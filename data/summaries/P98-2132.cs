4.4. On the other hand, in memory-based models such as IGtree (Daelemans, 1996), the number of features used in tagging is actually variable, within the maximum length (i.e., the number of features spanning the tree), and the different relevances of the different features are taken into account in tagging.

That neuro models require few parameters may offer another advantage: their performance is less affected by a small amount of training data than that of the statistical methods (Schmid, 1994).
C94-1027
Several kinds of POS taggers using rule-based (e.g., Brill et al., 1990), statistical (e.g., Merialdo, 1994), memory-based (e.g., Daelemans, 1996), and neural network (e.g., Schmid, 1994) models have been proposed for some languages.

The correct rate of tagging of these models has reached 95%, in part by using a very large amount of training data (e.g., 1,000,000 words in Schmid, 1994).
