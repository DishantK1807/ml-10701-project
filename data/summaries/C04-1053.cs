Finally, in (Riloff et al., 2002) a method is presented for rapidly creating Information Extraction (IE) systems for new languages by exploiting existing IE systems via cross-language projection.

Work The idea of obtaining linguistic information about a text in one language by exploiting parallel or comparable texts in another language has been explored in the field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) since the early 90â€™s, the most representative works being (Brown et al., 1991), (Gale et al., 1992), and (Dagan and Itai, 1994).

Yarowsky et al.(2001) describe a successful method consisting of (i) automatic annotation of English texts, (ii) crosslanguage projection of annotations onto target language texts, and (iii) induction of noise-robust taggers for the target language.

Cross-language tagging is the goal of the work by Diab and Resnik (2002), who present a method for word sense tagging both the source and target texts of parallel bilingual corpora with the WordNet sense inventory.
