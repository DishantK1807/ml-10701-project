We choose a Chinese corpus as the primary document collection because Chinese text (as well as other Asian languages) has a very large term set and a satisfying subset is usually not smaller than 50000 (Li et al., 2006); on the contrary, a dimensionality lower than 10000 suffices a general English text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002).

This collection was also used by Li et al.(2006). 20NG (20 Newsgroups1): This classical English document collection is chosen as a secondary in this study to testify the generality of the proposed approach.
