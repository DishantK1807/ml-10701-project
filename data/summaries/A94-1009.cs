Preparing tagged corpora either by hand is labour-intensive and potentially error-prone, and although a semi-automatic approach can be used (Marcus et al., 1993), it is a good thing to reduce the human involvement as much as possible.

The Xerox experiments (Cutting et al., 1992) correspond to something between D1 and D2, and between TO and T1, in that there is some initial biasing of the probabilities.

The results suggest that a completely unconstrained initial model does not produce good quality results, and that one 1The technique was originally developed by Kupiec (Kupiec, 1989).

The conclusions are broadly in agreement with those of Merialdo (1994), but give greater detail about the contributions of different parts of the model.

Work similar to that described here has been carried out by Merialdo (1994), with broadly similar conclusions.

For an introduction to the algorithms, see Cutting et al.(1992), or the lucid description by Sharman (1990).

More recently, Cutting et al.(1992) suggest that training can be achieved with a minimal lexicon and a limited amount of a priori information about probabilities, by using an Baum-Welch re-estimation to automatically refine the model.

One of the most effective taggers based on a pure HMM is that developed at Xerox (Cutting et al., 1992).

Similar results are presented by Merialdo (1994), who describes experiments to compare the effect of training from a hand-tagged corpora and using the Baum-Welch algorithm with various initial conditions.

With the availability of large corpora and fast computers, there has been a recent resurgence of interest, and a number of variations on and alter53 natives to the FB, Viterbi and BW algorithms have been tried; see the work of, for example, Church (Church, 1988), Brill (Brill and Marcus, 1992; Brill, 1992), DeRose (DeRose, 1988) and gupiec (Kupiec, 1992).
