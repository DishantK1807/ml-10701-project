Although there is some hope from using aligned bilingual corpora as training data for supervised algorithms (Brown et al., 1991), this approach suffers from both the limited availability of such corpora, and the frequent failure of bilingual translation differences to model monolingual sense differences.

92%. 1~ 9 Comparison with Previous Work This algorithm exhibits a fundamental advantage over supervised learning algorithms (including Black (1988), Hearst (1991), Gale et al.(1992), Yarowsky (1993, 1994), Leacock et al.(1993), Bruce and Wiebe (1994), and Lehman (1994)), as it does not require costly hand-tagged training sets.

Dagan and Itai (1994) have proposed a method using co-occurrence statistics in independent monolingual corpora of two languages to guide lexical choice in machine translation.

The use of dictionary definitions as an optional seed for the unsupervised algorithm stems from a long history of dictionary-based approaches, including Lesk (1986), Guthrie et al.(1991), Veronis and Ide (1990), and Slator (1991).

Sense Per Discourse The observation that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a given discourse or document was stated and quantified in Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992).

3 3 One Sense Per Collocation The strong tendency for words to exhibit only one sense in a given collocation was observed and quantified in (Yarowsky, 1993).
H93-1052
The decision-list algorithm used here (Yarowsky, 1994) identifies other collocations that reliably partition the seed training data, ranked by the purity of the distribution.
P94-1013
A supervised algorithm based on this property is given in (Yarowsky, 1994).
P94-1013
Words in the entry appearing in the most reliable collocational relationships with the target word are given the most weight, based on the criteria given in Yarowsky (1993).
