Heeringa and others have also done related work on phonological distance in Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997) and Gooskens and Heeringa (2004).

The permutation test used by Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006) is independent of the type of item whose frequency is measured, treating the items as atomic symbols.

Our work extends that of Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006) in a number of ways.

The average corpus was smaller than the Norwegian L2 English corpora of Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006), which had two groups, one with 221,000 words and the other with 84,000.

Fortunately, this is not the case; Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006) generate N − 2 POS trigrams from each sentence of length N; we generate N leaf-ancestor paths from each parsed sentence in the corpus.

R = Σi|cai − ¯ci| where ¯ci = cai + cbi2 However, to find out if the value of R is significant, we must use a permutation test with a Monte Carlo technique described by Good (1995), following closely the same usage by Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006).

For comparison to the experiment conducted by Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006), the experiment was also run with POS trigrams.

In fact, even though leaf-ancestor paths should provide finer distinctions than trigrams and thus require more data for detectable significance, the regional corpora presented here were smaller than the Norwegian speakers’ corpora in Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006) by up to a factor of 10.

A measure of syntactic distance is the obvious next step: Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006) provide one such method.

The primary source is the syntactic comparison of Nerbonne and Wiersma (2006), which uses a permutation test, explained in Good (1995) and in particular for linguistic purposes in Kessler (2001).
