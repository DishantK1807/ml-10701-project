Most current semantic role labeling (SRL) approaches can be classified in one of two classes: approaches that take advantage of complete syntactic analysis of text, pioneered by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and approaches that use partial syntactic analysis, championed by the previous CoNLL shared task evaluations (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004).

A subset of the one-to-many mappings are addressed with a simple heuristic, described in Section 2.4. 2.2 Features The features incorporated in the proposed model are inspired from the work of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2005; Collins, 1999) and can be classified into five classes: (a) features that capture the internal structure of the candidate argument, (b) features extracted The syntactic label of the candidate constituent.

On the WSJ data, our results surpass with almost 6% the results obtained by the best SRL system that used partial syntax in the CoNLL 2004 shared task evaluation (Hacioglu et al., 2004).

Following the strategy proposed by (Carreras et al., 2004) we select training examples (both positive and negative) only from: (a) the first S* phrase that includes the predicate, or (b) from phrases that appear to the left of the predicate in the sentence.

Content words, which add informative lexicalized information different from the head word, were detected using the heuristics of (Surdeanu et al., 2003).

Description 2.1 Mapping Arguments to Syntactic Constituents Our approach maps each argument label to one syntactic constituent, using a strategy similar to (Surdeanu et al., 2003).
