One school of extraction techniques concentrates on detecting the boundary of interesting entities in the text, (Califf and Mooney, 1997; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Yangarber et al., 2002).

For example, the simple subordinate clause in the following example (taken from (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pattern matcher from discovering a relation between ”London” and the ”river Thames”: ”London, which has one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks of the river Thames.” 1.3 Contribution This paper presents LEILA (Learning to Extract Information by Linguistic Analysis), a system that can extract instances of an arbitrary given binary relation from natural language Web documents without human intervention.

The only group that can learn arbitrary binary relations is the group of pattern matching systems (Etzioni et al., 2004; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Brin, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Xu et al., 2002; Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005).

Iria, 2005; Soderland et al., 1995), other systems require text patterns (Yangarber et al., 2000) or templates (Xu and Krieger, 2003) and again others require seed tuples (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Ruiz-Casado et al., 2005; Mann and Yarowsky, 2005) or tables of target concepts (Cimiano and V¨olker, 2005a).

Work There are numerous Information Extraction (IE) approaches, which differ in various features: • Arity of the target relation: Some systems are designed to extract unary relations, i.e. sets of entities (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004; Califf and Mooney, 1997).

The patterns found include the Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) ”Y such as X”, but also more complex patterns like ”X was known as a Y ”, ”X [.
