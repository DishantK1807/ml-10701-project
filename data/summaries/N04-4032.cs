Work in statistically parsing conversational speech (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has examined the performance of a parser that removes edit regions in an earlier step.

We evaluated parser performance by using bracket precision and recall scores, as well as bracket-crossing, using the parseval metric (Sekine and Collins, 1997; Black et al., 1991).

and IP Detection The system used here for SU and IP detection is (Kim et al., 2004), modulo differences in training data.

Across these conditions, the parser training was held constant, but the test segmentation varied across three cases: (i) oracle, hand-labeled SU segmentation; (ii) automatic, SU segmentation from the automatic detection system using both prosody and lexical cues (Kim et al., 2004); and (iii) na¨ıve, SU segmentation from a decision tree predictor using only pause duration cues.
