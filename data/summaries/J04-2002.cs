Berland and Charniak (1999) propose a method for extracting whole-part relations from corpora and enrich an ontology with this information.

21 To test the SSI algorithm, we selected 650 complex terms from the set of 3,840 concepts mentioned in Section 4.1, and we manually assigned the appropriate 18 In a paper specifically dedicated to terminology extraction and evaluation (Velardi, Missikoff, and Basili 2001) we performed an evaluation also on an economics domain, with similar results.

OntoLearn uses a novel method for filtering “true” terminology, described in detail in (Velardi, Missikoff, and Basili 2001).

We experimented with several thresholds for α and β, with consistent results in two domains (Velardi, Missikoff, and Basili 2001).

A statistical classifier for automatic identification of semantic roles between co-occuring terms is presented in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).

Candidate terminological expressions are usually captured with more or less shallow techniques, ranging from stochastic methods (Church and Hanks 1989; Yamamoto and Church 2001) to more sophisticated syntactic approaches (Jacquemin 1997).
