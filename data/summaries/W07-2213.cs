To achieve this, we applied (Boullier, 2000)’s algorithm on the unfolded version of (Villemonte de La Clergerie, 2005)’s factorized TAG.

Second, our method as a whole clearly does not process the input text from left-to-right and thus does not enter in the categories studied in (Nederhof and Satta, 2000).

However, virtually all Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG, see e.g., (Schabes et al., 1988)) used in NLP applications can (almost) be seen as lexicalized Tree Insertion Grammars (TIG), which can be converted into strongly equivalent CFGs (Schabes and Waters, 1995).

This reputation is not only based upon experimental results (van Noord, 1997) but also upon mathematical arguments in (Nederhof and Satta, 2000).

We can also remark that our results are not in contradiction with the claims of (Nederhof and Satta, 2000) in which they argue that “Earley algorithm and related standard parsing techniques [.

In particular, in NLP, (van Noord, 1997) and (Satta and Stock, 1994) propose bidirectional algorithms.

Left-corner (Nederhof, 1993; Moore, 2000), hereafter LC, is a well-known relation since many parsing strategies are based upon it.

The first grammar, named GT>N, is a variant of the CFG backbone of a large-coverage LFG grammar for French used in the French LFG parser described in (Boullier and Sagot, 2005).

The idea behind the b-filter is very simple and has largely been used in lexicalized formalisms parsing, in particular in LTAG (Schabes et al., 1988) parsing.

Raw sentences have been turned into DAGs of inflected forms known by both grammar/lexicon couples.15 This step has been achieved by the presyntactic processing chain SXPipe (Sagot and Boullier, 2005).
