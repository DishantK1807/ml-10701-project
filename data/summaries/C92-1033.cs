TIP has been used as front-end of a natural language processing component to a traditional document-based information retrieval system (Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992).

nns). Perhaps more imlxmantly, elimination of word-level lexical ambiguity allows the parser to make projection about the input which is yet to be parsed, using a simple lookabead; in particular, phrase boundaries can be determined with a degree of confidence (Church, 1988).

Partial parsing techniques have been used with a considerable success in processing large volumes of text, for example AT&T's Fidditch (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) parsed 13 million words of Associated Press news messages, while MIT's parser (de Marcken, 1990) was used to process the 1 million word Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus.

a Hindle and Rooth (1991) and Church and Hanks (1990) used partial parses generated by Fidditch to study word ~urrt.ncÂ¢ patterns m syntactic contexts.
