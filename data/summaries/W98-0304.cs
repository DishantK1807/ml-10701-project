There exists a large body of research in NLU on analysing the temporal structure of texts, including the role of temporal markers, though again restricted to English (Moens and Steedman 1988; Lascarides and Oberlander 1993; Hitzeman et al.1995). We turn to these studies when it comes to identifying the information that needs to be assembled for representing temporal markers.

22 2 Related work Work on discourse marker generation in general has focussed on marker selection, mainly for causal relations (Elhadad and McKeown 1990; Vander Linden and Martin 1995), and on the realization of RST's subject-matter relations (Rhsner and Stede 1992; Delin et al.1996). As for temporal markers, Dorr and Gaasterland (1995) examine the generation of English temporal subordinating conjunctions.

Whereas several studies have been concerned with causal markers and their interactions with other linguistic means, for instance, Vander Linden and Martin (1995), Rhsner and Stede (1992), Delin et al.(1996), temporal markers as signals of the temporal relation holding between two events have not received much attention, with the exception being Dorr and Gaasterland (1995).

This phenomenon interacts with other discourse phenomena, for instance, given and new information, and--when placed in a larger discourse context--with presuppositions and their accommodation (Lascarides and Oberlander 1993).

Table 2 contains an informal description of the lexicon entries; the formal representation depends on the actual sentence planner used in text production, see Grote and Stede (1998) for a preliminary proposal.

Although there have been quite a few studies on individual aspects of sentence planning, little attention has been paid to the interaction between the various tasks--exceptions are Rambow and Korelsky (1992) and Wanner and Hovy (1996)--and in particular to the role of marker choice in the overall sentence planning process.

First, Hitzeman et al.(1995) argue that there exist temporal defaults of the kind "An event will occur just after a preceding event"; this renders the introduction of explicit markers superfluous.

Following Grote and Stede (1998) we assume three categories in the marker lexion: â€¢ Applicability conditions: The necessary conditions that need to be present in the input representation for the marker to be a candidate.

In this paper, we take up the idea suggested in Grote and Stede (1998) of a discourse marker lexicon as a declarative resource at the sentence planning stage.

In Grote and Stede (1998) we argue that such a flexible control is best realized by introducing independent modules for the different sentence planning tasks, such as proposed by Wanner and Hovy (1996), and that these modules should rely on declarative representations as much as possible.

Hitzeman et al.1995). In a nutshell, when aiming at selecting an appropriate temporal marker in text generation one needs a representation of temporal markers that enables marker choice and other sentence level decisions (such as tense and aspect selection) to mutually constrain each other.
