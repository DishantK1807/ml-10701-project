Methods of implementing these principles have also been proposed (e.g., (Shieber, 1983; Wermter, 1989; Wilks et al., 1985)).

While there are also other principles proposed in the literature, including the Minimal Attachment Principle (Frazier and Fodor, 1979), they are generally either not highly functional or are covered by the above three principles in any case (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al., 1990).

The number of para.meters that need to be estimated increases drastically when we use threeword probabilities, and the data available for estimation of the probability parameters usually are 4An alternative for resolving coordinate structure ambiguities is to employ a method which examines the similarity that exists between conjuncts (c.f.(Kutohashi and Na~ao, 1994; Resnik, 1993)).

We extracted 181,250 case frames from the WSJ (Wall Street Journal) bracketed corpus of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al., 1993).

For subproblem (a), we have devised a new method, based on LPR, which has some good properties not shared by the methods proposed so far (Alshawi and Carter, 1995; Chang et al., 1992; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Resnik, 1993).

4 3.2 The data sparseness problem Hindle & Rooth have previously proposed resolving pp-attachment ambiguities with 'two-word probabilities' (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), e.g., P(withlice_cream),P(withleat), but these are not accurate enough to represent lexical preference.

(the motivation for using the two-word probabilities in (Hindle and Rooth, 1991) appears to be a desire to avoid the data sparseness problem.

These two kinds of ambiguities are typical, and other ambiguities can be resolved in the same way (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).

Hobbs & Bear have generalized RAP to the Attach Low and Parallel Principle (ALPP) (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).

deterministic approach Shieber has previously proposed incorporating RAP into the mechanism of a shift-reduce parser (Shieber, 1983).

obtained interpretations as follows: if else if else if else if else if else if tagged WSJ corpus which was not used When analizing a sentence, we rank the tit is necessary to do so, as the number increases (Church and Patil, 1982).

The attachment sites would be determined to be the same, however, if we were to use two-word probabilities (c:f.(Resnik, 1993)), and thus the ambiguity of only one of the sentences can be resolved.

The Lexical Preference Rule (LPR) (Ford et al., 1982), the Right Association Principle (RAP) (Kimball, 1973), and the Attach Low and Parallel Principle (ALPP, an extension of RAP) (Hobbs and Bear, 1990) have been proposed, and it is thought that we might resolve ambiguities quite satisfactorily if we could implement these principles sufficiently (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al., 1990).
C90-3029 P90-1004
LPR is a lexical semantic principle, while RAP and ALPP are syntactic ones, and in psycholinguistics it is commonly claimed that LPR overrides RAP and ALPP (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).
C90-3029
Chang et al., for instance, have proposed replacing words with word classes and using class-based co-occurrence probabilities (Chang et al., 1992).
P92-1023
According to Whittemore et al.and Hobbs & Bear, nearly all of the ambiguities can be resolved by first applying LPR and then RAP and ALPP (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al., 1990).

Briscoe & Carroll have proposed using a probabilistic model specific to LR parsing (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993).
