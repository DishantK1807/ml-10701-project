Among the attempts to enrich lexical information, many have been directed to the analysis of dictionary definitions and the transformation of the implicit information to explicit knowledge bases for computational purposes (Amsler, 1981; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow et al., 1985; Markowitz et al., 1986; Klavans et al., 1990; Vossen and Copestake, 1993).

It would therefore be a good idea if we can unify our lexical semantic knowledge by some existing, and widely exploited, classifications such as the system in Roget's Thesaurus (Roget, 1852), which has remained intact for years and has been used in WSD (Yarowsky, 1992).

Algorithm The possibility of using statistical methods to assign ROGET category labels to dictionary definitions has been suggested by Yarowsky (1992).
