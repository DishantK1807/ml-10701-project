We supplement the output of Buckwalter's analyzer with synthetically constructed analyses that are proposed by a model which uses character information (Diab et al., 2004) in a way that is similar to Nakagawa's (2004) system for Japanese.

Lexicon-based approaches (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2005) use a lexicon that is extracted from a manually constructed morphological analyzer (Buckwalter 2002 and Segal 2001 respectively).

Remarkably, this gives state-of-the-art accuracy (96.12%) on the same Arabic datasets as Habash and Rambow (2005).

For example, (Church, 1988) uses the simple heuristic of predicting proper nouns from capitalization.

Data-driven approaches like (Diab et al.2004) employ the lexicon only implicitly when extracting features on possible POS tags from annotated corpora that are used for training the POS tagger.

More advanced methods like those described by Weischedel et al.(1993) incorporate the treatment of unknown words within the probability model.

97 Consequently, we propose a hybrid model of datadriven methods and lexicon-based methods, and show its advantages over both models, in a way that is reminiscent of Nakagawa's (2004) results for Chinese and Japanese.

Nakagawa (2004) addresses the problem of unknown words for Japanese and Chinese, and uses a hybrid method of word-level and character-level information.

(Diab et al., 2004; Habash and Rambow, 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2005) are some examples for this line of work on Modern Standard Arabic and Modern Hebrew.

To overcome this coverage problem we supplement the output of Buckwalter's analyzer with synthetically constructed analyses that are proposed by a model which uses character information (Diab et al., 2004) in a way that is similar to Nakagawa's (2004) system for Chinese and Japanese.

We start out from MorphTagger, a lexicon-based tagger for Hebrew developed by Bar-Haim et al.(2005), which uses standard Hidden Markov Model techniques.

The performance of MorphTagger over Arabic was measured using the same test settings of Diab et al.(2004). Habash and Rambow (2005) use a different test setting drawn from ATB1.

This gives state-of-theart accuracy (96.12%), comparable to Habash and Rambowâ€™s (2005) analyzerbased POS tagger on the same Arabic datasets.
