Work The standard way of deriving a semantic interpretation for constituency-based grammars is to assign each syntactic rule one or more semantic interpretation rules (e.g., van Eijck and Moore (1992)), and to 4A more detailed presentation of this evaluation study is given in Romacker and Itahn (20001)).

In particular, abstraction mechanisms (going beyond the level of sortal taxonomies for semantic labels, cf., e.g., Creary and Pollard (1985)), such as property inheritance, defaults, are lacking.

We clearly want to point out that while this rule system covers a wide variety of standard syntactic constructions (such as genttives, prepositional phrases, various tense and modal forms), it currently does not account fbr quantificational issues (like scope ambiguities) for which entirely logic-based approach (Charniak and Goldman, 1988; Moore, 1989; Pereira and Pollack, 1991) provide quite sophisticated solutions.
