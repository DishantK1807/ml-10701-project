This is reflected in common features of the parsing algorithms for HG (Pollard 1984) and TAG (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1985) and the CKY algorithm for CFG (Kasami 1965; Younger 1967).
P85-1011
Some of the main ideas underlying our scheme have been influenced by the observations that can be made about the constructions used in the proofs of the equivalence of these formalisms and Head Grammars (HG) (Vijay-Shanker 1987; Weir 1988; Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993).
E93-1045 P88-1034
In the case of CCG, this provides the only polynomial parsing algorithm (apart from a slight variant of this scheme given in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1990)) we are aware of.
P90-1001
CCG parsing algorithms that have been proposed so far follow this strategy (Pareschi and Steedman 1987; Tomita 1988).
P87-1012 P88-1031
The method of extracting parses and representing them using a shared forest given in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1990) can be generalized in a straightforward manner to be compatible with the generalized recognition scheme given here.
P90-1001
However, an algorithm to extract the parses and build a shared forest representation of all parses for CCG was proposed in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1990).
P90-1001
The derivations themselves represented can be in another TAG that we call the derivation grammar (see Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993)).
E93-1045
The details of the examination of the relationship between CCG and LIG may be found in Weir and Joshi (1988) and Weir (1988).
