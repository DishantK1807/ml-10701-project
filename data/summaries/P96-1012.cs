Such invalid spines are not deleted during the check of the LIG conditions because they could be 7In (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) the emptiness problem for LIGs is solved by constructing an FSA.

In (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) LIGs are used to express the derivations of a sentence in TAGs.
E93-1045 J93-4002
For example, quoted from (Schabes and Shieber, 1994) "The LIG version of TAG can be used for recognition and parsing.

In (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993), the contextfreeness of adjunction in TAGs is captured by giving a CFG to represent the set of all possible derivation sequences.
E93-1045 J93-4002
However, we know that derivations in TAGs are context-free (see (Vijay-Shanker, 1987)) and (VijayShanker and Weir, 1993) exhibits a CFG which represents all possible derivation sequences in a TAG.

Boullier@inria. fr Abstract In this paper 1 we present a new parsing algorithm for linear indexed grammars (LIGs) in the same spirit as the one described in (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993) for tree adjoining grammars.
