Chodorow and Leacock (2000) use a mutual information measure in addition to raw frequency of ngrams.

The (to our knowledge) oldest work in this area is that of Atwell (1987) who uses a POS tagger to flag POS bigrams that are unlikely according to a reference corpus.

N-gram-based approaches to the problem of error detection have been proposed and implemented in various forms by Atwell(1987), Bigert and Knutsson (2002), and Chodorow and Leacock (2000) amongst others.

In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al., 2002) for our experiments.

Golding (1995) builds a classifier based on a rich set of context features.

The ParGram English LFG is a hand-crafted broad-coverage grammar developed over several years with the XLE platform (Butt et al., 2002).
