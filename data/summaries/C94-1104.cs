Voutilainen and Tapanaincn \[1993\] argued that the richer set of tags could make parsing more accurate in a rule-based system.

A better tag set for surface-syntactic parsing is presented in \[Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993\].

Our work is based on work done with ENGCG, the Constraint Grammar Parser of English \[Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson, 1994; Karlsson et al., 1994; Voutilainen, 1994\].

Although it is not possible to fully disambiguate the syntax in ENGCG, the rate of disambiguation can be improved using a more powerful linguistic rule tbrmalism (see \[Koskenniemi el al., 1992; Koskenniemi, 1990; Tapanainen, 1991\]).
