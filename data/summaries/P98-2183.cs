We have employed them in exploring the language-theoretic complexity of theories in GB (Rogers, 1994; Rogers, 1997b) and GPSG (Rogers, 1997a) and have used these model-theoretic interpretations as a uniform framework in which to compare these formalisms (Rogers, 1996).

Schabes and Shieber (1994), for instance, suggest allowing multiple adjunctions of modifier trees to the same node on the grounds that selectional constraints hold between the modified node and each of its modifiers but, if only a single adjunction may occur at the modified node, only the first tree that is adjoined will actually be local to that node.

They have also provided a foundation for an approach to principle-based parsing via compilation into tree-automata (Morawietz and Cornell, 1997).
