Dictionary definitions of nouns are normally written in such a way that one can identify for each headword (the word being defined), a "genus term" (a word more general that the headword), and these are related via an IS-A relation(Bruce,1992; Klavans, 1990; Richardson,1997).

In (Luk, 1995), using the dictionary definition, co-occurrence data of concepts, rather than words, is collected from a relatively small corpus to tackle the data sparseness problem.

In (Yarowsky,1995), the definition words were used as initial sense indicators, automatically tagging the target word examples containing them.
P95-1026
(Yarowsky, 1993) determined various disambiguating behaviors based on syntactic category; for example, that verbs derive more disambiguating information from their objects than from their subjects, and adjectives derive almost all disambiguating information from nouns they modify.

In (Karov, 1998), all the corpus examples of the dictionary definition words, instead of those word alone were used as sense indicators.

The class-based approaches(Brown, 1992; Luk, 1995; Pereira, 1993; Resnik, 1992) attempt to obtain the best estimates by combining observations of classes of words considered to belong to a common category.

In the similarity-based approaches(Dagan, 1997; Karov, 1998), rather than a class, each word is modeled by its own set of similar words derived from statistical data extracted from corpora.

execute inner product with new distributions, dvl and dv2 Dv (d(v:), d(v2) ) = dvl . dv2 We use a stop verb list to discard from Steps 1 and 2 verbs taken too many nouns as objects, such 3As many of the possible co-occurrences are not observed even in a large corpus(Church, 1993), actually the noun distributions have not many common verbs.

Several researchers subsequently continued and improved this line of work(Guthrie, 1991; Krovetz, 1989; Veronis, 1990; Wilks, 1997).

However, our system is the unsupervised learning with small POS-tagged corpus,and we do not restrict the word's sense set within either binary senses(Yarowsky,1995; Karov, 1998) or dictionary's homograph level(Wilks, 1997).

(Karov, 1998) proposed an extension to similaritybased methods by means of an iterative process at the learning stage with small corpus.

in OALD part-of-speech tag sets tend to differ in the detail); (b) sense annotation has a comparatively high error rate (Miller, personal communication, reports an upper bound for human annotators of around 90~ for ambiguous cases, using a non-blind evaluation method that may make even this estimate overly optimistic(Resnik, 1997)); (c) in conclusion, a sense-tagged corpus large enough to achieve broad coverage and high accuracy word sense disambiguation is not available at present.

Nevertheless, informally, the relative entropy is used as the "distance" between two probability distribution in many previous works(Pereira, 1993; Resnik, 1997).

Recently, many works combined a MRD and a corpus for word sense disambiguation(Karov, 1998; Luk, 1995; Ng, 1996; Yarowsky,1995).

Our system is similar to (Karov, 1998) with respect to similarity measure, which allows it to extract high-order contextual relationship.
