1 INTRODUCTION
In information extraction systems, finitestate pattern matchers are becoming popular as a means of identifying individu~d pieces of information in a sentence.
Pattern matching systems for English texts are reported to be suits,hie tor achieving a high level of per\[brmance with less effort, compared to full parsing architectures\[Hobbs et al.92\]. Among seventeen systems presented in the Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5), three systems used a pattern marcher a.s the main component for identifying patterns to be extracted \[MUC-5 93\].
A pattern matching architecture is appropriate for information extraction fi-om texts in narrow domains since identifying informatkm does not necessarily require full understa.nding of the text.
The pattern matcher can extract information of intertVisiting rese;trcher fron/ NTT Data Communications Systems Corp., email: tkitani~.rd.nttdM.a.jp HNTT Data Communiclttions Systems Corp.
est by locating speciIic expressions defined a.s key words and phrasal patterns obtained by coq)us analysis.
This paper describes a pattern matching method that first identifies concepts in a seutence and then links critical pieces of information that map to a p~ttern.
The first step in pattern ln~tching is a concept searvh applied in the TI';XTRACT system of the TIPSTER Japanese microelectronics and corporate.joint ventures domainsaacobs 93a\], \[aacobs 93b\].
In this step, key words representing a concept are searched for within a sentence.
The second step is a.
template pattern sea~rh applied in the TEXTRACT joint ventures system.
A complex pattern to be searched for usually consists of a few words and phrases, inste~d of just one word, as in the concept search.
The template pattern search recognizes relationships between matched objects in the defined pattern a.s well a.s recognizing the.
concept itself.
l,'rom the viewpoints of system perfof mance and portalfility across domains, the TIPS'I.'I~;II/MUC-5 evaluatioll J'esults suggest that pattern nta.tching described in this paper is all appropriate architecture for information extraction from,lapanese texts.
2 TIPSTER/MUC-5 OVERVIEW The goal of the TI1)STER/MUC-5 project sponsored by ARPA is to capture information of interest from English and .lal)aJmse newspal)er artMes about microelectronics and corpora.re joint ventures.

generic template with information taken 1Several AlPA-sponsored sites f¢)rmed tile TIPST\]'21/informal|on extraclion project.
"\['he TIPSTER sites and other non-sponsored organizations participated in MUC-5.

a fully automated fa.shion.
The template is composed of several objects, each containing severM slots.
Slots may have pointers as va.lues, where pointers link related ot)jects.
Extracted information is expected to be stored in an object-oriented database \[TIPSTER 92\].
In the microelectronics domain, information about four specific processes in seiniconductot manufacturing for microchip fabrication is captured.
They are layering, lithography, etching, aaM packaging processes.
\],ayering, lithography, and etching a.re wafer fa.brical:ion processes; packaging is part of tile last stage of manufacturing.
Entities such as manufactu rer, distributor, and user, in addition to detailed manufacturing information such a.s materials used and the microchip specifications such as wafer size and device speed are also extra.cted in each process.
The joint ventures domain focuses on ex tracting entities, i.e. organizations, forming or dissolving joint venture relationshil)s.
The information to l)e extracted includes entity information such as location, na.tionality, personnel, and facilities, and joint venture information such as rela.tionshii)s, 1)usiness a.ctivities, capital, and estimated revenue of the joint ventttre.
3 TEXTRACT
ARCHITECTURE TEXTI/ACT is an informati(m extraction system developed as an optiona.l system of the GE-CMU SHOGUN system \[Jacobs 93a\], \[aacobs93b\].
it processes the TIPSTFI.
Japanese domains of microelectronics and col porate joint ventures.
The :I'I';XTllA(VI ~ microelectronics system comprises three major components: prel)rocessing ~ conceltt search, and template generatiol|.
In ad(lition to (:on.
celtt search, the "FI!XrI'IIACT joint ventures system perfbrms a templ~te pattern search.
\[t is also equipped with a discourse processor, as shown in Fig.
1. In the preprocessor, Japanese text is segmented into primitive: words tagged with their t)arts of speech by a Japanese segmentor called MAJESTY\[Kitani and Mitamura 93\], \[Kitani 91\].

\]?inally, l.he template generation pro(:ess assembles the extracted information necessary to creat(.~ the OUtl)nl; descril)ed in Secl, iou 2.
1065 4 PATTERN MATCHING IN TEXTRACT 4.1 Concept search Key words representing the same concept are grouped into a list and used to recognize the concept in a sentence.
The list is written in a simple format: (concept-name wordl word2 ...).
For example, key words tbr recognizing a dissolved joint vent u re con cept can be written in the following way: (DISSOLVED ~-~j~-~ ~-.~: ~) or (DISSOLVED dissolve terminate cancel).
The concept search module recognizes the concept when a word in the fist exists in tile sentence.
Using such a simple word list sometilnes generates an incorrect concept.
For example, a dissolved concept is erroneously identiffed fl'om an expression "cancel a hotel reservation".
IIowever, when processing text in a.
narrow <lomain, concepts are often i<lentiffe<t correctly fi'om the simple list, since key words are usually used in a particular meaning of interest in the domain.
During the Ja.panese segmentation process in the preprocessor, a key word in the text tends to be divided into a few separate words by MAJESTY, when the word is not stored in the dictionary, For example, the compound noun "~jJ'~f~" consists of two words, "i~3 '' (joint venture) and ":r#~b1" (dissolve).
It is segmented into the two individual nouns using the current MAJESTY dictionary.
Thus, when the compound word "~.-~jlf(t'-fb\] '' is searched for in the segmented sentence, the concept search fails to identify it.
To avoid this segmentation problein, adjacent nouns are automatically put together during the concept search process.
This process al\]ows, by defanlt, partial word matching between a key word and a word in the text.
Therefore, "~.-~j" and "~05 {~J" both meaning "a .joint venture" can be identitied by a single key word "~.'I~,Y'.
Ilowever, due to the nature of partial matching, the key word "-.:/~ = :/" (Silicon) matches "-iL~.
4\[:: "5+ ~ = :/" (Silicon dioxide), which is a different type of ffhn reported in the microelectronies domain.
This undesirable behavior can be avoided by attaching ">" to the beginning or "<" to the end of key words.
Thus,,,> .3.1) :~ :/ <,, tells the matcher that it requires an exact word matching against a word in the text.
4.2 Template
pattern search 4.2.1 Template pattern matcher The teml>late pattern matcher identifies typical expressions to be extracted from the text that frequently aplmar in the corpus.
The patterns are defined as pa.ttern matching rules using regular expressions.
The pattern matcher is a ffnite-state automaton sinfilar to the pattern recognizer use.d in the MUC-4 FASTUS system developed at SRI \[I\[obbs et al.92\]. /n TEXTRACT, state transitions arc driven by segmented words or grouped units fi'om the prei)rocessor.
The matcher identifies all possible patterns of interest in the.
text that match defined l>atterns.
It must ignore unnecessary words in the pattern to perform successfifl pattern matching for various expressions.
4.2.2 Pattern
matching rules Fig.
2 shows a defined pattern in which an arhitrary string is represented as "g~string" along with its corresponding English pattern.
2 Specilica.lly, a variable starting with "@CNAMI:;" is ca.lled the COulpally-name varial)le, used where a company nanm is exi)ected to apl)ear.
For exainpie, "{}CNAME_I'AITNER_SUBJ" matches any string that likely includes at least; one company name acting a.s a joint venture partner and functioning as a subject in tile sentence.
The pattern "~ I h:stri(:t:P" tells the pattern matcher to identify the word, where "~" or "z)<" are grammatical particles that serve as sul)je(-t case markers.
The (tefault type "strict" requires a.n exact string match, whereas "loose" allows a partial string match.
Partial string matching is useful when compound words must be matched to a defined pattern.
A joint venture, "~.-~j: loose:VN", whose l>art of speech is verbal nominal, matches compound words such as "~..~ ~'~--~j" (corporate joint venture) a.s well,%s "N ~,j" (joint venture).
2'\]'his \],'mglish pattern is used to capture expressions such as "XYZ Corp.
created a joint venture with PQR 1066 (JointVenturel 6 @CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJ ~ \[ ~:strict:P @CNAME_PARTNERWITH :strict:P @SKIP ~.-~:loose:VS) (a) A matching pattern for Japanese (JointVenturel 3 @CNAME_PARTNER_SUBJ create::V a joint venture:NP with::P @CNAME_PARTNER_WITH) (b) A matching pattern for English Fig.
2: A re;etching pattern for (a),laf)anese a,n(l (b) English The ill-st field in a i)atteril is the pattern nalile followed by the patterll iiuliiber.
The tia, ttern nunlber is used to deride whether or llOt a, search within a, given strhlg is IleCess.>t£y, To assure ell\]ciency with the pal, l;ern marcher, the fiehl designated by the lllunber sliould include tlie leant frequent word in the entire patterll (,,~t~,, for aa, l)anese and :'a joint velil, urc" for English in this case).
4.2.3 Pattern
selection Approxiiila.tely 150 pa.tterns were used to extract various concepts in the Japanese joint ventures domain.
Several patterns usually tllatch a.
single sentence.
Moreover, siuce pal;terns are often searched using case ma.rkers slic\]i as "~", "7~<", and " ~ ", which frequently apt)ea.r ill .\]al)a.nese texts, even a sitigie l)a.t 1;eri/ Call l\[latch the Sellt,ence ill n\]oi'e thrill Olle wI,y whell severa, I of" tile same ca,se lliarkers exist ill a sentence.
However, since the template gtmerator aCCellts only the best lnat(;he(I pal;tern~ ehoosilig a corre(:tly nla,tehed i)atl,eril is imlJortant.
The selection in (lone by applying three heuristic rules in the following or<let: • sele(:t l)a,tterns th~tt in(:hide the IlK)st I/lli\[lbei' of' nla, tched COlll\])al/y-ll311K) Val'i Inc".
a bles in which there is at least one company llaDle~, sele(:t l)atterns tha.t COllSili\[le tilt fewest input seglnents (the shortest string match), and • select patterns that include the lnost llliiiil)er of variables and defined words.
Another important feature of the pa.t:tern Iilat(:hor is tha,t rules can be groupe(1 accordilig to their COilCel)t.
A rule lla.iile "JohltVeliturel" iii Fig.
2, for example, represents a concel)t "JointVelitllre'.
Ushlg this groupbig, the best nlatched pattern can be selected fl'on-i nlatched patterns of a particular concept group instea.d of choosing from all the matched patterns.
This feature enables the discourse and template g(meration processes to look at the, best infortnation necessary whet, tilling in a particular slot.
5 EXAMPLE
OF THE INFORMATION EXTRACTION PROCESS This sectkm describes how concepts ~tnd patterns identifh;d by tile matcher are used for tenll)late filling.
Concepts are often useful to fill in the "set fill" (choice fi'om a.
given set) sh)ts.
An entity type slot, for examl)le, ha,s four giw, i choices: COMPANY, I)EISON, GOVERNM/i;NT, ~tnd OTIIt;R.
The matcher assigns concepts related to each entity type except ()TflEIL Thus, from the given set, the output generator chooses an entity type corresponding to the identified concept.
There axe ca.ses when discourse processing is necessa.ry to link identified concepts and patterns.
The f.ollowing text;: "X Inc.
created a joint w;ntm'e with Y Corp.
last yea.r.
X announced yesterday that it.
terminated the venture".
in used to describe the extraction process illustrated in Fig.
3. In the preprocessing, two company na.tnes in the first sentence "X hic".
and "Y Corp".
are identified either I)y MAJESTY or the name recognizer.
In the first sentence, the templa.te pa.tteru search locates t he,I ointgenture 1 pattern shown in Fig.
2. Now, the,/OINTV I';NT \[J 11'3 con cepl; I)etweeii "X inc".
and "Y C'ol'l)".
is recognized.
In tim second Sellt(~.it(X~., 7067 "X Inc.
created a "X announced joint venture with yesterday that it Y Corp.
last year."i terminated the venture".
I Precompany1: "X Inc".
"X" company2: Ip rocesslng company3: "Y Corp".
:::::::::::::::::::::: D,ssoLveD" IVENTURE* &LCorp" Discourse "X Inc."(companyl=company3) process ng } JOINT-VENTURE* y DISSOLVED* "Y Corp".
* concept name Fig.
3: FxamI)le of the inforntatiou extraction process the company name "X" is also identitied by the preprocessor, a Next, the concept "DISSOLVEi)" is recognized by the key word terminate in the concept search.
(The key word list is shown in Section 4.11).
After sentencelevel processing, discourse processing recognizes that "X" in the second sentence is a reference to "X Inc".
found in the first sentence.
Thus, the "DISSOLVI';I)" concept is joined to the, joint venture relationship between "X inc".
and "Y Corp.".
in this way, TI!iXTRACT recognizes that the two companies dissolved the,joint venture.
SupI)ose that the second sentence is replace(t with another sentence: "Shortly after, X terminated a contract to supply rice to Z Corp.".
Although it does not mentiot~ the dissolved relationship nor anything a hottt "Y Corp.", the system incorrectly recognizes the dissolved joint ventttre rela.tionship between "X In('".
and "V Corp".
due to the existence of the word terminate.
When this undesirable matching is often seen, more complicated template patterns must be used instead of tile simple word list.
A dissolved concept, lbr example, could he identified using the fo\]\[owing template pattern: aWhen it is an unknown word to tim prepro(x~ssor, the discourse processor idcnti\[ies it IM.er.
(Dissolvedl 2 OCNAMEPARTNER_SUBJ dissolve I terminate l cancel::V @skip venture::N @CNAME_PARTNER_WITH).
Then, discourse processing must check if com+ panies identified in this pattern are the same as the current joint venture comi)anies in order to recognize their dissolved relationship.

1069 has not been tested to languages other than Japanese.
It is expected to work to other languages with some minor modifications given that the input is segmented into primitive words tagged with their parts of speech.
The TEXTRACT Japanese microelectronics system was developed in only three weeks by one person.
In spite of its simplicity, it showed the high performance.
This result also suggests that the pattern matching architecture is highly portable across similar domains of the same la.nguage, thus facilitating rapid system development.
Developing and maintaining TEXTRACT's pattern matching based architecture is easier and less complex than that of a full parsing system, as experienced in the early stage of StIOGUN system development \[aacobs 93b\].
Corpus analysis took about half of the development time, since only a KWIC (Key Word In Context) list and a word fi'equency tool were used to acquire the concept-word lists and the template patterns.
Using good statistical corpus analysis tools will shorten the development time and promise a high performance.
The tools should not only collect patterns of interest with context, but also give statistical data to show how well deft ned patterns are working when they are applied in the system.
At MUC-5 meeting, P&R F-measure of one of the top-ranking systems was claimed to be close to the human perfornlance \[Jacobs 93b\].
r To match the system performance of a pattern matching system to human performallce, the preprocessor must recognize expressions to be extracted at nearly 100% accuracy given that other components simply merge information and generate ontput.
