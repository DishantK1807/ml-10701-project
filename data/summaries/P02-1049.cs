Previous work also predicted User Satisfaction by applying multi-variate linear regression features with and without DATE features and showed that DATE improved the model t from a5 a4 a3a18a6a9a8a11a10 to a5a19a4a20a3a21a6a23a22a24a16 (Walker et al., 2001).

Previous research on spoken dialogue evaluation proposed the application of automatic classi ers for identifying and predicting of problematic dialogues (Litman et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2002) for the purpose of automatically adapting the dialogue manager.

However, a number of studies have been done on predicting speci c errors in a dialogue, using a variety of automatic and handlabelled features, such as ASR con dence and semantic labels (Aberdeen et al., 2001; Hirschberg et al., 2000; Levow, 1998; Litman et al., 1999).

The HOTEL task includes both the HOTEL-NAME and HOTEL-LOCATION subtasks.2 For the DATE labelling of the corpus, we implemented an extended version of the pattern matcher that was used for tagging the Communicator June 2000 corpus (Walker et al., 2001).

When a system is prototyped in house or rst tested in the eld, human subjects are often paid to use the system and give detailed feedback on task completion and user satisfaction (Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 2001).
