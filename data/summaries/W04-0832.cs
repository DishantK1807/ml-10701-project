We use the YASMET MEtagger (Bender et al.2003) to perform the Viterbi search for choosing the most probable tag sequence for a sentence using the probabilities computed during training.

The initial features are adopted from (Gildea and Juraksky 2002) and (Fleischman, Kwon, and Hovy 2003), and a few additional features are also used.

The Automatic Labeling of Semantic Roles track in SensEval-3 focuses on identifying frame elements in sentences and tagging them with their appropriate semantic roles based on FrameNet 1. For this task, we extend our previous work (Fleischman et el., 2003) by adding a sentence segmentation step and by adopting a few additional feature vectors for Maximum Entropy Model.

The sentence-wide features, containing dependent information between frame element such as the previously identified class or the syntactic pattern, have previously been shown to be powerful features for role classification (Fleischman et al., 2003).
