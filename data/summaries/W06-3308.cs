Entity Features In the newswire domain, Surdeanu et al.(2003) used named entity (NE) features that indicate whether a constituent contains NEs, such as personal names, organization names, location names, time expressions, and quantities of money.

Hacioglu et al.(2004) showed that tagging phrase by phrase (P-by-P) is better than word by word (W-by-W).

In the first step, we adopt the definitions found in PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), defining our own framesets for verbs not in PropBank, such as “phosphorylate”.

In the second step, we first use an SRL system (Tsai et al., 2005) trained on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to automatically tag our corpus.

The Penn-style treebank for GENIA, created by Tateisi et al.(2005), currently contains 500 abstracts.

In addition to these syntactic structures, it was also annotated with predicate-argument structures (WSJ proposition bank) by Palmer et al.(2005). In biomedical domain, there is one available treebank for GENIA, created by Yuka Tateshi et al.(2005), who has so far added full-parsing information to 500 abstracts.

Their effectiveness has been previously shown by (Pradhan et al., 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2004).
P03-1002 W04-3212
Punyakanok et al., (2004) further showed that constituent-by-constituent (Cby-C) tagging is better than P-by-P.
C04-1197
Proposition Bank As proposition banks are semantically annotated versions of a Penn-style treebank, they provide consistent semantic role labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb (Palmer et al., 2005).

Detailed descriptions of these features can be found in (Tsai et al., 2005).
