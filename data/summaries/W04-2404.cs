The interest data (Bruce, 1994) consists of 2,368 instances where the noun interest is used in one of six senses taken from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE).

(Pedersen, 2001b) compares decision trees, decision stumps and a Naive Bayesian classifier to show that bigrams are very useful in identifying the intended sense of a word.

However, both (Pedersen, 2001a) and (Lee and Ng, 2002) suggest that different learning algorithms result in little change in overall disambiguation results, and that the real determiner of accuracy is the set of features that are employed.

The hard data (Leacock, 1998) consists of 4,337 instances taken from the San Jose Mercury News Corpus (SJM) and are annotated with one of three senses of the adjective hard, from WordNet.
J98-1006
The line data (Leacock, 1993) consists of 4,149 instances where the noun line is used in one of six possible WordNet senses.
H93-1051
The serve data (Leacock, 1998) consists of 5,131 instances with the verb serve as the target word.

(Lee and Ng, 2002) compare the performances of Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Decision Trees using unigrams, parts of speech, collocations and syntactic relations.

Previous work has shown that using different combinations of features is advantageous for word sense disambiguation (e.g., (McRoy, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002)).

(Lin, 1997) takes a supervised approach that is unique as it did not create a classifier for every target word.
P97-1009
The LEXAS system of (Ng and Lee, 1996) uses part of speech, morphology, co-occurrences, collocations and verb object relation in nearest neighbor implementation.

It should be noted that the experiments for the SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-1 data using unigrams and bigrams are re-implementations of (Pedersen, 2001a), and that our results are comparable.
N01-1011
Work (McRoy, 1992) was one of the first to use multiple kinds of features for word sense disambiguation in the semantic interpretation system, TRUMP.
J92-1001
(Pedersen, 2002) describes how to determine the upper bound when combining two systems.
W02-0806
(Pedersen, 2002) does a pairwise study of the systems that participated in SENSEVAL-2 English and Spanish disambiguation exercises.
