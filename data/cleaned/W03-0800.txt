1:15	Preface This volume contains the papers presented at the workshop entitled: Software Engineering & Architecture for Language Technology Systems.
2:15	The workshop was held on May 31, 2003, and sponsored by the Human Language Technology Conference and North American Chapter of the Associationfor ComputationalLinguistics.Thepaperswererefereedby an internationalpanelof experts in the field.
3:15	This Workshop is the first held under the auspices of the ACL to be directed at issues in software engineeringandarchitecturefor languagetechnology.
4:15	It maybe surprisingthatwe have waitedso longto directour attentionovertlyto the topic,but therehave many peopledealingwiththe problemsof the fieldwellbeforewe conceived of this Workshop.Theirwork and interestshas leadto strong support for the workshop and we are very happy to see the hidden activities of so many people come into a more visible arena.
5:15	With the creation of this workshop came also the question of defining the scope of the topic.
6:15	We received a number of good quality papers on topics which in the end we determined where not within the sphere of interest intended for the workshop.
7:15	These were all papers that developed algorithms for certain computational linguistics problems such as parsing and n-gram manipulation.
8:15	This decision has lead us to a partially de facto definition of the workshop topic, namely the description of methods for creating complex systems of interacting functionality of diverse componentsin the computationallinguisticsfield.Thisdescriptiongives scopeto the two maintypes papers represented in the workshop.
9:15	The first type of paper deals with the architectural organisationof completedsystemsandtheissuesin creatingsuccessfulinteractionbetweenheterogeneous components.
10:15	The second type of paper is the speculative paper that proposes new methods or approaches to language processing tasks without necessarily demonstrating that such methods have been verified in practice.
11:15	These papers were deemed meritorious when they exhibited insights that the referees considered to be innovative and promising.
12:15	To create some demarcation between the speculative and the verified we have allowed a longer presentation time to the completed works than the speculative work.
13:15	The collection of researchers and language industry engineers who need to more effectively managelarge systemsis growing,as wellas greatereffort to designsystemsthatmoreeffectively interactwiththoseof others.Given suchgrowththe workshoporganiserswilluse thisoccasionto assess the breadth of interest to create a Special Interest Group in the field.
14:15	We wish to thank the members of the Program Committee for reviewing the large number of workshopsubmissionson a very tightschedule.We wouldalsolike to thankEd Hovy, JasonEisner and Dragomir Radev for making the workshop possible.
