This is in fact the lesson from much previous work in expert system explanation, for example the work of Paris et al.(1988)contrasting "the line of reasoning" and "the line of explanation", and the claim of Swartout et al.(1991) that the domain representation must be augmented with additional knowledge about the domain and about reasoning in the domain.

In the Rex approach, the obvious problem is that in order to generate an explanation, additional reasoning must be performed which in some sense is very similar to that done by the expert 2We do not consider explanation generation from data bases (for example, (McKeown, i985; Paris, 1988; Lester and Porter, 1997)) to be the same problem as expert system reasoning explanation (even though we may use some similar techniques).

For example, the "views" of Lester and Porter â€¢(1997) can be seen as a form of CDK, though they are not a declarative representation.
