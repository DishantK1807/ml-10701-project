Barzilay and Elhadad (2003) have allowed us to use their corpus from Encyclopedia Britannica, which contains articles from the full version of the encyclopedia and corresponding articles from Britannica Elementary, a new version targeted at children.

We also use a standard statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) to provide syntactic analysis.

The widelyused Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level index is based on the average number of syllables per word and the average sentence length in a passage of text (Kincaid et al., 1975) (as cited in (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004)).

They developed a smoothed unigram classi er to better capture the variance in word usage across grade levels (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).

Future work includes testing additional classi er features, e.g. parser likelihood scores and features obtained using a syntax-based language model such as Chelba and Jelinek (2000) or Roark (2001).

Motivated by our goal of representing syntax, we used part-of-speech (POS) tags as labeled by a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
W96-0213
The parse features are generated using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the standard Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus.
