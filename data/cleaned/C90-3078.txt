ABSTRACT This note presents an overview of the English-Chinese Translalion System for Tourists (~I~q) currently under development at South China University of Technolo~/.
A brief description of the bilingual dictionazv is given, followed by descriptions of grammar rules representation and the n~in processes involved in translation.
S~TEM CONFiGUR&TIOR ECTST consists of a translation program, a bili,4Tual diction~w and a rule-data base.
The program body is composed of a sequence of modules, performing translation in four phases: SL sentence Initiation ~ Tt, sentence The initiation pha~e is concerned with input of the SL sentence, diotionsry look-up and morphological processing.
The analysis phase involves syntactic and semantic parsing, which are accomplished through linguistic models and case frame.
The transfer phase comprises rules for converting the parsed SL sentence into the TL sentence.
~e generation phase, applying the contents obtained from the previous process, generates the TL sentence.
ECTST is implemented in PASCAL.
The software is separated from the linguistic data, so that any language can be accepted if the grammar rules and vocabulary are given.
Likewise, the system program are free to o:hange their components with no undue restrictions that may be imposed by the linguistic components.
DIdTIONAP¥ ~,ONT~PFS The dictionary is bilingual: it contains morphological, syntactic and semantic information needed for the analysis and generation of a sentence.
This includes information about the category of words, their semantic fea~ tures and case frames.
Entries in %he lexicon are of eight types, and their semantic features are based on graded concepts.
The case frame provides a means to find out the logical relationship between components in the sentence.
At present, the dictionary contains a limited set of lexical entries, which are grouped into models with the initial letter as the index for access° GRAMMAR RUL~ In ECTST, rules are represented in the form of meta-model.
It may contain one or more data items as shown below: A \[~\](a) B FY\](b) C \[~3(c) 376 ~,'here #~B,C Pepresent in:Formation on caLe.~oz'y of the word, while x,ytz aald a, t h, c are parameters ind J.

TRM~SFF~ AND GIi~i~I~ATiON In the transfer sta~e, transformation is accomplished in two steps" firs% the internal structure of the Fi, senteuoe is generated into a tree, with nodes that indicate their proper memsntic and gr~r.atica\] order in th~ TL sentence; then lexicon rules arc invoked to transfer the SL entrT~ on the basis of its context, in%o %he TL entry.
The advantage of such a procedure are obvious.
It ~kes the r~u\].es more flexib!e9 especially those oopin¢ S with sentences with similar int ernal s tructl/res.
Moreover p ~ es can be added, modified or changed as needed with no resultant effect on one another.
When a target tree is built up, it is then scanned by way of left recursion 377 and with words appended to its terminal nodes a~ required° Finally~ a oh~r~cter string is obtained; its output is ~ sentence in TL.
CONCLUSION Efforts made over the past decade h~ve achieved co~miderable progress in machine translation.
First syntactic parsing was pursued, then semantic and context analysis was advocated.
ECTST has profited from both theories.
Natural language is essentially discrete information system.
It often al\]ows multiple syntactic interpret&tions.
To mini,~ize the possibility of multiple interpret~.tion, we introduce a mioimum amount of semantic information and .adopt the case frame.
This provides flexible f~cility in .<vnt~ctic analysis and helps to distinguish st~otura/ mmbiguity, in this approach, the translation accuracy is up to 9C,~)~ or more, which can be raised if correspondzng i~'orn~ztion and/or rules are modified ar/l supplemented.
