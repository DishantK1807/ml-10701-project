Ill this study, we will look tbr the patterns and generalizations in the i)honemic ditrer(m(:es 1)et;ween Dutch and Fhmfish 1)y using two (tat;ndriven t(~chniques.
It; is our aim to extract the regularities that are implicitly contained in the data.
Two corpora were used tbr this study, r(~l)resenting the Norl;hern Dul, eh and Sout;hern Dutch w~rbmts.
D)r Northenl Dut(:h Celex (releas(; 2) was used and for Flemish Fonilex (versioll 1.01)).
The Celex datM)ase contains fiequen(:y infi)rlnation (based on the INL corl)uS of the hlsl;itute fi)r 1)ul;(:h Lexieology), and i)honologi(:al~ morl)hologicM, and synt;a(:tic lexicM intbrmation tbr more l;tmn 384.000 word forms, 327 and uses DISC as encoding tbr word pronunciation.
The Fonilex database is a list of more than 200.000 word tbrms together with their Flemish pronunciation.
For each word tbrm, an abstract lexical representation is given, together with the concrete pronunciation of that word tbrm in three speech styles: highly formal st)eech, sloppy speech and "normal" speech (which is an intermediate level).
A set of phonological rewrite rules was used to deduce these concrete speech styles ti'om the abstract t)honological tbrm.
The initial phonological transcription was obtained by a grapheme-to-phoneme converter and was afterwards corrected by hand.
Fonilex uses YAPA as encoding scheme.
By means of their identification number, the Fonilex entries also contain a rethrence to the Celex entries, since Celex served as basis tbr the list of word tbrms in Fonilex.
E.g. tbr the word "aaitje" (Eng.: "stroke"), the relevant Celex entry is "25/aait.je/5/'aj-tj¢}/" and the corresponding Fonilex entry looks like "251aaitjel'ajts@l".
The word tbrms in Celex with a fl'equency of 1 and higher (indicated in field 3) ~re included in Fonilex and fl:om the list with tiequency 0, only the monomorphematic words were selected.
In the fi)llowing section, a brief explanation is given of the method we used to search for the overlap and ditfhrences between both regional w~riants of Dutch.
Section 3 provides a quantitative analysis of the results.
Section 4 discusses the dittbrences between Celex and Fonilex, starting fl'om tile set of transtbrmation rules that is learned during TranstbrmationBased Error-Driven Learning (TBEDL).
These rules are COlnpared to the production rules produced by C5.0.
In addition, we present an overview of the non-systematic diflhrences.
In a final section, some concluding remarks are given.
"2 Rule Induction Our starting i)oild; is the assumption that the differences in the phonemic transcriptions between Flemish and Dutch are highly systematic, and can be represented in a set of rules.
Hence, these rules provide linguistic insight into the overlap and discrepancies between both w~riants.
Moreover, they can be used to adapt prommciation databases tbr Dutch md;omatically to Flemish and vice versa.
A possil)le w~y to find the regul~trities within the diflbrences betweet, both corpora is to make the rules by hand, which is time-consmning and error-prone.
Another option is to make use of a data-oriented learning method in which linguistic knowledge is learned automatically.
In our experiment we have made use of two rule induction techniques, viz.
~:a~nsformation-Based Error Driven Learning (TBEDL) (Brill, 1995) and C5.0 (Quinlan, 1993).
In the process of 'Transfbnnation-Based Error-Driven Learning, transtbrmation rules are learned by comparing a corpus that is annotated by an initial state annotator to a correctly amlotared corpus, which is called the "truth".
l)uring that comparison, an ordered list of transtbrmation rules is learned.
This ordering implies that the application of an earlier rule sometimes makes it possible tbr a later rule to apply (so-called "feeding").
In other cases, as also descrit)ed in the work of Roche and Schabes (1995), a given structure fiTdls to undergo a rule as a consequence of s()me earlier rule ("bleeding").
These rules are applied to tile output of the initial state ammtator ill order to t)ring that outt)ut closer to the "truth".
A rule consists of two parts: a transtbrmation and a "triggering environment".
For each iteration in the learning process, it is investigated tbr each possible rule how many mistakes can be corrected through al)t)lication of that rule.
The rule which causes the greatest error reduction is retained.
Figure 1 shows the TBEDL learning process apt)lied to the comparison of the Celex representation and the Fonilex "n()rmal" representa|;ion, which flmctions as "truth".
In this case, the task is to learn how to transtbrm Celex rel)resentations into Fonilex representations (i.e., translate Dutch pronunciation to Flemish prommciation).
Both corpora serve as input tbr the "transtbrmation rule learner" (Brill, 1995).
This learning process results in an ordered list of transformation rules which reflects the systematic differences between both representations.
A rule is read as: "change x (Celex representation) into y (Fonilex representation) in the following triggering enviromnent".
E.g. /i:/ /~/ NEXT 1 Oil.
2 ()I/l.
3 PHON/e:/ (change a tense/i/to a lax/i/when one of the three tollowing Celex phonemes is at tense/e/).

Therefore, the phonemic symbols are aLigned with the graphemes of the written word tbrm.
In case the phonemic transcription is shorter than the speLLing, mill phonemes ('-') are used to filL the g~L)S.

With .Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning and C5.0, we looked for the systematic differences between Northern Dutch and Flenfish.
In TBEDL, the complete training set of 90% was used for learning the transfbrmation rules.
A threshold of 15 errors was specified, which means that learning stops if the error reduction lies under that threshold.
Due to the large amount of training data, this threshold was chosen to reduce training time.
This resulted in about 450 rules.
In figure 2, the number of transformation rules is plotted against the accuracy of the conversion between both w, riants.

Figure 2 shows that especially tile first 50 rules lead to a considerable increase of performance fl'om 59.07% to 79A0% on the word level and from 92.77% to 96.98% for phonemes, which indicates the high applicability of these rules.
Afterwards, the increase of accuracy is more graduah from 79.40% to 88.95% (words) and fl'om 96.98% to 98.52% (phonemes).
For the C5.0 experiment~ 50% (887.647 cases) of the original training set served as training set (more training data was not feasible).
A decision tree model and a production rule model were lmilt from the training cases.
The tree gave rise to 745 rules.
These production rules were applied to the original 10% test set we nsed in the TBEDL experiment.
In order to make the type of task comparable for the transfbrmarion based approach used by TBEDL, and the classification-based approach used in C5.0, the output class to be predicted by C5.0 was either ~0' when the Celex and Fonilex phoneme are identical (i.e.
no change), or the Fonilex phoneme when Celex and Fonilex differ.
Table 2 gives an overview of the overlap between Celex and Fonilex after application of t)oth rule induction techniques.
A comparison of these results shows that, when evaluating both TBEDL and C5.0 on the test set, the rules learned by the Brill-tagger have a higher error rate, even when C5.0 is only trained on half the data used by TBEDL.
On tile word level, the initial overlap of 59.07% is raised to 88.95% af ter application of the 450 transformation rules, and to 90.35% when using the C5.0 rules.
On the phoneme level, the initial 92.77% overlap is increased to 98.52% (TBEDL) and 98.74% (C5.0).
C5.0 also has a slightly lower error rate for the consonants, vowels and diphthongs.

When looking at those cases where Celex and Fonilex difl'er, we see that it; ix possible to learn Brill rules which predict 73% of these differences at the word level and 79.5% of the differences at the phoneme level.
Tile C5.0 rules are more or less 3% more accurate: 76.4% (words) and 82.6% (phonemes).
It is indeed possible to reliably 'translate' Dutch into Flenfish.
4 Qualitative
Analysis In this section, we are concerned with the linguistic quality of tile rules that were extracted using TBEDL and C5.0.
To gain more insight ill the important differences between both pronunciation variants, a qualitative analysis of tile rules was performed.
Therefore, the conversion rules were listed and compared.
The following list presents some examples for consonants, vowels and diphthongs.
Starting point 330 is the first 10 rules that were learned during TBEDL, which are compared with the 10 C5.0 rules, which most reduce the error rate.
In the, transtbrmation rules 1)resented below, the relationship between Dutch art(1 Flemish, especially the most important differences, are extracted fronl the eorl)ora and tbrmulated in a set of easily understmldal)le rules.
The C5.0 produ(:tion rules, Oll the other hand also descrit/e the overlapl)ing phonelnes between Celex and Dmilex, which makes it hard to have at clear overview of the regularities in the dilt'erences 1)etween both variants of Dutch.
The fact that the category '0' was used to describe the overlap between the databases (no chauge) does not; really hell).
Even if C5.0 discovers that no change is the default rifle, additional specific rules (lescrit)ing the, default condition are neverthel(~ss ne('c, ssary to l)revent the other rules fl'om tiring incorrectly.
4.1 Consonants
Nearly 60% of the differences on the consonant level concerns l;he alternation 1)etween voiced and unvoiced consonants.
In the word "gelijkaardig" (Eng.: "equal"), for example, we lind a /xolcika:rdox/ with a voi('eless velm: fri('ative in Dutch and /golcika:rdax/ with a voiced velar fricative in Flenlish.
The word 'hnachiavellisme" (Eug.: "Machiavellism") is pronommed as /ln(igi:ja:w:hsm,)/ in Dutch an(t as /m(d¢J.j(,wchzmo/ in Flelnish.

T~tble 3 clearly shows the alternation t)etween /x/ and /,g/.
This alternation also is the subject of the first transformation rule, namely "/x/ changes into/,g/ it, case of a word t)eginning (indicated by "STAAll.T") one or two I)ositions t)efbre".
When looking at the to t) ten of the C5.0 l)roduction rules that most reduce error rate, the two most important rules also describe this alternation: ilnle 682: (7749/29, lift 110.9) t-1 in {=, {, c:} f in {x, .q, ;, Q}1 -> class y \[0.996\] Rule 683: (7749/29, lift 110.91 fl in {=, {, ~:} f in {x,,q} -> class,g \[0.996\] Another important phenomenon is the use of p~tlatalisation in Flemish, as in the word "aaitje" (Eng.: "stroke"), where Folfilex uses the t)alatalized fortll/aljtJ'o/instead of/a:jtjo/.
The two sul)sequent transtbrmation rules 3 and d make this change possible.
In the top 10 of C5.0 rules, only the tirst i)arl; of this change is descril)ed.
Transtbrmation rule 8 (les('rit)es the omission of the i)honeme /t/ in ea,se, of the gral)hemic combination <ti>, as in "t)olitie '~ (Eng.: "police").

A closer look at the ten most important C5.0 production rules shows that seven out of ten rules descrit)e this transition from a Celex tense vowel to a Fonilex lax vowel.

The rnles concern the phonemes that follow the diphthongs: /.j/ after /ei/ and /u/ afl;er /ou/.
E.g. '%lanw" "blue"), the/l,/ is omitted in Flemish: /bkm/.

These rules, describing the differences between Northern Dutch and Flemish consonants, vowels and diphthongs also make linguistic sense.
Linguistic literature, such as the work of Booij (1995) and De Schutter (1978) indicates tendencies such as voicing and devoicing on the consonant level and the confllsion of tense and lax vowels as important differences between Northern Dutch and Flemish.
The same discrepancies are f(mnd in the transcriptions made by both Flemish and Dutch subjects in the Dutch transcription experiments described in Gillis (19!)9).
5 Error
Analysis Besides tile systematic phonenlic differences between Flemish and Dutch, there are a number of mmystematic differences between both databases.
After application of 450 transformation rules, 88.95% of the words makes a correct; transition from the Celex-transcription to the Fonilex-transcriptiolL The 7d5 C5.0 rules lead to a 90.35%.
Using the Brill-tagger, it also has to be taken into account that rules can be undone by a later rule (see also Roche and Schabes (1995)), as in tile word "feuilleteer" (Bug.: "leaf througlf').
Celex provides the transcrit)tion/t'(x'.y.iol;e:r/, while Fonilex transcribes it as /f~:jate:r/.
During learning, the transtbrmation rule "change /my/ into /~:/ if the preceding graphenm is an <e>" is learned.
This results in the correct Fonilex-/ff~:jote:r/.
This transformation, however, is canceled by a later rule, which changes /0:/ back into /oey/ if tile *bllowing grapheme is an <i>.
This leads again to the original Celex-transcription.
C5.0, which does not suflhr from sinfilar consequences of rule ordering, will correctly classify "feuilleteer".
hi this section, we are concerned with the relnaining errors after application of all rules.
Making use of a rule induction technique to extract the sub-regularities in the differences between the corpora can lead to some rules, which, however, may be based on noise or errors in the databases.
Theretbre, a manual analysis was done, which showed that the explanation of these remaining errors is twotbhl.
A first reason is that no rule is awfilable tbr less frequent cases.
TILe rules are induced on the basis of a sufficiently big frequency effect.
This leads to no rule at all tbr less frequent 1)honemes and phoneme coml)inations mid also for phonemes which are not always consistently transcribed.
Examples are loan words, such as "points" and "pantys '~ or the loan sound /-/ which only appears in Fonilex.
Another cause tbr errors is that rules will overgeneralise in certain cases.
The confusion 332 matrix for vowels in table 5 clearly indicates the tendency to use more l~x vowels in Flemish.
This leads to a mmfl)er of tr;mstbrInation rules ~md C5.0 rules describing this tendency.
A (:loser investigation of the errors committed t)y the, Brill-tagger, however, shows thnt 41..7% of the errors concerns the use of a wrong vowel.
In 25% of the errors conmfitted on the t)honeme level, there was an incorrect transition fl'om a tense to a b~x vowel, as in '%ntagonislne" (Eng.: '%ntagonisln") where there was no transition from an /o:/ to ;u, /:)/.
in 16.8% of the errors, a tense vowel is errolleOllsly used instead of a \]~x vowel, as in "atfi('he" (Eng.: "I)OSt(~r ") where an/,/ is used instead of a ((:orr(x:t) /i/.
1) ifliculties ill the alternation t)etween voiced ;u mlvoiced consort;mrs account for 6.3% of the errors on the phoneme level.

Of tWO rifle in(hu:tion techniques, nnmely 3h:mlsformation-Based Error-Driven Learning (Brill, 1995) and C5.0 (Quinlan, 1993).
Studying the accuracy of 1)oth systems, we noted that M'ter ~l)plication of the transtbrmation rules that were learned t)y the TBEDL method, 73% of the differences (m the word level and 80% of the ditl'crences on the t)honeme level was covered by the rules.
The C5.0 I)ercentages are some 3('/o higher.
This (:()rresl)onds with an overall a(:(:ura(:y in 1)redicting the 1)ronun(:iation of n lq('.mish word l)rommcb~tion ti'om the l)utch pronunciation of about 89% for TBEDL and 90% for C5.0 (about 99% at i)honeme level for l)oth).
A qualitative analysis of the first ten rules produced by both methods, suggested that l)oth TBEDL and 05.0 extract valuable rules describing the most important linguistic differences between Dutch mid Flelnish on the consonant and the vowel level.
The C5.() production rules, however, are more numerous and more dit\[icult to interpret.
The results of the transtbrnlationbased le~rnillg approach are clearly more understandMfle than those of a classification-based lenrning approach for this problem.
