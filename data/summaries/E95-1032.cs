Inappropriate scoping may leave undischarged and hence uninterpretable terms and indices (which accounts for the so-called freevariable and vacuous quantification constraints on scope (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992)).
P92-1005
Phenomena Space precludes illustrating the substitutional approach through further examples, though more are discussed in (Alshawi et al., 1992; Cooper et al., 1994b).

Evaluation Figure 1 defines a valuation relation for the QLF fragment used above, derived from (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Cooper et al., 1994a).
P92-1005
\] Heuristics simi\]ar to those described by Hardt (1992) may be used for this.
P92-1002
Terms and indices not dischargeable in this manner lead to uninterpretable QLFs (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992).
P92-1005
Multiple VP Ellipsis Multiple VP ellipsis (Gardent, 1993) poses problems at the level of determining which VP is the antecedent of which ellipsis.
E93-1018
Section 2 describes the substitutional treatment of ellipsis by way of a few examples presented in a simplified version of Quasi Logical Form (QLF) (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Alshawi et el., 1992).

The use of terms and indices has parallels to proposals due to Kehler and Kamp (Kehler, 1993a; Gawron and Peters, 1990).
E93-1025 P93-1009
The treatment is similar to the discourse copying analysis of (Kehler, 1993a), and to the substitutional treatment suggested by Kamp within Discourse Representation Theory, described in (Gawron and Peters, 1990).
E93-1025 P93-1009
The treatment is easily implementable, and forms the basis of the ellipsis resolution component currently used within the Core Language Engine (Alshawi et al., 1992).
P92-1005
This comprises the restriction of the antecedent form and a new category constructed by taking the features of the antecedent category, unless overridden by those on the ellipsis--a kind of (monotonic) priority union (Grover et ai., 1994) except using skeptical as opposed to credulous default unification (Carpenter, 1993).
P94-1003
Kehler (1993a) has convincingly argued that this problem arises because DSP do not distinguish between merely co-referential and co-indexed (in his terminology, role-linked) expressions.
E93-1025 P93-1009
and Inference Selecting ellipsis antecedents and parallel elements within them is an open problem (Priist, 1992; Prfist et al., 1994; Kehler, 1993b; Grover et al., 1994).
E93-1025 P93-1009 P94-1003
The substitutions employed by the evaluation rule for scoping achieve a similar effect to the introduction and discharging of quantifier assumptions in Pereira's (1990) categorial semantics.
