In a typical information extraction task, the most interesting part is the events and relationships holding among the events (Appelt et al., 1995).

SRA (Krupka, 1995) employs a graphical user interface that allows the user to create patterns by identifying the important concepts in the text, as well as the relationships between the concepts.

Other research concerns using WordNet senses to tag large corpus with the lexical semantics for automated word sense disambiguation (Ng, 1997) (Wiebe et aal., 1997) 3 Application of WordNet in the System Our system contains three major processes which, respectively, address training, rule generalization, and the scanning of new information.

SRI developed a specification language called FASTSPEC that automatically translates regular productions written by the developer into finite state machines (Appelt et al., 1995).

Many researchers have taken steps toward successful extraction of computationally useful lexical information from machine readable dictionaries and convert it into formal representation (Montemagnia and Vanderwende, 1993) (Byrd et al., 1987) (Jensen and Binot, 1987).

The overall performance of recall and precision is defined by F-measurement (Chinchor, 1992), which is (/~2 + 1.0) • P • R /32*P+R where P is precision, R is recall,/~ = 1 if precision and recall are equally important.

Some early work of applying WordNet for the lex~ ical semantic acquisition can be found in NYU's MUC-4 system (Grishman et al., 1992), which c used WordNet hierarchies for semantic classification.

Many research groups are making progress toward efficient customization, such as BBN (Weischedel, 1995), NYU (Grishman, 1995), SRI (Appelt et al., 1995), SRA (Krupka, 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen et al., 1995), UMass (Fisher et al., 1995)...etc.

Ralph Grishman and his group at NYU reached the conclusion that "WordNet may be a good source of concepts, but that it will not be of net benefit unless manually reviewed with respect to a particular application" (Grishman et al., 1992).
