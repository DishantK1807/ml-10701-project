A pomset mcfg G is a 7-tuple (Σ,N,O,P,F,R,S) such that Σ is a finite non-empty set of atoms, i.e. terminal symbols, N is a finite non-empty set of nonterminal symbols, where N∩Σ=∅, O is a set of valid pomset operators, P is a set of i-tuples of pomsets labelled by Σ∪N, F is a finite set of pomset rewriting functions from tuples of elements of P into elements in P, F⊆{ g:Pn →P | n>0 }, R is a finite set 2Pomset isolation is similar to proposals in for string isolation in linear specification language (Goetz and Penn, 2000), locking in idl-expressions (Nederhof and Satta, 2004), and integrity constraints in fo-tag (Becker et al., 1991).

mcfgs There are many (structural) mildly context sensitive grammar formalisms, e.g. mcfg, lcfrs, mg, and they have been shown to be equivalent (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987).

Computational linguistis have explored adding crossing dependency and discontinuous constituency, i.e. a structural context sensitivity (Seki et al., 1991; Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Stabler, 1996).
