Besides, sentence alignment can also be indirectly achieved via more complicated word corresponding models [Brown et al., 93; Vogel et al., 96; Och and Ney, 2000].

Since the bilingual corpus is a valuable resource for training statistical language models [Dagon, 91; Su et al., 95; Su and Chang, 99] and sentence alignment is the first step for most such tasks, many alignment approaches have been proposed in the literature [Brown, 91; Gale and Church, 93; Wu, 94; Vogel et al., 96; Och and Ney, 2000].
