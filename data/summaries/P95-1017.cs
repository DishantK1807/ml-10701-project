2Our work on the DTTool and tagged corpora was reported in a recent paper (Aone and Bennett, 1994).

Various theories of Japanese zero pronouns have been proposed by computational linguists, for example, Kameyama (Kameyama, 1988) and Walker et aL (Walker et al., 1994).

For example, discourse structure information (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Hearst, 1994), if obtained reliably and automatically, will be another useful domain-independent feature.

Previously (Aone and McKee, 1993), we reported our data-driven multilingual anaphora resolution system, which is robust, exteusible, and manually trainable.

This is because the current application of our multilingual NLP system is information extraction (Aone et al., 1993), i.e. extracting from texts information about which organizations are forming joint ventures with whom.
