We model meaning as an ontologically richly sorted, relational structure, using a description logic-like framework (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).

This yields several inferences that need to hold for the scene, like DeVault and Stone (2004).

We use a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003) to describe the relation between the syntactic structure of an utterance and its meaning.

Gorniak and Roy (2004) use manually constructed mappings between linguistic constructions, and probabilistic functions which evaluate whether an object can act as referent, whereas DeVault and Stone (2004) use symbolic constraint resolution.

ing the cognitive load model (§1), objects located in this region should be described with a projective relation such as “to the right of L2” rather than a proximal relation like “near L2”, see Kelleher and Kruijff (2006).
