We assume a fixed inventory of topics T1,T2,...,Tk, with k on the order 104, similar in granularity to the Northern Light topic hierarchy (Kornai et al 2003) and reserve T0 to topicless texts or “General Language”.

But if larger training corpora are available, significant disambiguation is possible: with a 1 m word training corpus (Csendes et al., 2004) the TnT (Brants, 2000) architecture can achieve 97.42% overall precision.

The standard solution to constrain the probabilistic tagging model for some of the unseen items is the application of MA (Hakkani-T¨ur et al., 2000; Hajiˇc et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2005).

Hungarian is particularly challenging in this regard, both because the number of ambiguous tokens is high (reaching 50% in the Szeged Corpus according to (Csendes et al., 2004) who use a different MA), and because the ratio of tokens that are not seen during training (unseen) can be as much as four times higher than in comparable size English corpora.

But even if the MA is tight, a considerable proportion of ambiguous tokens will come from legitimate but rare analyses of frequent types (Church, 1988).

For small range, we use the Hungarian translation of Orwell’s 1984 – 98k words including punctuation tokens, (Dimitrova et al., 1998).

Our first model (MA-ME) is based on disambiguating the MA output in the maximum entropy (ME) framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

For Hungarian, the highest quality (4% threshold) stratum of the corpus contains 1.22m unique pages for a total of 699m tokens, already exceeding the 500m predicted in (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).
