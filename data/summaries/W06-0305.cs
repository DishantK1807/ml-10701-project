Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) The PDTB contains annotations of discourse relations and their arguments on the Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).

Recent work has shown the importance of recognizing such perspectivization of information for several NLP applications, such as information extraction, summarization, question answering (Wiebe et al., 2004; Stoyanov et al., 2005; Riloff et al., 2005) and generation (Prasad et al., 2005).

Following the approach towards discourse structure in (Webber et al., 2003), the PDTB takes a lexicalized ap31 proacha2 towards the annotation of discourse relations, treating discourse connectives as the anchors of the relations, and thus as discourse-level predicates taking two abstract objects (AOs) as their arguments.

The proposed scheme is an extension of the core scheme used for annotating attribution in the first release of the PDTB (Dinesh et al., 2005; PDTB-Group, 2006).

Most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), or the sentence or word level (Wiebe et al., 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

Annotation schemes (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005; PDTB-Group, 2006) encode such distinctions to facilitate accurate recognition and representation of such perspectivization of information.

This paper describes an extended annotation scheme for marking the attribution of discourse relations and their arguments annotated in the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Prasad et al., 2004; Webber et al., 2005), the primary goal being to capture the source and degrees of factuality of abstract objects.

of Attribution Recent work (Wiebe et al., 2005; Prasad et al., 2005; Riloff et al., 2005; Stoyanov et al., 2005), has shown the importance of recognizing and representing the source and factuality of information in certain NLP applications.
