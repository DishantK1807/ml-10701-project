(4)We will continue to expand our CWS with other linguistic knowledge (such as part-ofspeech information and morphology) and BTM model (Tsai 2005) to improve our BMM-based CWS for attending the third International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff in both closed and open testing tracks.

The bottleneck of developing a high-performance CWS is to comprise of a high-performance Chinese UWI (Lin et al.1993; Tsai et al.2003). It is because Chinese is written without any separation between words and meanwhile more than 50% words of the Chinese texts in web corpus are out-of-vocabulary (Tsai et al.2003). Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al.1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntaxsemantic knowledge (Chen et al.2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al.2000; Gao et al.2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al.2003; Ma and Chen, 2003).
