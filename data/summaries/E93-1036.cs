Lang \[Lang, 1974; Lang, 1988c\] gives a general construction of deterministic parsing algorithms from nondeterministic push-down automata.

The algorithm can be easily changed so that, with a little amount of overhead, the time complexit~ is re3 duced to O(n ), similar to the algorithms in \[Perlin, 1991\] and \[Leermakers, 1992\], and the algorithm produces parse forests with subpacking, which require only O(n 3) space for storage.

The general idea of Lang has been applied to other formalisms than context-free grammars in \[Lang, 1988a; Lang, 1988b; Lang, 1988d\].

The technique has been adapted to other formalisms than context-free grammars in \[Tomita, 1988\].

Subpacking has been discussed in \[Billet and Lang, 1989: Leiss, 1990; Leermakers, 1991\]; see also \[Sheil, 1976\].
