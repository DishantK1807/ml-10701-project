The problem here, however, is not of unbounded functional uncertainty (described, with proposed solutions, in Kaplan, Maxwell, and Zaenen \[1987\], Kaplan and Maxwell \[1988\], and Kaplan and Zaenan \[1990\]), but rather, one of disjunctive constraint satisfaction bounded within the matrix.

More recently, Johnson and Dorre (1995) have presented a framework for constraint coroutining to deal with linguistic constraints that cannot be effectively resolved during parsing at the location in which they are most naturally introduced.
