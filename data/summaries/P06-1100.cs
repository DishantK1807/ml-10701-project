For example, in eXtended WordNet (Harabagiu et al.1999), the glosses in WordNet are enriched by disambiguating the nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives with synsets.

The semantic classes of x and y are then inferred using conceptual density (Agirre and Rigau 1996), a WordNet-based measure applied to all instantiation of x and y in the corpus.

Most recently, Pantel (2005) developed a method to propagate lexical cooccurrence vectors to WordNet synsets, forming ontological co-occurrence vectors.

Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al.2004), is-a (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al.2003), and other relations.

Pantel (2005) defined the task of ontologizing a lexical semantic resource as linking its terms to the concepts in a WordNet-like hierarchy.

Also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in Corley and Mihalcea (2005).

The first algorithm that we explore, called the anchoring approach, was suggested as a promising avenue of future work in (Pantel 2005).

NLP researchers have developed many algorithms for mining knowledge from text and the Web, including facts (Etzioni et al.2005), semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), concept lists (Lin and Pantel 2002), and word similarity lists (Hindle 1990).
