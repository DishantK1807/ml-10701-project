Van Uytsel (2000) developed a top-down alternative along similar lines but based on a lexicalized and context-sensitive DP version of an efficient Earley parser (Stolcke, 1995; Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991).

The second set was trained on the BLLIP WSJ Corpus (BWC), which is a machine-parsed (Charniak, 2000) version of (a selection of) the ACL/DCI corpus, very similar to the selection made for the WSJ0/1 CSR corpus.

3.2.1 Context-sensitive and lexicalized states In our work we did not attempt to find semantic generalizations (such as casting a verb form to its infinitive form or finding semantic attributes); our simple (but probably suboptimal) approach, borrowed from (Magerman, 1994; Collins, 1996; Chelba, 2000), is to percolate words upward in the parse tree in the form in which they appear in the sentence.
