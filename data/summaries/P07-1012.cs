Results of the experiments were consistent with earlier findings(Hirsimäki et al., 2006; Kurimo et al., 2006).

In (Kurimo et al., 2006) a WER of 57.6% was achieved with word-based varigrams and a WER of 49.0% with morphs-based ones.

One solution to this is expanding the different items with tags according to pronunciation, shifting the problem to language modeling(Creutz et al., 2007).

These items would then be of more use when trying to predict unseen data(Creutz et al., 2007).

This is verified by recent empirical results, where gains obtained from simple morphological decomposition seem to be marginal(Kirchhoff et al., 2006; Creutz et al., 2007).

This approach, called “Morfessor Baseline” is described in detail in (Creutz et al., 2007).
