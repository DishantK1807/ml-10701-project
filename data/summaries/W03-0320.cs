Many previous efforts have used a similar methodology but were only able to focus on word to word correspondences (Gale and Church, 1991).
H91-1026
Following a suggestion in Gale and Church (1993), the alignment was aided by the use of additional anchors that were available for the language pair.

Alignment 3.1 Sentence Alignment Approach The algorithm used to align English-Inuktitut sentences is an extension of that presented in Gale and Church (1993).

For comparison, the Gale and Church (1993) program, which did not make use of additional anchors, had poorer results over our corpus.

Third, it makes the correct judgment on Gale and Churchâ€™s wellknown chambre-communes problem (Gale and Church, 1991).
H91-1026
Sentences have been aligned using the length-based dynamic programming approach of Gale and Church (1993) enhanced with a small number of lexical and non-alphabetic anchors.
J93-1004
All alignments that occurred in the first two sentences of each paragraph were marked as hard boundaries for the Gale and Church (1993) program as provided in their paper.

To protect against that problem, we compute the 99.99999% confidence intervals around the PMI (Lin, 1999), and use the lower bound as a measure of association.
