The weight of a lexical chain is computed using the following formula inspired by (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002): a0a2a1a3a0 a1a5a4a7a6 a1a9a8a4 a4a11a10a13a12 a1a14a4 a0 a4 a4a7a6 a4a8a15a11a4a16a10a13a12 a4 a4a18a17a19a17a19a17a20a4 a6a22a21a24a23 a1a9a8a21a25a4a26a10a13a12a27a21a24a23 a1 a4 a0 a21 where n represents the number of relations in the lexical chain.
