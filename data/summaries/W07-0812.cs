They report improved results of 93.91% using a combined voting scheme (Kudo & Matsumato, 2000).

Phrase Chunking In this task, we use a setup similar to that of Kudo & Matsumato (2000) and Diab et al.(2004 & 2007), with the IOB annotation representation: Inside I a phrase, Outside O a phrase, and Beginning B of a phrase.

In general, BPC is appealing as an enabling technology since state of the art performance for BPC is higher (Fβ=1 95.48%) than that for full syntactic parsing (Fβ=1 90.02% ) in English (Collins, 2000; Kudo & Matsumato, 2000).

A la Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), and Kudo and Matsumato (2000), we use the IOB tagging style for modeling and classification.

An English example of base phrases is [I]NP [would eat]V P [red luscious apples]NP [on Sundays]PP. The BPC task is proving to be an enabling step that is useful to many natural language processing (NLP) applications such as information extraction and semantic role labeling (Hacioglu & Ward, 2003).

A la Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), they represent the words as a sequence of labeled words with IOB annotations, where the B marks a word at the beginning of a chunk, I marks a word inside a chunk, and O marks those words (and punctuation) that are outside chunks.

Consequently, SVMs have been applied in many NLP tasks with great success (Joachims, 1998; Hacioglu & Ward, 2003).

For Arabic, BPC is especially interesting as it constitutes a viable alternative to full syntactic parsing due to the low performance in Arabic full syntactic parsing (labeled Fβ=1 = ∼80% compared to Fβ=1=91.44% for BPC) (Bikel, 2004; Diab et al., 2007; Kulick et al., 2006).

As far as Arabic BPC, Diab et al.(2004 & 2007) adopt the KM00 model for Arabic using YAMCHA.

Moreover, since BPC had been cast as a classification problem by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the task is performed with greater efficiency and is easily portable to new languages in a supervised manner (Diab et al., 2004; Diab et al., 2007).

It was first cast as a classification problem by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), as a problem of NP chunking.

The closest relevant approach to the current investigation is the work of Kudo and Matsumato (2000) (KM00) on using SVMs and a sequence model for chunking.

There exists a system that produces the full morphological POS tag set, MADA, with very high accuracy, 96% (Habash & Rambow, 2005).

The overall results for all the conditions significantly outperform state of the art published results on Arabic BPC of Fβ=1=91.44% in Diab et al.(2004 & 2007).
