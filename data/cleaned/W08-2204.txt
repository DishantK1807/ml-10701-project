Abstract
In this paper we present LXGram, a general purpose grammar for the
deep linguistic processing of Portuguese that aims at delivering detailed
and high precision meaning representations. LXGram is grounded on the
linguisticframeworkofHead-DrivenPhraseStructureGrammar(HPSG).
HPSG is a declarative formalism resorting to unification and a type sys-
tem with multiple inheritance. The semantic representations that LX-
Gram associates with linguistic expressions use the Minimal Recursion
Semantics(MRS)format,whichallowsfortheunderspecificationofscope
effects. LXGramisdevelopedintheLinguisticKnowledgeBuilder(LKB)
system, a grammar development environment that provides debugging
tools and efficient algorithms for parsing and generation. The implemen-
tation of LXGram has focused on the structure of Noun Phrases, and LX-
Gram accounts for many NP related phenomena. Its coverage continues
to be increased with new phenomena, and there is active work on ex-
tending the grammar’s lexicon. We have already integrated, or plan to
integrate, LXGram in a few applications, namely paraphrasing, treebank-
ing and language variant detection. Grammar coverage has been tested
on newspaper text.

1 Introduction
In this paper we present LXGram, a hand-built, general purpose computationalgram-
marforthedeeplinguisticprocessingofPortuguese,speciallygearedtohighprecision
processingof NounPhrases. Thisgrammaris basedon theframeworkof Head-Driven
Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag (1994)), one of the most promi-
nent linguistic theories being used in natural language processing. Like several other
computational HPSGs, LXGram uses Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copes-
take et al. (2005)) for the representation of meaning.
LXGram is developedin the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) system (Copes-
take, 2002), a development environment for constraint-based grammars. This envi-
ronment provides a GUI, debugging tools and very efficient algorithms for parsing
and generation with the grammars developed there (Malouf et al., 2000; Carroll et al.,
1999).
Several broad-coveragegrammars have been developed in the LKB. Currently, the
largest ones are for English (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000), German (Müller and
Kasper, 2000) and Japanese (Siegel and Bender, 2002). The grammars developed
with the LKB are also supported by the PET parser (Callmeier, 2000), which allows
for faster parsing times due to the fact that the grammars are compiled into a binary
format in a first step. As the LKB grammarsfor other languages, LXGram is in active
development, and it is intended to be a broad-coverage, open-domain grammar for
Portuguese. At the same time, it produces detailed representations of meaning in
tandem with syntactic structures, making it useful for a wide range of applications.
In Section 2, we describe the framework foundations of the grammar. The major
designfeaturesofthegrammarareintroducedinSection3. Wetalkaboutthecoverage
of LXGram in Section 4. Section 5 presents some of the phenomena treated within
the NP domain and shows examples of implemented analyses relating to NP syntax
and semantics. In Section 6, results on the performance of the grammar are reported,
and in Section 7, we discuss applications where the grammar is or is being integrated.
Finally, the paper closes with concluding remarks in Section 8.
2 Foundations
LXGramadoptstheHPSG framework,apopularlinguistictheorywith alargebodyof
literature covering many natural language phenomena. These insights can be directly
incorporated in the implementation of a computational grammar.
2.1 HPSG
HPSG resorts to a declarative formalism to model linguistic data. It employs a type
system (supporting multiple inheritance) and typed feature structures (recursive data
structures defining “has-a” relations) in order to describe the properties of linguistic
objects (words, phrases, rules). Unification of types and feature structures is central
to HPSG, used to ensure that the various elements have compatible properties. For
instance, the fact that a transitive verb takes an NP as its complement is captured in
HPSGbydefiningalexicaltypefortransitiveverbs,saytransitive-verb-lex(eme),with
constraints like the following (among others), presented in the Attribute-Value Matrix
(AVM) format widely employed in HPSG:

The NP complement of the verb is represented in this AVM as the value of the at-
tribute COMPS. This attribute takes a list as its value (indicated by the angle brackets).
In this case the sole element of this list describes an object with a HEAD feature of the
type noun and empty complements (the attribute COMPS) and specifier (the feature
SPR) (i.e. they have been saturated at the point where the verb combines with this
element), which is the HPSG description of an NP.
2.2 MRS
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) is used as the format of semantic representa-
tions that LXGram associates with expressions from Portuguese. MRS has several
properties that are interesting for applications. A relevant one is the use of pointers to
represent scope effects that are handled via recursion in traditional formal semantics.
This use of pointers (called handles) allows for the underspecification of scope rela-
tions, which avoids listing all scope possibilities for ambiguous sentences (although
theycanstill becomputedondemandwith theLKBmachinery). Thisis ausefulprop-
erty: scope does not need to be resolved in all applications (e.g. machine translation
does not require it), but at the same time scoped formulas can be obtained on demand
if required (e.g. for automated inference).
We provide an example MRS representation derived for the sentence “todas as
equipas podem vencer” (all teams can win) in Figure 1. This MRS describes the

• _poder_v(e2,_todo_q(x6,_equipa_n(x6),_vencer_v(e11,x6)))
34 Branco and Costa
The first reading is the one that says that each team has a chance to win, while the
second reading says that it is possible for there to be a situation in which all teams win
(false assuming common sense knowledge). A single MRS representation is obtained
forthesetworeadingsbyinstantiatingthe ARG1 featureoftherelation_poder_v(can)
with the handle h9, which is related to the handle h10 labeling the relation _vencer_v
(win) via a qeq relation (equality modulo intervening quantifiers). This is the way of
saying thatthese two handlesarethesame (firstreading)or thatthereis an intervening
generalized quantifier relation (second reading).
Semantic representations abstract from many grammatical and superficial details
of language, like word order, syntactic structure and morphology. As such, they are
very similar across differentnatural languages(modulo predicate names). This is also
true of MRS. Furthermore, semantic representations hide grammar implementation.
As such, they are the preferred grammar’s interface for applications, that do not need
any knowledgeof the grammatical properties of Portuguese and may not need to look
at syntactic analysis.
The MRS format is also used with several other computational HPSGs, for other
languages. Several applications (e.g. Machine Translation) have been used with other
HPSGs that communicate with these grammars via the MRSs (Bond et al., 2004).
These applications can be easily integrated with grammars for different languages
that also use MRS: they are almost completely language independent.
3 Design
Features
Given the foundational options, LXGram adheres to a number of important design
features.
Bidirectionality LXGram is bidirectional. The formalism employed is completely
declarative. It can be used for parsing (yielding syntactic analyses and semantic rep-
resentations from natural language input) and also for generation (yielding natural
language from meaning representations). As such it can be useful for a wide range of
applications.
Precision LXGram aims at high precision of linguistic processing. Modulo bugs,
the grammar cannot parse ungrammatical input. Although this feature may have a
negative impact on robustness, it is an important aspect of the grammar when it is
used for generation, as it means it is not possible to generate ungrammatical strings.1
It is indeed possible to mark some rules and some lexical entries to only be used for
parsingand notforgeneration. In theconfigurationfiles fortheLKB onecan list these
rules and lexical items. We are currently using this feature in order to be able to parse
input that is not ungrammatical but is marked with respect to register, but preventing
the grammar from generating such strings.
Importantly, the fact that it cannot parse ungrammatical input also means that the
grammar will not produce impossible analyses for grammatical sentences.
Broad Coverage LXGram development is aimed at a broad coverage. We also
seek to make LXGram neutral with respect to regional variation as much as possi-
ble. Currently, the grammar accommodates both European Portuguese and Brazilian
1We believe that dealing with ill-formed input is best done via other means (rather than let the grammar
overgenerate so it can parse more), like partial parsing or the integration with/falling back to other tools.
High Precision Analysis of NPs with a Deep Processing Grammar 35
Portuguese. Aspects of variation that are accounted for include lexical differences
(merely affecting spelling or more substantial ones) as well as syntactic discrepancies
(e.g. definite articles before possessives, word order between clitic pronouns and the
verb).
Efficiency The processors on which LXGram runs (LKB, PET) are very efficient.
In addition, there are grammar engineering techniques that improve efficiency (e.g.
(Flickinger, 2000)) that are also exploited in our implementation.
Robustness The LKB and PET systems provideseveral ways to combine a grammar
with the output of shallow tools, like part-of-speech taggers. Such integration can
improve grammar coverage, as the grammar needs information about all words in the
input, and some words may be missing in the grammar’s lexicon. We have success-
fully combined LXGram with a part-of-speech tagger and a morphological analyzer
(more in Section 6). The grammar code includes mappings from the input format
(XML) to the feature structures that are manipulated by the grammar.
Availability A version of LXGram is publicly available at http://nlxgroup.di.
fc.ul.pt/lxgram. LXGram can be used by applications without any knowledge of
the grammar’simplementationor internal workings. The LKB allows for applications
to communicate with the grammar via sockets, accepting parser input in XML or raw
text and returning semantic representations in XML, for which a DTD is available. It
isalso possibleto automaticallyproducealistofallthepredicatesknownbythegram-
mar together with their arity and argument types (from the lexicon and syntax rules),
that can be manually annotated with comments and examples. The predicates corre-
sponding to lexical items are however quite transparent once the naming conventions
that are used are explained.
4 Coverage
4.1 Lexical
Coverage
When one is using a lexicalist framework like HPSG, lexical coverage is a key issue
because all tokens in the input should be known by the grammar in order for the
grammar to produce a parse. Furthermore, the amount of information included in
the lexicon that is used by an HPSG is very large. Part-of-speech and morphological
information is not sufficient. For the correct assignment of semantic representations,
subcategorization frames as well as other information pertaining to semantics must
be correctly associated with every lexical item, something that cannot be known with
sufficient quality by just using shallower tools, like part-of-speech taggers.
InLXGramahand-craftedlexiconcontainingseveralhundredsofnouns,adjectives
and verbs was developed. However, the manual creation of lexica with this amount
of information is time consuming and error prone. We are exploring methods to al-
leviate this problem. An option is to combine the grammar with shallower tools in
order to have access to some of the information needed and assume default values
for the information that cannot be obtained this way. We have already integrated
the grammar with a set of shallow tools (a part-of-speech tagger, a lemmatizer and a
morphologicalanalyzer) in order to guess informationaboutunknown words. Prelim-
inary results indicate an increase in coverage on unrestricted newspaper text from 2%
to 13%. Although this approach cannot guarantee correct semantic representations
36 Branco and Costa
(or even syntactic trees, since subcategorization frames constrain syntactic structure),
it can be useful in applications that only require some restricted amount of linguistic
information.
4.2 Overall
Grammatical Coverage
In order to get a quantitative overview of the grammar, it can be characterized as
follows:
• 24,484 lines of code, including comments and excluding the lexicon;
• 53 syntax rules;
• 40 lexical rules, mostly inflectional;
• 3,154 total types;
• 414 types for lexical items;
• 2,718 hand-built lexical entries.
For a qualitative overview, these are the linguistic phenomena covered so far:
• Declarativesentences
• Yes-no questions e.g.: “Portanto o Estado tem um gosto?” (So does the State
have preferences?)
• Imperative sentences e.g.: “Dá-me um desses bolos.” (Give me one of those
cakes)
• Somesubcategorizationframesofverbs,nouns andadjectivese.g.: “a Poló-
nia empatou com a França”(Poland tied with France); “eu já disse que pode ser
um dos mais baratos” (I told you already that it can be one of the cheapest);
“filho de um professor dos arredores de Viena” (son of a teacher from the out-
skirts of Vienna)
• Comparative constructions e.g.: “a vida é maior do que o cinema” (life is
larger than cinema)
• Noun phrase structure, including determiners, possessives, cardinal and
ordinal numerals, prepositional phrases, adjectives, etc. (examples in the
next section)
• Modification of verbal projections by prepositional and adverbial phrases
e.g.: “No CAPC termina hoje a exposição” (the exhibit ends today at CAPC);
• Relativeclausese.g.: “seteoutrossuspeitosqueapolíciaaindaprocura”(seven
other suspects that the police are still looking for)
• Null subjects and objects e.g.: “Saímos depois do jantar.” ((We) left after
dinner); “Podemos comer lá perto.” (We can eat near there)
High Precision Analysis of NPs with a Deep Processing Grammar 37
• FloatedQuantifiers e.g.: “os índices subiram todos” (the indices have all gone
up)
The developmentof the grammar is going on and this grammar is getting its cover-
age increased with important phenomena that are missing. In particular, for the near
future, we are working towards including more subcategorization frames for verbs,
nouns and adjectives, and implementing wh-questions, coordination and adverbial
subordination.
5 Noun
Phrases
A special design feature of LXGram is that it includes a comprehensive implementa-
tion of Portuguese Noun Phrase structure, covering:
• Bare noun phrases (i.e. NPs lacking a determiner) e.g.: “boa gestão” (good
management);“imagens da bancada” (images of the seats)
• Determiners and predeterminers e.g.: “esta sua última produção” (this last
productionof his); “todos estes problemas” (all these problems); “todos os par-
tidos políticos” (all the political parties), “aquele tempo todo” (all that time)
• Word order constraints among NP elements e.g.: “as duas primeiras insti-
tuições” (the two first institutions); “os primeiros sete meses deste ano” (the
first seven months of this year); “sete outros suspeitos que a polícia ainda
procura” (seven other suspects that the police are still looking for); “os outros
três membros do conselho” (the other three members of the council); “os seus
dois primeiros anos polémicos na Casa Branca” (his first two polemic years
in the White House); “o primeiro grande conflito que aportava em Belém” (the
firstgreatconflictthatreachedBerlin); “outrolugarqualquer”(anyotherplace);
“um lugar qualquer” (any place); “qualquer outra solução” (any other solution)
• Prenominal and postnominal possessives e.g.: “o seu terceiro maior parceiro
comercial” (its third major commercial partner); “um adjunto seu que atendeu
ali o telefonema” (an assessor of his who answered the phone call there)
• Modification of adjectives e.g.: “os escritores mais importantes” (the most
important writers); “o discurso razoavelmente optimista” (the reasonably opti-
mistic speech)
• Missing nouns e.g.: “dois que são gémeos” (two who are twins)
• Word order between adjectives and complements of nouns e.g.: “o conhec-
imento essencial das pessoas” (the essential knowledge about people)
• Adjectiveswiththesemanticsofargumentsofnounse.g.: “o veto americano
à renovação do mandato” (the American veto to the renewal of the position)
Precision was given a lot of attention. For instance, many items are constrained not
to appear more than once in a given NP (determiners, possessives, cardinals, ordinals,
etc.). Scope phenomena are also handled (motivated by semantics), as well as order
constraints. Agreement is enforced.
38 Branco and Costa
We present some examples of phenomena for which LXGram provides interesting
semantic representations and that we have not found in the literature pertaining to
implemented grammars.
5.1 Floated
Quantifiers
The first example relates to floated quantifiers. For all the sentences in (1), which are
all grammatical in Portuguese, LXGram provides the MRS equivalent of
all(x, price(x),will(go_up(x))):
(1) a. Todos
all
os
the
preços
prices
vão
will
subir.
go up
b. Os
the
preços
prices
todos
all
vão
will
subir.
go up
c. Os
the
preços
prices
vão
will
todos
all
subir.
go up
d. Os
the
preços
prices
vão
will
subir
go up
todos.
all
In all of these cases we associate empty semantics to the definite article (“os”).
Semantic information is percolated around the syntactic trees so that the universal
quantifier, which can be realized at several different places, ends up being linked to
the semantics of the NP subject in the semantic representationsfor all these sentences.
We also make sure that definite articles always carry quantifier semantics when no
floated quantifier is present.
The implementationrevolvesaround allowing floated quantifiersto attach to verbs,
resulting in verb-headed nodes that combine with NP subjects lacking quantifier se-
mantics. Raising verbs, like the form “vão” in this example, constrain their subject
according to the constraints of the subject of their VP complement. For instance, the
last example (1d) receives a syntactic analysis like the one described by the following
tree:

High Precision Analysis of NPs with a Deep Processing Grammar 39
Here, NP abbreviates a feature structure that describes a noun phrase (of the se-
mantic type 〈〈e,t〉,t〉), and NP〈e,t〉 abbreviates the constraints that describe an NP
introduced by a determiner lacking quantifier semantics (i.e. an NP with an MRS
representation that is similar to that of constituents with the the semantic type 〈e,t〉).
In HPSG, the SUBJ feature encodes the constraints on the subject that a constituent
selects. Weuseadedicatedsyntaxruleto combine“subir”and“todos”(floated-quant-
phrase), thatcreatesa noderequiringan NP with thesemantictype 〈e,t〉 as its subject.
The verb form “vão” is treated as a raising verb: in HPSG the syntactic requirements
on the subject of a raising verb are the same as the requirements on the subject of the
VP complementthat that verb selects for. This is denoted by the boxed integersin this
tree (which represent unification).
In this example, the VP complement of “vão” is the phrase “subir todos”, as these
two constituents are combined via the head-comp-phrase rule (selection of comple-
ments is represented in a way similar to the selection of subjects, but via the feature
COMPS instead of the feature SUBJ). The subject of the head-comp-phraseis the sub-
jectofitsheaddaughter(“vão”). Thetopmostnodeistheresultofapplyingasyntactic
rule to project subjects to the left of their head (subj-head-phrase).
The example in (1c) is processed in a similar fashion:

In this example, the complement of “vão” is the node spanning “subir”, which
selects for a quantified subject. The subject of the raising verb is accordingly also
a quantified NP. Here, the rule to project a floated quantifier applies lower than the
construction that projects complements, creating a node that requires a non-quantified
subject. The SUBJ feature of head-complement constructions comes from the head
daughter (the floated-quant-phrase node in this example). Therefore, the node pro-
duced by the head-comp-phraserule also requires a non-quantified subject.
Note that the composition of semantics with MRS in based on the concatenationof
the RELS and HCONS lists associated to the various constituents and passing around
40 Branco and Costa
the values of the features LTOP and INDEX (see Figure 1). It is not based on function
application. The composition of semantics with MRS is quite flexible.
5.2 Scope
of Adjectives and Relative Clauses
Thesecondexamplethatwe showhererelatesto thesemanticscopebetweendifferent
elements of noun phrases. In particular, we can see a distinction in the interpretation
of the two following examples:
(2) a. um
a
possível
possible
médico
doctor
chinês
Chinese
a possible Chinese doctor
b. um
a
possível
possible
médico
doctor
que
who
é
is
chinês
Chinese
a possible doctor who is Chinese
In the first NP an entity is described as possibly being a Chinese doctor. The second
NP describes an entity as possibly being a doctor and certainly being Chinese. Ac-
cordingly, LXGram delivers slightly different semantic representations for these two
NPs. The first case produces something similar to
λP. a(x, possible(doctor(x)∧chinese(x)),P(x)).
The second NP is treated along the lines of
λP. a(x, possible(doctor(x))∧chinese(x),P(x)).
These two different readings are derived simply by constraining the relative syntactic
scope of adjectives and relative clauses. Namely, LXGram forces prenominal adjec-
tives to attach higher than postnominal adjectives (2a) but lower than relative clauses
(2b). In this case, the scope differences in the semantic representations are simply
derived from the differences in syntactic scope:

6 Evaluation
Some evaluation experiments were conducted to test LXGram’s coverage. In one of
them, a corpus with newspaper text (self-reference) was used, with 145 sentences.
For this experiment, we used a part-of-speech tagger and a morphological analyzer
(self-reference)in order to guess some information about out-of-vocabularywords. A
defaultvaluewasassumedforthemissingsubcategorizationinformation(allunknown
verbs were treated as transitive verbs). The average sentence length was 22 words. In
this experiment, 13.1% of all sentences received at least one parse by the grammar.2
On the same test corpus, the average time it took for a sentence to parse was 1.1
secondsonaP4machineat3GHz. Theaverageamountofmemoryrequiredtoanalyze
a sentence was 145.5MB.
In another experiment, with 180,000 short sentences (5 to 9 words) selected ran-
domly from two newspaper corpora (CETEMPúblico and CETENFolha), LXGram
had achieved 26% coverage,using a similar approach to handle unknownwords (self-
reference).
During the development of LXGram we maintain several test suites, consisting of
example sentences for the implemented phenomena. The test suites use a controlled
vocabulary. Also, several examples attest several phenomena, in order to test the
interaction of the different modules. They are very useful to test the syntax rules of
thegrammarandthesemanticsthatLXGramproduces,andforregressiontesting. The
test suite for NPs contains 851 sentences (429 of which are negative examples, that
the grammar should not parse). The average sentence length is 5.3 words (2–16). On
this test suite LXGram has 100% coverage and 0% overgeneration. The average time
needed to analyze a sentence is 0.11 seconds, with an average memory requirement
of 15.5MB. Plotting parse time by sentence length, we see an approximately linear
increase in parse time with this test suite.
7 Applications
and Further Work
We have used LXGram to automatically discriminate between texts written in Euro-
pean Portugueseand Brazilian Portuguese, with encouragingresults, which match the
results obtained with other dialect detection methodologies. (self-reference).3
Additionally, we are working towards integrating it with an existing question an-
swering system (self-reference).4 This is in part the reason for the special focus on
NPs, as these constituents are often short answers to factoid questions.
Because the grammar is entirely bidirectional, a paraphraseris gained for free from
theimplementationof LXGram: the grammarcan simply beused to generatefromthe
semantic representations that it derives from an input sentence, thus producing para-
phrases of the textual input. We are also working to integrate the grammar, running
under this functionality, into the QA system.
2Note that one of the HPSGs with the broadest coverage at the moment, the ERG, covers 17% of the
British National Corpus. The main cause of parse failure is out-of-vocabulary words.
3In particular, the results obtained with LXGram were quite similar to the results obtained with the
standard methods (based on character n-grams) that are used to identify the language in which a given text
is written, when used for this purpose.
4See (Bobrow et al., 2007) for a similar approach, where an LFG is employed in a question answering
system aiming at high precision.
42 Branco and Costa
On a par with the above lines of research, we are intensively using the grammar to
semi-automatically produce a treebank that contains syntactic representations and se-
mantic descriptions of the sentences in a newspaper corpus. LXGram has also served
in the past to implement and experiment with novel linguistic analyses of interesting
phenomena (self-reference). By making it freely available, we intend to encourage
this sort of experimentation also by other researchers. One can reap important bene-
fits fromcomputationallyimplementinglinguisticanalyses: thedebuggingtoolsallow
for fast checking of correctness; the impact on other analyses that are already imple-
mented can be immediately assessed via regression testing, making it possible to test
the interaction between linguistic analyses for different phenomena; it is possible to

8 Conclusions
In this paper we presented LXGram, a computational grammar for the deep linguistic
processing of Portuguese. LXGram is implemented in a declarative formalism. It
can be used for analysis as well as generation. It produces high precision syntactic
analyses and semantic representations. LXGram supports the two main varieties of
Portuguese: European and Brazilian Portuguese. It is not dependent on a particular
domain or genre.
So far the focus of the implementation was on noun phrases and basic sentence
structure,acoveragethatis beingextendedin ongoingwork. Theoutcomeofdifferent
evaluation experiments shows scores that are in line with those obtained with similar
grammars for other languages.
