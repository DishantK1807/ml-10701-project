frequency,1 following the widely accepted view that the occurrence frequency of an entity correlates with its discourse prominence (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Grosz et al., 1995).
J91-1002 J95-2003
This assumption is not arbitrary — some of these regularities have been recognized in Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and other entity-based theories of discourse.

Work Local coherence has been extensively studied within the modeling framework put forward by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Poesio et al., 2004; Kibble and Power, 2004).

Such a translation is challenging in several respects: one has to specify the “free parameters” of the system (Poesio et al., 2004) and to determine ways of combining the effects of various constraints.

Ordering Text structuring algorithms (Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2004) are commonly evaluated by their performance at information-ordering.
N04-1015 P03-1069 P04-1050
A great deal of research has attempted to translate principles of Centering Theory into a robust coherence metric (Miltsakaki and Kukich, 2000; Hasler, 2004; Karamanis et al., 2004).

This approach has been shown to be highly effective in various tasks ranging from collaborative filtering (Joachims, 2002a) to parsing (Toutanova et al., 2004).

we employ a state-of-the-art noun phrase coreference resolution system (Ng and Cardie, 2002) trained on the MUC (6–7) data sets.

For instance, Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) annotate a corpus of student essays with transition information, and show that the distribution of transitions correlates with human grades.
P00-1052
Karamanis et al.(2004) use a similar methodology to compare coherence metrics with respect to their usefulness for text planning in generation.
P04-1050
We follow Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000) in assuming that our unit of analysis is the traditional sentence (i.e., a main clause with accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses).
P00-1052
We employ a robust statistical parser (Collins, 1997) to determine the constituent structure for each sentence, from which subjects (s), objects (o), and relations other than subject or object (x) are identified.
P97-1003
Not surprisingly, a variety of coherence theories have been developed over the years (e.g., Mann and Thomson, 1988; Grosz et al.1995) and their principles have found application in many symbolic text generation systems (e.g., Scott and de Souza, 1990; Kibble and Power, 2004).
J04-4001 J95-2003
One way to achieve this goal is to cluster entities based on their semantic relatedness, thereby cre147 ating a grid representation over lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
