Following Smadja (1991a) we define precision as the number of correctly found collocations divided by the number of V-N combinations found at all.

Calzolari, Bindi {1990) use MI to extract compounds, fixed expressions and collocations fl'om an Italian corpus, but to our knowledge have not evaluated their results so far.

We have tested the statistical approach Mutual Information (MI), brought up by Church and Hanks (1989) for linguistics, for a (semi)automatic extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from untagged German text corpora.

113, D-72074 Tiibingen breidt~arbuckle.sns.neuphilologie.uni-tuebingen.de Abstract The usefulness of a statistical approach suggested by Church and Hanks (1989) is evaluated for the extraction of verb-noun (V-N) collocations from German text corpora.
P89-1010
As illustrated in the la.,~t paragraph the assumption that a "semantic agent \[...\] is principally used before the verb" and a "'semantic object \[...\] is used after it" as described in Smadja (1991a:180) does not hold for German.

The work described in Smadja and McKeown (1990) and Smadja (1991a.b) is along the same lines as ours, though he uses a different statistical calculation, a z-score, and tagged, lemmatized corpora.
