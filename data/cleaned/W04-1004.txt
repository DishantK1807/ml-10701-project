Paragraph-, word-, and coherence-based approaches to sentence ranking: A comparison of algorithm and human performance Florian Wolf, Edward Gibson Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences fwolf@mit.edu, egibson@mit.edu Abstract Sentence ranking is a crucial part of generating text summaries.
We compared human sentence rankings obtained in a psycholinguistic experiment to three different approaches to sentence ranking: A simple paragraph-based approach intended as a baseline, two word-based approaches, and two coherencebased approaches.
In the paragraph-based approach, sentences in the beginning of paragraphs received higher importance ratings than other sentences.
The word-based approaches determined sentence rankings based on relative word frequencies (Luhn (1958); Salton & Buckley (1988)).
Coherence-based approaches determined sentence rankings based on some property of the coherence structure of a text (Marcu (2000); Page et al.(1998)). Our results suggest poor performance for the simple paragraph-based approach, whereas word-based approaches perform remarkably well.
The best performance was achieved by a coherence-based approach where coherence structures are represented in a non-tree structure.
Most approaches also outperformed the commercially available MSWord summarizer.
