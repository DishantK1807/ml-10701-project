Similarly to its context-free counterpart, the reestimation algorithm can be extended to handle partially parsed corpora (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).
P92-1017
We use the data given by Pereira and Schabes (1992) on raw text and compare with an inferred SLTAG.
P92-1017
lWe attallnle familiarity throughout the paper with TAGs and its lexicallzed variant, See, for instance, (Joehl, 1987), (Schabes, Abeill~, and Joehi, 1988), (Schabes, 1990) or (Joslfi and Schabes, 1~1).

23-28, 1992 set of the Air Travel hfformation System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill, Godfrey, and Doddington, 1990).
H90-1021
As shown in Figure 2, the grannnar converges very rapidly to a lower value of the log probability than the stochastic context-free grammar reported by Pereira and Schabes (1992).
P92-1017
This corpus is of interest since it has been used for infcrring stochastic context-free grammars from partially bracketed corpora (Pereira and Sehabes, 1992).

Evaluation Expdrimentale Nous avons testd l'algorithme de r$estimation sur un corpus artificiel (Figure 1) et aussi sur les sequences de parties du discours (Figure 2) du corpus 'ATIS' (Hemphill, Godfrey, and Doddington, 1990).
H90-1021
The latter property is important as we would like to be able to use bracketing information in the ilLput corpus as in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).
