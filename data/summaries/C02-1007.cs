Our explanation for this is that human associative behavior is governed by the law of association by contiguity, which is well known from psychology (Wettler, Rapp & Ferber, 1993).

Algorithms for the computation of first-order associations have been used in lexicography for the extraction of collocations (Smadja, 1993) and in cognitive psychology for the simulation of associative learning (Wettler & Rapp, 1993).

Other evaluation measures lead to similar good results (Wettler & Rapp, 1993; Rapp, 1996).

More details on these two steps of corpus preprocessing can be found in Rapp (1999).

Let us now compare our results to those obtained using shallow parsing, as previously done by Grefenstette (1993).

Practical implementations of algorithms based on this principle have led to excellent results as documented in papers by Ruge (1992), Grefenstette (1994), Agarwal (1995), Landauer & Dumais (1997), Schütze (1997), and Lin (1998).

Third, it may be useful for determining the type of relationship between words (e.g., synonymy, antonymy, meronymy, hyponymy, etc., see Berland & Charniak, 1999).

However, Dunning (1993) pointed out that for the purpose of corpus statistics, where the sparseness of data is an important issue, it is better to use the log-likelihood ratio.

We propose here the city-block metric, which computes the similarity between two vectors X and Y as the sum of the absolute differences of corresponding vector positions: ∑ = −= n i ii YXs 1 In a number of experiments we compared it to other similarity measures, such as the cosine measure, the Jaccard measure (standard and binary), the Euclidean distance, and the scalar product, and found that the city-block metric yielded good results (see Rapp, 1999).
