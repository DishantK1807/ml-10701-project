The shift-reduce parser described by (Hermjakob, 1997) also requires relatively few training examples but requires semantic features that may require medical knowledge to construct and assign.

To improve efficiency, we use the indexed TBL method outlined by Ramshaw and Marcus (Ramshaw, 1994).

The idea of clustering words based on syntactic features has been well investigated in general language (Pereira, 1993; Li, 1998) However, (Harris, 1991) states that the syntactic relationships are more well-defined and have less variation in scientific languages (sublanguages), such as the ones used in medical texts.

Collins (Collins, 1996) used dependencies as the backbone for his probabilistic parser and there has been work on learning both probabilistic (Carroll, 1992; Lee, 1999; Paskin, 2001) and transformation based dependency grammars (Hajic, 1997).

Keeping in mind our goal of gathering headmodifier pairs for machine learning, a 77% accurate parse is approaching an acceptable parse (Sekine, 1992).
