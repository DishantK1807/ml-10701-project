This contrasts with the distributed class encoding commonly found in neural networks (Schmid, 1994).

Memory-based learning has fruitfully been applied to natural language processing, yielding state-of-theart performance on all levels of linguistic analysis, including grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993), PoStagging (Daelemans et al., 1996), and shallow parsing (Cardie et al., 1999).

Supervised learning methods applied to natural language classification tasks commonly operate on high-level symbolic representations, with linguistic classes that are usually monadic, without internal structure (Daelemans et al., 1996; Cardie et al., 1999; Roth, 1998).

For feature selection-based ECOC, backward sequential feature elimination was used (Raaijmakers, 1999), repeatedly eliminating features in turn and evaluating each elimination step with 10-fold cross-validation.
