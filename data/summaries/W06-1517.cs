This interest is motivated by two observations: First, well-nestedness is interesting as a generalization of projectivity (Marcus, 1967)—while more than 23% of the 73088 dependency structures in the Prague Dependency Treebank of Czech (Hajiˇc et al., 2001) are non-projective, only 0.11% are not well-nested (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006).

In contrast, multi-foot extensions of TAG (Abe, 1988; Hotz and Pitsch, 1996), where a single elementary tree may have more than one foot node, only induce well-nested dependency structures of bounded gap degree.

Since the extensions inherent to MCTAG and CCFG are orthogonal, it is possible to combine them: Multi-Component Multi-Foot TAG (MMTAG) as described by Chiang (2001) allows to simultaneously adjoin sets of trees, where each tree may have multiple foot nodes.

Specifically, parsers for well-nested grammar formalisms are not confronted with the ‘crossing configurations’ that make the universal recognition problem of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems NP-complete (Satta, 1992).
P92-1012
Probably the most prominent multi-foot extension of TAG is Ranked Node Rewriting Grammar (RNRG) (Abe, 1988); however, the properties that we are interested in here can be easier investigated in a notational variant of RNRG, Coupled Context-Free Grammar (Hotz and Pitsch, 1996).
