Approach In past work (Heeman and Allen, 1997; Heeman, 1998), we introduced an alternative formulation for using POS tags in a language model.
W98-1121
(Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1994)) and view the POS tags and word identities as two separate sources of information.
H92-1026
To learn which words behave similarly, Black et al.(1989) and Magerman (1994) used the clustering algorithm of Brown et al.(1992) to build a hierarchical classification tree.
H92-1026 J92-4003
In searching for the best sequence of POS tags for the transcribed words, we follow the technique proposed by Chow and Schwartz (1989) and only keep a small number of alternative paths by pruning the low probability paths after processing each word.
H89-2027
To determine the word classes, one can use the algorithm of Brown et al.(1992), which finds the classes that give high mutual information between the classes of adjacent words.
