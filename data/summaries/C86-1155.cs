However, it is obvious that the problems concerned with 'understanding texts' cannot be avoided for the future development of high quality translation systems, and, in fact, several experimental systems \[Carbonel\] 11.978, 81\] \[Lytinen 1982\] \[Ishizaki 1986\] \[Nomura 1986\] aims to translate texts through understanding them.

The interlingual or pivot approach, which has been repeatedly advocated by researchers originally interested in natural language understanding (NLU) who take machine translation as one possible application \[Muraki 1982, 1986\] \[Lytinen 1982\], instead performs translation through two phases, understanding and paraphrasing.

The transfer approach, originally proposed by GETA \[Vauquois1979\] and adopted by many research and development groups including the MU project, EUROTRA \[King 1981\] \[Johnson 1985\], TAUM \[Kittredge 1976\] \[Isabelle 1985\], METAL \[S\]ocum 1982\] \[Bennet 1985\], PAHO-ENGSPA \[Vasconcellos 1985\], ASCOF\[Biewer 1985\] etc., is an approach in which translation is carried out essentially in three phases: analysis, transfer and generation.

Japanese embedded 655 clauses should be translated into many other syntactic constructions such as (preposition + --ing\] forms of phrases which modify nouns, appositional phrases introduced by 'that', etc., depending on the semantic relationships between the modifying clauses (embedded clauses) and the modified noun \[Nagao 1984, 1986\].

\[Boitet 1984\] shows how factual knowledge in a specific subject field can be utilized to resolve certain syntactic ambiguities such as those of the scope of coordinations, determination of antecedents of relatJ w~ clauses and pronouns, etc.

In fact, while several large and practical MT systems, including some commercially available, have been developed in Japan based on different approaches such as the 'Pivot approach' \[Muraki 1985\], 'Conceptual Transfer Approach' \[Uchida 1980, 1985\] \[Amano 1985\], 'Integrated Approach' \[Tanaka 1983\], each of which puts emphasis on different aspects of translation processes, especially on aspects of 'understanding', when one closely examines the internal translation processes and what kinds of information are utilized in these systems, one in fact finds many similarities and fewer differences than one might have expected.

The experience of PAIIO-SPANAM \[Vasconcellos 1985\] shows, for example, in the translation from Spanish to English, that translation results sufficient for native speakers of English to correct translation errors can be obtained even without having a separate phase (the analysis phase) of obtaining explicit representations of the syntactic structures of source sentences.

We will also list some of the key problems, both linguistic and computational, which we encountered during the development of our MT systems, the Mu systems \[Nagao \]984, 85, 86\] \[Tsujii 1984, 85\] \[Nakamura 1984, 86 \] \[Sakamoto 1984\], and whose resolutions we consider to be of essential importance for future MT research and development.

In order to prevent the proliferation of possible syntactic interpretation in MT, we need a certain number of disambiguation rules which are also heuristic based \[Tsujii 1984\].
P84-1057
\[Boitet 1984\] notes this point as 'grafting on expert systems ' . In addition to this, the boundary between terminological terms and ordinary words is not so clear.

Several current MT systems prepare certain frameworks for treating such conventions of term translations specific to individual subject field~: such as the field code in the MU systems \[Sakamoto \]984\], the micro-glossaries in PAHO's systems \[Vasconcellos 1985\], hierarchical organizations of dictionaries in GETA's systems \[Boitet 1982\], etc.

Though Kay's notation in unification grammar \[Kay 1984\] is obviuosly one of the candidate frameworks, it is appropriate only for describing interpretations which have already determined by the analysis phase.
