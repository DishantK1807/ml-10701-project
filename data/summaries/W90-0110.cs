Forward and backward shifts correspond to introducing the consequence or preparatory phases of events \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\].

This purely RST-based approach was improved upon by Hovy and McCoy \[1989\] by incorporating Focus Trees \[McCoy and Cheng, 1988\] to guide the ordering and interrelationships of sentence topics.

States include relations that hold between agents or entities (e.g., possession, ownership) \[Nakhimovsky, 1988\].

Instead, this paper argues that at least three distinct attentional constraints are required: discourse focus \[Sidner, 1979, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986\], temporal focus \[Webber, 1988\], and a novel notion of spatial focus.

Discourse Focus, Temporal Focus, and Spatial Focus Like Hovy \[1988\], TEXPLAN uses a hierarchical planner to select, structure, and order propositional content using a library of plan operators (detailed in a subsequent section).

Hovy's \[1988\] "structurer" uses his sequence RST operator to produce the following narration of events in a naval domain (where C4 indicates a condition or level of operational readiness): Knox, which is C4, is en route to Sasebo.

Only Hovy's \[1988\] implementation of RST has examined the task of conveying events and states.

Nakhimovsky \[1988\] classifies local TF shifts as: forward, sideways, and backward "micromoves".
J88-2004
This is accomplished by representing each communicative act (either a rhetorical act or a speech act) as an operator in a library of plans which are reasoned about by a hierarchical text planner \[Sacerdoti, 1977\] similar to that used by Hovy \[1988\] and 1Surface to Air Missile 73 \[Moore, 1989\].

Processes, in contrast to states, involve changes or transformations over the interval for which they hold and often have some associated rate of progress toward a goal or a rate of consumption of resources \[Nakhimovsky, 1988\].

This is analogous to Kittredge's et al.\[1986\] weather reports which indicate warnings first and then WINDS > CLOUD-COVER > PRECIPITATION > FOG&MIST > VISIBILITY.

A collection of related events and states constitutes an event/state network analogous to Webber's \[1987\] event/situation structure.
