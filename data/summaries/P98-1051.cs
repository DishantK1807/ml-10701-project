For comparison with other experiments, refer to Resnik (1997).

Resources We decided to take advantage of the syntactic structures already contained in the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) (Mitchell et al., 1995) in order to build a large set of functional relation pairs (much as in Resnik (1997)).

Dini et al.(1998a)). 5 Towards SENSEVAL As mentioned above, the present system will be adopted in the context of the SENSEVAL project, where we will adopt the Xerox Incremental Finite State Parser, which is completely based on finite state technology.

5The search space of the algorithm is parametrised setting two different thresholds governing the possibility and in Dini et al.(1998a), as "paper", "original" and "goodlog".

For instance, the fragment you do something to the economy, after some intermediate steps which are described in Dini et al.(1998a) and Dini et al.(1998b), is transformed into: HASOBJ do something HASSBJ do you PREPMOD do TO economy 2.2 Adding Lexical Semantics.

Indeed, if we compare the "Adjusted" measure we obtained with a set of about 500 rules (50% precision), with the average reported by Resnik (1997) (41Â°~ precision), we obtain an advantage of 10 points, which, for a task suchas WSD, is noteworthy.

On an absolute basis, our results improve on those of Resnik (1997).

In our experiment, like ill Resnik (1997), we used both functional and semantic information in order to improve the learning capabilities of the system.
