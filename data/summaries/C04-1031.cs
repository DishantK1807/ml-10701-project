Another alignment strategy is a refined combination of link sets (ˆLR = {ˆLD ∩ ˆLI} ∪ {LR1,...,LRr }) as suggested by (Och and Ney, 2000b).

In other approaches complex expressions are identified in a pre-processing step in order to handle them as complex units in the same manner as single words in alignment (Smadja et al., 1996; Ahrenberg et al., 1998; Tiedemann, 1999).

Three different clue types are used for the alignment: the Dice coefficient (dice), lexical translation probabilities derived from statistical translation models (giza) using the GIZA++ toolbox (Och and Ney, 2003), and, finally, POS/relative-wordposition-clues learned from previous alignments (pp).

Alternative measures for the evaluation of one-to-one word links have been proposed in (Och and Ney, 2000a; Och and Ney, 2003).

In some approaches such relations are constructed in form of an exhaustive set of links between all word pairs included in both expressions (Melamed, 1998; Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

Furthermore, we do not split MWU links as proposed by (Och and Ney, 2000a).

In (Tiedemann, 2003) an adjacency check is suggested, i.e. overlapping links are accepted only if they are adjacent to other links in one and only one existing link cluster.
