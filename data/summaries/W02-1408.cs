However, few of them deal with term clustering: Maynard and Ananiadou (2000) present a method that uses manually defined semantic frames for specific classes, Hatzivassiloglou et al.(2001) use machine learning techniques to disambiguate names of proteins, genes and RNAs, while Friedman et al.(2001) describe extraction of specific molecular pathways from journal articles.

Ushioda (1996)), or syntactic information derived from corpora (e.g.
C96-2212
Some of these patterns have been previously used to discover hyponym relations between words (Hearst (1992)).
C92-2082
Some methods (Bourigault (1992), Ananiadou (1994)) rely purely on linguistic information, namely morpho-syntactic features of term candidates.
C92-3150 C94-2167
In order to discover new knowledge, one has to identify main concepts, which are linguistically represented by domain specific terms (Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)).

The ATC method is based on the Ushiodaï¿½s AMI (Average Mutual Information) hierarchical clustering method (Ushioda (1996)).

For example, some approaches consider only terms that appear in a close proximity to each other (Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)), while in other approaches, grammatical roles such as object or subject are taken into account (Grefenstette (1994)).

For example, Mima et al.(2002) introduce TIMS, a terminology-based knowledge acquisition system, which integrates automatic term recognition, term variation management, contextbased automatic term clustering, ontology-based inference, and intelligent tag information retrieval.
C02-1083
The notion of term similarity has been defined and considered in different ways: terms can have functional and/or structural similarities, though they can be correlated by different relationships (Grefenstette (1994), Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)).
C00-1077
Further, some of the syntactic categories can be removed from the context patterns, as not all syntactic categories are equally significant in providing useful contextual information (Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)).
