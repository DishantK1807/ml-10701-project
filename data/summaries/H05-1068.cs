PSF Hierarchy The third task is taken from Breck and Cardie (2004).
C04-1018
We use the same problem formulation as Soon et al.(2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002) â€” a combination of classification and clustering.
J01-4004 P02-1014
Special Metrics: Rather than focusing on performance at the pairwise coreference classification level, performance for this task is typically reported using either the MUC metric (Vilain et al., 1995) or the BCUBED metric (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).
M95-1005
Special Metrics: Breck and Cardie (2004) measure task performance with three metrics.
C04-1018
Instance selection (Soon et al., 2001; Ng, 2004) is used to increase the percentage of positive instances in the training set.3 We use the learning features described by Ng and Cardie (2002).
J01-4004 P02-1014
Data Set: We use the same data set and features as Breck and Cardie (2004).
C04-1018
Additionally, the rule learner, SVM, and LR are also trained with a hand-selected subset of the features that Ng and Cardie (2002) find to outperform the full feature set.
