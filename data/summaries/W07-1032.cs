A good deal of work has been done toward the automatic acquisition of rules, morphemes, and analyses of words from large corpora (Freitag, 2005; Jacquemin, 1997; Monson, 2004; Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Wicentowski, 2004; Xu and Croft, 1998; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).

Contextual similarity has been studied and applied in morphology (Jacquemin, 1997; Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Xu and Croft, 1998; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000) and more generally (Means and others, 2004).
