The kernel function we explored in our experiments was the polynomial function k(xi;xj) = (xi ¢xj + 1)d for d = 2 which was found to be the best by (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002).

Following on from previous studies in named entity we chose a set of linguistically motivated wordlevel features that include surface word forms, part of speech tags using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1992) and orthographic features.

Additionally we used head-noun features that were obtained from preanalysis of the training data set using the FDG shallow parser from Conexor (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997).

Recent studies into the use of supervised learningbased models for the named entity task have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1997), and decision trees (Sekine et al., 1998), and maximum entropy (Borthwick et al., 1998) are much more generalisable and adaptable to new classes of words than systems based on hand-built patterns (including wrappers) and domain specific heuristic rules such as (Herzig and Johns, 1997).
