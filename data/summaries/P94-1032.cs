The methodology is a simple version of Garside and Leech's probabilistic parser (1985).

Some researchers apply shallow or partial parsers (Smadja, 1991; Hindle, 1990) to acquiring specific patterns from texts.

2. Previous Works Church (1988) proposes a part of speech tagger and a simple noun phrase extractor.

As the result, we conclude that if we do not resolve PPattachment problem (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to the expected extent, we will not extract the maximal noun phrases.

The work executed by Voutilainen (1993) is more complex than our work.

Bourigault's work (1992) is evaluated manually, and dose not report the precision.

In contrast, Church (1988) tests a text and extracts the simple noun phrases only.
