At this time there exist full-size lexical transducers for at least five languages: English and French (Xerox DDS), German (Lingsoft), Korean (Hyuk-Chul Kwon, see Kwon and Karttunen 1994), and Turkish (Kemal Oflazer).

INTRODUCTION A lexical transducer, first discussed in Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen 1992, is a specialised finite-state automaton that maps inflected surface forms to lexical forms, and vice versa.

Because finite-state transducers are bidirectional, the same transducer can be used for analysis (veut ~ vouloir +IndP+SG+P3) The standard way of constructing lexical transducers, as described in Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen 1994, consists of (1) a finite-state source lexicon that defines the set of valid lexical forms of the language (possibly infinite), and (2) a set of finitestate rules that assign the proper surface realisation to all lexical forms and morphological categories of the language.

This special case of the algorithm was discovered independently by Pasi Tapanainen (Tapanainen, 1991; Koskenniemi, Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1992) as an efficient way to apply finite-state constraints for syntactic disambiguation.

Both of these features have been implemented in the Xerox authoring tools (Karttunen and Beesley 1992, Karttunen 1993) for lexical transducers.
