Although the degree of out-performance by Rep(., LLR) is not seemingly large, this is a promising result because it has been pointed out that, in the related domains of term extraction, existing measures hardly outperform even the use of frequency (for example, Daille et al.1994, Caraballo et al.1999) when we use this type of comparison based on the accumulated numbers.

Caraballo et al.(1999) tried to define a measure for "specificity" of a noun by using co-occurrence intbrmation of a noun, but it was not very successful in the sense that the measure did not particularly outperformed the term frequency.
