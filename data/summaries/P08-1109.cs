Unlexicalized parsers, on the other hand, achieved accuracies almost equivalent to those of lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).

In previous research on natural language processing, many methodologies for extracting various relations from corpora have been developed, such as the ?is-a??relation (Hearst 1992), ?part-of??relation (Berland and Charniak 1999), causal relation (Girju 2003), and entailment relation (Geffet and Dagan 2005).
