The first phase of our system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) separates adjectives into groups of semantically related ones.

Finally, knowledge of polarity can be combined with corpus-based collocation extraction methods (Smadja, 1993) to automatically produce entries for the lexical functions used in MeaningText Theory (Mel'~uk and Pertsov, 1987) for text generation.

The Deese antonyms (Deese, 1964) is the prototypical collection of pairs of antonymous adjectives that have been used for similar analyses in the past (Deese, 1964; Justeson and Katz, 1991; Grefenstette, 1992).

An automatic method for extracting polarity information would also be useful for the augmentation of lexico-semantic databases such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), particularly when the method accounts for the specificities of the domain sublanguage; an increasing number of NLP systems rely on such databases (e.g., (Resnik, 1993; Knight and Luk, 1994)).
