Since we are particularly interested in the correlations and co-occurrences of features on diﬀerent linguistic levels that can be interpreted as indicators of the abstract IS categories, we needed an annotation scheme to be as theoryneutral as possible: It should allow for a description of the phenomena, from which ’any’ theoryspecific explanatory mechanisms can subsequently be derived (Skut et al., 1997).

The MULI corpus consists of extracts from the Tiger treebank for German (Brants et al., to appear) 1 and the Penn treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1994) 2.Itcomprises 250 sentences in German (app.

Another possibility to explore is the to integrate MULI annotation with, e.g., the SALSA corpus (Erk et al., 2003), which provides more detailed semantico-pragmatic information in the style of FrameNet.

(See (Skut et al., 1997) for related methodology pertaining to syntactic treebanks.) The MULI corpus facilitates linguistic investigation of how phenomena at diﬀerent annotation levels interact.
