The major conclusion that seems to arise from our experiments is the effectiveness of combining a knowledge based thesaurus such as WordNet with distributional statistical information such as (Lin, 1998), overcoming the known deficiencies of each method alone.

In fact, it has been shown that prominence in similarity score corresponds to sense frequency, which was suggested as the basis for an unsupervised method for identifying the most frequent sense of a word (McCarthy et al., 2004).

To estimate such likelihood, our first measure is based on sense frequencies from SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), a corpus annotated with Wordnet senses.
