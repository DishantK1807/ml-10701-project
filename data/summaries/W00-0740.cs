Osborne (1999) argues (correctly) that the hypothesis space of grammars is sufficiently large that some form of bias is required.

In NLP, Mellish (1989) presents a method for repairing failed parses in a relatively efficient way based on the fact that, after a failed parse, the information in the chart is sufficient for us to be able to determine what constituents would have allowed the parse to go through if they had been found.

Giving the increasing sophistication of probabilistic linguistic models (for example, Collins (1997) has a statistical approach to learning gap-threading rules) a probabilistic extension of our work is attractive--it will be interesting to see how far an integration of 'logical' and statistical can go.

Asker et al.(1992) also describe a method for inducing new lexical entries when extending 191 coverage of a unification grammar to a new domain, a task which is also related to our work in that they are using a full unification formalism and using partial analyses to constrain hypotheses.

In (Osborne, 1999), the DCG is mapped to a SCFG to compute probabilities, in very recent work a stochastic attribute-value grammar is used (Osborne, 2000).
