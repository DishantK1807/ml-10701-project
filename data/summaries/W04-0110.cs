Previous research (Rytting, 2004) examined the role of utterance-final information in Greek, and found that this cue performs better than chance on its own.

Belz (1998), where the actual FSM structure (including classes of phonemes that could be group onto one arc) was learned, here the structure of each FSM is determined in advance.

Finite-state techniques, used by e.g., Belz (1998) in modeling phonotactic constraints and syllable within various languages, provide one straightforward way to formulate some of these comparisons, and may be useful in future testing of multiple cues.

However, Rytting (2004) showed that this extra context, while certainly helpful, is not strictly necessary in the Greek corpus under question.

Previous research (Rytting, 2004) examined the role of utterance-boundary information in Modern Greek, implementing a variant of Aslin and colleaguesâ€™ (1996) model within a finite-state framework.
