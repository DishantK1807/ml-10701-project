According to the definitions of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems given in Weir (1988), (including CFGs, Tree Adjoining Grammars, Head Grammars, Linear Indexed Grammars, Combinatory Categorial Grammars, and Multiple Component TAGs) any LCFRS contains a set of nonterminals.

The weak equivalence of TAGs, a modified version of Head Grammars and Linear Indexed Grammars has been shown in Vijayashanker (1988), while the weak equivalence of these three formalisms and Combinatory Categorial Grammars has been shown in Weir (1988) and Weir and Joshi (1988).

a formalism might be of the type similar to an augmented version of Combinatory Categorial Grammar as proposed by Steedman (1985) and discussed in Weir (1988, pp.
