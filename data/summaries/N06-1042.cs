Early work on Turkish used a constraint-based approach with hand crafted rules (Oflazer and Kurucurrency1oz, 1994).

In the statistical approach a hand tagged corpus is used to train a probabilistic model which is then used to select the best tags in unseen text (Church, 1988; Hakkani-Tcurrency1ur et al., 2002).
A88-1019
In the 329 rule-based approach a large number of hand crafted rules are used to select the correct morphological parse or POS tag of a given word in a given context (Karlsson et al., 1995; Oflazer and Tcurrency1ur, 1997).

Previous work on morphological disambiguation of in ectional or agglutinative languages include unsupervised learning for of Hebrew (Levinger et al., 1995), maximum entropy modeling for Czech (Haji c and HladkÂ·a, 1998), combination of statistical and rule-based disambiguation methods for Basque (Ezeiza et al., 1998), transformation based tagging for Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999).

It is also possible to train statistical models using unlabeled data with the expectation maximization algorithm (Cutting et al., 1992).
A92-1018
Even though the number of potential tags is unlimited, the number of morphological features is small: The Turkish morphological analyzer we use (Oflazer, 1994) produces tags that consist of 126 unique features.

Examples of statistical and machine learning approaches that have been used for tagging include transformation based learning (Brill, 1995), memory based learning (Daelemans et al., 1996), and maximum entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
