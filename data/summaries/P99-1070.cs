We are concerned here with probabilistic shift-reduce parsing models that define probability distributions over word sequences, and in particular the model of Chelba and Jelinek (1998).

The second approach (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) defines the probability of a parse tree as the probability that a certain shiftreduce stochastic parsing automaton outputs that tree.

Most other probabilistic shiftreduce parsing models (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Black et al., 1992; Magerman, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1997) give only the conditional probability of a parse tree given a word sequence.
