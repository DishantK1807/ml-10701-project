In work on generation preferences (in the sense of rankings of structures) are less clearly identifiable since such rankings tend to be contained implicitly in strategies for the larger problem of deciding what to say (but see \[Mann and Moore, 1981\] and \[Reiter, 1990\].)i Algorithm 1 is similar in spirit to the "all possibilities plus constraints" strategy that is common in principle-based approaches (see \[Epstein, 1988\])i, but it differs from them in that it imposes a preference ordering on interpretations, rather than rest'ricting the set O f legal interpretations to begin With.

algorithm is profligate in that it generates all possible orderings of quantifiers, many of which do not correspond to legal scopings (see \[Hobbs and Shieber, 1987\]).

116 5 Discussion Related Work: There is an enormous amount of work on preferences for understanding, e.g., \[Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner, 1990\], \[Jensen and Binot, 1988\], \[Grosz, Appelt, Martin, and Pereira, 1987\] for a few recent examples.

Instead, we will take the anaphora resolution algorithm from \[Rich and Luperfoy, 1988\], \[Luperfoy and Rich, 1991\] and show how it can be viewed as an implementation of a Complex Preference, allowing for a more efficient implementation.

ALGORITHM 1 e A wide variety of NLP algorithms can be implemented in this manner, particularly such recent reversible generation algorithms as \[Shieber, van Noord, Moore, and Pereira, 1989\] and \[Calder, Reape, and Zeevat, 1989\].
