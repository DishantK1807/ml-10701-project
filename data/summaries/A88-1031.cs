Even simpler models have employed allomorphic segmentation; morphosyntax may be approximated by a longest-match heuristic \[Pounder and Kommenda, 1986\] or defined by a finite-state grammar \[Bennett and Slocum, 1985\].

In order to elucidate morphosyntax, some approaches use a simple (e.g., two-level, or similar) model to account for orthographic behavior, and a "grammar of words" to analyze morpheme sequences syntactically (e.g., \[Bear, 1986\], \[Russell et al., 1986\]).
