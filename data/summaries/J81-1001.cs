The structure of tasks and the structure of dialogs have been discussed elsewhere (Grimes, 1980; Grosz, 1977a, 1977b, 1978; Hobbs, 1978; Reichman, 1978; Sacerdoti, 1977; Sidner, 1979; Wilensky, 1978).
T78-1013
The degree of focusing, which influences the choice of anaphora or a definite noun phrase to refer to some entity in communicated knowledge, has been discussed elsewhere (Sidner, 1979; Grosz, 1977b; Reichman, 1978).
T78-1013
We have developed a representation for discourse focusing (or global focusing), procedures for using it in identifying objects referred to by noun phrases, and procedures for detecting and representing shifts in focusing (Grosz, 1977a, 1977b, 1978, 1980).
T78-1013
Although considerable attention has been given to the latter (Donellan, 1977; Grosz, 1977a, 1977b; Sidner, 1979; Webber, 1978), little has been done with the former.
T78-1013
It builds directly on the concepts of global and immediate focusing, through which certain entities are highlighted (Grosz, 1977a, 1977b, 1978; Sidner, 1979).
