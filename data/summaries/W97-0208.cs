This approach has been recently used by (McRoy, 1992) and (Mahesh and Beale, 1996).

Recent work has been done using collocations as semantic disambiguators, (Yarowsky, 1993), (Dorr, 1996), particularly for verbs.

We are implementing a simple algorithm which prefers close senses in our domain hierarchy which was derived from LDOCE (Bruce and Guthrie, 1992).

The best examples of this approach has been the resent work of Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1992), (Yarowsky, 1993), (Yarowsky, 1995).

Recent examples of this work include (Bruce and Guthrie, 1992), (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), (McRoy, 1992).

codes (Thesaural categories) Pragmatic domain codes can be used to disambiguate (usually nominal) senses, as was shown by (Bruce and Guthrie, 1992) and (Yarowsky, 1992).

These approaches are not mutually exclusive and there are, of course, some hybrid cases, for example Luk (Luk, 1995) uses information in MRD definitions (approach 1) and statistical information from untagged corpora (approach 2b).

These figures should be compared to 72% correct homograph assignment and 47% correct sense assignment using simulated annealing alone on the same test set (see (Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie, 1992)).

(Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992), (Yarowsky, 1993), (Schfitze, 1992)) and our system is a true tagging algorithm, operating on free text.

Simmulated annealing, a numerical optimisation algorithm, was used to make this process practical (Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthri~, 1992), choosing an assignment of senses from as many as 10 lÂ° choices.
C92-1056
We propose a tagger that makes use of several types of information (dictionary definitions, parts-of-speech, domain codes, selectional preferences and collocates) in the tradition of McRoy (McRoy, 1992) although, the information sources we use are orthogonal, unlike the sources she used, making it easier to evaluate the performance of the various modules.
J92-1001
Much of the research in this area has been compromised by the fact that researchers have focussed on lexical ambiguities that are not true word sense distinctions, such as words translated differently across two languages (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992) or homophones ~ (Yarowsky, 1993).

2. The text is tagged using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1992) and a translation is carried out using a manually defined mapping from the syntactic tags assigned by Briil (Penn Tree Bank tags (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993)) onto the simpler part-of-speech categories associated with LDOCE senses.
