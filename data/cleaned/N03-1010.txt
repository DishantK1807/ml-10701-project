Greedy Decoding for Statistical Machine Translation in Almost Linear Time Ulrich Germann USC Information Sciences Institute Marina del Rey, CA germann@isi.edu Abstract We present improvements to a greedy decoding algorithm for statistical machine translation that reduce its time complexity from at least cubic (a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7 when applied na¨ıvely) to practically linear time1 without sacrificing translation quality.
We achieve this by integrating hypothesis evaluation into hypothesis creation, tiling improvements over the translation hypothesis at the end of each search iteration, and by imposing restrictions on the amount of word reordering during decoding.
1 Introduction
Most of the current work in statistical machine translation builds on word replacement models developed at IBM in the early 1990s (Brown et al., 1990, 1993; Berger et al., 1994, 1996).
Based on the conventions established in Brown et al.(1993), these models are commonly referred to as the (IBM) Models 1-5.
One of the big challenges in building actual MT systems within this framework is that of decoding: finding the translation candidate a9 that maximizes the translation probability a10 a1 a9a12a11 a13 a7 for the given input a13. Knight (1999) has shown the problem to be NP-complete.
Due to the complexity of the task, practical MT systems usually do not employ optimal decoders (that is, decoders that are guaranteed to find an optimal solution within the constraints of the framework), but rely on approximative algorithms instead.
Empirical evidence suggests that such algorithms can perform resonably well.
For example, Berger et al.(1994), attribute only 5% of the translation errors of their Candide system, which uses 1Technically, the complexity is still a14a16a15a18a17a20a19a22a21 . However, the quadratic component has such a small coefficient that it does not have any noticable effect on the translation speed for all reasonable inputs.
a restricted stack search, to search errors.
Using the same evaluation metric (but different evaluation data), Wang and Waibel (1997) report search error rates of 7.9% and 9.3%, respectively, for their decoders.
Och et al.(2001) and Germann et al.(2001) both implemented optimal decoders and benchmarked approximative algorithms against them.
Och et al.report word error rates of 68.68% for optimal search (based on a variant of the A* algorithm), and 69.65% for the most restricted version of a decoder that combines dynamic programming with a beam search (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).
Germann et al.(2001) compare translations obtained by a multi-stack decoder and a greedy hill-climbing algorithm against those produced by an optimal integer programming decoder that treats decoding as a variant of the traveling-salesman problem (cf.
Knight, 1999).
Their overall performance metric is the sentence error rate (SER).
For decoding with IBM Model 3, they report SERs of about 57% (6-word sentences) and 76% (8-word sentences) for optimal decoding, 58% and 75% for stack decoding, and 60% and 75% for greedy decoding, which is the focus of this paper.
All these numbers suggest that approximative algorithms are a feasible choice for practical applications.
The purpose of this paper is to describe speed improvements to the greedy decoder mentioned above.
While acceptably fast for the kind of evaluation used in Germann et al.(2001), namely sentences of up to 20 words, its speed becomes an issue for more realistic applications.
Brute force translation of the 100 short news articles in Chinese from the TIDES MT evaluation in June 2002 (878 segments; ca.
25k tokens) requires, without any of the improvements described in this paper, over 440 CPU hours, using the simpler, “faster” algorithm a23a2a24 (described below).
We will show that this time can be reduced to ca.
40 minutes without sacrificing translation quality.
In the following, we first describe the underlying IBM initial string: I do not understand the logic of these people . pick fertilities: I not not understand the logic of these people . replace words: Je ne pas comprends la logique de ces gens . reorder: Je ne comprends pas la logique de ces gens . insert spurious words: Je ne comprends pas la logique de ces gens -l`a .

model(s) of machine translation (Section 2) and our hillclimbing algorithm (Section 3).
In Section 4, we discuss improvements to the algorithm and its implementation, and the effect of restrictions on word reordering.
2 The
IBM Translation Models Brown et al.(1993) and Berger et al.(1994, 1996) view the problem of translation as that of decoding a message that has been distorted in a noisy channel.
Exploiting Bayes’ theorem a0 a1 a9 a11 a13 a7a2a1 a0 a1 a13 a7a4a3 a0 a1 a13 a11a9 a7a5a1 a0 a1 a9 a7 (1) they recast the problem of finding the best translation a6a9 for a given input a13 as a6a9 a3a8a7a10a9a12a11a14a13a15a7a17a16 a18 a10 a1 a13 a11a9 a7a5a1 a10 a1 a9 a7 (2) a10 a1 a13 a7 is constant for any given input and can therefore be ignored.
a10 a1 a9 a7 is typically calculated using an n-gram language model.
For the sake of simplicity, we assume here and everywhere else in the paper that the ultimate task is to translate from a foreign language into English.
The model pictures the conversion from English to a foreign language roughly as follows (cf.
Fig. 1; note that because of the noisy channel approach, the modeling is “backwards”).
a19 For each English word a9a17a20, a fertility a3 a20 (with a3 a20a22a21a24a23a26a25 ) is chosen.
a3 a20 is called the fertility of a9 a20 . a19 Each word a9 a20 is replaced by a3 a20 foreign words.
a19 After that, the linear order of the foreign words is rearranged.
a19 Finally, a certain number a3 a25 of so-called spurious words (words that have no counterpart in the original English) are inserted into the foreign text.
The probability of the value of a3 a25 depends on the length a27 of the original English string.
As a result, each foreign word is linked, by virtue of the derivation history, to either nothing (the imaginary NULL word), or exactly one word of the English source sentence.
The triple a28 a29 a3 a30a32a31a34a33a36a35a37a33a39a38a41a40 with a31 a29 a3 a30 a23a43a42a45a44a46a44 a33 a9a10a47 a33a49a48a50a48a50a48a50a33 a9 a20 a40, a35 a29 a3a51a30 a13a52a47 a33a50a48a49a48a50a48a53a33 a13a10a54 a40, and a38 a29a45a55 a24 a33a50a48a50a48a49a48a56a33a12a57a59a58a61a60 a55a63a62 a33 a24 a33a50a48a50a48a49a48a56a33a65a64a12a58 is called a sentence alignment.
For all pairs a30a66a64a24a33a24a57a41a40 such that a38 a1a22a57 a7a26a3a67a64, we say that a9 a20 is aligned with a13a10a54, and a13a52a54 with a9 a20, respectively.
Since each of the changes occurs with a certain probability, we can calculate the translation model probability of a28 as the product of the individual probabilities of each of the changes.
The product of the translation model probability and the language model probability of a31 is called the alignment probability of a28 . Detailed formulas for the calculation of alignment probabilities according to the various models can be found in Brown et al.(1993). It should be noted here that the calculation of the alignment probability of an entire alignment (a31a69a68a24a70a72a71a12a73a75a74a24a70 ) has linear complexity.
Well will show below that by re-evaluating only fractions of an alignment (a31a69a70a72a71a12a76a77a74a24a70 ), we can reduce the evaluation cost to a constant time factor.
3 Decoding
3.1 Decoding Algorithm The task of the decoder is to revert the process just described.
In this subsection we recapitulate the greedy hillclimbing algorithm presented in Germann et al.(2001). In contrast to all other decoders mentioned in Sec.
1, this algorithm does not process the input one word at a time to incrementally build up a full translation hypothesis.
Instead, it starts out with a complete gloss of the input sentence, aligning each input word a13 with the word a9 that maximizes the inverse (with respect to the noisy channel approach) translation probability a78 a1 a9 a11a13 a7 . (Note that for the calculation of the alignment probability, a78 a1 a13 a11a9 a7 is used.) The decoder then systematically tries out various types of changes to the alignment: changing the translation of a word, inserting extra words, reordering words, etc.
These change operations are described in more detail below.
In each search iteration, the algorithm makes a complete pass over the alignment, evaluating all possible changes.
The simpler, “faster” version a23a2a24 of the algorithm considers only one operation at a time.
A more thorough variant a23a1a0 applies up to two word translation changes, or inserts one zero fertility word in addition to a word translation change before the effect of these changes is evaluated.
At the end of the iteration, the decoder permanently applies that change, or, in the case of a23a1a0, change combination, that leads to the biggest improvement in alignment probability, and then starts the next iteration.
This cycle is repeated until no more improvements can be found.
The changes to the alignment that the decoder considers are as follows.
CHANGE the translation of a word: For a given foreign word a13, change the English word a9 that is aligned with a13 . If a9 has a fertility of 1, replace it with the new word a9a3a2 ; if it has a fertility of more than one, insert the new word a9a3a2 in the position that optimizes the alignment probability.
The list of candidates for a9a4a2 is derived from the inverse translation table (a78 a1 a9a12a11 a13 a7 ).
Typically, the top ten words on that list are considered, that is, for an input of length a3, a24a49a62 a3 possible change operations are evaluated during each CHANGE iteration.
In theory, a single CHANGE iteration in a23a2a24 has a complexity of a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a7 : for each word a13, there is a certain probability that changing the word translation of a13 requires a pass over the complete English hypothesis in order to find the best insertion point.
This is the case when a13 is currently either spurious (that is, aligned with the NULL word), or aligned with a word with a fertility of more than one.
The probability of this happening, however, is fairly small, so that we can assume for all practical purposes that a CHANGE iteration in a23a2a24 has a complexity of a0a2a1 a3 a7 . Since a23a1a0 allows up to two CHANGE operations at a time, the respective complexities for a23a1a0 are a0a2a1 a3a8a7 a7 in theory and a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a7 in practice.
We will argue below that by exploiting the notion of change dependencies, the complexity for CHANGE can be reduced to practically a0a2a1 a3 a7 for a23a1a0 decoding as well, albeit with a fairly large coefficient.
INSERT a so-called zero fertility word (i.e., an English word that is not aligned to any foreign word) into the English string.
Since all possible positions in the English hypothesis have to be considered, a9 a23a11a10 a31a1a12a14a13 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7, assuming a linear correlation between input length and hypothesis length.
ERASE a zero fertility word.
a31a15a12 a28a14a10 a31 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7 . JOIN two English words.
This is an asymmetrical operation: one word, a9a4a16 a74a18a17 a18a20a19, stays where it is, the other one, a9 a19 a71a36a71a22a21 a18a20a19, is removed from the English hypothesis.
All foreign words originally aligned with a9 a19 a71a36a71a22a21 a18a20a19 are then aligned with a9 a16 a74a18a17 a18a20a19 . Even though a JOIN iteration has a complexity of a0a2a1 a3a6a5 a7,2 empirical data indicates that its actual time consumption is very small (cf.
Fig. 6).
This is because the chances of success of a join operation can be determined very cheaply without actually performing the operation.
Suppose for the sake of simplicity that a9 a19 a71a12a71a23a21 a18a20a19 is aligned with only one word a13 . If the translation probability a78 a1 a13 a11a9 a16 a74a18a17 a18a20a19 a7 is zero (which is true most of the time), the resulting alignment probability will be zero.
Therefore, we can safely skip such operations.
SWAP any two non-overlapping regions a9 a20 a48a50a48a49a48 a9a17a54 and a9 a70 a48a50a48a50a48 a9 a21 in the English string.
The number of possible swap operations in a string of length a3 is a24a26a25 a47 a27 a74a18a28 a47 a24a26a25 a47 a27 a73a29a28 a74 a1a4a3a31a30a33a32 a7 a1a4a3a34a30a35a32a37a36 a24 a7 a0 a3 a3 a1a4a3a6a5a38a30 a24 a7 a1a4a3a39a36 a0 a7 a0a4a40 Thus, a10a42a41 a28 a0a44a43 a24a4a45a24a18 a16a47a46 a45 a20 a76 a46 a18a23a19 a3 a0a2a1 a3a48a7 a7 . However, if we limit the size of the swapped regions to a constant a49 and their distance to a constant a50, we can reduce the number of swaps performed to a linear function of the input length.
For each start position (defined as the first word of the first swap region), there are at most a50a26a49 a5 swaps that can be performed within these limitations.
Therefore, a10a42a41 a28 a0 a45a24a18 a16a47a46 a45 a20 a76 a46 a18a20a19 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7 . It is obvious that the baseline version of this algorithm is very inefficient.
In the following subsection, we discuss the algorithm’s complexity in more detail.
In Sec.
4, we show how the decoding complexity can be reduced.
3.2 Decoding
Complexity The total decoding complexity of the search algorithm is the number of search iterations (I) times the number of search steps per search iteration (S) times the evaluation cost per search step (E): a23a2a24 a3 a31 a1 a10 a1 a9 a48 We now show that the original implementation of the algorithm has a complexity of (practically) a0a2a1a4a3a52a51 a7 for a23a2a24 decoding, and a0a2a1 a3 a7 a7 for a23a1a0 decoding, if swap operations are restricted.
With unrestricted swapping, the complexity is a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a7 . Since our argument is based on some assumptions that cannot be proved formally, we cannot provide a formal complexity proof.
a31 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7 . In the original implementation of the algorithm, the entire alignment is evaluated after each search step (global evaluation, or a31 a68a24a70a72a71a12a73a22a74a56a70 ).
Therefore, the evaluation cost rises linearly with the length of the hypothesized alignment: The evaluation requires two passes over the English hypothesis (n-grams for the language model; fertility probabilities) and two passes over the input string (translation and distortion probabilities).
We assume a high correlation between input length and the hypothesis length.
Thus, a31a69a68a12a70 a71a36a73a75a74a24a70 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7 . 2There are a17a6a15a18a17a54a53a56a55 a21 possible join operations for an English string consisting of a17 non-zero-fertility words.

a9 a3 a0a2a1a4a3 a7 . The original algorithm pursues a highly inefficient search strategy.
At the end of each iteration, only the single best improvement is executed; all others, even when independent, are discarded.
In other words, the algorithm needs one search iteration per improvement.
We assume that there is a linear correlation between input length and the number of improvements — an assumption that is supported by the empirical data in Fig.
4. Therefore, a9 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7 . a10 a3 a0a2a1a4a3 a7 ( a23a2a24, restricted swapping) a10 a3 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a7 ( a23a1a0, restricted swapping) a10 a3 a0a2a1a4a3 a7 a7 (no restrictions on swapping).
The number of search steps per iteration is the sum of the number of search steps for CHANGE, SWAP, JOIN, INSERT, and ERASE.
The highest order term in this sum is unrestricted SWAP with a0a2a1 a3 a7 a7 . With restricted swapping, S has a theoretical complexity of a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a7 (due to JOIN) in a23a2a24 decoding, but the contribution of the JOIN operation to overall time consumption is so small that it can be ignored for all practical purposes.
Therefore, the average complexity of a10 in practice is a0a2a1a4a3 a7, and the total complexity of a23a2a24 in practice is a23a2a24 a45a24a18 a16a47a46 a45 a20 a76 a46 a18a20a19 a16a1a0 a74 a2a3a2 a20 a24 a68 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7a14a1 a0a2a1 a3 a7a14a1 a0a2a1 a3 a7a46a3 a0a2a1a4a3a6a51 a7a53a48 In a23a1a0 decoding, which combines up to two CHANGE operations or one CHANGE operation and one INSERT operation, a10 has a practical complexity of a0a2a1 a23 a5 a7, so that a23a1a0 a45a24a18 a16a47a46 a45 a20 a76 a46 a18a20a19 a16a1a0 a74 a2a3a2 a20 a24 a68 a3 a0a2a1 a3 a7a46a1 a0a2a1 a3 a7a46a1 a0a2a1 a3a6a5 a7a69a3 a0a2a1a4a3 a7 a7 . We discuss below how a10 can be reduced to practically linear time for a23a1a0 decoding as well.
4 Reducting
Decoder Complexity Every change to the alignment affects only a few of the individual probabilities that make up the overall alignment score: the n-gram contexts of those places in the English hypothesis where a change occurs, plus a few translation model probabilities.
We call the — not necessarily contiguous — area of an alignment that is affected by a change the change’s local context.
With respect to an efficient implementation of the greedy search, we can exploit the notion of local contexts in two ways.
First, we can limit probability recalculations to the local context (that is, those probabilities that actually are affected by the respective change), and secondly, we can develop the notion of change dependencies: Two changes are independent if their local contexts do not overlap.
As we will explain below, we can use this notion to devise a scheme of improvement caching and tiling (ICT) that greatly reduces the total number of alignments considered during the search.
Our argument is that local probability calculations and ICT each reduce the complexity of the algorithm by practically a0a2a1 a3 a7, that is, from a0a2a1 a3a5a4 a7 to a0a2a1 a3a6a4 a25 a47 a7 with a7a9a8 a24 . Thus, the complexity for a23a2a24 decreases from a0a2a1 a3a52a51 a7 to a0a2a1 a3 a7 . If we limit the search space for the second operation (CHANGE or INSERT) in a23a1a0 decoding to its local context, a23a1a0 decoding, too, has practically linear complexity, even though with a much higher coefficient (cf Fig.
6). 4.1 Local Probability Calculations The complexity of calculating the alignment probability globally (that is, over the entire alignment) is a0a2a1 a3 a7 . However, since there is a constant upper bound3 on the size of local contexts, a31a69a68a24a70a72a71a12a73a75a74a24a70 needs to be performed only once for the initial gloss, therafter, recalculation of only those probabilities affected by each change (a31 a70a72a71a12a76a77a74a24a70 a3 a0a2a1 a24 a7 ) suffices.
This reduces the overall decoding complexity from a0a2a1 a3 a4 a7 to a0a2a1 a3 a4 a25 a47 a7 with a7a10a8 a24 . Even though profoundly trivial, this improvement significantly reduces translation times, especially when improvements are not tiled (cf.
below and Fig.
2). 4.2 Improvement Caching and Tiling4 (ICT) Based on the notions of local contexts and change dependencies, we devised the following scheme of improvement caching and tiling (ICT): During the search, we keep track of the best possible change affecting each local context.
(In practice, we maintain a map that maps from 3In practice, 16 with a trigram language model: a swap of two large segments over a large distance affects four points in the English hypothesis, resulting in a11a13a12a15a14a17a16 a55a19a18 trigrams, plus four individual distortion probabilities.

Figure 3: A decoding trace using improvement caching and tiling (ICT).
The search in the second and later iterations is limited to areas where a change has been applied (marked in bold print) — note that the number of alignment checked goes down over time.
The higher number of alignments checked in the second iteration is due to the insertion of an additional word, which increases the number of possible swap and insertion operations.
Decoding without ICT results in the same translation but requires 11 iterations and checks a total of 17701 alignments as opposed to 5 iterations with a total of 4464 alignments with caching.
the local context of each change that has been considered to the best change possible that affects exactly this context).
At the end of the search iteration a64, we apply a very restricted stack search to find a good tiling of nonoverlapping changes, all of which are applied.
The goal of this stack search is to find a tiling that maximizes the overal gain in alignment probability.
Possible improvements that overlap with higher-scoring ones are ignored.
In the following search iteration a64 a36 a24, we restrict the search to changes that overlap with changes just applied.
We can safely assume that there are no improvements to be found that are independent of the changes applied at the end of iteration a64 : If there were such improvements, they would have been found in and applied after iteration a64 . Figure 3 illustrates the procedure.
We assume that improvements are, on average, evenly distributed over the input text.
Therefore, we can expect the number of places where improvements can be applied to grow with the input length at the same rate as the number of improvements.
Without ICT, the number of iterations grows linearly with the input length, as shown in Fig.
4. With ICT, we can parallelize the improvement process and thus reduce the number of iterations for each search to a constant upper bound, which will be determined by the average ‘improvement density’ of the domain.
One exception to this rule should be noted: since the expected number of spurious words (words with no counterpart in English) in the input is a function of the input length, and since all changes in word translation that involve the NULL word are mutually dependent, we should expect to find a very weak effect of this on the number of search iterations.
Indeed, the scatter diagram in Fig.4 suggests a slight increase in the number of iterations as the input length increases.5 At the same time, however, the number of changes considered during each search iteration eventually decreases, because subsequent search iterations are limited to areas where a change was previously performed.
Empirical evidence as plotted on the right in Fig.
4 suggests that this effect “neutralizes” the increase in iterations in dependence of the input length: the total number of changes considered indeed appears to grow linearly with the input length.
It should be noted that ICT, while it does change the course of the search, primarily avoids redundant search steps — it does not necessarily search a smaller search space, but searches it only once.
The total number of improvements found is roughly the same (15,299 with ICT, 14,879 without for the entire test corpus with a maximum swap distance of 2 and a maximum swap segment size of 5).
5Another possible explanation for this increase, especially at the left end, is that “improvement clusters” occur rarely enough not to occur at all in shorter sentences.

Translations were performed with a maximum swap distance of 2 and a maximum swap segment size of 5.
4.3 Restrictions
on Word Reordering With a0a2a1a4a3 a7 a7, unlimited swapping swapping is by far the biggest consumer of processing time during decoding.
When translating the Chinese test corpus from the 2002 TIDES MT evaluation6 without any limitations on swapping, swapping operations account for over 98% of the total search steps but for less than 5% of the improvements; the total translation time (with ICT) is about 34 CPU hours.
For comparison, translating with a maximum swap segment size of 5 and a maximum swap distance of 2 takes ca.
40 minutes under otherwise unchanged circumstances.
It should be mentioned that in practice, it is generally not a good idea to run the decoder with without restrictions on swapping.
In order to cope with hardware and time limitations, the sentences in the training data are typically limited in length.
For example, the models used for the experiments reported here were trained on data with a sentence length limit of 40.
Sentence pairs where one of the sentences exceeded this limit were ignored in training.
Therefore, any swap that involves a distortion greater than that limit will result in the minimal (smoothed) distortion probability and most likely not lead to an improvement.
The question is: How much swapping is enough?
Is there any benefit to it at all?
This is an interesting question since virtually all efficient MT decoders (e.g.
Tillmann and Ney, 2000; Berger et al., 1994; Alshawi et al., 2000; Vidal, 1997) impose limits on word reordering.
In order to determine the effect of swap restrictions on decoder performance, we translated the Chinese test corpus 101 times with restrictions on the maximum swap 6100 short news texts; 878 text segments; ca.

distance (MSD) and the maximum swap segment size (MSSS) ranging from 0 to 10 and evaluated the translations with the BLEU7 metric (Papineni et al., 2002).
The results are plotted in Fig.
5. On the one hand, the plot seems to paint a pretty clear picture on the low end: score improvements are comparatively large initially but level off quickly.
Furthermore, the slight slope suggests slow but continuous improvements as swap restrictions are eased.
For the Arabic test data from the same evaluation, we obtained a similar shape (although with a roughly level plateau).
On the other hand, the ‘bumpiness’ of the surface raises the question as to which of these differences are statistically 7In a nutshell, the BLEU score measures the n-gram overlap between system-produced test translations and a set of human reference translations.

We are aware of several ways to determine the statistical significance of BLEU score differences.
One is bootstrap resampling (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993)8 to determine confidence intervals, another one splitting the test corpus into a certain number of subcorpora (e.g.
30) and then using the t-test to compare the average scores over these subcorpora (cf.
Papineni et al., 2001).
Bootstrap resampling for the various system outputs leads to very similar confidence intervals of about 0.006 to 0.007 for a one-sided test at a confidence level of .95.
With the t-score method, differences in score of 0.008 or higher seem to be significant at the same level of confidence.
According to these metrics, none of the differences in the plot are significant, although the shape of the plot suggests that moderate swapping probably is a good idea.
In addition to limitations of the accuracy of the BLEU method itself, variance in the decoders performance can blur the picture.
A third method to determine a confidence corridor is therefore to perform several randomized searches and compare their performance.
Following a suggestion by Franz Josef Och (personal communications), we ran the decoder multiple times from randomized starting glosses for each sentence and then used the highest scoring one as the “official” system output.
This gives us a lower bound on the price in performance that we pay for search errors.
The results for up to ten searches from randomized starting points in addition to the baseline gloss are given in Tab.
1. Starting points were randomized by randomly picking one of the top 10 translation candidates (instead of the top candidate) for each input word, and performing a (small) random number of SWAP and INSERT operations before the actual search started.
In order to insure consistency across repeated runs, we used a pseudo random function.
In our experiments, we did not mix a23a2a24 and a23a1a0 decoding.
The practical reason for this is that a23a1a0 decoding takes more than ten times as long as a23a2a24 decoding.
As the table illustrates, running multiple searches in a23a2a24 from randomized starting points is more efficient that running a23a1a0 once.
8Thanks to Franz Josef Och for pointing this option out to us.
Choosing the best sentences from all decoder runs results in a BLEU score of 0.157.
Interestingly, the decoding time from the default starting point is much lower (G1: ca.
40 min.
vs. ca.
1 hour; G2: ca.
9.5 hours vs.
ca. 11.3 hours), and the score, on average, is higher than when searching from a random starting point (G1: 0.143 vs.
0.127 (average); G2: 0.145 vs.
0.139 (average)).
This indicates that the default seeding strategy is a good one.
From the results of our experiments we conclude the following.
First, Tab.
1 suggests that there is a good correlation between IBM Model 4 scores and the BLEU metric.
Higher alignment probabilities lead to higher BLEU scores.
Even though hardly any of the score differences are statistically significant (see confidence intervals above), there seems to be a trend.
Secondly, from the swapping experiment we conclude that except for very local word reorderings, neither the IBM models nor the BLEU metric are able to recognize long distance dependencies (such as, for example, accounting for fundamental word order differences when translating from a SOV language into a SVO language).
This is hardly surprising, since both the language model for decoding and the BLEU metric rely exclusively on ngrams.
This explains why swapping helps so little.
For a different approach that is based on dependency tree transformations, see Alshawi et al.(2000). Thirdly, the results of our experiments with randomized searches show that greedy decoding does not perform as well on longer sentences as one might conclude from the findings in Germann et al.(2001). At the same time, the speed improvements presented in this paper make multiple searches feasible, allowing for an overall faster and better decoder.
5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have analyzed the complexity of the greedy decoding algorithm originally presented in Germann et al.(2001) and presented improvements that drastically reduce the decoder’s complexity and speed to practically linear time.

The profiles shown are cumulative, so that the top curve reflects the total decoding time.
To put the times for a0 a18 decoding in perspective, the dashed line in the lower plot reflects the total decoding time in a0 a55 decoding.
Operations not included in the figures consume so little time that their plots cannot be discerned in the graphs.

The speed improvements discussed in this paper make multiple randomized searches per sentence feasible, leading to a faster and better decoder for machine translation with IBM Model 4.
