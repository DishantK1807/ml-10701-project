Whereas Miller et al.(2000) use a generative model to produce parse information as well as relation information, we hypothesize that a technique discriminatively trained to classify relations will achieve better performance.

Entity tagging has been thoroughly addressed by many statistical machine learning techniques, obtaining greater than 90% F1 on many datasets (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

Also, Roth and Yih (2002) learn a Bayesian network to tag entities and their relations simultaneously.
