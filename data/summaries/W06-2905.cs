Here we report rst quantitative results on the ATIS3 corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990).

The model I develop in this paper is true to these general DOP ideals, although it differs in important respects from the many DOP implementations that have been studied since its rst inception (Bod, 1993; Goodman, 1996; Bod, 1998; Sima’an, 2002; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Bod et al., 2003, and many others).

STSGs form a restricted subclass of Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars (henceforth, STAGs) (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992), the difference being that STSGs only allow for substitution and not for adjunction (Joshi and Sarkar, 2003).

Another interesting question is if and how the current algorithm can be extended to the full class of Stochastic Tree-Adjoining Grammars (Schabes, 1992; Resnik, 1992).

In (Zuidema, 2006) we evaluate existing estimation methods for Data-Oriented Parsing, and show that they are ill-suited for learning tasks such as studied in this paper.

Existing DOP models converge to STSGs that either (i) give all subtrees of the observed trees nonzero weights (Bod, 1993; Bod, 2003), or (ii) give only the largest possible fragments nonzero weights (Sima’an and Buratto, 2003; Zollmann and Sima’an, 2005).

An existing SCFG parser (Schmid, 2004) was then used, with a simple unknown word heuristic, to generate the Viterbi n-best parses with n = 100, and, after removing the address labels, all equal parses and their probabilities were summed, and the one with highest probability chosen.

My approach is closely related to work in statistical parsing known as Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP), an empirically highly successful approach with labeled recall and precision scores on the Penn Tree Bank that are among the best currently obtained (Bod, 2003).

However, more interesting is a qualitative analysis of the STSG induced, which shows that, unlike DOP1, push-n-pull arrives at a grammar that gives high weights (and scores) to those elementary 3We approximated the most probable parse as follows (following (Bod, 2003)).
