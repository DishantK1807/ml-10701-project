These are the 'quasi logical forms' (QLF) of Alshawi and van Eijck (1989), differing from 'resolved logical forms' (RLF) in several respects: they contain 'a_terms' representing the memlings of pronouns and other contextually dependent NPs; 'a.fornm' (anaphoric formula) representing the meanings of sentences containing contextually determined predicates (possessives, compound nominals, 'have' 'do' etc); and 'q_terms' representing the meaning of other quantified NPs before the later explicit quantifier scoping phase (see Moran 1988).
