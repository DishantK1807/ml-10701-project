Paris extended schemata to generate descriptions of complex objects in a manner that is appropriate for the user's level of expertise (Paris 1988), and ROMPER's schemata include information about the content of propositions to be selected, as well as their communicative role.

We manually "parsed" each passage into an informal language of structure, function, and process which is commonly found in the discourse literature; see Mann and Thompson (1987), McKeown (1985), Paris (1988), Souther et al.(1989), and Suthers (1988), for example.

To automatically construct explanation plans (trees that encode the hierarchical structure of texts, as well as their content \[Grosz and Sidner 1986; Mann and Thompson 1987\]), an explanation system must possess discourse knowledge (knowledge about what characterizes a clear explanation).

However, unlike all of the preceding research--and unlike KNIGHT as well--it offers sophisticated mechanisms for generating explanations in interactive contexts (Moore 1995; Moore and Paris 1993).

Research on text planning (Hovy 1993; Maybury 1992; McCoy 1989, 1990; McKeown 1985; Paris 1988) has developed techniques for determining the content and organization of many genres, and explanation generation (Cawsey 1992; McKeown, Wish, and Matthews 1985; Moore 1995) in particular has been the subject of intense investigation.

The Explanation Design Package (EDP) formalism is a convenient, schema-like (McKeown 1985; Paris 1988) programming language for text planning.

EDPs are schema-like (McKeown 1985; Paris 1988) structures that include constructs found in traditional programming languages.
