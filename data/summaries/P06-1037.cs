Clark and Curran (2004a; 2004b) describe a combination of supertagger and parser for parsing Combinatory Categorial Grammar, where the tagger is used to filter the parses produced by the grammar, before the computation of the model parameters.

In addition to determining the optimal SuperARV sequence in isolation, Wang and Harper (2002) also combine the SuperARV n-gram probabilities with a dependency assignment probability into a dependency parser for English.

The parser itself reaches a labelled precision of 92.6% and a labelled recall of 92.2% (Wang and Harper, 2004).

Bangalore and Joshi (1999) derived the notion of supertag within the framework of Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars (LTAG) (Schabes and Joshi, 1991).

The word/supertag pairs were then used to train the statistical part-of-speech tagger TnT (Brants, 2000), which performs trigram tagging efficiently and allows easy retraining on different data.

This confirms earlier findings for English (Nasr and Rambow, 2004).

After all, the integration of the supertagging results helped to reach a quality level which compares favourably with the state-of-the-art in probabilistic dependency parsing for German as defined with 87.34%/90.38% labelled/unlabelled attachment accuracy on this years shared CoNLL task by (McDonald et al., 2005) (see (Foth and Menzel, 2006) for a more detailed comparison).
H05-1066 P06-1041
Following (Wang and Harper, 2002), we further classify dependencies into Left (L), Right (R), and No attachments (N), depending on whether a word is attached to its left or right, or not at all.

Details about the WDCG parser can be found in (Foth and Menzel, 2006).

It allows us to define supertags on different levels of granularity (White, 2000; Wang and Harper, 2002), thus facilitating a fine grained analysis of how the different aspects of supertag information influence the parsing behaviour.
W02-1031
The supertagging approach that is closest to ours in terms of linguistic representations is probably (Wang and Harper, 2002; Wang and Harper, 2004) whose ‘Super Abstract Role Values’ are very similar to our model F supertags (Table 2).

(Foth and Hagenstr¨om, 2002; Daum et al., 2003) showed that the correct balance between the new knowledge and the existing grammar is crucial for successful integration.

This corresponds closely to the set of needs roles of (Wang and Harper, 2002).
W02-1031
Nasr and Rambow (2004) estimated that perfect supertag information already provides for a parsing accuracy of 98% if a correct supertag assignment were available.
