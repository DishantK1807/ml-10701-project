More recent work on aspects of stochastic generation include (Langkilde and Knight, 2000), (Malouf, 1999) and (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).

This step can be seen as analogous to "supertagging" (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999), except that now supertags (i.e., names of trees) must be fbund tbr words in a tree rather than tbr words in a linear sequence.

Indeed, LTAG has been used extensively in generation, starting with (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985).

Betbre we describe in more detail how we use stochastic models in NLG, we recall the basic tasks in NLG (Rainbow and Korelsky, 1992; Reiter, 1994).
