166:1076	Properties of Lex+cal Rezations.
167:1076	a, Refldvity, Symmetry, Transitivity.
168:1076	Certain properties of lexical-sewtic relations can be very useful in deductive inference.
169:1076	For instance, 15 we know that a cheetah is a ki,na or mammal anu a mamm i.s a kind of vertebrate then we can deduce that a cheetah is a kind of vertebrate.
170:1076	Writing T for the taxonomy relation, we can abbreviate this sentence: if cheetah T mammal and mammal T vertebrate then cheetah T vertebrate.
171:1076	Whenever bTc and cTd, it follcaws that bTd.
172:1076	This fact ran be described much more effi ciently by the stuement that the taxonomy relation is transitive.
173:1076	Two other commonly menttand properties of relations are refilexivity and syrmnetry.
174:1076	These properties may ppply to predicates formed from lexical entries as well as to lexical-semantic relations.
175:1076	To be precise, a relation R defined on a set S is said to be a trana~t<ve relation if whenever b and c are R-related and also c and d are I?
176:1076	related then b and d staAd in a relation R also, Synonyniy is a transitive relation just as transitivity is. The preposition in behaves in the same way.
177:1076	If Sam is in the kitchen and the kitchen is in the hotel, then we know that Sam is in the hotel.
178:1076	The time interrelation before behaves like this, too.
179:1076	If Zorro arrived before the posse did and the posse arrived before thz explosion, then we know thgt Zorro arrived before the explosion.
180:1076	A relation R defined on a set S is said to have the refZez<ue property if all the elements of S are R-related to thenl~elves, that is, if mRm is true for all members m of the set S, The synonymy relation has this property a word means the same thin% as itself.
181:1076	The antonymy relation ANTI does not have this property.
182:1076	It is not rrue tha&, hot ANTI be, for example.
183:1076	A relation R defined on a set S is said to be e~stric if whenever,b and c are R-related then so are c and b; that is, R is symme.tric if and only if bRc always implies cRb.
184:1076	Synonymy also has this property.
185:1076	If b is synonymous with c, then c is synonymous with b. So has antonfly.
186:1076	Given that hot ANTI sold, we immediately know that= cdd ANTI hot.
187:1076	Taxonomy ie not eymmetric, however.
188:1076	A lion is a kind of mammal, but a mammal is not a kind of lion.
189:1076	In question answering we may be just as Interested in drawing negative conclusions as positive-ones.
190:1076	Thus i~rmay be important to know tliat tf bRc is true then cRb must be falae.
191:1076	The term asynmrstrio is used to describe a relation R for which bRc and cRb are never both true, at $east when b and c are different elements of the stt S. Taxonomy is asymmetric and so is the thug interrelation before.
192:1076	If the question asks, "Did c happen before b"?
193:1076	and we know that b happened before r, we can answer with a confident no.
194:1076	For want of a better term we will say that the relr Sion R is mn-synonetrio if it is neither symmetric or &symmetric.
195:1076	In this case bRc and cRb are sometimes both true and sometfmes not.
196:1076	Shilarly, he term imefz.exive is used for the case in which mRm is never true, while the term nonreflexit)e is used for the case in which mRm is sometfmes true and sometimes not.
197:1076	In the same way intransiti~e is taken to mean that if bRc and cRd, we can conclude that b and d are not R-related, while nantrcrnsitive will mean that bRd is sometimes true if bRc and cRd, butnot always.
198:1076	Each lexical relation itself; has a lexical entry.
199:1076	The reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity properties of the relation are listed in this entry, as they are in the entries for interrelational operators and prepositions and other lexical item for which they are relevant.
200:1076	There are also lexical entries under the property names, refldvs, irr~~~~vr, etc. listing the appropriate axioms.
201:1076	The motivation behind laical entries for properties is first of all greater generality.
202:1076	Secondly, it makes it much easier to add lexical relations and to add other properties which turn out to be useful.
203:1076	At this stage of development there are several transitivity axioms: For lexical relations Rel, like taxonomy b Re1 c c Re4 d ' b Re1 d For interrelations J, like bsfbre lloZdsfI(~,~,,Z,)) A RoZda (I(J, Z2,Z3)) Holds (I(J,Z~,z$) For prepositions Q like in or abave Intuitively these are all instances of the same concept, transitivity.
204:1076	Theze should be some single way of expressing it.
205:1076	It is a defect of this representation system that there is not.
206:1076	A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive Ls called an equivalence relation.
207:1076	The synonymy relation is an equivalence relation since it has all three properties.
208:1076	If R is an equivalence relation, then a subset consistrlng of all the elements which are R-related to a partirtllar element x by the7equivalence relation is called an equivalence class.
209:1076	In an equivalence class all the elements are R-related to each other.
210:1076	An equi vaf ence relation partitions a set into equivalence classes ; each element of the set belongs to exactly one equivalence claas.
211:1076	The synonymy relation paftitions the items in the lexicon Ln just this way.
212:1076	There Is a class consisting of stcsp%oion and all the words synonymous with 8148phion, like mistmcet and dozibt.
213:1076	These synonymy classes are disjoint; each word sense in the lexicon belongs to exactly one of them (cf.
214:1076	Edrrmndson and Epstein 1972, Palmer 1976).
215:1076	With this ge a basis an equivalence relation of paxaphrasability between sentences can be established.
216:1076	Sentence S1 is a paraphrase of sentence S2 if one is obtained from the other 3y substituting synonyms for each other.
217:1076	d Mr. Kennedy viewed Lady Laura with suspicion.
218:1076	Mr. Kennedy regarded Lady Laura with mistrust.
219:1076	We might also allow substitution of conversives, nominalizations, etc. Nancy was Sally's student.
220:1076	Sally was ~ancy's teacher.
221:1076	Sally taught Nancy.
222:1076	The equivalence classes of this relation, each one of which is the set of all pamaphrases of a given sentence have a definite theoretical importance and some practical significance in question answering.
223:1076	One member of a class might well 'be part of the story; another the right answer to* a question.
224:1076	I This representation system can be viewed as defining a relation P such that S1 P S2 if and only if S1 and S2 have the same representation.
225:1076	If the representation system is well defined, then P should define the same equivalence classes as the paraphrasabilitv relatior b. Xttt)srses, The inverse R of the relation R is the relation which "goes in the opposite direction" from R; that is, bRc if and only if cRb.
226:1076	Thus, bake T make and mke T bake are two ways of saying the same thing.
227:1076	Both pieces of information are stated in the lexicon.
228:1076	However, the lexical entry for Eake includes T nuke; the lexical entry for naks includes T hake.
229:1076	Why bother to say the same thing in different places?
230:1076	There are two reasons for this.
231:1076	First of all, the inversa relation may be a relation that is conm~nly and easily verbalized, worth naming in its own right.
232:1076	This is certainly true of the CHILD relation, as in pu~py CHILD 20g.
233:1076	Instead of asking "What is a baby dog called?", we could ask ''What is a grow?
234:1076	puppy talled"?
235:1076	or "What does a puppy grow up to be"?
236:1076	The second reason is that putting this information in both entries can &e searches easier and much faster, We may only have one half of the pair and need the other.
237:1076	We may have dog and pppy.
238:1076	This is easy if we have the information CHILD pppz~ in the dog entry.
239:1076	Othewise we might have to search the whole lexicon, In other situations we have two words but no direct connection between them.
240:1076	For example, suppose the system knows twn T mama2 and maZ T vertebrate and is then asked, "Is a lion a vertebrate"?
241:1076	The connection betwen Zion and vertebrate can be found much more quickly if the search starts *om both the vertebrate end and the Zion end of the chain at the same time, but to do this there must be s pointer to m~mmaZ in the oertebrute entry.
242:1076	Another question comes to mind.
243:1076	Why call the inverse relation to CHILD by the clumsy name CAaD instead of its propel name PARENT?
244:1076	The ECD uses t~o different names for a relation and its inverse (So and Vo ace inverses, for example).
245:1076	If this were dane here, two versions of the appropriate axiom schemes would be needed, one in the CHILD entry and one in the PMNT entry.
246:1076	Since a relation R is called symmetric if bRc alwaye implies cRb, it follows that a symmetric relation ie its own inverse.
247:1076	The syaonymy relation S and antonymy relation ANTI are both self-inverse in thie sense.
248:1076	7 For this reason we never need the spnbol ANTI, etc. ANTI is MITI The entry for hot includes ANTI cold, the entry for cold includes ANTI hot.
249:1076	0.
250:1076	(hrique Linkage.
251:1076	Raphael (1968) has proposed a property which seems extremely useful.
252:1076	He calls it m6qus-Z$nkuge (U).
253:1076	Nathematicians usually.refer to such relatdons as one-to-one.
254:1076	A relation R has the unique-linkage property if whenever xRy then bRy is false for any bk and xRc is false for any cry, i.e. any object is R-related to at most one other.
255:1076	~aphael's example of unique-linkage is the relation "just to the right of".
256:1076	The behavior ie especially characteristic of the queuing relation, e.g. with days of the week, Monday Q Tuesday, etc.Some relations may be uniquely linked on one side only, e.g. mother-child is uniquely linked on the left.
257:1076	We can define UL unique-linkage on the left and UR unique linkage on the fight.
258:1076	(A relation which is UR is a single-valued function.
259:1076	If R has the UL property, then its inverse is a single-valued function).
260:1076	Raphael also proposed for SIR-1 (ibid, p. 101) a property which he calls ixreflexive.
261:1076	R is set-nunreflexive if (\lx M)--WBcX) 6!acX) @RBI In the SIR model both the 'X is a part of Y' and the 'X is owned by Yf relations hwe this property.
262:1076	What $t qays is that every set in the model has a minimal element with respect to the relation R. A siapler version of th&s property is sufficient for our purposes.
263:1076	Minimum ~cM) ()'Y i X) (32 X) {ZRY) Condition Every noneslpty subset has a minLmum.
264:1076	Maximum WXcM) -(qr X) (3 Z X) (YRZ) Condition Every nonempty subset has a maximum.
265:1076	The part-whole relation' has both properties in our model.
266:1076	In any nonempty subset in the model there is something in it that is not a proper subpart of anything else in that subset, and also something that has no proper subpart.
267:1076	A relation that has this property stops samewhere.
268:1076	It is not reflexive and not circular, A search that goes on looking for links of this kind will stop somewhere.
269:1076	The relation 'is an ancestor of' has this property.
270:1076	We will eventually run out of ancestors in one direction and descendants in the other, at least, inside a finite model.
271:1076	The properties of relations are summarized in Table 4.

Pmtial Ordering.
274:1076	Any transitive relation defines a partial ordering.
275:1076	Several of the lexisgl relatiohs discueeed earl,ier are transitive; many lexical items are transitive too.
276:1076	One important reason for.repr*senting time in terns of the transitive interrelatEton before is to allow one to make the same kinds of sdmple deductions about time that one can make about taxonomy.
277:1076	Some transitive relations, like taxonomy, are alsb reflexive.
278:1076	In this case we talk about a weak order<ng.
279:1076	(X s: Y for numbers is a weak ordering).
280:1076	Some are not reflexive, these are called strong ordering relations.
281:1076	(X < Y for numbers is a strong ordering).
282:1076	The time relation before 5s a strong order3ng relation.
283:1076	For any weak ordering there is a strong ordering and conversely, Starting with the taxonomy relation T, 1 I for example, a relation TI or proper,taxonomyl' can be defined consisting of the pairs x and y for which xTy but x and y are different.
284:1076	Then~Tly means that x is a kind of y but different from y. If instead one starts with strong ordering relation before, one can deane a weak relation "beforel" for which x beforel y means that either x before y or x cooccured with y. The queuing relation Q is nat itself a partla3 ordering but a partial ordering can 'be derived from it.
285:1076	Monday Q Tuesday anLTuesday Q Wednesday, but it is false that Monday Q Wednesday.
286:1076	Queuing is an 'immediate successor *lation like the relatxon between a natural number n and the next number n+l. A relation Q' can be defined such that xQ1y if either xQy or there are some objects cl,z2,.
287:1076	,z, such that xQzl, z1Qz2,  znQy.
288:1076	It follows immediately that if bQc and cQd then bQ1d.
289:1076	Q', the 'successor' relation, 95 2 4 ie now transitive, for if #ltc and cQ1d, then one can find s chain of Q-related objects linking b and d just bv cbncatenating the chain linking c and d, Rapbl's pair of relations jright and right behave this way.

296:1076	Rec~gni, tlon rules for semantic components SUMM (9 l$X Ordinary dictionaries have not been given their due, either AH 80ur~e8 of material for natural language understanding syetema or as corpora that can be used to unravel the complexities of meaning and how it is represented.
297:1076	If either of these goal8 are aver to be ~chieved, I believe that investigators must develop methods for extracting the semantic content of dictionaries (or at least for transforming it into a more useful form).
298:1076	It is argued that definitions contain a great deal of information about the semantic characteristics which should be attached to a lexeme, To extract or surfacke such infarmation, it will be necessary to systematize definitions and what they represent, probably using semantic primitives.
299:1076	In this paper, I deecribe procedures which I have developed in an attempt to accomplish these objectives for the set of verbs in Websterle Third New Intern~tional Dictionary (~3).
300:1076	I describe (4) how I have'used the structure of the dictionary itself in an attempt find semantic primi tive s and how appears that the systematization must incorporate a capability for word sense diecrimination and must capture the knowledge contained in a definition.
301:1076	The body of the paper is concerned with demonstrating that semantic information can be surf aced through a rigorous analysis of dictionary definitions.
302:1076	The first step in this process reaviresa clom~phenaive framw~arkwithin WkLch def iait ions can be an~ly~ed.

307:1076	?rro theee models and from digrwh theory, we cqn conclude that there may exist orimi-tive units of meaning from which 911 concepts in the dictionary can be derlved.
308:1076	To determine arimitive concepts, it is necessarv to subject definitiuns to syntactic and semantic nsrsinp in order to identify characteristics that should be att~chkd to each definition.
309:1076	Syntactic parsing such as that implemented for systemic grammar by Minograd is the first stea.
310:1076	semantic parser must next be developed.
311:1076	Tt appears that definitions themselves, and particularly definitions of prep~si.ti~ns (which are used to express sense relations), will be of sipi,ficant help :in develop; ing such a Darser, Further work is necessary to develon procedures for surfacing from definitions i.nformation about the context which must be associ.ated with each sense.
312:1076	It wpears as ib this Darser wlll have more ~eneral use for ordlnary discourse.
313:1076	5 These notions lead to the ultimate model of a dictionary, where points represent concepts (which nay be verbalized and symbolized in more than one lay) and lines represent relations (synta~ti,c or aemantk-c) between canoepts.
314:1076	Ba ~ed on these models, procedures for f i,nding prirniti-ve concepts are described, using the set of verbs and their definitions from W3.
315:1076	Specific rules are described, based on some elementary graph-th6qre tic principles, structural characteristics of dictionary de'finitiohs, and the parsing of the definitions.
316:1076	These rules have thus far reduced the initial eet of 20,000 verbs to fewer than 4,000, with further reduction to cone as all rules are applied, It is argued that this approach bears a~ strong relationship to efforts to represent knowledge in framecr.
317:1076	Although much work is needed on the parser and on a computerized version of this approach, there is some hope that the parser, if expectations are borne out, will be capable of transforming ordinary discourse into canonical frame representations, 6 1 . INTRODUCTION During the pa~t 15 years.
318:1076	scientists in many fields have been building a reservoir of knowledge about the semantic char acteristics of natural language.
319:1076	Perhaps somewhat inexplicably znese developments have for the most part Agnored the semantic contenl of dictionaries, despite the fact that even a small one contain8 a vast amount of material.
320:1076	Some attempts have been made to dent these repositories, but the steps t'aken have been tentative and have not yet borne significant fruit, perhaps because che sheer volume and scope of a dictionary is so overwhelming.
321:1076	As a result, most studies have dealt with only a few definitions wj%hout a comprehensive assault on the whole.
322:1076	While such studies have led to many insights, it seems that the full ugerulness of a dictionary's cantents will be realized only when a comprehensive model of its semantic structure is dweloped, Any system intended to provide natural language understanding must necessarily include a dictiona~.
323:1076	If any such system is to achieve broad applicability, its dictionary lnust cover a substantial pat of the natural language lexicon.
324:1076	For this to occur, the developers of a system must either create a dictionary from scratch or be able to incorporate an existing dictxonary.
325:1076	Given the amount of effort that usually goes into development of an ordinary dictionary, the former a1 ternative is rather impractical.
326:1076	Bowever, little has been done toward meetinn the latter alternative; with wnat follows, I will 7 describe the approach which I believe must be followed in transforming the contents of an ordinary dictionary for us6 In a true naturaX language system, In order to be used in a language understanding system, a dictionary's semantic contents must be systematized in a way that the sense in which a word ia being used can be identified.
327:1076	Bbfore thi~ can be done, it is necessary to characterize what 1s already cantained in each definition.
328:1076	To do this, it seems necessary to write the meaning of each definition in terms of serpantic and syntac5ic primitives.
329:1076	My purpose in this paper ia (1) to describe how to use the dictionary itself to move toward idhntification of the primitives, at the same time (2) showing how this process can be used (a) to provide the capability for discriminating among word senses ( i. e. characterizing; the frames into which a given word sense will fit) and (b) to characteriee knowledge contained or presupposed in a definition.
330:1076	Before elhbarking on the description, it-$8 necessary tc paint out some limitations whZch shaad be kept in mind as Dhe reader proceeds.
331:1076	First, in trying to @resent an overview of my approach, I have had to forgo describing the detailed steps which I have followed to date.
332:1076	Second, even had I presented a full description, I would still have been short of providing sufficient details to enable computer implementation of any procedures.
333:1076	Third, Since the approach presumgs that cancepts represented by the lexicon are tne realizations of many as yet unknovin-rrecursive functions to be dl scovered by stripping away 8 one-layer at a t~me, results other than procedures to be used An stripplpg will not emerge untll all layers have been removed.
334:1076	(However, I do wrae that the llstripplngm procedures are inherently useful, in that they will constitute a parser even in the intermea~ase stages).
335:1076	Fourth, since I have not ha@ access to a computer, which has become essentlalLfor significant further progress, I have been unable to determine how far the grocedures I have developed would take me, so there iLs an inherent uncertain-ty as to how much further development as needed.
336:1076	Notw~thstandlng these limitations, I am hopeful that what is prenented will provide a satisfactof.y framework for further iLnvestigations into the contents of dictlonarles.
337:1076	I will comment further on these limitahions and how they might be overcome at the end of the paper.
338:1076	2, ATTITUDB'3 TOWARD DICTION4RIE5 Many of +he siqnifxcant contributors to the present understandxng of rneanlng (such as Xatz and Fodor 1963, Plllmore 1968 and 7971, CHafe 1970, Jackendoff 1974, wlnograd 1972, and Schank 9972) have generally lgnored dictlonarles.
339:1076	Yet, each has presented a formulai~ structure for lexical entrhe5 to serve as a bas= for the creation of a rlew dictionary 4lthough their perceptions abouti the nature of language are well-established, thei?
340:1076	formellsms for lexxcal entries have not taken advantage of the equally well-establ~shed praetlces of lexicography.
341:1076	The rationale underlslng the development of new fommalisms~ ex~rer~sed in some cases and ~m~llcrt t;n others, ids that lexlcal 9 entries in dictionaries am unsatisfactory DeCAuse they do not contain sufficient infomation.
342:1076	These formali-sms thus require that semantic features such as 1lanirnateft or "statew be appended* to particular ent*ies.
343:1076	While it is true that ordinary diotionary entries do not overtly identify all appropriate features, this may be lees a dlfficulhg inherent in definitions than the fact thst no one has developed the necessary mechanisms for surfacing features from definitions.
344:1076	Thus, for examp3.e. ltnurse1' may not have the feature llanLmatew in its definition, but t?nuraew is defined as a ltwomanw which fs defined ad a tlpersonw ~hich is defined as a 1"beingfl" which "Ys defined as a "living thingw; this string seems sufficieht te estabaish "nurseN as "anirnatell.
345:1076	In general, it seems that, if a semantic feature is essential to the meaning ofa particular entry, it is similarly necessary %Hat the feature be discoverable within the semantic structure of a dictionary, Otherwise, there is a defect in one or more definitione, or the dictionarycontains some internal inconsistency.
346:1076	(Clearly, it is beyond expectation that any pre~nt dictionary will be free of these problems).
347:1076	The possibility of defective definitions has also gene^-ated crf ticiams, more direct than above, on the potential usefulness Of a dictionary.
348:1076	On one Hand definitions are viewed as "deficient in the presentation of relevant dataw since they provide meaninbv ueing "substitutable words (i.e. by synonyms), rather than by listing distinctive femtureafl (Nida 1975 : 172) . On another hand-, the proliferation of meanings 10 attached to an entry is viewed as only a case of "apparent polyeenyN which obscures the more general meaning of a lexeme by the addition of "redundant features already determined by the environmentft (Bennett 1975:4-1.1).
349:1076	Both objections may have much validity and ts that extent would necessitate revisions to iqdividu& or sets of definitions.
350:1076	However, neither viewpoint is sufficient' to preclude an analysis of what actually appears in any dictionary.
351:1076	It is possible that a cbmprehensive analysis might more readily surface such difficulties and make their amelioration (and the consequent improvement of definitions) that mu& easier, Xven though dictionaries are viewed somewhat askance by many who study meaning, it seems that this viewpdint is influenced more by the difficulty o* systematically tapping their contents than by my substantive objections which conclusively establish themas ~seless repositories of semantic content.
352:1076	However, it is necessary to demonstrate that a spstematic app~oach exists and can yield useful results.
353:1076	3, PREVIOUS RESXARCN ON DICTXONARIES Notwithstanaing the foregoing direct and indirect criticisms.
354:1076	some attempts have been made to probc the nature and& structure of dictionary definitions.
355:1076	A review of relevant aspects QItwo such studus will help the niaterial presented here stand out in sharper relief.
356:1076	Olney 1968 describes the conceptual baais of many pro$eetted routines for processing a machine-readable transcript of 11 Webster ' s Seveqth New Collq&ate Dictionary (~7).
357:1076	The primary objectives of these routines were the development of "(a) rules for obtaining c-ertain of the senses described for W7 entries from other senses described for the same entries or from senses described for other W7 entries from which the first (at least in typical cases) were derived morphologically; and (b) semantic wmponents and rules for combining them to yield specifications of senses that cannot conveniently be obtained br rules refer~ed to in (a) above".
358:1076	(ibid.
359:1076	: 6) Although these objectives me reasonable, they do not take advantage of the possibility that the semantic structure of a dlictionary might be a unlfied whole.
360:1076	As a\ result, an8 routines that are developed seem to require the serendipitous perception of patterns.
361:1076	Further, i0 a dictionary does have a unified semantle stpucture, it is not clear that a rule relating meaning to form wil-1 be relevant toga model' of the semantic structure even though interesting results might emerge.
362:1076	It seems n-cessary to have some comprehensive view that will permit un to kaW whether a particular rule is well-formed.
363:1076	This lack of objective criteria also im~erils any anaIysisthat selects a subset of definrrions for detailed analysis.
364:1076	The selection of a subset of the dictionary shoulcl.
365:1076	arise from wll-defined a priori considerations mmer than an intuition that a particular 12 wbset seems to be related, An example of this intuitive agproach appears ~JI Simmons 1975 and 1976.
366:1076	rn Quillian 1968, the analysis of dictionary definitions was part of a study of semantic memory, and for that reason was noP concerned with the full development of a dictionary model.
367:1076	In that study, a person determined the mesning of a concept when he "looked up the 'patriarch1 ward in a dictionary, then looked up every word in each of its definitions, then looked up every word f6hnd-in each of those, and so on, continually branching outward until every word he could reach by this process had been Looked up once".
368:1076	This process was never actually carried out because (1) not all words in a dictionary were used in the computer files, (2) the process was terminated when a common word was found in comparing the meanings of two words, and (3) there was a bellef that there are no primitive ward concepts.
369:1076	The termination of a search 3x designed was necessary in any event since, without my restrictions, it is likely that a large part of the dhztionary would have been reached on every occasion, More importantly, Quillian did not fully consider wHat was happening when branching led to a word already encountered, namely, that a definitional circularity was thereby uncovere6 Such circularities which mi-ght be vicious cir-cles, must be treatea specially (as will be shown below), and hence, Quillian8 s unrestricted branching should have been mdifbed.
370:1076	Quill ian also overlooked the.
371:1076	possibility that a concept common to two qatriarchs is more primitive than either.
372:1076	The continued comparison of more and more primitive concepts, along with restricti~ns on the outward branching, implies that primitiive concepts actually do Based on these observations, I take, as a working hypothesis, the assumption that a dictionary may be a unified whole with underlying primitive conce~ts.
373:1076	' With thin beginning, it is necessary to articulate a mod& of the dictionary which will permit an identifiqatian of the primitive concepts through the application of well-defiaea rules or procedures.
374:1076	It is proposed that what follows constitutes the first steps toward meeting this objective, 4.
375:1076	DXSRIPTIBN OF -UICTIONRHY . . CONTENTS Since a dictionary contains much material, it is first necessary to delineate exactly what is to be modeled-?
376:1076	For thi~s purpose, it is assumed that the semantic content of a dictionary essentially resides within its defi.nitions, thereby excluding from formal analysis such things as the pronunciation, the etymol~gy, and illwtrative examples.
377:1076	s presently concelvea, the analysis will focus on the ward belng defined (hereafter called Ehe main entry), the definitions ( including sense numbers and letters used as delimiters), part-of-speech I No dictianary is likely ta satisfy thls assumption, which is only a theoretically desirable characteristic.
378:1076	The assumption enables us to exclude the definienda from the models, 2 In the interests of space, I have glossed over B large number of intricacies that would have to be dealt with in arriving at a machine-readable hnscript suitable for analysis.
379:1076	Several pages would be reqyired to describe them fully.
380:1076	labels, status or usage labels, and usage notes.
381:1076	The manner in which these features will be employed will be made clear as the analysis proceeds.
382:1076	The hypothesized unified nature of a dictionary arises from the fact that definitions are expressed by werds which are 3 4180 defined (i. , there is no semantic metalangua~e).
383:1076	If we wish to understand the meaning of a given definition, then we must first understand the meanings of its constituent w&dse Since each constituent corresponds to a main entry, then, in order to understand the meaning of the given definition, we mus% understand the meaning of the constituent wards1 definitions, Continued repetition of the process is nothing more than, the outward branching process described by Quillian; however, as mentioned before, we must make this branching more disciplined in order to deal with vicious circles and avoid unwanted circularities, If we are to have a fully consistent dictiona~y, its model must show how each definition is related to all others.
384:1076	Thus, for each definition, X, the model should enable to identify ( 1) those definitions of the constituent wordr of X that apply and those that do not apply, and (2) the production rules that generated X from these definitions.
385:1076	For exampl,e, in the definition of tqe noun broadcast, "the act of spreading abroadu, 4 it There are some exceptions to this assertion, such as groper names, . biological caxa, and other special symbols, a s pointed out by the Journal's referee.
386:1076	15 is necessary that the model indicate (1) which of the definitions of --the, act, of, spread, and abroad apply, and (2) the production rules by which the and ___I_ act and all other collocations) occur together.
387:1076	If this can be done for each definition in the dict~onary, and if any inconsistencies are reconciled, then, as will be shown, it should be possible to find the primitive concepts in the dictionary and to transform each definition mto a canonical f Drm.
388:1076	5, BJSIC MODEL The theory of (labeled) directed graphs (digraphs)5 is used as the formalism for the modds.
389:1076	Digraph 'theory deals wj th the abstract notions of lfpointsff and "directed linest1 ; its applicability to the problem before us therefore depends on how these notions are interpreted.
390:1076	In this respect, it 1s important to distinguish tpe manner in which this theory is used here from the manner in which it previously has been used in semantics and linguistics.
391:1076	The two most common uses are (1) where trees display phrase and syntactic structures (cf.
392:1076	Kate and Fodor 1963), or (2) where directed graphs portray the seguena tial generation of words in a se~tence or phrase lcf.
393:1076	Simmons 1972).
394:1076	In these cases and others (cf.
395:1076	Quillian 1968 and Bennett 1975) graphs are used primarily as a vehicle for display All definitmns ueed in this paver are taken from Websterts . Third New International ~iction&ry, Eficyclopaed~a Britannica, Chicago, 1965.
396:1076	Terminolqy for digraphs follows Rarary 1965.
397:1076	16 and no results from graph theorv are expPicitly employed to d>aw further inferences.
398:1076	However, as used here, g~aphs consti tute an essential basis for the analysis and hence will play an integral role in a nulrrber of assertions that are made.
399:1076	In the simplest model, a point can be interpreted as representing all the definitions appearinpunder a single maln entry; the main entry word can be construed as the label for that point.
400:1076	The part-of-speech labels, status or usage labels, and usage notes are considered integral to the definitions and may be viewed as part of a set of characteristics of the individual defxnitions.
401:1076	A directed line from x to y will be used to represent the asymmetric relation "x is used to define yu; thus, if the main entry x appears exactly or in an inflected form In a definition of y, then xRy.
402:1076	(This does not preclude a distinct line for yRx or XRX).
403:1076	Therefore, we can establish a point for every main entry in a dictionary and draw he appropriate directed lines to form a digraph consisting of the entire dictim nary.
404:1076	(~hls digraph may be disconnected, but probably is not).
405:1076	An example.
406:1076	, which 1s a subggaph of the dictibnary digraph, 1s shown in Figure 1 on the next page.
407:1076	Xxcept for broadcast, only the labels of each point are shown, but each represents all the definitions appearing at its respective main entry.
408:1076	The directed line from act to broadcast corresponds to the fact tha* "act is used to define broa@castn, since its token appears in "tfle act of spreading abroad".
409:1076	In this model, the token "spreadingH is not represented by a point, since it is not a main ertry.

413:1076	The resultant digraph for even a small dictionary i.S extremely large, perhaps consibsting of well over 100,000 points and 1,000,000 lines.
414:1076	Clearly, such a digraph provides little fin& structure, but even so, it does have some utility.
415:1076	The manner, i.n whdch it can be used is descr,i.bed 9n Section 9.
416:1076	6. EXPANSION OF THL MODXL: POIN_S 45 DEFINITIONS Lett5ng each poi.nt in the basic model represent all the definitions of a main entry provides very lfttle del?neatAon of subtle gradations of semantic content.
417:1076	As a first step toward understanding this content, it seems worthwhile to let each point represent only one definition.
418:1076	However, the basic model will not trivially accommod&te such a spec~ficataon i~rimarily because of the interpretation gzven tg the directed llne), and thus it must first be modified, In the basic model, the exzstence of a line between two points, x and y, assertr that xRy, I. , "r 1s used to define yB1.
419:1076	Sfnce the points represent all the Cieflnltlons under the main entries, the existence of a line arises from the simple fact that x appears in at least one of yes definitions.
420:1076	ff the point y represents only one definition, say y, there 4s no 3 dlfflculty in saylng that xRyj.
421:1076	However, if we wf sh every polnt to represent only one definltlon, then we must frind the deflnltlon of x, say xl, for whlch xlHy is true.
422:1076	Referrinp to the 3 subgraph An Figure 1, this amounts to determining, for example, which def-inition of abroad b is used to defi.ne the token ltabroad" inn "the act of spreading abroadN, that js, finding the i such that "abroad,Rthe act of spreading ab-roadfl or It should be intuitively clear 'that 3nterpretation of points as amgle @efPn.itfons is desirable.
423:1076	However, there are no a prior1 crateria by which the appropritate value of i can be determhed, and hence there is no immediate transformation of the basic model hnto a model where each mint represents one qefinition.
424:1076	Sance th~s objective is wollth pursuing, it 3s therefore necessary to develop criteria or rules according to which the desired transformation can be made.
425:1076	In the appli.catAon of rules that may be deueloped, it will be convenient to make use of a model intermediate between the basic one and the one atlth points as definitions.
426:1076	For this purpose, we can comblne the two models by employlng a trivial ze lation, xLRx, which says that the ith defAnltion of x is used to define x; this holds for all definitions of x. The line reflecting xRy would remain in the mqdel, so that the digraph (the act of spreading abroad) broadcast wide -area) large) '&$art) Figure 2.

428:1076	would show both xlRqdand xRy and x would l5e a carrier, .as ilj lustrated in Tigure 2.
429:1076	In this case, the unsubscripted abroad represents all the definitions of I abroad (olny some of whia are shown).
430:1076	If and when suitable criteria establish, for example, ikat abroad,, but not abroad --2 * abroad,, 3 fits chc context of the token llabroadn in-thr definition of broadcas i, it would then be possible to draw a line directly from ?broad1 to broadcast without the intermediation of the ansubscripted Roint abroad, thus eliminating* paths from abroad*, abr~ab~, . .,* This model thus includes the points of' the basic model and adds mints to represent each individual definition in the dictionary.
431:1076	The lines betwen these points ensure that no relatian in the basic made1 is lo&*.
432:1076	As described in the example, 'it is necessary to develop rules according to which the points representing more than one definition can be eliminated or bypassed, 80 that the Only relatl ons, xRy, that remain are such that x and y are poi~ts which represent one definition, It way happen during the application of rules that some lines to a carrler will be eliminatgd with more than one st111 remaining.
433:1076	In such a case, it will still be useful to modify the digraph as much as possible.
434:1076	For example, if xRy in the basic nlpdel, whepe x has m definitions and y has n, and xRy is 3 the ejrpanbd model, then x,,.

440:1076	grouping will be demonstrated in Section 9.
441:1076	In any event, since maw criteria will eventually be requj red in the elimination of points representing two or more bfinitions.
442:1076	this abklity to group definitjons is a necessary mechanism for modeling intermediate descriptions of the dict~onarj.
443:1076	(It should be noted here that all such points will not be elimina fed; those that remain will indicate an essential ambiguity in the dictionary; this is further discu%sed in Section 8).
444:1076	7.
445:1076	SEMANTIC, STRUCTURAL, AND SYNTACTIC PARSING OP DEFINITIONS The basic ad expanded models, exampled in Figures 1, 2, and 3, do not portray any of the meaning of the di~tiohary, but rather indioate where particular relationships exist.
446:1076	In fact, these two models portray only the relation "is used to definett as if there is no other relation between definitions.
447:1076	This approach does not capture some very important elements that go to make up a definition.
448:1076	Instead of being analyzed directly into its ultimate constituents, a6 in Figures 1 and 2, the definition, "the act of spreading abroad", should fir-.
449:1076	,st be br*en down into sub~hrases and then into its ultimate qnstf tuents, s s in Figure 4, shown on the next page.
450:1076	A-desirable property of the new pointe is that they have the syntactical structure ox derinitions; Thus, ff the act" and ftspreading abmad" have the form of noun def initionsy "spread abroad" has the form of a verb definition: and nof spreading abroadN (not shown, but feasible under a diTfesent parsing) has the form of an adjective definition.
451:1076	This would elfminam such combinations as "act afll or the".
452:1076	The poinss represen-ung pbase consti-tuenta of a def-bni ti on thus have the form of definitions, but lack a label.
453:1076	The absence or presence of a label seems to make no difference in understagding the definition represented.
454:1076	In fact, (the act of spreading abroad) the act of spxead aaoad, abroad* (over a (At ( spreading abroad) ( spread abroad) ( ::::a:a wide drea) (at large) wlde area 1 arge) Figure 7.

456:1076	it seems val.id to represent identically worded definitions or phrase constltuenfq, regardless ~f the number of main entries under which they appear, by a single point with multiple labels.
457:1076	Thus, if each of the main entries disperse, scatter, and A diatribute has a definition verbalized as spread abroadtt, these three words can be labels of the point lfspread abroad" jn Figure 4.
458:1076	auch a construction has no effect on the analysis of 'the definition "the act of spreading abroad" or "spread abroad" as showr in F~gure 4, and si,miiarly, the analysis there would have no effect on any analysis involv ng disperse, scatter, or distribute.
459:1076	Since thtre is a large number of fnstances where duplicate wording appears in a dictionary, the approach given here would effect a substantial reduction in the she of the digraph.
460:1076	(This is not to say that the words diapePse, scatter, and distribute haua ae same meaning, but rather that in some instances these words can express the same concept).
461:1076	The definition, X, "the act of spreading,ibroad'!
462:1076	is essentially an entity unto itself.
463:1076	The definitimns of its component words have similar independence, However, lkke atoms in molecslles, we need to identify those forces which hold the components %ogether a~ld which endow the whole with whatever chara'ct3ristlcs it has.
464:1076	The d@ finitions of the component words may require several worde for their expression.
465:1076	but'thev are symeoliwd %y one word in the definition X; even so the symbol and the definition both represent the same entity, which has certain charactefisCics enabling it to be acted upon by ce~tain forces.
466:1076	These characteristics are the semantic, ~tructural, md syntactic properties of defihitions, and the forces are the production rules by which the entities (i. the component definitions or their symbols) are brought together.
467:1076	A definition may be viewed as the realization of such rules operating on the chgiraeteristics of other definitions.
468:1076	The nerculean task before us is to build a parsing system or recognition grammar which ill articulate the e%xracteristics %o be attached to each definition and which wul capture the production rules necessary to portray the relationships between definitions.
469:1076	The remainder of this section will present my ideas on how to approach this task.
470:1076	The pT.ocess which I have used IUL.
471:1076	finding primitives entails showing that one definition is derived from another thereby excluding the former as a candidate for being primitive.
472:1076	Such a demonstration of a derivational relationship requires a parser.
473:1076	Each pattern which I observe b6 tween definitions helps to exclude fu~ ther definl tions and simultaneausly becomes part o?
474:1076	the parser.
475:1076	As 2 result, identincation of the charatteristics Lo be attached to eacfi def~nition does not have to *be accomplished all at once; as will bacome clear below, our purposes can be served as the components of thc parser sre det Ilneated.
476:1076	Thug, success does not require trill n~ticulat~nn of the parser before any parsing is init~ated.
477:1076	The following represents genegal observations about the form of the parses as it has emerged thus fax^.
478:1076	The rirst set of characteristics would result from the syntactic parsing of each definition.
479:1076	The purpose of this step would be simply to establish the syntactic pattern of each definltion.
480:1076	The output of this step would be similar to that generated by Winoqrad (1972) in h~s parser.
481:1076	The 'dictionaryt for the parser would be the very lictionary we are analyzing, although only the main entry, its inflectional forms, and its part-of-speech label would be used in this step.
482:1076	Ambiguous parsings and failures would be kicked out; the failures in particular, would provide an excellent source for refinlng the parser used by Winograd.
483:1076	Clewly, this step is fiat trivial, and, it might even be argued that it is beyond the state-of-the-art.
484:1076	25 However, by using a corpus as large as a dictimnary and by kicking out failures and ambiguities, I believe that this step will significant3 advance the state-of-the-art The second set of characteristics would be determined from a semantic parsing of the definitions, that is, an attempt to identify the cases snd semantic components present within each definition.
485:1076	For this study I have found the followinp; distinction to be useful: 4 case is a semantic entity which is not intrinsic to the meaning of a word, e.g. that eomeone ~s an agent of an action, whereas a component; 1s an intrinsic pert of the meaning, e.g. a human being is animate It is necessary to artl culate recognition rules for determining that a particular case or semantic component is present The 1ittA.e thdt has been done ta develop such rules has &en based prl~arily on syntwtic structures or a prlorl assertions that a given case or conponent is present.
486:1076	Despite the recc mized deficiencj es of dictionaries, I be3ieve that it is possible to-bring much greater rigor to such rules with evidence gleaned directly fi om the definitions.
487:1076	For example, cut has a definition, "penetrate with an ins%rurnenVt ; this defin~tion irJould be parsed as having the instrument case.
488:1076	(Note also that this definition makes the instrument case intrinsic to cut).
489:1076	Havnver, in most cnnen.
490:1076	it will be necessary to examine the definitions of the,constituent woras.
491:1076	For example, the verb knife has the definition, tf cut with a knifetf; although it is quite obvzous in this instance that a knife is an instrument, rigor demands that we go to its aef inltlons where we flnd, " a sample instrument . . .
492:1076	4 great leal of analysls may ultimately be requlred to discern the intrash character~atics to be attached to a definition, but I beli-eve that many of these can come from the dictionary itself rather than grom ~ntuition.
493:1076	Although the nuaber of cases and components discussed in the literature is nut very large, the number of ways dn whlch they may be expressed, at least &n English, is slgnlficantly larger.
494:1076	In addition, there is sl ell a large amount of ambigutty, e, not every form spec.if.ically indicates the presence of a particular case.
495:1076	For example, a defjnaon, "act with haste" does no$ indxcate that "hasteft An an instrument: rather, "with haste" expresses a manner of actlng.
496:1076	Unraveling all these nuances requires a great deaE of effort.
497:1076	However, it appears that a partlcalarly good source of help i,n this endeavor might be found in the definitions of preposlti~ks (which are used pr3manly to indicate sense relations).
498:1076	Bennett 1975 found it possable to express the meaning of spatial and temporal pregosit:ions (a high percentage of all prepositions) with only 23 components.
499:1076	However, in Websterls.
500:1076	the number of then deflnltions is at least two ordera of mag nJ tudes hlgher.
501:1076	The d~fference seems to he in the "apparenC polysemyu vrh~ch, as Bennett says, arlses from the lncluszon in preposl tl onal definltlons of "redundant features already determined by the enylronment".
502:1076	In other words, many preposit,ional def~nltlons contam lnformatlon about the context surrounding 27 the pr~osition, pa~ticularly what sort of entities are related by the prepositions.
503:1076	My examination of verb defintions containing prepositions haa led to the observation of many noticeable word patterns, i.e. collocations, which appear to be uaful xh the recognition ~f cases.
504:1076	For example, one definition of af states that its object indicates something irom which a person or thingis delivered".
505:1076	In examining verb definitions, there appears to be a distinct set of verbs with which tnls sense is used in the following frame ft( transit Sve verb) (ooject) of ( something)".
506:1076	The verbs that fit the slat are exemplified by free, clear, relieve, and rld.
507:1076	Thus, if this pattern appears, the object of the preposition can be assigned the meaning It something from which a person or thing is blivered".
508:1076	cfChrough the use of prepositional bfinitions in this way, I have therefore been able to articulate some semantic recognition rules by which the arllst, or cage of a noun phrase the object c P a preposition) can be identified.
509:1076	My use of this technique has barely begun, so that it?
510:1076	is presently unclear whether this appmach will suffice to discldse all the caE informatl~n that we wish to identify ~ith a senantic parser, but if not it will tfertainly make significant strides toward this objective.
511:1076	Parsing of a definition according to the greceding notions is still not sufficient to identify'the semantic components which should be attached to a main entry, since much af the sermntic content is only present by virtde of -the definition's constituent wsrds.
512:1076	Thus, a compl ete rendering of a definnion' s 28 semantic content must be derived from the sernantlc characte~istics of Its constituents, in a recursive fa~hiong all the way down to the primitives.
513:1076	Although -identification of these primitives is the primary go-1 of the aoproach being presented here, and Wce, intrinsically incomplete until the analysls is completed, the set ol semantic characteristics for a particular definitian can be developed as we proceed towdrd our goal.
514:1076	Yo do this, it will be necessary to articulate rules whlch indicate hou semantic characteristics may be transmitted from me definition to another.
515:1076	An example of such a rule is: If the noun X possesses the semantic component "animatem, and if X iti the noun genus) the noun Y will also have the component ltanimate".
516:1076	Another exarhple is: If a verb X has a definition x whlch has been parsed as having an instrument case, and X is the core verb of a definitlor, y 3 of Y, and y. also has been parsed as having the instrument case, J then the instrument in J is "a type ofs tne i~istrurnent ia xi.
517:1076	j It will also be necessary to articulate other derivational (such as the application of a causative derivation to a state vqb) and transformational (such as the application of a rrerundid transformation to any verb) rules.
518:1076	This process of delineating how semantic characteristics are trmsmitted will at fhe same time give more meaning to the lines of the diotionary d~graph than simply "is used to definett.
519:1076	The third, and final, set Q-f characteristics $hat must be attached to a definition is a s~ecifieation of the context that must be present if that def rn~tlon intended.
520:1076	The context re& stnc~lons may requme mat the deflnlendum must be used in a particular syntactical way, for example, as a trms~l lvn or intranslkive verb.
521:1076	Usage restrict&ons may speclfy the presence of partlcdar wor& such as particles or objects.
522:1076	For example, there is a distinct set of defin~tions for the ~dlom take -.I out whrch thus requlres the presence of the partlcle "outll zn addltion tc the verb.
523:1076	One definition of the transityve verb chuck requires the object Itbaseballt1.
524:1076	Other defln~tlons may requlre a speclflc subaect.
525:1076	~~nilly, there are sernant1-e restrlttlons that may be dis~ernlble only from the definition itself.
526:1076	For examp3re two deflnltlons of the verb chew r re: "to give new hope toit 7and llllft from olscouragement, dejection, or sadness to a more happy state"; lf the seco~d deflnltlon 1suatended, it seems necessary that the context lndlcate the prlor state of dlscouragement, de jectlon, or sadness, slnce we cannot presume such a state, for someone mlght have been zin a happy or non-sad state dnd simply recelved some new hope.
527:1076	In the absence of the necessary context, we would default to the flrst defmxtlon.
528:1076	Thus far in my research, I have not devoted any effart toward, developln~ ~rocedures for prescrlblng the context based o* the deflnat~on.
529:1076	I expect that lnltlat~on of thls step'wlll beneflt f~pm further results of the first two steps.
530:1076	Although the parslng system outllned in thls section may appear to be exceedingly cornplaw, such an eventuality is not unex~~cted.
531:1076	The character1s"t~os to be attached to each def in&30tion are not significantly different from those proposed by Fillmore 1971.
532:1076	It is also important to no-ce xnax some of the goals of analyzing the contents of a dictionary are to reduce the amount of redundancy, to remcnre vicious circles, ad to represent the meaning 6f a word in a more efficient way.
533:1076	Hopefully, this type of analysis would eventually leqd to a substantial reduction in the size of a dictionary; the prospects for thls are considered further in the next section, 8.
534:1076	THE ULTIMATE MODEL: POINTS AS CONCEPTS At this juncture, it is necessary to ask whether the points of the digraph models sufficiently corl espond to meaning as we wish it to be represented.
535:1076	In the two models described thus far,,the analysis of a definition was deemed complete when the appropriate definitions of the const$tuent words had been identdfied.
536:1076	This situation 1s not entirely, satisfactory, since, if a constituent word has more than one definition that applies, the definitior being analyzed is subject to more than one interpre bation and hence may be called ambiguous with respect to that constituent.
537:1076	For example, if the two definrtions of abroad, "over a wide -nrea" an4 "at largeH, fit the definition of broadcast to yield either Itthe act of spreading over a wide areat1 or "the acd of spreading at larget1, it is not legitimate to exclude one.
538:1076	This situa Lion is only a reflection of the fact that natural language is almost always somewhat ambiguous.
539:1076	However, in accepting this fact, it is necessary that we incoqorate it into our models, Parts of the parsing system described in the last section will help to discriminate and select those defini-ti~ns of a constltuent word whioh fit n given context.
540:1076	As the parser is refined, the candidates for a particular context will be narrowed as described in Section 6, but many instances will remain where more than one del hition fits the context.
541:1076	We might say that any point representing more than one definition thus constitutes an ambiguity.
542:1076	Viewed differently, we might also scy that the context is not sufficient to distinguish among all the defitions of a word, In other words, we can-tbLamer the ambigu?
543:1076	ity on the context We must expect that ambiguity will be present in the dictionary and deal with it on that basis.
544:1076	Fgr purposes of illustration, let us say that abroad shown in FLgure 4 1s one such point.
545:1076	To remove such points from the d graph, we must make two points for the definition oj broadcast, ope repsmenting "the act of spreading abraaditt and one representing "the act of spreading abroad2".
546:1076	These two points use the same words for expressin$ a definition and will-be distinguishable only by the fact that their underlying definitions are different.
547:1076	Because of this situation, it is no longer valid to say that a point of the model represents a definition: rather, we will say that a point represents a lfconceptfl.
548:1076	It is also pessibxe that the concepts represented by two or more points can be shown to be equivalent.
549:1076	Ihe concept, *'the act of spreading absoadft, has men shown to be equivalent to "the act of spreading over a wide arealt.
550:1076	If the latter phraseology appears under some main entry, say distribution, then bath it and the definition of broadcast would eventually be an.
551:1076	slyzed in the same way.
552:1076	We will say that both expressions may represent the same concept and hence are equivalent at least to this extent.
553:1076	(since the-other definitions of these words would be dif fwent they are not totally equivalent).
554:1076	This concept will thus be represented by one point, labeled by either broadcast or distribution and equi'ra1ent.l~ verbalized as '!the act of 7 spreading or "the act of spreading over a wide This interpretation is a reflection of the fact that in ordinary speech a single coacept may be verbalized in mbre than one way, The observations in this sectlon lead to the following description of the 'ultimate' model: The semantic content of a dictionary may be represented by means of a digraph in which (1) a point represents a distinct concept, which may be verbalized in more than one way and may have more than one label, and to which is appended a set of syntactic, semantic, and usage features, and (2) a line represents an instance bf some one of a set of cxperators which act on the verbalizations or labels of a point according to the feafures of that point to ield the parametric values of another point.
555:1076	It should go without saying that the cpmplete portrayal of a dictionary according to this model requir,es a considerable amouht of further work; nonethejess, I believe that the model provides the appropriateframework for describing a dictionary.
556:1076	9.
557:1076	PROCBDURBS . FOR FINDING THE PRIMIEIVES In Section 3, I stated that the model of a dictionary shouid permi t Lhe transformation of each definition into i ta pqimitivecomponents.
558:1076	Based on the pneceding deacriptl ws.
559:1076	it is sugge~ted tha-c tHe 1x1~ articulatio~ of the ultimate model wxll satiqfy this objective for the following reasons: ( I) An elementary Fheorem in the theory of digraphs1 maerts that every digraph has a poin, basis, that is, a set of points from which every point in the digraph may be reached.
560:1076	Since points represent concepts in the ultimate model, it seems reasonable to assert that the point basis of its tligraph represents the set 09 prirnftive concepts out of which all bthers iri the dictionary may be formed.
561:1076	Based on the characteristics of the mints in that model, it is possible (and perhape even necessary) that each primitive cancept would be verbalized in several ways and symbolised in several way$ (as will be shown below) (2) Since the digraph has a finlte number of points and lines, the sets of primitive concepts and operators are also finite.
562:1076	It dllly remains Do ?find the primitive concepts; this will be done by applying rules, based oh the models and the parsing system, ta identify words and definitions which cannot %be primitives.
563:1076	Essentially, the assertion that a word or definition is non-prim~tive requires a showlng that it is derived from a more primitive concept and that a primitive cannut be derived from 58 34 it.
564:1076	These non-primitives can be set aside and their Pull syntactic and semantic characterization can be accamplished after the primitives have been identified.
565:1076	Although no primitives have yet been identifieti (since the described procedures have not been fully applied), then form and nature will be delineated, To dernoqstrate the validity of my approach, 1 have bPe~ applying rules developed thus far t'o the set of verbs in Websterr's Thud New Internatronal Dictionary ( 20,000 verbs and their 111,000 definitions).
566:1076	This set was chosen because of their importance (cf.
567:1076	Chafe 19'70) and the (bare) feasibility of coping with them manually (although it may be another 3-4 years before I am finisheh,.
568:1076	at my current rate of progress).
569:1076	I have attempted to formulate my procedures with some rigor, keeping in mind the ultimqte necessity of computerieat~on.
570:1076	I have developed some detailed specifications for some of my procedures, envisioning the use of computer tapes developed by Olney, but have not completed these since I do not presently have acoess to a computer.
571:1076	Despite the focus on verbs, it will become clear that words from other nnrts of speech are inextricably involved in the analysis.
572:1076	Also, the rules that are presented can, for the most part.
573:1076	be applzed to other parts of speech.
574:1076	lotwithst;indi?lg the fact that the meaning of many verbs is derived in part from nouns and adjectives, I believe that each verb definition alsu, contains a primitive verb constituent.
575:1076	Lacn vero aeunltlon conslsts of a core verb (~bllgatory) and some dlfferenxlae (opt~onal).
576:1076	he deflnxtions of other parts of speech have a similar structure, i.t. a core unit fron the same part of speech and some hfferentlae).
577:1076	The subgraph of the total dictionary digraph formed by core verbs accords fully wlth the models described LJI Sectlane 4, 5, and 7.
578:1076	Therefore, any rules developed on the basls of those models wlll apply equally to the verb subgraph.
579:1076	We need only keep An m~nd that the differentiae come from other parts, of speech and become embodied ~n the core verb.
580:1076	Thrs 1s Bow the verb cu% comes to have the lnstrurnent case ~ntrinslcally.
581:1076	To begln the analysis, we will let E represent the set of those vnrb deflnltlons whlch have been Adentifled as non-prlmxtlve; ~nltlally, thls set i& empty.

590:1076	In W3, this rule applies to approximately 13,800 verbs out of 20,000; the number of definitions in the verbs excluded is not known, Rule 2.
591:1076	If a verb main entry is used only as the core unit of definitions already placed in E, then all its definitions may also be placed in E. his rule applies to points of the basic mceel with pusitive outdegree.
592:1076	The uses of su* verbs as core units follow definitional paths that dead-end; hence, they cannot be primitive.

595:1076	digrapn where the verb cake defines only barkle, which in turn is not used to define!
596:1076	any verb.
597:1076	Thus, the definitions of cake may be included in E after the definitions of barkle have been entbred, In W3, this rule applies to approximately 1400 of the 6200 verbs that remained after application of Rule 1.
598:1076	Rule 3, If the verbs-forrnang a strong component are not used as core units in any definitions except those in the strong componwt or in definitions of verbs already placed in E by Rules 1.
599:1076	2, or 3, =then the definit,ions of all verbs in the strong component may be placed in E.
600:1076	(This rule applies to points of &he basic model which constitute a ptrong component, i. e. a maximal let of points such that for every two points, u and v, there are paths from u to v and from v to.
601:1076	u. This rule does not apply when he strong component consists of all points not yet placed in E).

603:1076	aerify air aera*e f ventilate oxygenate Figure 7.
604:1076	Basic mod&, verb subgraph example subject to Rule 3.
605:1076	Except for oxygenate, the other verbs defining the set constltuting the strong component are not shown.
606:1076	Shce it is possible to start at any of the four and follow a path to any other of the four, there as no real generic hierarchy among *them.
607:1076	It is possible to emerge from the strorlg component and follow paths to pram, eventilate and perflate, to whlch, however, Rule 1 applies.
608:1076	If we follow a definitional path that leads ihto thls strong component, we can never get out agaln or if .we tlo we will only dead-end.
609:1076	Hence, the de finitions of all the verbs in the strong component are not primitive and may be placed in E. In WJ, this rule applies to approximatelv 150 of the 4800 remaining after the application of Rule 2.
610:1076	Actually, Rules 2 and 3 may be applied in tandem; based on those placed in E. Thus, 38 after Rule 3 places the%def~nltlons of aerate, aer~fy, -9 alr and.
611:1076	ventilate in b, it so happens that ilule 2 then applles to the definitions ~f oxuenate.
612:1076	After Rules 1.2, and 3 are applied t~ the digraph or the baslc model, tne remaining polnts constitute a strong component of approximately 4500 polnts.
613:1076	Thls dlffers from those to which Rule 3 applies in that there'would be no ~olnts left if we placed all it8 polnts in E. phis flnal stro~g component 1s the basls set of the basic model, that is, any point of the basic model (1.
614:1076	e. any main entry in the dictionary) may be reached from any point in the final strong compo'nent (but not conversely) * kt th.is juncture, we can proceed no further w.i;h the basic model alone; it .is necessary to expand the points of the final strong component lnto two or more points each representing a subset of the definitions represented by the orlglnal point, as previously shown in Flgure 3, In part, this can be laccompllshed by ~derl,Llfylng ~ndividual definitions which are not used.
615:1076	Rule 4.
616:1076	If !any definition can be shown to be not used as the sense of any core unlt (or only those already in E), it may be placed in E. Th,is rule is essent:ia$ly a restatement of Rule 1 for xad~vidual definitions and includes the following two subrules, among others nat presented.
617:1076	Rule 4a.
618:1076	If all the rema,in,ing uses of a verb are trans1 tlver ( intransitive) then .its :intransitive ( trans.it.ive) defini* tions are not,used and may be placed in E. The exp'anslon of a poinl into transitive and intransitifire uses is a good examole of how the points of the basic model are transformed into pgints of the expanded model.
619:1076	Rule 4b.
620:1076	12 a definition is rn ked by a status, label (e.g. archaic or obsolete),, a subject labs or a subject-guide phrase, it may be pldced in E. Lexicographers creating W3 were instructed not to use such marked definitionn in defining any other word.
621:1076	Other ?rules have been developed in an at,kernot to identify $he specific sense of the core verb, or those senses of n verb which have not been used in deyining other verbs, but are not presented here.
622:1076	However, there are too many instances where the differentiae of a definition do not provide sufficient context to exclude all but one sense (for example, many senses of move fit into a definition phrased "move quickly").
623:1076	In order to continue toward the primitxves, we must shift gears slightly and ask whether a definition can be characterized as llcomplexv, that is, derived from more primitive elements.
624:1076	For example, one befinition of make is "cause to be", which can be labeled as complex aecause it conbists of a causative, component and a state component, each of which is more primitive by it~elf than lcause to be", The importaqqe of the notion of a complex definition becomes evident when we try to viaualiee how a primitive concept wd.11~ be identified.
625:1076	To understand this, -re must consid-er some further properties of the digraph.
626:1076	After the application of 40 64 nuie and any Subsequent rule), the remaining graph is a findl sProng component.
627:1076	(~ecall that in a strong component, for each two points, u and v, there is a path from u to v and one from v to u. ) Assuming that each point aepresents a concept (as in the ultimate model), the fact that two concepts are in the same strong component means thdt they are e~uivalen4.
628:1076	In more traditional terms, what we have is a definitional vicious circle, . that is, a definitronal chain which adds nothing to our Undeistanding of the meahings invol ved.
629:1076	Using the digraph of the final strong component, we can identify (and examine one by one) all putative definitional cycles or vicious clrcles; these will fall into three classes.
630:1076	The first class will konsist of improper cycles, whiqh can be removed by determining that one poifit is more complex (and hence not equivalent to the definition from which it is derived) Further rules for_ characterizing a definition as complex are given below.
631:1076	The second class of cycles will be real viclous circles, which fortunately can be removed, but only under certain conditions.
632:1076	For example, one definition of jockey is "maneuver for advantage", while one definition of maneuver is "jockey for positionN; these two definitions constitute a vicious circle.
633:1076	In order to remove it, the~e must be some other definition of either verb whicn constitutes its meaning; in this case, it is found under maneuver, specifically, "shift tacticst1.
634:1076	Thus, in order to remove a vicious circle, we must find some way out.
635:1076	If we cannot, we have the third class of cycles; this class will comprise %he set of basic concepts.
636:1076	If there had been no way out for the example of jockey and maneuver we would have said that no meaning was conveyed by eitber -9 Vera, but rather that the meaning was established by use.
637:1076	This third set of cycles is what is sought by the procedures described inathis paper.
638:1076	As mentioned above, the crux of the analysis after the application, ~f Rules 1 to 4 is the iaenfjfication of complex con& cepts.-Essentially this entails a showing that, for any definitlon yi of verb Y, with Y as the core verb of definition x of 3 verb X, the differentiae of x, make yi generic to x . For exam3 J ple, all transitive definitions of cut would be generic to a definition in which "cut1f is used with an object, even without narrowing down to one definition.
639:1076	The general rule may now be stated, Ru1.e 5.
640:1076	If any definition is identified as complex, it may be placed in E, The net effect of this rule is to brea~ one or 1 L more putative cycles hf equivalent definitions or concepts, enabling them to be transformed into a strict hierarchical order which will eventually be subject to Rule 4.
641:1076	Thus, the complex defiriition and all definitions that can be shown to be derived therefrom dan be placed in E, be cause they cannot be part of a primitive cycle.
642:1076	Rule 5 is implemenBed only by very specific recognition rules, which are essentially part of the parser.
643:1076	The specific rules entail a showing that some component has teen added in 42 the differentiae of a definition that is not present in the II meanings of its core verb.
644:1076	For example, the limannern component is not htrinsic to the meaning of the verb moveo therefore, -9 when a daiinition has the core verb flmovett with an adverb of manner, it can be marked as complex.
645:1076	In establishing a component as non-intrinsic, it is necessary to articulate rules for recognizing the presence of the "mannerft component (such as a phrase in.8 manner" or an "-ly1!
646:1076	word with a aefinition 'hn a mannerl1) apd then to deterrnlne if that component is present in any definitions of a particular verb.
647:1076	If not, then the verb can be labeled as complex whenever it is used asthe core verb in a definition with differentiae that% fit the recognitinn rule.
648:1076	In addition to move I have determined that, for -9 the manner component, the verbs act, perform, ater, speak, exII press, behave, and many others follow the rul e. Table 1, on the next page, identifies some specific components, a brief descxiption of how they are recognized, some of the verbs to which the particular rule applies, and an -example of a gefinition labeled as complex by the rule and hence placed In E, If a definition has a. ccre verb whose applicable sense is one which has been marked as complex, it too can oe so marked, since it is derived from a complex definition.
649:1076	For example, all definitions of the forq "make aajectiveqi, i.e. with an adjective complement, are deri'ved from the definition of -9 make "cause to be or become" and hence can be marked as complex.

Through the devel~pment and application of further papsing rules under Rule 5, I am hopeful that I will eventually arrive at the set of primitive verb concepts (i.e. cycles or vlcious circles with no way out).
657:1076	I have already reduced the number of verbs from 20,000 to less than 4,000.
658:1076	This number would be mucH lover, But TOY the fact that I am applyiqg the rules manually and I must ex8yiise %me-consuming,care to emure correatmess.
659:1076	After the primitive concepts have been identified, it will be necessary to gg back to all the definitions that were set aside in the process of finding the primitives, so that then semantic characteristics can be articulated.
660:1076	5 fully expect that the parsing system which will have been deveoped will be able to accomplish much of this task I also expect that the parsing system will have equal applicability as a general parser capable of formally characterizing ordinary discourse in a canonical form.
661:1076	Of course, verification of this expectation will have tn await a full presentation of the parser.

663:1076	R8LATIONSHlP TO'EFFORTS TO REPRESENT KNOWLEDGE IN FRAMES The process whkch has been outlined ifi the preceding sections is closely akin to current efrorts to represent knowledge in frames.
664:1076	(~f. Winston 1977 for an elementary presentation* of 'this notion).
665:1076	Briefly, a frame consists of a fixed set of arguments, some of which may be specif.ically related to others, and some of which may have specific values.
666:1076	frame 1s intended to 69 45 rppresent a stereotyped situation, with the arguinems identifying the various attributes which the situation always possesses.
667:1076	In terms of case grammar, for e~ample, a movement frame will contain arguments or slots for an agent, an instrument, and a destination.By tying frames togeSher in spepific relationships, we can build larger and larger frames to represent more and more knowledge, perhaps constructing a series of events, an inferencp structrye, or a de8c~4ption of a scarre.
668:1076	Before bnilding these large structures, it is necessary to represent very small pieces of knowledge.
669:1076	Heretbforc, this has been done by postulating the components of frames to represent such things as actions and state changes.
670:1076	Butthis can be accomplished an a more rigorous basis.
671:1076	Por example, if we first locate all definitions using "move" as its core verb and then identify all the case structures in which it 1s used, we wqll have a generalized frame which characterjzes most if not all of the possible uses of *lrnove1l.
672:1076	(This approach ds currently being followed by Slmmons 1977).
673:1076	Each definition in which tlmovell is used could then be representea by the generalized frame with some of itb slots fllled.
674:1076	This process can be followed for any word for which we wish to develop a frame, If,_ ln addition, we analyzed the definitions of -* move we will find that they, in turn, represent instantiations of still o3her frames, which will be even more generalised than those developed for the uses of ftmoveft, The difference between the frames representing the definitipns of move and those represent46 ing the uses of "move" is that the latter are the same as the former wlth some slots filled.
675:1076	Within the bounds of the ambl~uity preselit in the dictionary, this stut-filling will identlfy which definition of move are employed in which uses of umove".
676:1076	It seema C.0 me that this ir nothing,more than the process which has already been described using a graph-theoretic naproach, except that the generalhxed frame for each verb will not be, carzied along tnrough each step.
677:1076	Moreover, si.nce the semantic parslng sy-stem which has been described wi13 be based largely on the relationships derived from he definitions of prepositions,,, and these comprise most of the case relationships, the parsing system will effectively circumscribe the ~errnissible elements (i. e. slots) which can be, present, glven any particular.
678:1076	context.
679:1076	Thus, although the phraseol~y ik different, the effect is the same, If there is ali essential equivalence between these two approaches, then.
680:1076	since frames purport to represent knowledge, the process described; if successful, will result in an articulation of whatever knswledge is contained in a dictionary, What this implles is that the lexicon cofitains a great deal of knowledge about the world and not just information which will er+ able us to understand such knowledge, Frames provide a 'great deal of inslght to the approach which has been described here, but the reverse also seems to hold true.
681:1076	If the semantic content of each defihition can be captured, then it map be possible to~articulate the frame for any utterance by combinihg the characteristics of the definition$ of Yts constituent words within what\is permitted by the parsing system.
682:1076	I 1, FINAL REMARKS 5 In Section 1, I described some limitatzons of this paper and my research.
683:1076	This paper suffers from a lack of sufficient detail to enabl,e a reader oP researcher to replicate what I have done or to take the next steps of cbmputerizing the procedures whrch I have developed.
684:1076	I will provide further details bn the specific steps I have followed in reducing the set of verbs from 20,000 to 4,000 to anyone requesting.
685:1076	With respect to compqter specifications, I have prepared some, but stopped because I have no access to a computer, However, if any researcher 1s interested in pursuing this (or setting graduate students to work), I am prepared to develop the necessary specifications and to work hand-in-hand for the further advancement and refinemekt of this methodology, I also ~ndicated in Section 1 that my research presently shows no final res,z4lts and that I do not even know how much further effort-will be necessary to explicate tfi% parsing system which has been described.
686:1076	Clearly, there are great dmtances yet to be covered toward a goal of being capable of transformin& ordinary discourse into a canohical form.
687:1076	I believe that characterization of the contents of an ordinary dictionary 1s an essential step in attaining this goal, and I am hopeful' that my approash c&n be used to develop such a characterization.
688:1076	7 2 48 If it seems worthwhile to pursue this approach, despite the limitations, I believe the best way to do so would be to establish a single computer-based repository for a dictionary, preferably W3, with @h-line access to researchers across the countLJ, and to build the parser and definitional.
689:1076	charac-terizations piece by piece.
690:1076	(I have noted how the parsing system which I have described can be built incrementally).
691:1076	The magnitude of this effort Precludes much progress by individual researchers.
692:1076	Olney tried to do something similar with the collegiate dictionary baged on W3, but by distributing bulky computer tapes.

824:1076	Under the heading of "Civil Liberties : Privacy, the President said : Government and privateinstitutions collect increasingly large amounts of personal data and use them to make many crucial decisions about indfviduals.
825:1076	Much of this 'information is needed to enforce laws, deliver benefits, provide credit, and conduct similar, important services.
826:1076	~bwever, these interests must be balanced against the individuals right to privacy and against the harm that unfair uses of infarmation can cause.
827:1076	Individuals shoul'd be able to know what information organizations collect and maintain about them; they should be able to correct inaccbrate records; and there should be limits on the disclosure of particularly sensitive personal information.

977:1076	) A APRIL, 1979 AFIPS WASHINGTON REPORT Thomgs Pickering, Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans 4 International 93 Environmental & Scientific, Affairs, tqld the gathering that the State aepartment would publish internal papers on tramborder data flow issues (issues relating to the international tkansmission af computer data) a fter the President's Privacy Initiative has been approved and announced.
978:1076	The papers were scheduled to be released by the Government Printing ffice in early March.
979:1076	The State Department was also scheduled to =c?nvene a one-day seminar on transborder data flows last month.
980:1076	~mbassador.
981:1076	Herbert Hleman, of the U.S. Mission to the Organization for Economlc Cooperation and Development (OECD), said that the most important unresolved issues before the OECD Drafting and Expert Groups are tfk inclusion of manual files, inclusion or exclusion of legal persons (i.e. corporations and certain other legal entities), handling of 9 sensitive data, and establishment of a mechanism for the rtssolution of disputes.
982:1076	CoveraH >f Manual F,ibs.
983:1076	According to William Fishan, of the Nat~onal re1 ecommunications and Information Administrat ion (NTJA), the U. S . has taken the $osition that it is conceptually unsound to distinguish between automatic and manual processing when working to insure privacy protection.
984:1076	In some technical areas (such as microfiche technology), it is impossible to say whether the processing is manual o'r automatic.
985:1076	since it includes aspects of both.
986:1076	U.S. domestic law doy not draw the distinction.
987:1076	Fishman noted that distinguishing between automatic and manual processing would weaken the "moral authorityw of the guidelines.
988:1076	knally, he said that restricting thC guidelines to automat~c processing sould cause governments to retreat to manual files tp evade the effect of the guidelines.
989:1076	Fishman noted, on the other hand, that most ~uiopean legislation only affects automatic processing.
990:1076	The Europeans also point out that the origin of these privaoy concerns comes, from computer developments.
991:1076	They also claim that it would be difficult for their data inspection boards to cover the many sensitive uses of manual files.
992:1076	Inclusion of Legal Persons {Corporations) as Protected Parties . Flshman observed that' privacy protecti~n is a civil rights Issue in the U.S. a~ld not an issue of corporate regulation.
993:1076	In the U. S. view, limialng protection to natural persons would make th guxdelines relate more clemly to privacy issues.
994:1076	The U.S. believes that the OECD is not in any event in a position to bro%de~ %he guidelines to include legal persons until it has studied thef area.
995:1076	Fishman conceded that some European laws cover legal persons (with some variation among them].
996:1076	In some cases, wsmaller'L legal persons would be excluded from coverage.
997:1076	He zeta that the draft treaty of the Council df Europe would cover legal persons.

999:1076	J~GS Privacy Motivations, Not Trade Protectiqn.
1000:1076	Fishman elnphasf zed that the U.S. see6the current effort as motivated largely by griwcy concerns -civil rights, democratic concerns.
1001:1076	While some nations, clearly want to limit **reign data processing from their markets, Fishman said that that interest is not significant in the current OECD effort.
1002:1076	APRIL, 1979 AFIPS WASHINGTON REPORT Another Meeting Scheduled; Subcommittee Expanded.
