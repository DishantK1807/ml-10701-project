Although some recent systems indicate an improvement over the baseline (Mihalcea, 2005; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005), statistical significance has not been shown.

Jing showed, for 300 news articles, that 19% of human-generated summary sentences contain no matching article sentence (Jing, 2002).

We also include the sum of news query terms in Si, given by NT+(Si) = summationtextq∈Si p(q), and the relative probability of news query terms in Si, given by NTr(Si) = summationtext q∈Si p(q) |Si|. We perform term disambiguation on each document using an entity extractor (Cucerzan, 2007).

The methods include binary classifiers (Kupiec et al., 1995), Markov models (Conroy et al., 2004), Bayesian methods (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005; Aone et al., 1998), and heuristic methods to determine feature weights (Schiffman, 2002; Lin and Hovy, 2002).
