For multilingual applications, a popular approach is to carry out monolingual WSD and then map the source language senses into the corresponding target word translations (Carpuat and Wu, 2005; Montoyo et al., 2002).

Ide (1999), for example, analyzes translations of English words into four different languages, in order to check if the different senses of an English word are lexicalized by different words in all the other languages.

In fact, although it has been agreed that WSD is more useful when it is meant for a specific application (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), little has been done on the development of WSD modules specifically for particular applications.

Vickrey et al.(2005), e.g., show that the inclusion of a WSD module significantly improves the performance of their statistical MT system.

Bentivogli et al.(2004) proposed an approach to create an Italian sense tagged corpus (MultiSemCor) based on the transference of the annotations from the English sense tagged corpus SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), by means of wordalignment methods.

between translators In an attempt to quantify the agreement between the two groups of translators, we computed the Kappa coefficient for annotation tasks, as defined by Carletta (1996).

Similarly, Ng et al.(2003) employ EnglishChinese parallel word aligned corpora to identify a repository of senses for English.
P03-1058
In subsequent work (Ide et al., 2002), seven languages and clustering techniques are employed to create sense groups based on the translations.

Diab and Resnik (2002) use multilingual information to create an English sense tagged corpus to train a monolingual WSD approach.
P02-1033
Conversely, Carpuat and Wu (2005) found that WSD does not yield significantly better translation quality than a statistical MT system alone.

They are motivated by the argument that the senses of a word should be determined based on the distinctions that are lexicalized in a second language (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997).
