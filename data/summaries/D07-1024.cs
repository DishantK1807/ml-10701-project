We adapt the idea of Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) to the task of identifying protein-protein interaction sentences.

Here, they also test the methods ELCS (Extraction Using Longest Common Subsequences) (Bunescu et al., 2005) and SSK (Subsequence Kernel) (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b).

Bunescu et al.(2005) have studied the performance of rule learning algorithms.

edit sim(pi,pj) = e−γ(edit distance(pi,pj)) (2) Bunescu and Mooney (2005a) propose a similar method for relation extraction in general.

This corpus is becoming a standard, as it has been used in the recent studies by (Bunescu et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005b; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006; Mitsumori et al., 2006; Yakushiji et al., 2005).
