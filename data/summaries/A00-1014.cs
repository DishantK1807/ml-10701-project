Selection Previous work has argued that initiative affects the degree of control an agent has in the dialogue interaction (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998).

The strategies employed when MIMIC has only dialogue initiative are similar to the mixed initiative dialogue strategies employed by many existing spoken dialogue systems (e.g., (Bennacef et al., 1996; Stent et al., 1999)).

Since task initiative models contribution to domain/problemsolving goals, while dialogue initiative affects the cur5An alternative strategy to step (4) is to perform a database lookup based on the ambiguous query and summarize the results (Litman et al., 1998), which we leave for future work.

Figure 2(a) shows the frame-based semantic representation for the utterance "What time is Analyze This playing 2 See (Nakatani and Chu-Carroll, 2000) for how MIMIC's dialoguelevel knowledge is used to override default prosodic assignments for concept-to-speech generation.

Furthermore, a number of performance features, largely based on the PARADISE dialogue evaluation scheme (Walker et al., 1997), were automatically logged, derived, or manually annotated.

Using a vector-based topic identification process (Salton, 1971; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999), these keywords are used to determine a set of likely values (including null) for that attribute.
