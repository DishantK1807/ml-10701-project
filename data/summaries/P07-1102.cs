To do so, we use the measure of priming strength established by Reitter et al.(2006b), which then allows us to test whether priming interacts with task success.

In a previous corpus-study, using transcriptions of spontaneous, task-oriented and non-task-oriented dialogue, utterances were annotated with syntactic trees, which we then used to determine the phrasestructure rules that licensed production (and comprehension) of the utterances (Reitter et al., 2006b).

Church (2000) proposes adaptive language models to account for lexical adaptation.

This method has been previously used to confirm priming effects for the general case of syntactic rules by Reitter et al.(2006b). Additionally, the GLM can take into account categorical and continuous covariates that may interact with the priming effect.

In our previous study (Reitter et al., 2006b), we found more syntactic priming in the task-oriented dialogues of the Map Task corpus than in the spontaneous conversation collected in the Switchboard corpus.

There may still be an influence of cognitive load due to speakers working on the task, or an overall disposition for higher priming in task-oriented dialogue: Reitter et al.(2006b) point at stronger priming in such situations.

Specific competing constructions such as active/passive, verbal particle placement or thatdeletion in English are often the object of study (Szmrecsanyi, 2005; Gries, 2005; Dubey et al., 2005; JÂ¨ager, 2006), but the effect can also be generalized to syntactic phrase-structure rules or combinatorial categories (Reitter et al., 2006a).

Classical priming effects are strong: around 10% for syntactic rules (Reitter et al., 2006b).

Features such as recognition error rates, natural language understanding confidence and context shifts, confirmations and re-prompts (dialogue management) have been used classify dia809 logues into successful and problematic ones (Walker et al., 2000).
