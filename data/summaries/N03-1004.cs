These distributions are modeled using a maximum entropy formulation (Berger et al., 1996), using training data which consists of human judgments of question answer pairs.

Answering Agent The second answering agent takes a statistical approach to question answering (Ittycheriah, 2001; Ittycheriah et al., 2001).

Traditional question answering (QA) systems typically employ a pipeline approach, consisting roughly of question analysis, document/passage retrieval, and answer selection (see e.g., (Prager et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2001; Clarke et al., 2001)).

In NLP, such methods have been applied to tasks such as POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998), word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999), and machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).

The definition-Q agent targets definition questions (e.g., “What is penicillin?” and “Who is Picasso?”) with a technique called Virtual Annotation using the external knowledge source WordNet (Prager et al., 2001).
H01-1006
In our own earlier work, we developed a specialized mechanism called Virtual Annotation for handling definition questions (e.g., “Who was Galileo?” and “What are antibiotics?”) that consults, in addition to the standard reference corpus, a structured knowledge source (WordNet) for answering such questions (Prager et al., 2001).
