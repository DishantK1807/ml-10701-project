The problem of choosing an appropria.te level in the h.ierarchy at which to represent a particular noun sense (given a predicate and argument position) has been investigated by Resnik (1993), Li and Abe (1998) and ll,iba,s (1995).

Yarowsky (1992) and \]{esnik (1993) explain how the noise introduced by this technique tends to dissipate as counts are passed up the hierarchy.

Further work will look at how to integrate probabilities such as p(clv, r) into a model of dependency structure, similar to that of Collins (1996) and Collins (1997), which can be used \['or parse selection.
