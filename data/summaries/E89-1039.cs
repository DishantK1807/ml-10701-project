With some caution, bowever, perhaps the following can be accepted as a summary of the pattem of results obtained so far: The syntactic structure is not too complex (Guindon et al, 1987, Reilly, 1987), and presumably within the capacity of current parsing technology.

523) One way of tackling this problem is to simulate the man-machine dialogue by letting users communicate with a background system through an interface which they have been told is a natural language interface, but which in reality is a person simulating such a device (sometimes called a Wizard of Oz experiment, see Guindon, Shuldberg, and Conner, 1987).

There is therefore in our opinion good reasons to believe that indirect speech acts can be handled by computational methods simpler than those developed by Perrault and co-workers, something which in fact seems compatible with the discussion in Perrault and Allen (1980).

Similar results were found by Guindon et al (1987), where only 3% of the utterances contained any pronouns.

Socalled ill-formed input (fragmentary sentences, ellipsis etc) is very frequent, but the use of pronouns seems limited (Guindon, et al, 1987, J0nsson and Dahlb/~ck, 11988).,However, the results concerning ill-formedness are difficult to evaluate, mainly because they are often presented without an explicit description of the linguistic representation used.

The language used has been described as 'formal' (Grosz, 1977), 'telegraphic' (Guindon et al, 1987), or 'computerese' (Reilly, 1987).
