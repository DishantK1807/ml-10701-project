Experiments We have ran LexTract on the one-millionword English Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and got two Treebank grammars.

A Head Percolation Table has previously been used in several statistical parsers (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997) to find heads of phrases.
P95-1037 P97-1003
There has been much work done on extracting Context-Free grammars (CFGs) (Shirai et al., 1995; Charniak, 1996; Krotov et al., 1998).
P98-1115
We choose those sections because several state-of-thwart parsers (Collins, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Charniak, 1997) are trained on Section 2-21 and tested on Section 23.

2 • We adopt the definition of derivation trees in (Schabes and Shieber, 1992) (which allows multiple adjunction at any node) and require all mod-etrees adjoin to the etree that they modify.
P92-1022
Previous evaluations (Doran et al., 1994; Srinivas et al., 1998) of the XTAG grammar use raw data (i.e., a set of sentences without syntactic bracketing).
C94-2149
Comparing with other CFG extraction algorithms such as the one in (Krotov et al., 1998), the CFGs produced by LexTract have several good properties.
P98-1115
(T2) Coordination in XTAG: the templates for coordinations in XTAG are generated on the fly while parsing (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996), and are not part of the 1004 templates.
C96-2103
As for Srinivas' results, we did not use the results reported in (Srinivas, 1997) and (Chen et al., 1999) because they are based on different training and testing data.

(For more discussion on the Chinese and the Korean Treebanks and the comparison between these Treebank grammars, see (Xia et al., 2000a)).
W00-1208
Supertaggers A Supertagger (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994; Srinivas, 1997) assigns an etree template to each word in a sentence.
C94-1024
It has been used in many NLP applications such as generation (Stone and Doran, 1997).
P97-1026
Our strategy for choosing heads is similar to the one in (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
We also ran the system on the 100-thousand-word Chinese Penn Treebank (Xia et al., 2000b) and on a 30-thousand-word Korean Penn Treebank.
W00-1208
In the last decade, LTAG has been used in several aspects of natural language understanding (e.g., parsing (Schabes, 1990; Srinivas, 1997), semantics (Joshi and Vijay-Shanker, 1999; Kallmeyer and Joshi, 1999), and discourse (Webber and Joshi, 1998)) and a number of NLP applications (e.g., machine translation (Palmer et al., 1998), information retrieval (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997), and generation (Stone and Doran, 1997; McCoy et al., 1992).
P92-1007 P97-1026 W98-0315
Second, the second baseline is slightly better than the first baseline, indicating using ~°Noticeably, the results we report on Srinivas' data, 85.78% on Section 23 and 85.53% on Section 22, axe lower than 92.2% reported in (Srinivas, 1997) and 91.37% in (Chen et al., 1999).
