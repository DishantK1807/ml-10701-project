Parameterization of the Interlingua in Machine Translation Bonnie Dorr* Institute for Advanced Computer Studies A.V.
Williams Building, Room 3157 University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 e-mail: bonnie@umiacs.umd.edu Abstract The task of designing an interlingual machine translation system is difficult, first because the designer must have n knowledge of the principles underlying cross~ linguistic distinctions for the languages under consideration, and second because the designer must then be able to incorporate this knowledge effectively into the system.
This paper provides a catalog of several types of distinctions among Spanish, English, and German, and describes a parametric approach that characterizes these distinctions, both at the syntactic level and at the lexical-semantic level.
The approach described here is implemented in a system called UNITRAN, a machine translation system that translates English, Spanish, and German bidirectionally.
1 Introduction
What makes the task of designing an interlingual machine translation system difficult is the requirement that the translator process many types of language-specific phenomena while still maintaining language-independent information about the source and target languages.
Given that these two types of knowledge (language.specific and languageindependent) are required to fulfill the translation task, one approach to designing a machine translation system is to provide a common language.
independent representation tiiat acts as a pivot between the source and target languages, and to provide a parameterized mapping between this form and the input and output of each language.
This is the approach taken in UNITRAN, a machine translation system that translates English, Spanish, *This paper describes research done at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Labo~ ratory.

'7-r Figure 1: Overall Design of the UN|TRAN System and German bidirectionally.
The pivot form that is used in this system is a lexical conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see Jackendoff(1983, 1990), Hale & Laughren (1983), Hale & Keyser (1986a, 1986b), and Levin & Rappaport (1986)), which is a form that underlies the sourceand target-language sentences.
The pivot approach to translation is called intcvliugual because it relies on an underlying form derived from universal principles that hold across all languages.
Within this framework, distinctions between languages are accounted for by settings of parameters associated with the universal principles.
For example, there is a universal principle that requires there to be a conceptual subject for each predicate of a sentence.
Whether or not the couceptual subject is syntactically realized is determined by a parameter associated with this principle: the null subject parameter.
This parameter is set to yes for Spanish (also, Italian, Hebrew, etc).
but no for English and German (also French, Warlpiri, etc.).
The setting of the null subject parameter accounts for the possibility of a missing subject in Spanish and the incorrectness of a missing subject in English and German (except for the imperative form).
This paper argues that, not only should the syntactic component of a machine translation system be parameterized, but other components of a machine translation system would also benefit from the parameterization approach.
In particular, the lexicalsemantic component must be constructed in such a way as to allow principles of the lexicon to be parameterized.
Thus, UNITRAN uses two levels of processing, syntactic and lexical-semantie, both of which operate on the basis of language-independent ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~r 1992 6 2 4 PROC.

23-28, 1992 knowledge that is parameterized to encode lauguage~ specific information (see figure 1).
Within the syntactic level, the languageindependent and language-speeilic information are supplied, respectively, by the principles and parmnetets of government-binding theory (henceforth, GB) (see Chomaky (1981, 1982)).
Within the lexical-semantie level, the language-independent and language-specific information are supplied by a set of general LCS mappings and the associated parameters for each language, respectively.
Tim interface between the syntactic and semantic levels allows the source-language structure to be mapped systematically to the conceptual form, and it allows the targetdanguage structure to be realized systematically from lexical items derived from the conceptual form.
This work represents a shift away from colnplex, language-specific syutactic translation without entirely abandoning syntax.
Furthermore, the work moves toward a model that employs a well-defined lexieal conceptual representation without requiring a "deep" semantic conceptualizatiou.
Consider the following example: (1) (i) I stabbed Jnhn (ii) Yo le di pufialadas a Juan 'I gave knife-wounds to John' This example illustrates a type of distiuctiou (henceforth called divergence as presented in Dorr (1990a)) that arises in machine translation: the sourcelanguage predicate, stab, is,napped to more than one target-language word, dar puiialadas a.
This divergence type is lezical in that there is a word selection variation between the source language and the target language.
Such divergeuees are accounted for by lexical-semantie parameterization, as we will see in section 3.
The following section of this paper will provide a catalog of syntactic divergences between the source and target languages.
The set of parameters that are used to account for these divergences will be described.
In the third section, we will exanfine the divergences that occur at tire lexical-semantie level, and we will see how the parametric approach accounts for these divergences as well.
Finally, we will turu to the evaluation and coverage of tile system.
2 Toward
a Catalog of Syntactic Divergences Figure 2 shows a diagram of the UNITItAN syntactic processing component.
The parser of this component provides a source-language syntactic structure to the lexical-semantic processor, and, after lexicalsemantic processing is completed, the generator of this component provides a target-language syntactic structure.
Both the parser and generator of this component have access to the syntactic principles of GB theory.
These principles, which act as constraints (i.e., filters) on the syntactic structures proFigure 2: Design of the Syntactic Processing Component duced hy the parser and the generator, operate on tim basis of parameter settings that supply certain lauguage-specific iulbrmation; this is where syntactic divergences are factored out from the lexicalsemantic representation.
The Gll principles and parameters are organized into modules whtme constraints are applied in the following order: (1) X, (2) Boundiug, (3) Case, (4) 'iYace, (5) Ilinding, and (6) 0.
A detailed descriw tiou of these modules is provided in Dorr (1987).
We will look t, riefiy at a number of these, /hensing on how syntactic divergences are accounted for by this approach.
Figure 3 smmnarizes the syntactic divergences that are revealed by the parametric variations presented here.l 2.1 Principles and Parameters of the X Modal(," The X" constraiut module of the syntactic component provides the phrase-structure representation of sentenees.
In particular, the fundamental principle of the X module is that each phrase of a sentence has a mazimal projection, X-MAX, lor a head of category X (see tigure 4).
~ In addition to the head X, a phrasal projection potentially contaius satellites c~1, a~, ill, f12, 71, and 72, where cq attd ~2 are any nulnber of maximally adjoined adjuncts positioned accurding to the adjuaclion parameter, fll aud f12 are arguments (subjects aud objects) ordered according to the constituent order parameter, and 71 and 72 are any number of minimally adjoined adjuncts p~ sitioued according to the adjunctiou parameter.
3 tThe syntactic divergences are enumerated with r~ spect to the relevant pasametera and modules of the syntactic component.
The figure illustrates the effect of syntactic parameter settings on tile constituent structure for each language.
(In this figure, E stands for English, G for German, S for Spanish, and I for Icelandic).
aThe possibilities for the category X are: (V)erb, (N)oua, (A)djective, (P)reptmition, (C)omplementizer, and (1)affection.
't'ite Complementizer corresponds to relative pronouns such as that in the matt that I saw.
The IntlectionM category corresponds to modals such as would in 1 would eat cttke.

For example, the constituent order parameter characterizes the word order distinctions among English, Spanish and German.
Unlike English and Spanish, German is assumed to be a subject-object-verb language that adheres to tim verb-second requirement in matrix clauses (see Safir (1985)).
Thus, for the sentence 1 have seen him, we have the following contrusting argument structures: (2) (i) I have seen him (ii) Yo he visto a dl 'I have seen (to him)' (iii) Ich habe ihn gesehen 'I have him seen' The X module builds the phrase-structure from the general scheme of figure 4 and the parameter settings described above.
The principles and parameters of the remaining modules are then applied as constraints to the phrase-structure representation.
We will now examine each of the remaining modules in turn.
2.2 Principles
and Parameters of the Government Module Government Theory is a central notion to the Case and Trace modules.
A familiar example of the government principle in English is that a verb governs its object.
4 We
will examine the effect of this module in sections 2.4 and 2.5. 2.3 Principles and Parameters of the Bounding Module The Bounding module is concerned with the distance between pairs of co-referring elements (e.g., traceantecedent pairs).
The fundamental principle of the bounding module is that the distance between coreferring elements is not allowed to be more than one bounding node apart, where the choice of bounding nodes is allowed to vary across languages.
The bounding nodes parameter setting accounts for a syntactic divergence between Spanish and English (and German): (3) (i)* Whol did you wonder whether ti went to school?
~ (ii) LQui6n, crees tfi queti rue a la esenela?
The reason (3)0) is ruled out is that the word who has moved beyond two bounding nodes.
It turns out that the corresponding Spanish sentence (3)(ii) is well-formed since the choice of bounding nodes is different and only one bounding node is crossed.
2,4 Principles and Paranaeters of the Case Module The Case module is in charge of ensuring that all noun phrases are properly assigned abstract case (e.g., nominative, objective, etc.).
The Case Filter rules out any sentence that contains a non-casemarked noun phrase.
The notion of government is relevant to case assignment since an element assigns case only if it is a governing case-assigner.
Tile setting of the type of government parameter for English, Spanish, and German characterizes the following divergences: (4) (i) I saw Guile • I saw to Guile (ii)* Lo vi Guille Lo vi a Guile s (iii) lch sah Guile • lch sah zn Guille 4See Dorr (1987) for a more formal definition of the government principle.
sit who is spoken emphatically, this sentence can almost be understood as an echo question corresponding to the statement I wondered whether John went to school.

23-28, 1992 2.5 Principles and Parameters of the Trace Module After case has been assigned, the Trace module applies the empty category principle (ECP) which checks for proper government of empty elements.
The ECP is parameterized by means of the null subject parameter.
As discussed in section 1, the null subject parameter accounts for the null subject distinction between Spanish, on the one hand, and F,nglish and German on the other: (5) (i) Vo vi ellibro Vi el libro (ii) I saw the book * Saw the book (iii) Ich salt das Buch * Sah das Buch Art additional parameter that is relevant to the Trace module is the proper governors parameter.
The choice of proper governor accounts for preposition-stranding distinctions in the three languages: (t;) (i) \[mMxx What store\]i did John go to ti? r (fi)* \[N.IdaX Cu~I tienda\]i rue Juan a ti?
(iii)* \[mMAX Welchem Geseha.ft\]i geht Johann zu ti? 2.6 Principles and Parameters of the Binding Module The Binding module is tire final module applied before thematic roles are assigned.
This module is concerned with the coreference relations among noun phrases, and it is dependent on the governing category parameter, which specifies that a governing category for a syntactic constituent is (roughly) the nearest dominating clause that has a subject.
This parameter happens to have the same setting for English, Spanish, and German, but see Dorr (1987) for a description of other settings of this parameter (e.g., for Icelandic) based on work by Wexler & Manzini (1986), 2.7 Principles and Parameters of the 0 Module The 0 module provides the interface between the syntactic component and the lexical-aemantic component.
In particular, the assignment of themalic roles (henceforth 0-roles) after parsing leads into the construction of the interlingual form.
The fundamental principle of the 0 module is the O-Criterion which states that a lexical head must eAs noted in Jaeggli (1981), animate objects (e.g., Guille) are a~ociated with a clitic pronoun (e.9., Io) only in certain dialects such as that of the River Plate area of South America.
7The t~ constituent is a trace that corresponds to the noun phrase that has been moved to the front of the sentence.
2~ L./ __\ Figure,5: Design of the Lexieal-Semantic Compo~ Ilent assign 0-roles in u unique one-to-one correspondence with the argument positions specified in thc lexical entry for the head.
One of the parameters ax~ociated with the 0 \[nodule is the unto-drop paradigm (NDP) parameter (based on work by Safir (1985)).
This parameter accounts for the distinction between English, on the one hand, and Spanish and German, on the other hand, with respect to the subject of an embedded clause: (7) (i) * 1 know that was dancing (ii) Yo sd que hahfa un halle '1 know that (there) was a dance' (iii) Ich weill, daft getanzt wurde 'I know that (there) wa~ dancing' Ones all 0-roles are assigned, the lexical-semantic component of the translator composes the interlingual representation for the source and target language.
The next section will describe the lexicalsemantic component, and it will show how this com~ l)onent accounts for a number of divergences outside of the reahn of syntax.

a Catalog of LexicaI-Semantic Divergences Figure 5 shows a diagram of the UNITRAN lexicalsemantic processing component.
A detailed description of the lexical conccplual structure (LCS) which serves as the interlingua is not given here, but see Dorr (1990b) for further discussion, s 81n general, the LCS representation follows the format proposed by Jackeudoff (1983, 1990) which views semautic representation as a subset of conceptual structure.
Jackeudoff's approach includes such notious as Event and State, which are specialized into primitives such as (30, STAY, BE~ GO-EXT, aud ORIENT.
As an example of how the primitive GO is used to represent sentence semantics, consider the following sentence: (s) (i) The ball rolled toward Beth.

The parameterization of this component is specified by means of language-specific lexical override markers associated with the LCS mapping betweeu the syntactic structure and the interlingua.
We will look briefly at the principles and parameters of the lexical-semantic component, focusing on how a number of divergences are accounted for by this approach.

Tile 0-roles represent positions in the LCS representations of lexical entries associated with the input words.
Thus, the construction of the interlingun is essentially a unification process that is guided by the pointers left behind by 0-role assignment.
The mapping, or linking rule between the syntactic positions and the positions of the LCS representation is shown in figure 7.
In terms of 0-role assignment, the phrasal head X assigns #-roles corresponding to positions in the LCS associated with X j.
For example, the syntactic subject Bk is assigned the logical subject position fl~ in the LCS.
Once all these roles have been assigned, the interlingual representation is composed simply by reenrsively filling the arguments of tile predicate into their assigned LCS positions.

23-28, 1992 Ill addition to tile LCS linking rule, there is another general rule associated with tile lexical= semantic component: the canonical syntaclie represchist\]on (CSW,).
function. This fmtction associates an LCS type (e.g., TIIIIII3) with a syntactic category (e.g., N-MAX) (see figure 8).
The LCS Linking rule and the CS~ function are the two fundmnental principles of the lexical= semantic component.
In order to account for lexicalsemantic divergenc~, these principles nmst be parameter\]zeal.
In general, translation divergences occur when there is all exception to one (or both) of these principles in one language, but not in the other.
Titus, the lexical entries have bccn constructed to support parametric variation that ac counts for such exceptions.
The parameters are used in lexical entries as overrides for tile LCS linking rule and (JS~ function.
We will now examine examples of how each parameter is used.
3.1.1 %' Parameter The '*' parameter refers to an LG'S position that is syntactically realizable in the surfitce sentence.
This parameter accounts for sSructural divergence: (9) (i) John entered the house (ii) Juan entr6 en la casa 'John entered (into) the house' Here, the Spanish sentence diverges structurally from the English sentence since the noun phrase (the house) is realized as a prepositional phrase (en la cuss).
In order to account for this divergence, the lexicon uses tile * marker ill the LCS representation associated with the lexical entries for enter and entrnr.
This marker specifies tim pbrasal level at whictl an argument will be projected: in tile Spanish lexical entry, the marker is associated with all LCS position that is realized at a syntactically higher phrasal level than that of tile English lexical entry.
3.1.2 :INT and :EXT Parameters The :INT and :EXT paraineters allow tile I,CS linking rule to be overridden by associating a logical subject with a syntactic complement aud a logical argument with a syntactic subject.
A t)o~iblc effect of using these parameter settings is that there is a subject-object reversal during translation.
Such a reversal is called a thematic divergcuee: (10) (i) I like Mary (ii) Me gnats Maria 'Mary pleases me' tlere, the subject of the source-language sentence, I, is translated into all object position, and the object of the source-language sentence Maria is translated into a subject position.
Ill order to accouut for this divergence, the lexicon uses the :INT and :EXT markers in the LCS representation associated with the lexieal entries for gustar.
The English lexieal entry does not contain thesc markers since tile LCS linking rule does not need to be overridden in this case.
3.1.3 :CAT Parameter The :(~AT lllarker provides a syntactic category for all LCS argument.
Recall that the CS'K function maps all LCS type to a syntactic category (see figure 8).
When this mapping is to bc overridden by a lexicaI entry, the language-specific marker :CAT is used, This parameter accounts for categorial divergence: (11) (i) 1 am hungry (ii) ich hahe Hunger 'l have hsnger ~ llere, not only are tl~e predicates be and hubert lexically distinct, but the arguments of these two predicates are categorially divergent: ill English, the urgmnent is all adjectival phrase, and, ill German, the argument is a noun phrmse.
¢~'bc :CAT marker is used in the Gernmn definition to force the PROPEWFY al'glnln~nt tO be realized as a norm rather than an adjective.
Thus, the (2S~ function is overridden daring realization of tile word Hunger in this exampie.
3.1.4 :DEMOTE and :PROMOTE ~lar~tln(~t \[Jr s The :I)EMOTE and :PROMOTE markers, like the :INT and :EXT markers, allow the LCS linking rule to be overridden by iL~sociating a logical head with a syntactic adjunct or complement.
These lla t'ameters account, respectively, for demoiioual divergence: (12) (i) 1 like to eat (ii) lch ease gem 'I eat likingly' and promotional divergence: (13) (i) John usually goes home (ii) Juan sselc ir a I:zLsa ~Johlt teltds to go home' in the first case, thc English main verb like corresponds to tile adjunct geru in German, and the embedded verb eat corresponds to the main verb essen in German.
Ill the second case, tile English adjunct usually corresponds to the main verb soler in Spanish.
'Fhese "head switching" divergences are acconnnodated analogously: the :\])EMOTE marker is used in the lexical entry tot ger~t and the :PROMO'l'l,; ~.vker is used in the lexical entry for soler.
3.1.5 :C.ONFLATED Parameter The sixth LCS parameter is tile :GONI"LATED marker.
This marker is used tbr indicating that a particular argument need not be realized in tile surhtcc representation.
This parameter accounts for couflational divergence aa in the sentence I stabbed John (see (1) from section 1).

Thns, the :CONFLATED marker is associated with the I~IiIFE-WOUI~ argument in the case of stab, but not in the ease of dar.
4 Evaluation
and Coverage One of the main criteria used for evaluation of the parameterization framework described herc is the ease with which lexieal entries may be automatically acquired from on-line resources.
While testing the framework against this metric, a number of results have been obtained, including the discovery of a fundamental relationship between the lexical-semantie primitives and aspectnal information.
This relationstlip is crucial for demonstrating the snceess of the parameterization approach with respect to lexical acquisition.
Details about the lexical acquisition model and results are presented in Dart (1992).
We have already examined the syntactic and lexieal-semantic coverage of the system (see figures 3 and 6 above).
The linguistic coverage of the lexicon is summarized in figure 9.
5 Conclusion
The translation model described here is built on the basis of a parametric approach; thus, it is easy to change from one language to another (by setting syntactic and lexical switches for each language) without having to write a whole new processor for each language.
This is an advance over other machine translation systems that require at least one language-8pecific processing module for each sourcelanguage/targetolanguage pair.
The approach is interlingual: an underlying language-independent form of the source language is derived, and any of the three target languages, Spanish, English, or German, can be produced from this form.
Perhaps the most important advance of UNITRAN is the mapping between the lexical-semantie level and the syntactic level.
In particular, tile 8ys~ tern has been shown to select and realize the appropriate target-language words, despite the potential for syntactic and lexical divergences.
The key to being able to provide a systematic mapping between languages is modularity: because the system has been partitioned into two different processing levels, there is a deeoupling of the syntactic and lexicalo semantic decisions that are made during the translation process.
Titus, syntactic and LCS parameter settings may be specified for each language without hindering the processing that produces, and generates from, the interlingual form.
