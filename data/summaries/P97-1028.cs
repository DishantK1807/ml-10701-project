These filters serve the same means as the "chunking criteria" described in (Rayner and Carter, 1996).

used for machine translation (Copestake et al., 1996; Shemtov, 1996).

In our current implementation we are using TDL, a typed feature-based language and inference system for constraint-based grammars (Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1994).
C94-2144
In case of an agenda-driven chart generator of the kind described in (Neumann, 1994a; Kay, 1996), an instantiated template can be directly added as a passive edge to the generator's agenda.

In that case, EBL is used as a method for adapting a general grammar and/or parser to the sub-language defined by a suitable training corpus (Rayner and Carter, 1996).
P96-1030
Thus viewed, a grammar is a formal statement of the relation between utterances in a natural language and representations of their meanings in some logical or other artificial language, where such representations are usually called logical forms (Shieber, 1993).
J93-1008
We are adapting a "flat" representation of logical forms as described in (Kay, 1996; Copestake et al., 1996).
P96-1027
The core properties of this new method are: • prototypical occuring grammatical constructions can automatically be extracted; • generation of these constructions is vastly sped up using simple but efficient mechanisms; the new method supports partial matching, in the sense that new semantic input need not be completely covered by previously trained examples; • it can easily be integrated with recently developed chart-based generators as described in, 214 e.g., (Neumann, 1994b; Kay, 1996; Shemtov, 1996).

In recent years, a Machine Learning technique known as Explanation-based Learning EBL (Mitchell, Keller, and Kedar-Cabelli, 1986; van Harmelen and Bundy, 1988; Minton et al., 1989) has successfully been applied to control and speeding-up natural language parsing (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Neumann, 1994a; Samuelsson, 1994; Srinivas and Joshi, 1995; Rayner and Carter, 1996).
