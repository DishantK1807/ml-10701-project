Consequently, current anaphora resolution methods rely mainly on restrictions and preference heuristics, which employ information originating from morpho-syntactic or shallow semantic analysis, (see Mitkov (1998) for example).

More recently, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) propose an algorithm for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one developed by Lappin and Leass (1994).

We shall also evaluate our proposal in a Machine Translation application, where we shall test its success rate by its generation of the zero-pronoun in the target language, using the algorithm described in Peral et al.(1999).

Moreover, in order to compare our proposal with Centering approach, Functional Centering by Strube and Hahn (1999) has also been implemented, and an accuracy of 60% was attained.

Dagan and Itai (1990), for example, developed a statistical approach for pronominal anaphora, but the information they used was simply the patterns obtained from the previous analysis of the text.
