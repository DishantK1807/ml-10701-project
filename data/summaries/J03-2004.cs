Their results show that logical metonymy is a relatively widespread phenomenon and that most metonymic examples can be interpreted on the basis of the head noun’s qualia structure, assuming a theoretical framework similar to Pustejovsky’s (1991).
J91-4003
Previous approaches to processing metonymy typically rely heavily on the availability of manually constructed knowledge bases or semantic networks (Fass 1991; Inverson and Helmreich 1992; Bouaud, Bachimont, and Zweigenbaum 1996; Hobbs et al.1993). Furthermore, most implementations either contain no evaluation (Fass 1991; Inverson and Helmreich 1992; Hobbs et al.1993) or report results on the development data (Bouaud, Bachimont, and Zweigenbaum 1996).
C96-1025 J91-1003
It has been argued that in some cases, the different interpretations of these words must arise from the interaction between the semantics of the words during syntactic composition, rather than by exhaustively listing all the possible senses of a word in distinct lexical entries (Pustejovsky 1991).
J91-4003
Briscoe et al.(1990) investigate the presence of verbal logical metonymies in naturally occurring text by looking into data extracted from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen corpus (LOB, one million words).
C90-2008
This is in line with claims made in the lexical semantics literature (Copestake and Briscoe 1995; Pustejovsky 1995; Verspoor 1997), and it ultimately contributes to an improved performance against a “naive baseline” model (see Section 2.4).
P97-1018
The approach put forward by Utiyama, Murata, and Isahara (2000) is perhaps the most comparable to our own work.
C00-2128
Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev’s (1990) work further suggests ways of acquiring qualia structures for nouns by combining information extracted from machine-readable dictionaries and corpora.
C90-2008
Furthermore, recent work has shown that omitting low-frequency tuples degrades performance for language-learning tasks such as PP attachment (Collins and Brooks 1995; Daelemans, van den Bosch, and Zavrel 1999), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, POS tagging, and NP chunking (Daelemans, van den Bosch, and Zavrel 1999).
W95-0103
Previous approaches have focused on descriptive (Vendler 1968) or theoretical (Pustejovsky 1991, 1995; Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990) accounts, on the linguistic constraints on the phenomenon (Godard and Jayez 1993; Pustejovsky and Bouillon 1995; Copestake and Briscoe 1995; Copestake 2001), and on the influence of discourse context on the interpretation of metonymies (Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990; Lascarides and Copestake 1998; Verspoor 1997).
C90-2008 E93-1021 J91-4003 P97-1018
POS tagging of the BNC (Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994) distinguishes between verb particle constructions like down in climb down the mountain and up in put up the painting, on the one hand, and prepositions, on the other.
C94-1103
Probabilities can be defined in terms of senses from a semantic hierarchy by exploiting the fact that the senses can be grouped into classes consisting of semantically similar senses (Resnik 1993; Clark and Weir 2001; McCarthy 2000; Li and Abe 1998).
A00-2034 J98-2002 N01-1013
Our model provides plausible alternatives to the default, and it augments the general semantic type in the interpretation that’s assigned by these theories with a plausible range of more specific values, although, in contrast to the hybrid model of interpretation described in Copestake and Lascarides (1997), it does not predict the contexts in which a statistically dispreferred interpretation is the correct one.
P97-1018
Furthermore, in agreement with other lexical acquisition studies (Merlo and Stevenson 2001; Barzilay and McKeown 2001; Siegel and McKeown 2000; Light 1996; McCarthy 2000; Rooth et al.1999), we showed that it is possible to extract semantic information from corpora even if they are not semantically annotated in any way.

A Japanese thesaurus is used for the estimation of the term P(R, V | B) when the frequency f(R, V, B) is zero (see Utiyama, Murata, and Isahara (2000) for the derivation 307 Lapata and Lascarides Logical Metonymy and estimation of (63)).
C00-2128
For instance, current models of lexical semantics typically assign verbs such as enjoy a nonmetonymic sense when they are combined with NPs that are purely temporal or eventive in nature, as in enjoy the marriage or enjoy the lecture (Copestake and Briscoe 1995; Verspoor 1997).
P97-1018
Currently our models cannot estimate probabilities for word combinations unseen in the corpus, and WordNet could be used for re-creating the frequencies of these combinations (Lapata, Keller, and McDonald 2001; Clark and Weir 2001).
N01-1013 P01-1046
In particular, the model does not learn conventional constraints, such as that enjoy must take an event of duration as its argument (Godard and Jayez 1993).
E93-1021
Arguably the most influential account of logical metonymy is Pustejovsky’s (1991, 1995) theory of the generative lexicon.
J91-4003
Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev (1990) and Verspoor (1997) undertake a manual analysis of logical metonymies found in naturally occurring text.
C90-2008 P97-1018
The class of phenomena that Pustejovsky (1991, 1995) has called logical metonymy is one such example.
J91-4003
This finding complies with Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev’s (1990) results for the LOB corpus: begin V NP is very rare when the value of V corresponds to a highly plausible interpretation of begin NP.
C90-2008
In contrast to Utiyama et al., we use no information external to the corpus (e.g., a thesaurus); sparse-data problems are tackled via independence assumptions, and syntactic information is obtained through shallow text analysis (Utiyama, Murata, and Isahara (2000) rely on morphological analysis to provide cues for syntactic information).
C00-2128
Our approach is conceptually similar to that of Utiyama, Murata, and Isahara (2000).
C00-2128
Domain knowledge assigns doors, highways, and bridges a particular purpose, and so the fact that the sentences in (4b)–(4d) are odd indicates that metonymic interpretations are subject to conventional constraints (Godard and Jayez 1993).
