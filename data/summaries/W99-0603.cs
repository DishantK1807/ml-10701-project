communication). We performed experiments directly on the taxonomies extracted by (Rigau et al., 1997), as well as on slight variations of them.
P97-1007
Several lexical resources and techniques are combined in (Atserias et al., 1997) to map Spanish words from a bilingual dictionary to WordNet, and in (Farreres et al., 1998) the use of the taxonomic structure derived from a monolingual MaD is proposed as an aid to this mapping process.
W98-0709
In (Okumura and Hovy, 1994) (semi)automatic methods for associating a Japanese lexicon to an English ontology using a bilingual dictionary are described.
H94-1025
The method has been applied to attach substantial fragments of the Spanish taxonomy derived from DGILE (Rigau et al., 1998) to the English WordNet using a bilingual dictionary for connecting both hierarchies.
P98-2181
The algorithm has been applied to POS tagging (Mkrquez and Padrd, 1997), shallow parsing (Voutilainen and Padrd, 1997) and to word sense disambiguation (Padrd, 1998).
A97-1013
In (Ageno et al., 1994), a Spanish/English bilingual dictionary is used to (semi)automatically link Spanish and English taxonomies extracted from DGILE (A1var, 1987) and LDOCE (Procter, 1987).
C94-1052
That is: â€¢ The starting point is a sense disambiguated Spanish taxonomy-automatically extracted from a monolingual dictionary (Rigau et al., 1998)-.
P98-2181
These taxonomies were automatically assigned to a WordNet semantic file (Rigau et al., 1997; Rigau et al., 1998).
