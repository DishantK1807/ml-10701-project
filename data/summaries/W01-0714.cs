The chance of a pair a8a10a2a9a42a17a3a36a11 being a constituent is a57 a8a15a83a53a45a2a9a42a17a3a36a11a28a27 a57 a8a15a83a81a45a2a16a11 a57 a8a15a83a53a45a3a32a11a17a33 a57 a8a15a83a97a11 and we score a tree a98 by the likelihood product of its judgements a83a81a8a10a2a28a42a89a98a99a11 . The best tree is then a100a74a101a103a102a28a104a6a100a34a105a107a106 a8a109a108 a67a110a69a111a72a112a26a71 a88 a24 a57 a8a15a83a81a8a10a2a28a42a89a98a99a11a97a45a2a28a42a17a3a32a11 As we are considering each pair independently from the rest of the parse, this model does not correspond to a generative model of the kind standardly associated with PCFGs, but can be seen as a random field over the possible parses, with the features being the sequences and contexts (see (Abney, 1997)).

Because of these kinds of results, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on parsing as a supervised learning problem (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).
