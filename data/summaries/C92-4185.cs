Therelore there have been many proposals on how to unify disjunctive feature structures, the most important being Karttunen's (1984) unification with constraints, Kasper's (1987) unification by successive approximation, Eisele & D0rru's (1988) value unification and lately Eisele & D0rre's (1990a, b) unification with named disjunctions.

Carter (1990) has made a development of this algorithm which improves the efficiency when nsed together with bottom-up parsing.

Eisele, Andreas and Jochen D0rre (1988).
P88-1035
Comparing this to the other proposed alternatives we can see that Kasper's (1987) algorithm has a better worst case complexity (2a/2).
P87-1033
Eisele & D01Te'S (1988) approach is based on the fact that unification of path equivalences should return uot only a local value, but also a global value that affects some other part of the struetm'e.
P88-1035
The algorithm by Eisele & D0rre (1988) has a similar worst case complexity.
