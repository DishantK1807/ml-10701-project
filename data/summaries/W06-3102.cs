To find such groups of morphemes and functional words, we applied a sequence of morpheme groupings by extracting frequently occuring n-grams of morphemes as follows (much like the grouping used by Chiang (2005): in a series of iterations, we obtained high-frequency bigrams from the morphemic representation of parallel texts, of either morphemes, or of previously such identified morpheme groups and neighboring morphemes until up to four morphemes or one root 3 morpheme could be combined.

Statistical machine translation views the translation process as a noisy-channel signal recovery process in which one tries to recover the input “signal” e, from the observed output signal f.1 Early statistical machine translation systems used a purely word-based approach without taking into account any of the morphological or syntactic properties of the languages (Brown et al., 1993).

The availability of large amounts of so-called parallel texts has motivated the application of statistical techniques to the problem of machine translation starting with the seminal work at IBM in the early 90’s (Brown et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993).

Although the BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) score from Finnish to English is 21.8, the score in the reverse direction is reported as 13.0 which is one of the lowest scores in 11 European languages scores (Koehn, 2005).

Limitations of basic word-based models prompted researchers to exploit morphological and/or syntactic/phrasal structure (Niessen and Ney, (2004), Lee,(2004), Yamada and Knight (2001), Marcu and Wong (2002), Och and Ney (2004),Koehn et al.(2003), among others.) In the context of the agglutinative languages similar to Turkish (in at least morphological aspects), there has been some recent work on translating from and to Finnish with the significant amount of data in the Europarl corpus.
