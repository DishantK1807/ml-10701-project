The likelihood of realisations given concepts or semantic representations has been modeled directly, but is probably limited to small-scale and specialised applications: summarisation construed as term selection and ordering [Witbrock and Mittal, 1999], grammar-free stochastic surface realisation [Oh and Rudnicky, 2000], and surface realisation construed as attribute selection and lexical choice [Ratnaparkhi, 2000].

In parsing, Magerman & Marcus [1991] and Briscoe & Carroll [1993] used the geometric mean of probabilities instead of the product of probabilities.

In hybrid symbolic-statistical approaches, White [2004] prunes edges in chart realisation using n-gram models, and Varges uses quantitative methods for determining the weights on instance features in instance-based generation [Varges and Mellish, 2001].

Some statistical NLG research has looked at subproblems of language generation, such as ordering of NP premodifiers [Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou, 1999; Malouf, 2000], attribute selection in content planning [Oh and Rudnicky, 2000], NP type determination [Poesio et al., 1999], pronominalisation [Strube and Wolters, 2000], and lexical choice [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000a].
