The measure can be also used as a confidence estimator in active learning in CRFs (Kim et al., 2006), where examples with the most uncertainty are selected for presentation to human annotators.

It is calculated by constrained forwardbackward algorithm (Culotta and McCallum, 2004), and confident segments are added to the dictionary in order to improve segmentation accuracy.

As for the marginal probability to use as a confidence measure shown in Figure 4, Peng et al.(2004) has applied linear-chain CRFs to Chinese word segmentation.
