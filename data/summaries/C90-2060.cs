This method is contrasted with the approaches that seek to define a generalized but computationally expensive evaluation strategy for running a grammar in either direction without a need to manipulate its rules (Shieber, 1988), (Shieber et al., 1989), and see also (Colmerauer, 1982) and (Naish, 1986) for some relevant techniques, employing the trick known as goal freezing.
C88-2128 P89-1002
To reduce the cost of the goal freezing, and also to circumvent some of its deficiencies, Shieber et al.(1989) introduce a mixed top-downPoottom-up goal expansion strategy, in which only selected goals are expanded during the top-down phase of the interpreter.

We have completed a first implementation of the system and used it to derive both a parser and a generator from a single DCG grammar for English (Strzalkowski and Peng, 1990).

is the general procedure MSEAS for computing the active sets of essential arguments in the head literal of a clause as proposed in (Strzalkowski and Peng, 1990).
