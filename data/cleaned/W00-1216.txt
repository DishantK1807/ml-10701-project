Text Meaning Representation for Chinese Wanying Jin Computing Research Laboratory New Mexico State University Las Cruces, NM 88003-8001 U.S.A. wanying@crl.nm~u.edu Abstract This paper describes text meaning representation for Chinese.
Text meaning representation is composed of a set of ontological concept instances along with ontological links among them.
It integrates lexical, textual and world knowledge into a single hierarchical framework.
In NLP application it serves as an interlingual representation for various processing.
The methodology and implementation of text meaning representation is discussed in detail.
1 1 Introduction In natural language text processing, it becomes inevitable to require a system having capability to automatically extract and represent the information conveyed in a given text.
The theory and methodology of text meaning representation (TMR) has been studied in the past decade (Nirenburg, 1991; Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1996; Beale et al., 1995; Onyshkevych 1997) and its application has been presented in machine translation systems that employ interlingual approach.
An ideal text meaning representation will be a language-neutral description of the linguistic information conveyed in a natural language text.
TIVIR captures the meanings of words in the text and represents them in a set of ontological concepts interconnected through ontological relations.
In a~:ldition, TMR provides information about the lexicon-semantic dependencies as well as stylistic factors.
Based on this study, two supportive resources to compose TMR are ontology and semantic lexicon.
An ontology is a set of knowledge concepts about the world.
It is composed of thoul This work has been supported by the Department of Defense of the United States under contract number MDA-904-92-C,-5189.
sands of concepts organized into a particular hierarchy so that each concept is related to other concepts through semantic links (Carl son et aI., 1990; Bateman, 1993; Dowellet al.1995; Nirenburg et al., 1995; Bouaud, et al: 1995; Mahesh et al.1995;). Semantic lexicon represents the senses of the words.
Each lexicon entry is a framework that maps a word sense to an ontological concept.
It also indudes information about syntax, semantics, morphology and pragmatics, as well as annotation that keep the record of data management.
Over the years, various methodologies have been investigated carrying out the structure of a computational lexicon entry within a knowledge-based framework(Onyshkevych et aI, 1995; Viegas and Raskin, 1998; Viegas: 1999; Viegas, et a/, 1998a, 1998b).
A semantic parser uses information in the semantic lex/con and makes a decision on word sense disambiguation based on the strategy proposed by Beale et aI.
(1995) and Beale(1997).
This paper presents the development and application of text meaning representation for Chinese.
Detailed discussion about the principle for building a computational semantic Chinese lexicon is illustrated in Jin (1999).
The methodology and implementation of word sense disambiguation is fully discussed in Viegas, Jin and Beale(1999a: 1999b, 1999c).
2 Overview
of Ontology An ontology is a body of knowledge about the world.
It is a repository of concepts used in meaning representations.
All concepts are organized in a tangled subsumption hierarchy and further interconnected using a system of semantic relations defined among the concepts.
The ontology is put into well-defined 109 relationships with knowledge sources in the system.
In an NLP application the ontology supplies world knowledge to lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic processes.
In the MikroKosmos project, 2 the ontological concepts consist of: OBJECT, the static things existing in the world; EVENT, any activities happening in the world, and PROPERTY, the properties of OBJECTs and EVENTs.
The ontology organizes terminologicalnouns into a taxonomy of objects, verbs into a taxonomy of events, and adjectives into a taxonomy of attributes.
It further includes many ontological relations between objects and events to support a variety of disambiguation tasks.
Currently, the ontology in the IVIikroKosmos project contains about 5,000 concepts covering a wide range of categories in the world.
Each concept, on average, has 14 relation links.
An example below presents the top three level of the ontology, which differentiates between OBJECT; EVENT and PROPERTY.
+ ALL +EVENT + MENTAL-EVENT + PHYSICAL-EVENT + SOCIAL-EVENT + OBJECT +MENTAL-OBJECT + INTANGIBLE-OBJECT + PHYSICAL-OB/ECT + SOCIAL-OBJECT + PROPERTY + ATTRIBUTE + RELATION + 0NTOLOGY-SLOT Each concept is a frame in which a collection of ontological slots such as DEFINITION, IS-A, SUBCLASSES, INVERSE~ case roles such as AGENT, THEME and properties such as HEADED-BY, HAS-MEMBER, etc.
link one concept to other concepts in the ontology.
Below is an example of a concept frame of GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY: 2The MikroKosmos project is a knowledge-based machine translation system using an interHngual approach.
The so~ce languages are Spanish, Chinese and Japanese.
The target language is English.
Concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY DEFINITION: an activity commonly carried out by a government.
IS-A: POLITICAL-EVENT AGENT: HUMAN THEME: EVENT OBJECT ACCOMPANIER: HUMAN LOCATION: PLACE This example indicates that the concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY is a subclass of the concept POLITICAL-EVENT~ its case role AGENT requires its semantic value as HUMAN and its THEME requires its value as either OBJECT or EVENT~ the GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY can also have case role ACCOMPANIER with value as HUMAN and LOCATION with value as PLACE.
Any lexicon entry mapping to the concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY gets extended information through this frame.
3 Semantic
Lexicon Semantic lexicon is another knowledge source for text meaning representation.
In the M.ikroKosmos project each lexicon entry is designed as a frame with 11 zones corresponding to information relevant to orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, syntax-semantic linking, stylistics, and database type management record, etc.
The core of the lexicon frame is syntactic zone SYN-STRUC, semantic zone SEM-STRUC and their link SYNSEM zone.
Syntax particular to a given language is described in the syntactical zone.
The semantic zone maps a sense into an ontological concept in the case of single sense, or to several concepts in the case of multiple senses.
Through the syntactic-semantic link zone the information of each word in the text can be extracted directly from lexicon database and its relevant world knowledge also can be retrieved.
The general template of semantic lexicon entry is shown as follows.
For a detailed description see Viegas and l~kin (1998).
Entry Elements = \[FORM: Word Form CAT: Part of speech MORPH: Morphology ANNO: Annotation TRANS: Translation 110 SYNSEM: SYR-STRUC: SEM-STRUC: LEX-RULES: PRAGM: STYL: Syn1;ax-Semant ic link Syntactic strucCure Semant ic sl;ructure Lexical rules Pragmatic information Stylistic informazion\] '~k-Vl syn: I~jb.j t: \[\] : ~\]\[cat: NP\]I : \[\]\[cat: NP\]J sere: ;ynsem: IT G°vernment-Activity an 1 AGENT: ~-l Hum HEME: ~-~ Object J :bj ubj: E\]\[ sere: \[~\]1\] : ~\[se~: ~\]J Figure 1: Sense for the Chinese lexicon ~k.
Figure 1.
is a simplified structure of a Chinse lexicon entry ~k in the sense of {GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY.
The SYN zone indicates that when parsing a sentence containing this entry, subcategories SUBJ and OBJ are required.
The SEM zone presents the semantic value of each case role, i.e.
AGENT with value HUMAN, and TttEM~ with value EVENT or OBJECT.
The SYNSEM zone provides information about the syntax-semantic linking.
That is, SUBJ \[\] is linked to AGENT ~-l with value HUMAN and OBJ \[\] is linked to THEblE with value EVENT or OBJECT.
Due to the lack of morphological information in Chinese, it is often the case that the same Chinese word form can be mapped to a different part of speech and has multiple senses, such as the word ~:g~: • in the context ~:~ ~:~ flowers bloom, can be an intransitive verb mapping to a concept BLOOM with the definition to produce flower.
• in the context ~ ~k ~ ~ ~ the government opens the foreign trade policy, can be a transitive verb mapping to a concept GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY with the definition an activity that is commonly carried out by a government at any level.
• in the context ~ ~ ~k ~ the government carries open policy, can be an adjective mapping to OPEN-TO-PUBLIC with the definition to be available to the public.
• in the context I~l~ ~k the library is open, can be an intransitive verb with the same concept OPEN-TO-PUBLIC.
Using the ontological concepts as the value of semantic variables and linking them to syntactic variables makes the lexicon very informative.

4 Semantic
Analysis for Word Sense Disambiguation The task of a semantic analyzer is to combine the knowledge contained in the ontology and lexicon and apply it to the input text to produce text meaning representation output.
The central tasks involved are to retrieve the appropriate semantic constraints for each possible word sense, test each sense in context, and construct the output TMBs by instantiating the concepts in semantic zones of the word senses that best satisfy the combination of constraints.
Figure 4.
illustrates the process of text meaning representation.
Below illustrates the process through a sentence ~ \[\] 111 ~t~ ~:~ T ~J~ ~ ~.
The Chinese government has opened foreign trade policy.
The syntactic analysis gives the following output: ((ROOT ~)(CAT V)(TRANS open) (s~J (MODS ~\[\]) (CAT N) (TRANS China) (ROOT ~'~) (CAT N) (TRANS government) ) (0BJ (~0DS (HODS ~) (CAT ADJ) (TRAILS foreign) (ROOT ~ ~ ) (CAT N) (TRNAS trade) ) (ROOT ~)(CAT N)(TRANS policy) )) ~PUTTEX~ S'VHTACIlCpA.~R J PANGLOSS ~n,s*l,.w u,t S~lem SYHTACllCO-SEMAINrnc P~.PROCESS~ TP~O PARSE FOREST IttSTANTLk'nON taXI SYNTAX-S~ANlrIC$ VARIABLE B~I~IG FR,~NtE$ & $&OF$ WORD SBCSE S~.ECnON (¢~.~.&,; ChKtdng) TMRs lira COMMNA~OW IMR SIJ~G ~w C~ l~Fm | -mC~Oll.H!O~.S Figure 4: The Architecture of TMR.
The semantic analysis process takes the following steps: • to gather all of the possible lexicon for each of the words with instantiated each concepts.
~\[\] N CHINA-6 ~ ~ ZSDZ~TIO~-I ~ VI BLOOM-2-1 V2 GDVERNME~rr-ACTIVITY2-2 V3 OPI~I-TO-PUBLIC-2-3 ADJ OPEN-TO-PUBLIC-2-4 ~ M)J1 INTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5-1 ADVI OUTVARD-5-2 ~, N c0mrzacz-zvmrr-4-1 V CO ~..RCE-EVEIWr-4-2 Syntactic variables are bound to one another using the syntactic patterns in the lexical entries to establish syntactic dependencies.
In addition: ontological concepts referred to the semantic zones of the lexical entries are instantiated and linked through ontological relations to establish semantic dependencies.
For example, the syntactic structure of the text requires ~k to be a verb.
Thus: the ADJ category with sense OPEN-TO-PUBLIC-2-4 is rejected.
From Figure 2.
and Figure 3.
both SYN zones indicate an intransitive verb that violates the required syntax.
Therefore, the concepts BLOOM and OPEN-TO-PUBLIC are also rejected.
In the same way, the adverb ~b with sense OUTWARD-5-2 and the verb ~ with sense COMMERCE-EVENT-4-2 are also rejected because of the violation of required POS.
Finally the ADJ .~ with the sense INTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5-1 and the NOUN ~ with COMMERCE-EVENT-4-1 are selected.
After all senses are determined: SYN-SEM zone binds all syntactic variables with semantic variables, i.e.
SUBJ FEDERATION-I is bound to the AGENT of GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY2-2, OBJ LAW-3 is bound to the THEME of GOVEB_NMENT-ACTIVITY-2-2.
• In the next step, selectional constraints are retrieved from the ontology.
Individual selectional constraints are checked.
In the example, the concept GOVEthNMENTACTIVITY requires AGENT to be HUMAN and THEME to be EVENT or OBJECT.
The lexical information indicates that the SUBJ ~ with sense FEDERATION must satisfy the AGENT of GOVERNMENTACTIVITY with value HUMAN.
An inference rule described below checks the satisfaction.
The OBJ ~ with the sense LAW satisfies THEME of GOVERNMENT112 ACTIVITY with value OBJECT.
Through IS-A links it is found that LAW is a descendant of OBJECT.
Therefore, the semantic constraints are satisfied.
Seeking satisfaction through inference rules, the semantic analyzer does more than match selectional constraints or find the distance along IS-A links.
The search inside the ontology also involves looking for metonymic type links, such as FEDERATION in a metonymic relation with HUMAN through the property HASREPRESENTATIVE: Concep%: IS-A: DOMAIN: RANGE: INVERSE : HAS-REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATION-RELATION ORGANIZATION HUMAN BUSINESS-ROLE GOVERNMENTAL-ROLE REPRESENTATIVE-OF in which DOMAIN is ORGANIZATION that has subclass FEDERATION and RANGE is HUMAN.
Thus, the constraint of AGENT of GOVERNAIENT-ACTIVITY to be HUMAN is satisfied.
• In case multiple senses all satisfy the constraints, the concept with the shortest path is selected as the best choice.
An ontological search program, Onto-Search, is presented in Onyshkevych (1997).
The resulting preference values for each constralnt are combined in an efficient control and search algorithm called HunterGatherer that combines constraint satisfaction~ branch and bound, and solution synthesis techniques to pick the best combination of word senses of the entire sentence in near linear time, as described in Beale (1997).
• Chosen word senses are assembled into TMR frames.
5 Text
Meaning Representation i text meaning representation(TMR) is a language-neutral description of the meaning conveyed in a text.
It is derived by syntactic and semantic analysis.
TMR captures not only the meaning of individual words in the text, but also the relation between those words.
It provides information about the lexicon-semantic dependencies.
In addition, it also represents stylistic and other factors presented in the text.
From the result of word sense disambiguation, TMR integrates lexical, ontological and textual information into a single hierarchical framework.
Below is a TMR for the example sentence ~\[\] R~ ~:~ T ~ ~ ~ R~.
Chinese government has opened .foreign trade policy.
(FEDERATION-1 (AGENT-0F (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) ) (RELATION (VALUE CHINA-6) ) (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE FEDERATION) ) ) ( GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2 (AGENT (VALUE FEDERATION-i) ) (THEME (VALUE LAW-3)) (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY) ) ) (LAW-3 (THmm-0Y (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) ) (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE LAW) ) ) (COMMERCE-EVENT-4 (EVENT-OBJECT-RELATION (VALUE LAW-3) ) (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE COMMERCE-EVENT) ) ) (INTERNATI ONAL-ATTRIBUTE-5 (DOMAIN (VALUE COMMERCE-EVENT-4) ) (RANGE (VALUE INTmU~ATIONAL)) (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE INTERNATIONAL-ATTRIBUTE) ) ) (CHINA-6 (INSTANCE-OF (VALUE CHINA) ) ) (ASPECT-7 (SCOPE (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) ) (TELIC (VALUE YES) ) ) (TIME-8 (DOMAIN (VALUE GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY-2) ) (RANGE (VALUE *speaker-time*))) (INFERENCE (TYPE METONYMY) (HUMAN (REPRESENTATIVE-OF (VALUE FEDERATION-1 ) ) ) ) After semantic analysis~ a variety of microtheories are applied to further analyze elements of text meaning such as time, aspect: propositions, sets, co-reference, and so on..
to produce a complete TMR.
In the example, ASPECT-7 is applied within the scope of GOVERNMENT-ACTIVITY in which TELIC with value YES indicates the GOVERNMENTACTIVITY is complete that means the action 113 of opening foreign trade policy is done.
TIME8 indicates the GOVERNMFENT-ACTIVITY happens at the time the speaker make the utterance.
Thus, the meaning of the Chinese sentence ~H\] ~ ~ ~ 3" ~t" ~ ~ is completely represented in the TlVIR.
6 Discussion
A knowledge-based machine translation can be viewed as extracting and representing the meaning of a text and generating a text in target language based on the meaning presented.
Thus, text meaning representation plays the key role in an interlingual approach to machine translation.
The approach described in this article enables integrating linguistic knowledge of source languages with general world knowledge to reach high quality translation.
It is because TMR represents meaning deeper and broader than what the context presents.
For example, in the context ~.
~9~ provide service, the linguistic information indicates syntactic-semantic dependency as SUBJ (human) -V(service-event)OBJ(event).
In an ontology, the SERVICEEVENT concept frame contains information about AGENT and THEME as well as BENEFICIARY, ACCOMPANIEtL INSTRUMENT, LOCATION, etc.
which extends the meaning of the given text ~ ~ to lEA.
:~ ~ ~ i~,A.
~. ~ ~ Someone provides service to someone else at some place.
If the extended information is not explicitly presented in the text, the default value provides the assumption based on the world knowledge.
In machine translation, it enables the generation of high quality text, especially in the case where the syntax in source language is different from that in target language or in the case where ellipsis is allowed in one language such as He plays Bach in English, but is not allowed in other language such as in Chinese, where one must say ~ ~ ~ fi.\] ~ ~ He plays Bach's work.
With the rapid development of internet, information retrieval plays the key role in search engin.
The extended information about the world knowledge allows to retrieve relevant data through the ontology that is implicitly specified in the query.
As result, more broad and deep information can be extracted.
It is extremely valuable to the development of next generation of internet search engin.
All in all, using ontology strengthens all NLP systems.
