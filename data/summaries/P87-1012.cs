Thus, we follow Pereira and Shieher (1984) in claiming that the "bottom-up" realization of a unificationbased rule • corresponds to the unification of a structure E• encoding the equational constraints of r, and a structure D r corresponding to the merging of the structures instentiating the elemcnu of the right-hand side of r.

2. Unification-based Comblnatory Categorlal Grammars As Kamunen (1986), Uszkoreit (1986), Wittenburg (1986), and Zeevat et al.(1986) have noted, unification-based computational enviroments (Shieber 1986) offer a natural choice for implementing the categories and combination roles of CGs, because of their rigorously dermed declarative semantics.
