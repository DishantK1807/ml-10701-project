Although the authors of (Brown et al., 1993) stated that they would discuss the search problem in a follow-up artiâ€¢ cle, so far there have no publications devoted to the decoding issue for statistical machine translation.

The modeling and learning issues have been discussed in (Brown et ah, 1993), where ngram model was used for language modeling, and five different translation models were introduced for the translation process.

We dealt with this by either limiting the translation probability from the null word (Brown 367 et al., 1993) at the hypothetical 0-position(Brown et al., 1993) over a threshold during the EM training, or setting SHo (j) to a small probability 7r instead of 0 for the initial null hypothesis H0.

in Statistical Machine Translation (Brown et al., 1993) and (Vogel, Ney, and Tillman, 1996) have discussed the first two of the three problems in statistical machine translation.
