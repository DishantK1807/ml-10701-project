In (Dahan-Netzer, 1997) and (DahanNetzer and Elhadad, 1998a), we have refined the D/Q classification and preferred using functional criteria: we map the Q quantitiers to the "amount" category defined by Glinert, and the D set is split into the partitive and determiner categories each with a different function.

(Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b) for an even more abstract proposal).

Traditionally, syntactic realization components have attempted to raise the abstraction level of input specifications for two reasons: (1) to preserve the possibility of paraphrasing and (2) to make it easy for the sentence planner to map from semantic data to syntactic input As new applications appear, that cannot start generation from a semantic input because such an input is not available (for example re-generation of sentences from syntactic fragments to produce summaries (Barzilay et al., 1999) or generation of complex NPs in a hybrid template system for business letters (Gedalia, 1996)), this motivation has lost some of its strength.

A similar approach has been adopted in generation (Bateman, 1997), (Bateman et al., 1991) and in machine translation most notably in (Dorr, 1994).

Smixut is, on the one hand, very productive in Hebrew and yet very constrained (Dahan-Netzer and E1hadad, 1998b).

In previous work (Elhadad, 1996), we discuss how to map a more abstract domainspecific representation to the SURGE input 145 structure within a sentence planner.

But, in addition to these pragmatic factors and as is the case for the English genitive, the construct state can realize a wide variety of semantic relations (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), (Azar, 1985), (Levi, 1976).
W98-1012 W98-1418
Consequently, "shallow surface generators" have recently appeared (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) (Busemann and Horacek, 1998) that require an input considerably less abstract than those required by more traditional realization components such as SURGE (E1hadad and Robin, 1996) or KPML (Bateman, 1997).

Consider the following example: cat head classifier possessor common lex "Simlah"/"dress" \] lex "Sabat" \] cat common \] lex "yalda"/"girl" If only the possessor is provided in the following input, it can be mapped to a construct state: Simlat ha-yaldah dress-cs the-girl the girl's dress If a classifier is provided in addition, the construct-state slot is not available anymore 1, and the free genitive construct must be used: Simlat ha-Sabat Sel ha-yaldah dress-cs the-Shabat of the-girl The Shabat dress of the girl l If the classifier had been specified in the input as a semantic relation as discussed in (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b), an alternative realization (The girl's dress/or Shabat) could have been obtained.
W98-1012 W98-1418
For example, we have shown in (Dahan-Netzer and Elhadad, 1998b) that the semantic relations that can be realized by a construct state are the ones defined as classifier in SURGE.

Recently, the search for higher abstraction has been, however, challenged (E1hadad and Robin, 1996)(Lavoie and Rambow, 1997)(Busemann and Horacek, 1998).
