Techniques for automatic feature identification (Hu and Liu, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) could possibly help here, although these techniques currently have the limitation that they do not automatically identify different lexicalizations of the same feature.

An alternative would be to leave some sentences unparsed and usethem astemplateswith hybridgenerationtechniques (White and Caldwell, 1998).

For example, Hu and Liu (2005) use reviews to find adjectives to describeproducts, and Popescuand Etzioni(2005) automaticallyfind features of a product together with the polarity of adjectives used to describe them.

1. 2.3 Parsing and DSyntS conversion We adopt Deep Syntactic Structures (DSyntSs) as a format for syntactic structures because they can be realized by the fast portable realizer RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).

One exception is (Barzilay and Lee, 2002), which derives mappings between semantic representations and realizations using a parallel (but unaligned) corpus consisting of both complex semantic input and corresponding natural language verbalizations for mathemat270 shorthand for relations and utterance score [food=4] The food is delicious and beautifully prepared.

However, it might be possible to use their approach to create rating information for raw review texts as in (Pang and Lee, 2005), so that we can create mappings from reviews without ratings.

Work Automatically finding sentences with the same meaning has been extensively studied in the field of automatic paraphrasing using parallel corpora and corporawith multiple descriptionsof the same events (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2003).

These include discourse markers, such as list item markers with LS as the POS tag, that signal the organization structure of the text (Hirschberg and Litman, 1987), as well as discourse connectives that signal semantic and pragmatic relations of the sentence with other parts of the text (Knott, 1996), such as coordinatingconjunctions at the beginning of the utterance like and and but etc., and conjunct adverbs such as however, also, then.
