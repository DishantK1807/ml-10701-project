An interesting research thread is to use more linguistic structure in a statistical translation model [Yamada and Knight 2001], which has some relevance to ITU since we need to handle structured semantic data.

2 MDA: A semantics-based document authoring system The MDA (Multilingual Document Authoring) system [Brun et al 2000] is an instance (descended from Rantaâ€™s Grammatical Framework [Ranta 2002]) of a text-mediated interactive natural language generation system, a notion introduced by [Power and Scott 1998] under the name of WYSIWYM.

document normalization to ITU A first route towards achieving an ITU system is through an extension of ongoing work on document normalization [Max and Dymetman 2002, Max 2003].

He then goes on to adapt the conventional noisy channel MT model of [Brown et al 1993] to NLU, where extracting a semantic representation from an input text corresponds to finding: argmax(Sem) {p(Input|Sem) p(Sem)}, where p(Sem) is a model for generating semantic representations, and p(Input|Sem) is a model for the relation between semantic representations and corresponding texts.

4, we see strong parallels between TransType and ITU: language model enumerating word sequences vs 4 Initially statistical MT used a noisy-channel approach [Brown et al.1993]; but recently [Och and Ney 2002] have introduced a more general framework based on the maximum-entropy principle, which shows nice prospects in terms of flexibility and learnability.
