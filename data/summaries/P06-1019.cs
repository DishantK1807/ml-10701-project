To better understand the needs of grammar developers we carefully explored two existing grammars: the LINGO grammar matrix (Bender et al., 2002), which is a basis grammar for the rapid development of cross-linguistically consistent gram146 mars; and a grammar of a fragment of Modern Hebrew, focusing on inverted constructions (Melnik, 2006).
W02-1502
Kaplan et al.(2002) introduce a system designed for building a grammar by both extending and restricting another grammar.
W02-1506
Candito (1996) introduces a description language for the trees of LTAG.
C96-1034
To constrain undesired combinations, Candito (1996) uses a finite set of names where each node of a tree description is associated with a name.
