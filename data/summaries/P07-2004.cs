Thus, the HPSG ERG grammar for English was extended to output minimal recursive structures as semantic representations for sentences (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000); the LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar) grammars to output lambda terms (Dalrymple, 1999); and Clark and Curranâ€™s CCG (Combinatory Categorial Grammar) based statistical parser was linked to a semantic construction module allowing for the derivation of Discourse Representation Structures (Bos et al., 2004).

In this approach (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003), the TAG used integrates syntactic and semantic information as follows.

This is the approach sketched by Montague and 1For mode details on LU, see (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003).
