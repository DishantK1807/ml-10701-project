Abstract
This paper describes our approach to
“NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration
Shared Task.” We built multiple translit-
eration engines based on different combi-
nations of two transliteration models and
three machine learning algorithms. Then,
the outputs from these transliteration en-
gines were combined using re-ranking
functions. Our method was applied to all
language pairs in “NEWS 2009 Machine
Transliteration Shared Task.” The official
results of our standard runs were ranked
the best for four language pairs and the
second best for three language pairs.
1 Outline
This paper describes our approach to “NEWS
2009 Machine Transliteration Shared Task.”
Our approach was based on two transliteration
models – TM-G (Transliteration model based
on target-language Graphemes) and TM-GP
(Transliteration model based on target-language
Graphemes and Phonemes). The difference
between the two models lies in whether or
not a machine transliteration process depends
on target-language phonemes. TM-G directly
converts source-language graphemes into target-
language graphemes, while TM-GP first trans-
forms source language graphemes into target-
language phonemes and then target-language
phonemes coupled with their corresponding
source-language graphemes are converted into
target-language graphemes. We used three dif-
ferent machine learning algorithms (conditional
random fields (CRFs), margin infused relaxed al-
gorithm (MIRA), and maximum entropy model
(MEM)) (Berger et al., 1996; Crammer and
Singer, 2003; Lafferty et al., 2001) for build-
ing multiple machine transliteration engines. We
attempted to improve the transliteration quality
by combining the outputs of different machine
transliteration engines operating on the same in-
put. Our approach was applied to all language
pairs in “NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration
Shared Task.” The official results of our approach
were ranked as the best for four language pairs and
the second best for three language pairs (Li et al.,
2009a).
2 Transliteration
Model
Let S be a source-language word and T be a target-
language transliteration of S. T is represented in
two ways – T
G, a sequence of target-language
graphemes, and T
P, a sequence of target-language
phonemes. Here, a target-language grapheme is
defined as a target-language character. We regard
consonant and vowel parts in the romanized form
of a target language grapheme as a target-language
phoneme. Then TM-G and TM-GP are formu-
lated as Eq (1) and (2), respectively.

Figure 1 illustrates the two transliteration mod-
els with examples, Clinton and its Chinese
and Japanese transliterations. Target language
graphemes are represented in terms of the BIO no-
tation. This makes it easier to represent many-
to-one correspondence between target language
phoneme and grapheme.
3 Machine
Learning Algorithms
A machine transliteration problem can be con-
verted into a sequential labeling problem, where
each source-language grapheme is tagged with its
corresponding target-language grapheme. This
section briefly describes the machine learning al-
gorithms used for building multiple transliteration
engines.
3.1 Maximum
Entropy Model
Machine transliteration based on the maximum
entropy model was described in detail in Oh et al.(2006) along with comprehensive evaluation of its
performance. We used the same way as that pro-
posed by Oh et al. (2006), thus its full description
is not presented here.
3.2 Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs)
CRFs, a statistical sequence modeling framework,
was first introduced by Lafferty et al. (2001).
CRFs has been used for sequential labeling prob-
lems such as text chunking and named entity
recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003). CRF++
1
was used in our experiment.
3.3 Margin
Infused Relaxed Algorithm
The Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA)
has been introduced by Crammer and Singer
(2003) for large-margin multi-class classification.
Kruengkrai et al. (2008) proposed a discriminative
model for joint Chinese segmentation and POS
tagging, where MIRA was used as their machine
learning algorithm. We used the same model for
our machine transliteration, exactly joint syllabi-
cation

and transliteration.

chine learning algorithms.

graphemes (or syllables)
• Left-three and right-three target-language
phonemes

previous three source-language graphemes

4 Multi-engine Transliteration
4.1 Individual
Transliteration Engine
The main aim of the multi-engine transliteration
approach is to combine the outputs of multiple en-
gines so that the final output is better in quality
than the output of each individual engine. We
designed four transliteration engines using dif-
ferent combinations of source-language translit-
eration units, transliteration models, and machine
learning algorithms as listed in Table 1. We named
four transliteration engines as CRF-G, MEM-G,
MEM-GP, and MIRA-G. Here, the prefixes rep-
resent applied machine learning algorithms (max-
imum entropy model (MEM), CRFs, and MIRA),
while G and GP in the suffix represent the translit-
eration models, TM-G and TM-GP, respectively.
Each individual engine produces 30-best translit-
erations for a given source-language word.

4.2 Combining
Methodology
We combined the outputs of multiple translitera-
tion engines by means of a re-ranking function,
g(x). Let X be a set of transliterations gener-
ated by multiple transliteration engines for source-
language word s and ref be a reference translit-
eration of s. A re-ranking function is defined as
Eq. (3), where it ranks ref in X higher and the
others lower (Oh and Isahara, 2007).
g(x):X →{r : risorderingofx∈ X} (3)
We designed two types of re-ranking functions by
using the rank of each individual engine and ma-
chine learning algorithm.
37
4.2.1 Re-ranking Based on the Rank of
Individual Engines
Two re-ranking functions based on the rank of
each individual engine, g
rank
and g
Fscore
(x),
are used for combining the outputs of multiple
transliteration engines. Let X be a set of outputs
of N transliteration engines for the same input.
g
rank
(x) re-ranks x ∈ X in the manner shown
in Eq. (4), where Rank
i
(x) is the position of x in
the n-best list generated by the i
th
transliteration
engine. g
rank
(x) can be interpreted as the average
rank of x over outputs of each individual engine.
If x is not in the n-best list of the i

engine,

Fscore

rank
(x) and the F-
score measure, which is one of the evaluation met-
rics in the “NEWS 2009 Machine Transliteration
Shared Task” (Li et al., 2009b). We considered
the top three outputs of each individual engine
as reference transliterations and defined them as
virtual reference transliterations. We calculated
the F-score measure between the virtual reference
transliteration and each output of multiple translit-
eration engines. g
Fscore
(x) is defined by Eq. (5),
where VRef is a set of virtual reference transliter-
ations, and F
score
(vr,x) is a function that restores
the F-score measure between vr and x.

Since the F-score measure is calculated in terms of
string similarity, x gets a high score from g
MF
(x)
when it is orthographically similar to virtual refer-
ence transliterations.
4.2.2 Re-ranking based on Machine Learning
Algorithm
We used the maximum entropy model for learn-
ing re-ranking function g
ME
(x). Let ref be a ref-
erence transliteration of source-language word s,
feature(x) be a feature vector of x ∈ X, and
y ∈{ref,wrong} be the training label for x.
g
ME
(x) assigns a probability to x ∈ X as shown
in Eq. (6).

(x)=P(ref|feature(x)) (6)
A feature vector of x is composed of

where

gine are used as a feature.
We estimated P(ref|feature(x)) by using the
development data.

of individual translit-

guage pairs in “NEWS 2009 Machine Translit-
eration Shared Task” (Li et al., 2004; Kumaran
and Kellner, 2007; The CJK Dictionary Institute,
2009). CRF-G was the best transliteration engine
in EnKa, EnKo, and EnRu. Owing to the high
training costs of CRFs, we trained CRF-G in EnCh
with a very small number of iterations
5
. Hence,
the performance of CRF-G was poorer than that
of the other engines in EnCh. MEM-GP was the
best transliteration engine in EnCh, EnHi, EnJa,
and EnTa. These results indicate that joint use
of source language graphemes and target language
phonemes were very useful for improving perfor-
mance. MIRA-G was sensitive to the training data
size, because it was based on joint syllabication
and transliteration. Therefore, the performance of
MIRA-G was relatively better in EnCh and EnJa,
whose training data size is bigger than other lan-
guage pairs. CRF-G could not be applied to JnJk,
mainly due to too long training time. Further,
MEM-GP could not be applied to JnJk, because
transliteration in JnJk can be regarded as conver-
sion of target language phonemes to target lan-
guage graphemes. MEM-G and MIRA-G were

transliteration approach to “NEWS 2009 Machine
Transliteration Shared Task.” We built multiple

binations of transliteration models and machine
learning algorithms. We showed that the translit-

transliteration approach are effective, regardless of
