As explained in (Jankowski et al., 1990), for the purpose of alignment with TIMIT, sets of clicks were added at the start and end of utterances. However, it is reported that this method produced misalignments in approximately 10% of uttera</context>

In NTIMIT the signal was passed to the telephone line using a handset and an artificial mouth placed in an acoustically isolated room (Jankowski et al., 1990). On the contrary, in STC-TIMIT we use the switchboard to generate directly the telephone signal at the calling end and therefore it is not affected by convolutional distortions caused by the telepho</context>
