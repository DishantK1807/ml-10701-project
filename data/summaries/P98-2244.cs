There exist several methods of calculating a similarity curve, or a sequence of similarity values, representing the lexical cohesion of successive constituents (such as paragraphs) of text (see, e.g., (Hearst, 1994; Hearst, 1997; Kozima, 1993; Morris and Hirst, 1991; Yaari, 1997; Youmans, 1991)).

For example, the lexical cohesion profile (Kozima, 1993) should be perfectly usable with our fragmentation method.
