To this purpose it provides parallelism constraints (Niehren and Koller, 1998) of the form X/X',,~Y/Y I reminiscent to equality up-to constraints (Niehren et al., 1997a), and anaphoric bindings constraints of the form ante(X)=X'.

In principle, capturing may occur in all formalisms for structural underspecification which represent binding relations by the coordination of variables (Reyle, 1995; Pinkal, 1996; Bos, 1996; Niehren et al., 1997a).
P97-1053
The insights of the CU-analysis in (Niehren et al., 1997b) carry over to CLLS, but the awkward second-order equations for expressing dominance in CU can be omitted (Niehren and Koller, 1998).

(8) has three readings (see (Crouch, 1995) for a discussion of a similar example).
E95-1032
Our definition of parallelism implements some ideas from Hobbs and Kehler (1997) on the behavior of anaphoric links.
P97-1051
It can be derived in a compositional fashion along the lines described in (Niehren et al., 1997b).
P97-1053
This analysis agrees with the proposal made in (Kehler, 1993; Kehler, 1995).
E93-1025
(11) and (13) together give us a 'Hirschbiihler sentence' (Hirschbiihler, 1982), and our treatment in this case is descriptively equivalent to that of (Niehren et al., 1997b).
P97-1053
Our approach follows Crouch (1995) in this respect, who also includes parallelism constraints in the form of substitution expressions directly into an underspecified semantic formalism (in his case the formalism of Quasi Logical Forms QLF).
E95-1032
As proved in (Niehren and Koller, 1998), CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (Niehren et al., 1997a).
P97-1053
Thus, the coverage of CLLS is comparable to Crouch (1995) and Shieber et al.(1996). We illustrate CLLS at a benchmark case for the interaction of scope, anaphora, and ellipsis (8).
E95-1032
It also extends its linguistic coverage (Niehren et al., 1997b) by integrating an analysis of VP ellipses with anaphora as in (Kehler, 1995).
P97-1053
CLLS extends the expressiveness of context unification (CU) (Niehren et al., 1997a), but it leads to a more direct and more structured encoding of semantic constraints than CU could offer.
P97-1053
A central concern of semantic underspecification (van Deemter and Peters, 1996) is the underspecification of the scope of variable binding operators such as quantifiers (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Alshawi, 1990; Reyle, 1993).
J87-1005 J90-3001
CLLS subsumes dominance constraints (Backofen et al., 1995) as known from syntactic processing (Marcus et al., 1983) with tree-adjoining grammars (Vijay-Shanker, 1992; Rogers and VijayShanker, 1994).
