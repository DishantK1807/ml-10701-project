Therefore, semanti.c. features are analyzed by the structure embedded into the case frame in Japanese syntactic analysis: these features play an important role when selecting words in the transfer phase from Japanese into Pkqglish.
Semantic features are more word specific.
Pairs of deep cases and nouns should be written in the lexicon.
}k)wever, due to the huge number of nouns, it is more effective to include pairs of the deep cases and semantic markers in the lexicon instead of nouns.

Documents. "* ~Transfer Apprpach to Machine Translation We are currently restricting the domain of translation to abstract papers in scientific and technological, fields.
The system is based on a transfer approach and consists of three phases; analysis, transfer and generation.
In the first phase, morphological analysis divides sentence into lexical items, then syntactic analysis is carried out by syntactic and semantic analyses of' Case Grammar in Japanese.
In the second transfer phase, lexical features are transferred and at, the seine time, the syntactic structures are transferred by maldn,; them match tree patterns between Japanese and English, Here, we use semantic features Lo select words for translation into English.
In the final generation phase, syntactic stru¢%urcs are generated by the Phrase Structurc Grammar and the morphological features of ErR;lish.
The fo\] \]owJne; describes the processing fnnct.Jons employed in our system.
Morpholoo:Jeal analysis and generation program are described in L\]:SP, which is adequate for morphological proeess in Japanese and English, whi\]e syntactic analysis, transfer and generation programs are written in GRADE (Grammar DEscriber).
Such process written Jn GRAI)E are independent of natura\].
languages in machine translation.
GRADE allows a grammar writer to write grammars using the same expression in al\] three phases.
Grammati ca\] rules written in GRN\]E (Gl~mmar DEscriber) are trans\[.ated into internal forllis, which are expressed by S-expression in LISP.
This trans\].atJon is performed by GRADE trans\].ator.
3. Concept of a.
Dependency Structure baaed on Case Grammar in Japanese; In Japan, we \[lave come to the cone\] usion that case grammar is the most effective one for" Japanese syntactic analysis in machine translation systems.
This type of grammar has been proposed and studied by Japanese linguists before Fillmore's presentation.
As the word order" is heavily restricted in F~iglish syntax, ATNG(Au~nented Transition Network Grammar) based on CFG(Context Free Grammar) is adequate for syntactic; analysis.
However, Japanese word order is almost unrestricted and Kok~j_q,~hi (postpositonal case particle) play an important role as deep eases in Japanese sentences.
Therefore, case grammar is the most effective method for Japanese * This project was carried out with the aid of a special grant for the pronlotion of science and technology from the ~-ience and Technology Agency of the Japanese Government.
13 syntactic and semantic analyses.
In Japanese syntactic structure, the word order is unrestricted except for predicates(verbs or verb phrases) which will be located at the end of sentences.
In Case Ora,mar, verbs play a very important role in syntactic analysis, and the other parts of speech act only in partnership with or subordinate to verbs.
That is, syntactic analysis is made by ehecking the semantic compatibility between verbs and nouns.
Consequently, the semantic structure of a sentence can be extracted at the same time as syntactic analysis.

Then semantic markers for nouns preceeding to ~Ho-shi are described.
~SemanticMarkersfoK N_ou~na This section describes what the system of semantic information for nouns is and what the concept of semantic markers is and how semantic markers are attached to nouns.
5.1 System
of semantical information for nouns 1 ) Study in the primary stage of our study, we thought that all nouns were symbols to display the following concepts recognized by humans.
We set up four concepts :in heighest level ; "Concrete objects", "Abstract concepts", "Phenomena", and "lluman actions".
Concrete objects are the selfsame objects in the world.
Abstract concepts are the standards which fix intellectual activities of hunlankind.
Phenomena include both social, phenomena and natural phenonlena.
\[\[unlan actions are the selfsame acted by humans.
Wc assigned facets to these four concepts.
Then we further extracted the feature of a park from these facets and assigned a new facet "Parts ° . Similarly, another coneept of "Attribute" was extracted from °Phenomena ° and "lluman actions".
This feature is crucial especially for action nous.
Thus we added two faeeLs; "Parts" and °Attribute".
Nouns also include concepts of measurement, space & topography and time.
So we added three facets; "Measurements", "Spaces & Topography", and "Time".
We classified into lnore concepts as follows.
The concept of concrete objects arcclassified into "Nations & Organizations', °Animate objects' arid "inanimate objects" which cons t\] Lute three independent concepts.
The concept of Ihmlan actions was elassifJ ed t.wo facets, "Sen:~e & Feel ing" and "Actions °.
We rallied the scope formed by the concept "conceptual category".
It is difficu\]k to define the conceptual scope e.xplicitly.
The concept which can be defined explicitly in the conceptual category is called a facet.
The facet i.s subc\]assifJed into a number of semantic slots.
This relation is illustrated i.n fir:ure 5.1.

" cateqory a facet \[ facet name Figure 5, I Relationship between Facet and ~em_ant ie Mm:kerN 2) SubclassJfication of Facets Facets, for example, were subclassified into slots as follows, the facet of Animate objects was subclassified as semantic slots °humans", "animals ~, and "plants ° The facet of Phenomena was subelassified as slots "natural phenomena", "physical phenomena °, "power and energies", "physiological phenomena", °social phenomena ° and "social systems and customs'.
We then set up an "others" slot in each facet, for these words which cannot he assigned to any slot.
The use of these slots is explained in section 5.3.
We will study "others" slots through semantic analysis for nouns; new slots or facets may have to be assigned.
These semantic slots and facets are named semantic markers.
The System of Semantic Markers for Nouns is shown in figure 5.2.
The system of semantic markers for nouns is made up of 13 conceptual facets including ~Others ° markers, and 49 fiiial slots as term i nal s.
We also use Special.
Semantic Markers for "functional words" which represent some patterns, syntactic or semantic information.
For exmnple, the word "comparison" presupposes more than two nouns(arguments); comparison between "A" and "B ° . Then, "WK(Relation)" as a special semantic marker is attached to the word °comparison".
The word "time ° assumes time case.
These features suggest an effective device for semantic analysis.
5.2 Concept

l ) Natiens and Organizations (OF) This concept.us\] facet includes words related to such functional human groups as nations, parties, corporations and organizations.
Words in this facet can occur with volitional verbs, when used as subjects.
2) Ani mate Objects (OV) This conceptual facet includes such names as that of man, animal and plant, llowever, names of organs of the animate objects are included in the slot of "Organs or Components" (EL) under the facet of "Part.".
Names of diseases are included in the slot of "Physiological phenomena" (PB) under" the facet of "Phenolllerla" . 3) Inanimate Objects (CkS) This eoncepLual facet only includes words related to concrete objects in the inanimate objects, such as natural substances, parts and materials of products, artificial substances and J.nstitutions.
The objects which do not exist as concrete objects are included in the facet of °Intell.eetua\] Objects".
4) Intellectual Objects(IO) "IO" includes words related to theories, abstract tools and materials, intellectual products that are created by hunlan intellectual activities.
5) Phenomena (t~) "I~" includes words related to natural phenomena, physical phenomena, power & energies, physiological phenomena, social phenomena and systems/customs.
Words having causal properties are attached to words under this facet using plus minus signs (° i-" and ....
). Sign "4" denotes desirable conditions(e.g, success), while sign ° " indicates undesirable conditions (e.
g. suicide ) 6) Sense and Feeling(SO) °(IS ° includes words related to human mental phenomena such as feeling, reaction, recognition and thinking.
7) Actions(H)) "IX)" includes words related to human such as human actions and movements.
activities 8) Parts (EO) "tO" includes such words related to parts and e~nponents of concrete objects as parts, components and organs.

5.3 flow te attach semantic markers to words \]'he semantic markers for' nouns are deternlined in the following steps.
I) Attach semantic markers to the following nouns.
Propcr houri Connnon noun Action noun l (Sahen mei shi ) Action noun P,(exeept action noun 1) Adverbial noun(only when the words include the', concept of "Time" or "l.ocation" ) Interrogative pronoun Persona\] pronoun Demonstrative pronoun (only when the words include tile c.oneept of "\[,oeation") 2) Attach semantic markers to the: words according to the definition, semantic scope and examples given in the "definition table" of semantic markers.
3) Do not attach semantic markers to the following words : Molecular formulas Arithmetic expressions Names of product models 4) \]if a word belongs to multiple slots in the same facet, attach all relevant markers.
5) if a word belongs to a facet but this word not belongs to any appropriate slot in the facet, attach "others" marker in this facet to that word.
6) if a word is equal to a facet name itself, attach the semantic marker of that facet name to the word.
7) If the concept of a word is not included in any facet, attach "Others ° faeet(ZZ) to that word.
8) For compound words consisting of more than one word, attach the markers putting into consideration semantic information of the compound words themselves; do not always attach the marker only to the last element of the compound.
6. Sen!anti.c Informationfor Adverbs In our system, adverbs are subelassified fol lows.
I ) Adverb of condition(Joukyou fuku shi) 2) Adverb of degree(Teido fuku shi ) as 3) Adverb of stateJnent(Chinjutsu fuku-shi) 4) Adverb of quantity(Suuryou fuku shi) Besides, the aspects of verbs are c\]assified', "Mood", "Aspect °, "Tense °, and "Degree".
They contrast specific adverbs.
Then semantic information for adverbs is used to ensure more accurate translations.
Semantic information for adverbs are defined according to the concept aspects as follows.
I ) Semantic information on mood determined by the adverb of statenlcnt Subjunctive(e.g.
if), Interrogation(e.g.
when), Negation (e.
g. not always), Desirability (e.g.
possibly), Entireness (e.
g. entirely), Concession (e.g.
kindly ) 2,) Semantic information on aspects of verbs determined by the adverb of condition Complet ~on (e.
g. finally ), Progression (e.
g. rapidly ), Repe ti tion (e.
g. repeatably ), ConventJ on (e.
g. accordingly) 3) Seinantie information on tense determined by adverb of condition and statement Past (e.
g. yes terday ), Present (e.
g, now ), Future(e.g.
tomorrow) 4) ~mantic infornlation on degree when the adverb or adjective can be modified by the adverb of degree and quantity Scale(e.g, serJous\].y), Degree(e.g.

7.2 Interpretation
of Optional Cases One tCqkt!jo:shi (surface case) often plays the role of different deep eases in Japanese.
Often, various optional cases are included in this deep ease.
Fact optional, case is determined by the combination of K(gcujo:sltt(surface case) and the semantic marker of the noun which co occurs with it in the dictionary.
In the process of transfer, appropriate English prepositions must be specified according to each determined optional deep case.
For example, take kuk~jo-shi"~ ", The optional case is deternlined from the semantic marker of noun and the semantic marker which co occurs with the surface case of the verb.
1'hen the case frame in English is selected arid the preposition "in" is determined.
This process is shown as follows.
Ex. (1) Source sentence: J-& L-<J\]t~Eft~D~\]tLz~'6 ~2'l~fl/il~lik"\] 7,%~ 7< & O-$;~Ic.->t,,-<a~lIJI<, Translated sentence: The numerically controlled superhigh speed drilling machines are explained which are active mainly now in markets.
Explanation of Example (1): Let us observe the Japanese Analysis Dictionaries for Noun and Verb shown in Figure 7.1.
The noun < fl~N (market)> has semantic markers (SA and PS) according to Noun Dictionary, while verb < ?~\[~8 (be active)> has (SA or OF) for the noun according to case slot2 of case pattern in the verb dictionary.
°Market" and "be active" match with each other with respect to smnantic marker "SA".
Thus, the surface case < ~ > in the Japanese input sentence is determined to have the surface case "SA", which corresponds to case label < ~> SPAce+ Ex.
(2) Source sentence : ~flillIgT~l,IIz 2.
& t---~N~IIZ%¢ilc-) Translated sentence: Problems are solved bg two handling methods about laser absorption terms by the inverse damping radiation, and numerical solutions are obtained.
Explanation of Example (2) : Using these Dictionaries, the noun < IN O ~I,'P~ (handling methods)> has semantic markers(!C and AN) while verb < ~g< (solve)> has (DA, IT, J_C or TS) for the noun preceding the Kaknjo-shi.
"handling methods" and "solve" match with each other with respect to "IC ° .

8, Exanp\]es of Selantic Markers Use(l in Transfer Process in the transfer' phase the English verb is chosen by examining the semantic markers for nouns filling the deep case slot of" the condition part of the verb transfer dictionary.
Two examples of selecting the traslation for the Japanese verb," ~'" are as foil©us: Ex.
(1) Source sentence:*l-I ~,~J:U~6£x2 yg Translated sentence: The radiation and convection models of the vertical mercury arcs which contain the sodium and the scandium iodide.
gx. (2) Source sentence:~6~iE~f~K ~Ja £ 14 ~ b N~ea~No Translated sentence: Lemmas are verified by showing specific constitution methods about constitution methods of the normal double orthogonal bases which i~clud~ given normal double orthogonal systems.
Explanation of Example (1): Based on the Japanese to English Transfer Dictionary, Figure 8.1, both l J-b I O~ (sodium)> and < ~5£x~ ~99~ (scandium iodine)> in Example (1) have OM.
According to the conditions of the dictionary, ~ matches one of the semantic markers (OSO~jPN PB PP PE) in correspond to the appropriate case slot (in this case <.

9~._Concl u..ion Acknow \] edgmen We would like to thank Prof.
Makoto Nagao, Prof.
Junichi Tsujii, Mr.
Junichi Nakamura(F~oto University), Mrs.
Mutsuko Kimura (Institute for Behavior and Science), and Miss Masako Kume(Japan Convention Services, Inc).
and the other members of the Mu project working group for the useful discussions which led to many of the ideas presented in this paper.
I) When semantic markers are attached by human operation, several problems arise.
The first problem is simple mistakes made by humans.
The second problem is a fluctuation of semantic analysis due to a large amount of data.
So it is necessary to develop an automatic marking system to save time and to improve efficiency.
P) When assigning semantic markers to nouns, we attached them without considering the relationship between nouns and verbs.
That is, we attached semantic markers simply based on noun concepts.
This is not adequate to handle nouns which are intrinsically related to verbs.
One of the solutions to this problem will be to study the correlation matrix of the semantic markers for nouns in relation to the case frame of verbs.
3) Our system of semantic markers for nouns has been designed for Japanese nouns.
We have to design a syst~, of semantic mgrkers for English nouns.
Since recognition for its concept in an Enlish word is very difficult for the Japanese, we are also studying a method of evaluation test to handle these data.
4) Our system of semantic markers for nouns simply consists of the tree structure of facets and slots.
Subclassification for these structures with deep tree structure is a significant problem in order to analyze the concept of nouns more in detail, but such a semantic marking operation will bec~ne more c~nplex and difficult for I), 2) problems.
5) We suppose that a concept system for words is not a static structure, but various semantic networks constructed dynamically according to a given sUory.
We must give thorough consideration to this prospective problems.
