Some theoretical works from the literature also support this approach: (Guo, 1997) shows that sonle segmentation techniques can be generalized to any language, regardless of their writing systenl.

As (Sproat et al., 1996) testify, several native Chinese speakers do not always agree on one unique tokenization for a given sentence.

An important implication is that a same resource can be applied iteratively; as shown by (Roche, 1994:) this feature allows to implement segmentation models much more powerful than simple regular languages (see section 3.3 for an example).
