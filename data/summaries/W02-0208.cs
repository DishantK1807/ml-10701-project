Third, our dialogues are task-oriented and have a hierarchical structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

In her analysis, she finds good agreement between these emphasized regions and the beginnings of manually marked discourse segments (in the framework of Grosz and Sidner [1986]).

Whereas earlier work tended to look at these phenomena in isolation (Nakatani and Hirschberg 1994; Stolcke and Shriberg 1996), more recent work has attempted to solve several tasks within one framework (Heeman and Allen 1999; Stolcke et al.1998). Most approaches use some kind of prosodic information, such as duration of pauses, stress, and pitch contours, and most of them combine this prosodic information with information about word identity and sequence (n-grams, hidden Markov 461 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 4 models).

There have been attempts to get a more complete coverage of detection and correction of all types of speech repairs (Heeman and Allen 1999).

of human tutorial dialogues In an earlier analysis (Kim, Freedman and Evens 1998) we showed that a significant portion of human-human tutorial dialogues can be modeled with the hierarchical structure o f task-oriented dialogues (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
