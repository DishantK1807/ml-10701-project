Vlachos and Gasperin (2006) produced a revised version of the 59 guidelines for the task, and were able to achieve an a0 score of 91%, and a kappa of 0.905, between a computational linguist and a domain expert.

The usefulness of character-based a0 -grams has also been demonstrated elsewhere (Wilbur et al., 1999; Vasserman, 2004; Townsend et al., 2005).

The BioIE P450 corpus (Kulick et al., 2004), by contrast, includes chemicals, proteins and other substances such as foodstuffs in a single category called ?substance??

Both the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003) and the BioIE cytochrome P450 corpus (Kulick et al., 2004) come with named entity annotations that include a proportion of chemicals, and at least a few abstracts that are recognisable as chemistry abstracts.

A few chemical named entity recognition (Corbett and Murray-Rust, 2006; Townsend et al., 2005; Vasserman, 2004; Kemp and Lynch, 1998; Sun et al., 2007) or classification (Wilbur et al., 1999) systems have been published.

It is possible that tokens that contain hyphens, brackets and other special characters are more likely to be unknown or rare tokens?the TokenShapeChunker has previously been reported to make most of its mistakes on these (Vlachos and Gasperin, 2006), so tokenising them is likely to make less of an impact.
