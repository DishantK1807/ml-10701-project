A related example would be a version of synchronous CFG that allows only one pair of linked nonterminals and any number of unlinked nonterminals, which could be bitextparsed in O(n5) time, whereas inversion transduction grammar (Wu, 1997) takes O(n6).

Satta and Schuler (1998), working within the application domain of natural language syntax, dene another restriction on TAG which is also recognizable in O(n5) time.

The sub1Adjunction at root and foot nodes is another operation that by itself will not take a formalism beyond context-free power, a fact which is exploited in Rogers’ regular-form TAG (Rogers, 1994).

Proposition 2 (Uemura et al.1999). CFL subsetnoteql ESL-TAL Proposition 3 (Kato et al.2004). CFL ∪ SL-TAL subsetnoteql ESL-TAL Proposition 4 (Satta and Schuler 1998; Uemura et al.1999). SSL-TAG and ESL-TAG can be parsed in O(n5) time.

But this new derivation generates a string that was generable in the original grammar, namely by adjoining βL at 2This corresponds to Steps 1 4 of that proof (Schabes and Waters, 1995, p.

Since these only insert material to the left or right of a node, just as in tree-insertion grammars (TIGs), we may apply the conversion from TIGs to tree-substitution grammars (Schabes and Waters, 1995), used in the proof of the context-freeness of 26 (Step 1a)...
