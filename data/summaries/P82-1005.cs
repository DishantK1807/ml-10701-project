Thompson's (1980) extensive tabulation of utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison overlaps our analysis at the level of syntax.

Allen and Perrault (1980) suggest that properties needed to "fill in" such fragments come from shared expectations (not just from prior syntactic forms, as is current practice in computational linguistics) . The property in question in our domain is IDENTIFIED-REFERENT(HEARER, NP), which is (somehow) derived from the nature of the task as one of manual assembly.

The utterances in Group A can then be analyzed as requests for IDENTIFY-REFERENT using Perrault and Allen' s (1980) method of applying plan recognition to the definition of communicative acts.

The paper suggests how a plan-based theory of communication (Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Perrault and Allen, 1980) can uncover the intentions underlying the use of various forms.
