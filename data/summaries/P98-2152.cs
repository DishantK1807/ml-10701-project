Recently, statistical language models and featurebased method have been used for context-sensitive spelling correction, where errors are corrected considering the context in which the error occurs (Church and Gale, 1991; Mays et al., 1991; Golding and Schabes, 1996).

There is only one published work investigating the baseline accuracy much lower than 90% (Nagata, 1996).

Similar techniques are used for correcting the output of English OCRs (Tong and Evans, 1996) and English speech recognizers (Ringger and Allen, 1996).

= arg mwax P(W\[X) = arg mwax P(X\[W)P(W) (10) The maximization search can be efficiently implemented by using the Viterbi-like dynamic programing procedure described in (Nagata, 1996).

Newspapers were scanned at 300dpi and 400dpi, two of 4(Nagata, 1996) reported that, when the baseline accuracy is 90%, his method achieved 96.3%.

3In (Nagata, 1996), it was assumed that the rank order distribution of the correct characters is a geometric distribution whose parameter is the accuracy of the first candidate.

For comparison, we implemented the OCR error correction method, which does not use character similarity information, presented in (Nagata, 1996).

Recently, the first problem was solved by selecting the most likely word sequence from all combinations of exactly and approximately matched words using a Viterbi-like word segmentation algorithm and a statistical language model considering unknown words and non-words (Nagata, 1996).

The solution presented in (Nagata, 1996) which sorts a list of one edit distance words considering the context in which it will be placed is inaccurate because the context itself might include some errors.
