The most comparable results to our preliminary results are those reported by Resnik \[1997\] since he used the same corpus and evaluated against the same test set.

Resnik \[1999\] proposed a method for facilitating the acquisition of parallel corpora from the WWW.

It is an implementation of Models 1-4 of Brown et al.\[1993\], where each of these models produces a Viterbi alignment.

The algorithm~ disambiguate_class, which is implemented by Resnik and described in detail in \[Resnik, 1999\], calculates the similarity between all the words' senses of words in a set.

For instance, Yarowsky \[1992&1995\] reports the highest accuracy rates, to date, for an unsupervised method of a mean of 92%, yet his evaluation was measured using a knowledge resource, Roget's thesaurus, which has a coarser granularity in its sense representation than WordNet.

\[A10naizan et al., 1999; Melamed, 2000; etc.\] • For each source language token, create a List of its alignments to target language tokens, target set • Using the taxonomy, calculate the distance between the senses of the tokens in the target set; assign the appropriate sense(s) to each of the tokens in the target set based on an optimiTation function over the entire set of target token senses * Propagate the assigned senses back to both target and source corpora tokens, effectively, creating two tag sets, one for each the target and source corpus • Evaluate the resnlting tag sets against a hand tagged test set.

Many researchers in the field have looked at language translations as a source for sense distinctions \[Dagan & Itai, 1994; Dyvik, 1998; Ide, in press; Resnik & Yarowsky, 1999; etc.\].
J94-4003 P99-1068
\[Och & Ney, 2000\] The latter result has to be considered with caution in the present experimental design context since the evaluation of the alignments was done with a human translation on a closed domain corpus, for only one of the languages under consideration in the current investigation.

In an attempt to approximate the human effort, both supervised \[Bruce & Weibe, 1994; Lin, 1999;etc.\] and unsupervised methods \[Resnik 1997; Yarowsky, 1992&1995; etc.\] have been proposed to solve the problem automatically.

It is a balanced corpus and it has more than 200K words that are manually sense tagged as a product of the semantic concordance (SemCor) effort using WordNet \[Miller et al.1994\]. The SemCor data is tagged in lamning text words of varying parts of speech are tagged in context using WordNet 1.6.
