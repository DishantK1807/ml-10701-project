There has recently been a good deal of discussion about the "language" of thought or '~entalese" (\[Fodor 1975\]), \[Pylyshyn 1978\], \[Woods 1978\], \[Johnson-Laird 1978\]).

(See also Marcus \[1978\] for more evidence on input butter restrictions in adults).

(Some exceptions are \[Preparata and Ray 1972\], \[Yakimovsky 1973\], \[Bajcsy and Joshi 1978\], \[Zucker, Rosenfeld and Davis 1975\], and \[Tenenbaum and Weyl 1975\]).

~As discussed in Bajcsy & Joshi \[1978\], in adult speech shape is described verbally by referring to other familiar (or canonical) objects.

This idea is related to work in spreading activation for semantic networks \[Collins and Loftus 1972\], as well as to "focussing as in Grosz \[1978\].

MTRANS (transfer information between or within animals), PROPEL (apply force to), GRASP, SPEAK (make a noise, and ATTEND (Focus a sense organ on an object \[Schank 1975\].

Two particularly suggestive phenomena (other than visual imagery): (i) The striking similarity of some memories to sensory phenomena: in order to retrieve the punchline of a joke or content of a story, I sometimes have to go through the whole joke or story; I can "play back" music; etc., (2) recent work by Fillmore \[1977\] and Grosz \[1978\] which suggests that language may guide an analog of the attention process by suggesting a perspective from which to view memory structure(s) as they are retrieved.

To quote Pylyshyn \[1978\] at some length: 150 "There is no explanation, not even the beginnings of an approach, for dealing with the accommodation of schemata or conceptual structures into ones not expressible as definitional composites of existing ones.

Visual imagery My position may be acceptable to both Pylyshyn \[1973\] and Kosslyn \[1978\].

149 The need for an internal representation separate natural lansuase It is now reasonably well-established that people use large structures like "scripts" \[Schank and Abelson 1977\] or "frames-systems" \[Minsky 1975\] prevasively for reasoning and language and that a large script can be invoked by referring to a single salient aspect of the script.

Along these same lines, there are striking parallels in the structures of Schank's \[1975\] conceptual dependency diagrams for PTRANS, ATRANS, and MTRANS (see earlier footnote).
