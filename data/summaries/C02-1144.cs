We used Minipar 1 (Lin 1994), a broadcoverage English parser, to parse about 1GB (144M words) of newspaper text from the TREC collection (1988 AP Newswire, 1989-90 LA Times, and 1991 San Jose Mercury) at a speed of about 500 words/second on a PIII-750 with 512MB memory.

Similarity Following (Lin 1998), we represent each word by a feature vector.
P98-2127
An example of the second approach evaluates the clusters by using them to smooth probability distributions (Lee and Pereira 1999).
P99-1005
Broad-coverage lexical resources such as WordNet are extremely useful in applications such as Word Sense Disambiguation (Leacock, Chodorow, Miller 1998) and QuestionAnswering (Pasca and Harabagiu 2001).
J98-1006
We use the frequency counts of synsets in the SemCor corpus (Landes, Leacock, Tengi 1998) to estimate the probability of a subhierarchy.
