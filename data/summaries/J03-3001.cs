Two studies in this area are Sekine (1997) and Gildea (2001), both of which show substantial variation in model performance 342 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 3 Table 5 Hits for Spanish pensar que with and without possible “dequeismos errors” (spurious de between the verb and the relative), from Alltheweb.com (March 2003).

In the main session Atsushi Fujii and Tetsuya Ishikawa (2000) demonstrated that descriptive, definition-like collections can be acquired from the Web.

Another argument is made vividly by Banko and Brill (2001).

It was only with the highly successful 1993 special issue of this journal, “Using Large Corpora” (Church and Mercer 1993), that the relation between computational linguistics and corpora was consummated.

As mentioned above, Sekine (1997) and Gildea (2001) directly address the relation between NLP systems and text type; one further such item is Roland et al.(2000). Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001) explores the relation between domain and sense disambiguation.

100M Words of the BNC One hundred million words is a large enough corpus for many empirical strategies for learning about language, either for linguists and lexicographers (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998; Kilgarriff and Rundell 2002) or for technologies that need quantitative information about the behavior of words as input (most notably parsers [Briscoe and Carroll 1997; Korhonen 2000]).

Philip Resnik (1999) showed that parallel corpora—until then a promising research avenue but largely constrained to the English-French Canadian Hansard—could be found on the Web: We can grow our own parallel corpus using the many Web pages that exist in parallel in local and in major languages.
P99-1068
Rada Mihalcea and Dan Moldovan (1999) used hit counts for carefully constructed search engine queries to identify rank orders for word sense frequencies, as an input to a word sense disambiguation engine.

Clearly, the statistics for different types of text will be different (Biber 1993).
J93-2001
The EU MEANING project (Rigau et al.2002) takes forward the exploration of the Web as a data source for word sense disambiguation, working from the premise that within a domain, words often have just one meaning, and that domains can be identified on the Web.

Exceptions focusing on genre include Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch ¨utze (1997) and Karlgren and Cutting (1994).

Arguments raged, and it was not clear whether corpus work was an acceptable 1 Across the Atlantic, a resurgence in empiricism was led by the success of the noisy-channel model in speech recognition (see Church and Mercer [1993] for references).
