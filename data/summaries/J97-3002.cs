The usual Chinese NLP architecture first preprocesses input text through a word segmentation module (Chiang et al.1992; Lin, Chiang, and Su 1992, 1993; Chang and Chen 1993; Wu and Tseng 1993; Sproat et al.1994; Wu and Fung 1994), but, clearly, bilingual parsing will be hampered by any errors arising from segmentation ambiguities that could not be resolved in the isolated monolingual context because even if the Chinese segmentation is acceptable monolingually, it may not agree with the words present in the English sentence.

Inspection showed the errors to be due largely to imperfections of our translation lexicon, which contains approximately 6,500 English words and 5,500 Chinese words with about 86% translation accuracy (Wu and Xia 1994), so a better lexicon should yield substantial performance improvement.

A number of recent proposals can be cast in this framework (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994).

We have been using a lexicon that was automatically learned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung and Wu 1994; Wu and Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation-learning procedure (Wu and Xia 1994).

The later IBM models are formulated to prefer collocations (Brown et al.1993). In the case of word_align (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Dagan and Church 1994), a penalty is imposed according to the deviation from an ideal matching, as constructed by linear interpolation?

We consider elsewhere an extreme special case of leaky ITGs, inversion-invariant transduction grammars, in which all productions occur with both orientations (Wu 1995).

Finite-state transducers, or FSTs, are well known to be useful for specific tasks such as analysis of inflectional morphology (Koskenniemi 1983), text-to-speech conversion (Kaplan and Kay 1994), and nominal, number, and temporal phrase normalization (Gazdar and Mellish 1989).

Parallel bilingual corpora have been shown to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (Brown et al.1990; Gale and Church 1991; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Church 1993; Brown et al.1993; Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Department of Computer Science, University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong.

Algorithms for subsentential alignment have been developed as well as granularities of the character (Church 1993), word (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993; Fung and Church 1994; Fung and McKeown 1994), collocation (Smadja 1992), and specially segmented (Kupiec 1993) levels.

It can now be assumed that a parallel bilingual corpus may be aligned to the sentence level with reasonable accuracy (Kay and Ri3cheisen 1988; Catizone, Russel, and Warwick 1989; Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Chen 1993), even for languages as disparate as Chinese and English (Wu 1994).

Aside from purely linguistic interest, bracket structure has been empirically shown to be highly effective at constraining subsequent training of, for example, stochastic context-free grammars (Pereira and Schabes 1992; Black, Garside, and Leech 1993).
P92-1017
Crossing constraints are implicit in many phrasal matching approaches, both constituency-oriented (Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Cranias, Papageorgiou, and Peperidis 1994; Grishman 1994) and dependency-oriented (Sadler and Vendelmans 1990; Matsumoto, Ishimoto, and Utsuro 1993).
C90-3101 C92-2101 C94-1014 P93-1004
FSTs may also be used to parse restricted classes of context-free grammars (Pereira 1991; Roche 1994; Laporte 1996).
