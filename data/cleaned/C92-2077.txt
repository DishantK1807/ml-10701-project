The uniformity of the AD organization and of the DE pattern does not prevent the system from taking into account the structural differences of isolating (analytical), agglutinating and internal-flection languages.
The "Speech Statistics" (SpSt) project team has been designing a linguistic automaton aimed at NL processing in a variety of forms.
In addition to Germanic and Romance languages the system under development is to handle text processing of a number of Oriental languages.
The strategy adopted by th~ SpSt ~roup is characterized by a lexicalized approach: the NLP algorit}nns for any language are entirely AD dependent, i.e., a large lexicon database has been provided, its entries being loaded with information including not only lexical, but also morphological, syntactic and semantic data.
This information concentrated in dictionary entries (DEs) is essential for both source text analysis and target (Russian) text generation.
The DE structure is largely determined by the typological features of the source language.
The SpSt group has hitherto had to deal w.ith European languages and it was for these languages (inflective and inflective analytical) that the prototype entry schemes were elaborated and adopted.
No doubt, the typological characteristics of Oriental languages required certain modifications to be made %o the basic scheme.
Hence in the present paper each of the language types is given consideration.
Agglutinating languages proved to be the most suitable to process according to the SpSt strategy.
But an isolating language will be the first to be proposed for discussion.
I. The AD organization for a~ isolating language: Chinese For the purposes of NLP it is plausible to assume written Chinese as exclusively isolating language where affixation is virtually non-existent.
The few inflective word-forms are entered into the lexicon as unanalizable lexical items, whereas multiple grammar formants are treated as free structural elements.
High degree of lexical ambiguity making syntactic disambiguation a must, and the fact that word boundaries are not explicitly AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO13T 1992 5 0 5 Paoc.

23-28, 1992 marked in the text are well-known problems with Chinese text analysis.
(Actually, in the MULTIS project elaborated by the SpSt group Chinese characters are transformed into 4-digit strings in conformity with Chinese Standard Telegraph Code).
Thus grammatical and logico semantic relations in the text are expressed by word order, structural words and semantic valencies.
In addition to their role of the labels for syntactic units (predicate, direct and indirect objects, etc).
the structural words function as delimitators singling out word-forms and phrases.
A separate sub-lexicon for structural words is accordingly provided within the whole lexicon database of Chinese as source language.
The file of notional words comprises lexical items of various lengths ranging from one-character items to eight-character ones, no differentiation being made among one-stem words, composite words and phrases.
A distinct version of the DE scheme is assigned to each of the two classes of lexical items: notional words (N/ W) and structural words (S/W).
The DE scheme for N/W includes, along with syntactic and semantic, the following data: i) Part of ~pcech assignment; 2) Information on the lexical ambiguity.
Thus, by way of example, the one-stem word sudan 'sultan' and composite beida 'Beijing University' are coded N00, where N denotes noun, while qianding 'to sign a treaty' is coded 0S0 where S denotes verb/noun lexicui ambiguity (to be eventually disambiguated by syntactic means).
As to the DE schemes for S/Ws, each of these should include positional characteristics of the lexieal item and provide information on the way the given particle affects formation of the Russian equivalent.
E.g., in the grammatical coding of the verbal aspect S/W le and nominal S/Ws de and ba the following points are marked: i) part of speech dependence; 2) position (proor post-position with respect to the N/W); 3) Russian matching;.
4) syntactic function.
The information placed in a DE may be used in translating sentences as illustrated below: Sudan ba heyue qi-~sding The sultan the peace treaty signed In carrying out the lexico syntactical analysis of this sentence two word groups are delimitated : nominal group ba heyue and verbal group quanding le.
In the ba-DE there are data to define ba as a S/W in preposition to a direct object which is equivalent to a Russian noun in the Accusative Case.
In the le-OE there are data to define le as a verbal index in a post-position to a verbal predicate and indicating the completion of an action, equivalent to a Russian verb in the Past Tense, Perfective.
(For the sake of simplicity the polyvalent and polysemantic nature of these particles is ignored in this example).
2. The AD organization for an agglutinating language: Turkish The agglutinative word-formation technique is characterized by ordered additiun of affixes to the stem to preOuce formant strings of various lengths.
An outstanding feature of agglutinating languages is that these word-forms are not reproduced ready-made in speech but are constructed by the speaker actually 'ad hoc' according to definite rules.
Each of the limited set of affixes imparts 'a semantic quant' or ACRES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Aou'r 1992 $ 0 6 PROC.

Of one nominal stem it is theoretically possible bo derive an infinite number of word-forms (actually, though, only some 200 as registered in the corpora). As to the verbal paradigms, of each stem it is potentially possible to form more than Ii thousand word-:forms.
Clearly, Turkish lexicon database, wouJd include, besides stems, sub-lexicons of postpositive affixes.
Along with the stems of which both nouns and verbs may be derived there are those a.~; s is'ned to only one definitt~ part of speech class (e.
g. gel ' c~me ' ), also unproductive lexemes such as ve 'and' zaten 'generally' . Each DE contains coded J nformation indicating: i ) the lexeme's part of speech class and type of lexical ambiguity ( e.g., for the stem insan 'man' it is noun/adjective ambig'uity, that is, NA ); 2) the lexeme's semantic class ( ee.g., for the stem insan 'man' there is an indication that it belongs to Subject (S) semantic class, and, c.onsequenbly, may function as the subject of a sentence; 3) Russian equivalent ( the address of the "machine" stem with necessary lexico-grammatical information) . Turkish affixes are structured so as to form four connec t.ed graphs constructed to the rules of the grammar of orders.
Graph 1 presents simple noun morphology; Graph 2, finite verb form morphology; Graph 3, non-f inite verb forms ; Graph 4, flomina\] prudicabc; . The word s~em is assigned go the graph root while affixes (their al\].omorph variants) are assigned to graph nodes, each node corresponding to definit~ grammar rank.

2. If no recognition is acknowledged, tile system goes on with iexico-morphological analysis, it is performed by consecut:i ve superposition of affixes on the end segments of the string, 1,be affixes being fed by access to an appropriate graph.
The opt:ration is accomplished by mask matching method proceeding :Irom right to left, from junior order to senior order affixe~i.
All possible affixes having been identified, J.he initial part of the text, word that remains is treated as the hypothetJo stem and is eventually searched in the AD.The search may result in differenl; situations.3.
If the hypothetie stem is identified as one of A\]) stems and its part of speech assignment coincides with that of affixes, then the task is considered to be fulfilled.
E.g., in analysing the text word tutanaklarinin the noun stem tut.anak ' protocol' is revealed:it is a joined by nominal affixus larinin.
The target equivalent with its g'rammatical characteristics is passed to the syntactic module.
4. in case of failure (that is, when the stem is not found) the string is recovered in its original form (identified affixes are ' glued ' back), and the AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO£n" 1992 5 0 7 PROC.

23-28, 1992 analysis restarts with access to Graph 2 on the assumption that the input text word is a finite verb form, etc.
This sequential access to graphs does not take place at random but has been programmed according to the frequency data received by a preliminary quantitative analysis of some text corpora.
3. The AD organization for internal-flection languages: Arabic and Hebrew.
The word morphology of Arabic and Hebrew is not only characterized by internal flection but also by a rather wide use of agglutinative formants and external flection.
Taking into account these features of the Semitic word-form structure three different approaches to AD design seem plausible.
i. Representation of lexicon items by word-forms listed in alphabetical order; in this case the following Hebrew words would have three independent DEs: 1 ~f~ SiLTWoN suit.an 6~@ SiLTWoNJiM sultans S~LT~Ne;.
sultans ~ (status constructus) 2.
An alphabetical arrangement of machine stems as has been made for European languages; in this case the above Hebrew wordforms may be reduced to only one item.
3. Designing the source lexicon as a lexicon of roots; all above-mentioned Hebrew word-forms would then be representated by the root ~.~.~ SLTN supplemented with lists of internal and external affixes.
Since word-formation and wordbuilding in Semitic languages are practically limitless the option of the first or second approaches would cause a dimension crisis with respect to the lexicon size: the AD would surpass the critical storage capacity while the dictionary search would be strongly impeded.
With root-based AD organization the root-originated word-form development process follows the order: "root-derivation internal flection types rules of combination with definite external affixes".
Unfortunately, this kind of AD organization requires, for the purposes of the text-word lexico-grammatical analysis, a multiple access to the hard disk, and this would again cause a dimension crisis, now with respect to the system operating speed.
To relieve the dimension crisis a trade-off may be suggested: combined root-based and alphabetic approach to construction, operation and maintenance of the AD.
With this approach five lists (sublexicons) of linguistic units are distinguished.
i. List of roots actually in use (some 500 for Hebrew, 200 for Arabic).
2. List of internal flections (some 800 for Hebrew, 900 for Arabic).
3. Alphabetic list of words with regular word-formation (nouns, adjectives, also basic forms of verbs); 4.
List of words of Semitic origin with irrigular word-formation and borrowed words (i.e., those where triliteral scheme is not observed).
E.g.,,/)t' 'day',,_O'~ days (this is one of the" few Hebrew nouns where the internal flection is changed with word-formation).

Aceesing to bh~.s~ lists is to take place after the primary root affix ~dentification oT the text word has been done.
Stems of other lists may be assigned various entries.
Irregular word-forms are specified as paradigms where each word-form is supplied with the %arge.t language equivalent.
kecognition and \]exico-morphological analysis of the Semitic text words goes on by the following steps: I.
The root is singled out and recognized according to List I.
The operation performed is in fact a combinatorial-probabilistic analysis of possible consonant combinations within the input text word.
The operation is based on the actual consonants being used exclusively in root,s (so-called root consonants\] or in both roots and affixes (structural consonants) . 2.
Internal f\].ection types (derivations) and their versions are identified with the models included in List 2.
3. The roots recognized are reduced to .lexicon forms as in List 3: this allows one to get the target language equivalent of the item.
The final synthesis of the target text word is performed on the basis of the information of the internal and external fleetions of the given source text word.
The external flections are determined by the types and versions of the internal fleetion: singling out an internal f\]ection automatically i dentil ies the correspondin~ external.

Conclusion As is evident, the very notion of the text word, which is so essential in designing automatic dictionaries, is quite distinct in each of the Oriental languages and fundamentally different from what we are used -to treat as a t <~,x-t word in indo-European languages, inflecting or inflecting analytical.
If an Oriental language AD is to be J nte~rated into a mul timodular NLP system ( such as MULTIS e\].aborated by tht= GpSL group\] and the system has to retain its basic structure, this project requires development of various forms of sub-/exi con databases.
As we have seen the most complicated structure of Arabic and Hebrew text word required elaboration of four versions of DE while the differentiation of notional and structural words in Chinese required two versions.
An agglutinative word structure model such as in Turkish, though the most suitable for the SpZt grammar, required a tree-structured database and special procedures of access.
