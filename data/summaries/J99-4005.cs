Recently, Brown et al.(1993) built a source-channel model of translation between English and French.

In Brown et al.(1993), aligrtrnents are asymmetric-each French word is connected to exactly one English word.

We note that Brew (1992) discusses the NPcompleteness of a related problem, that of finding some permutation of a string that is acceptable to a given context-free grammar.

In the main channel model of Brown et al.(1993), each English word token ei in a source sentence is assigned a "fertility" @, which dictates how many French words it will produce.

2. Part-of-Speech Tagging The prototype source-channel application in natural language is part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988).

Lacking a polynomial reformulation, Brown et al.(1993) decided to collect counts only over a subset of likely alignments.

610 Knight Decoding Complexity More efficient O(lm) training was devised by Brown et al.(1993). Instead of processing each alignment separately, they modified the algorithm in Figure 2 as follows: b.

Brown et al.(1993) recently cast some simple theories into a source-channel framework, using the bilingual Canadian parliament proceedings as training data.
