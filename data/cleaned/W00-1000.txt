2:18	SIGdial is the ACL Special Interest Group in Discourse and Dialogue which was formed in late 1997.
3:18	With the increasing importance of our area of research there has been a perceived need in the SIGdial Community for a regular workshop spanning the entire field of discourse and dialogue.
4:18	While there has been a lot of activity in the field, and fairly ffrequent workshops on various subtopics, there has not been a regular place for presentation of discourse and dialogue research to receive attention from the larger SIGdial community.
5:18	This workshop is intended to be the first in a regular series which serves to bring the SIGdial community together.
6:18	Topics for this workshop include formal, corpus-based, implementational and analytical work on discourse and dialogue, with a focus on the following three themes:  Dialogue Systems, i.e. models, methods, strategies, tools and architectures related to spoken, multi-modal, and text/web based dialogue systems.
7:18	 Corpora and Corpus Tools, i.e. support for corpus-based work on discourse and dialogue.
8:18	 Pragmatic and/or Semantic Modelling, i.e. the pragmatics and/or semantics of discourse and dialogue (beyond a single sentence), and specific aspects of discourse and dialogue structure.
9:18	In addition to these three themes, this year's workshop includes a special-theme session on  Principles for Evaluation of Dialogue Systems.
10:18	We would like to thank the members of the Program CornrnitteeNiels Ole Bemsen, Phil Cohen, Morena Danieli, Yasuharu Den, Barbara Di Eugenio, Paul Heisterkamp, Lynette Hirschrnan, Beth Arm Hockey, Kristiina Jokinen, Pamela Jordan, Hans Kamp, Ian Lewin, Daniel Marcu, Katashi Nagao, Laurent Romary, Remko Scha, Akira Shimazu, Candace Sidner, Mark Steedman, Michael Strube, Jan van Kuppevelt, and Marilyn Walker for their work.
11:18	We would also like to thank our invited speaker, Jens Allwood, for his contribution to the Workshop Program.
12:18	We are sure that these efforts together with the active participation of workshop attendees will make the workshop a stimulating and constructive event for interchange of research results, ideas and visions for future work.
