The algorithm consists of three major parts: Check success IS 1 \], Choose property \[$6\], and Extend description \[S16\]; this organization stems from (Dale, Haddock, 1991) and is extended here.

in the Algorithm The new algorithm designed to incorporate these concepts is built on the basis of some predecessor algorithms (Dale, Haddock, 1991, Reiter, Dale 1992, Horacek, 1995, Horacek, 1996), from which we also adopt the notation.

Two other interpretations, the Greedy heuristic interpretation (Dale, 1989) and the local brevity interpretation (Reiter, 1990a) lead to algorithms that have polynomial complexity in the same order of magnitude.

Some predecessor algorithms, for instance (Dale, Haddock 1991), would still attempt to distinguish b I from b2.

The algorithm in (Dale, Haddock 1991) would produce the less natural, embedded expression 'the table on which there is a glass besides which there is a cup' instead.

By applying this strategy, a best-first behavior is achieved instead of pure breadth-first (Reiter, Dale, 1992), depth-first (Dale, Haddock, 1991), and iterative deepening (Horacek, 1995, Horacek, 1996) strategies.

The approach undertaken by Appelt and Kronfeld (Appelt, 1985a, Appelt, 1985b, Kronfeld, 1986, Appelt, Kronfeld, 1987) is very elaborate but it suffers from very limited coverage, missing assessments of the relative benefit of alternatives, and notorious inefficiency.

Over the last decade, (Dale, 1989, Dale, Haddock, 1991, Reiter, 1990b, Dale, Reiter, 1995), and others 2 have contributed to this issue The term 'referential description' is due to Donellan (Donellan, 1966).
E91-1028 P89-1009 P90-1013
Full brevity, the strongest interpretation, is underlying Dale's algorithm (Dale, 1989), which produces a description entailing the minimal number of attributes possible, at the price of suffering NP-hard complexity.
P89-1009
A context set is defined as the set of entities the addressee is currently assumed to be attending to this is similar to the set of entities in the focus spaces of the discourse focus stack in Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure (Grosz, Sidner, 1986).

(see the systems NAOS (Novak, 1988), EPICURE (Dale, 1988), FN (Reiter, 1990a), and IDAS (Reiter, Dale, 1992)).
