for the optimal model The search for the optimal model given our input data corresponds closely to the recursive segmentation algorithm presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).

We utilize an evaluation method for segmentation of words presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).

algorithms The new probabilistic method is compared to two existing segmentation methods: the Recursive MDL method presented in (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)10 and John Goldsmith’s algorithm called Linguistica (Goldsmith, 2001).11 Both methods use MDL (Minimum Description Length) (Rissanen, 1989) as a criterion for model optimization.

We previously presented two segmentation algorithms suitable for agglutinative languages (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).

A Poisson distribution can be justified and has been used in order to model the length distribution of word and morph tokens [e.g., (Creutz and Lagus, 2002)], but for morph types we have chosen the gamma distribution, which has a thicker tail.

Often the limiting assumption is made that words consist of only one stem followed by one (possibly empty) suffix (D´ejean, 1998; Snover and Brent, 2001; Snover et al., 2002).

The Finnish data consists of subsets of a newspaper text corpus from CSC,12 from which nonwords (numbers and punctuation marks) have been 9In (Creutz and Lagus, 2002) the results are reported less intuitively as the “alignment distance”, i.e., the negative logprob of the entire test set: −logproducttextpi(morpheme |morph).

In the following, we discuss recent unsupervised algorithms and refer the reader to (Goldsmith, 2001) for a comprehensive survey of previous research in the whole field.

This limitation is reduced in (Goldsmith, 2001) by allowing a recursive structure, where stems can have inner structure, so that they in turn consist of a substem and a suffix.

Some morphology discovery algorithms learn relationships between words by comparing the orthographic or semantic similarity of the words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Baroni et al., 2002).
