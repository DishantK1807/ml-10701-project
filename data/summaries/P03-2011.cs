The feature I focus on, following Ciaramita (2002), is morphological similarity to words whose semantic category is known.

example-base semantic classification The algorithm for the nearest neighbor classifier is as follows: 1) An unknown word is parsed by a morphological analyzer (Tseng and Chen 2002).

The Caraballo (1999)â€™s system adopted the contextual information to assign nouns to their hyponyms.

Other previous research has focused on features related to unknown word contexts (Caraballo 1999; Roark and Charniak 1998).

Prior research in Chinese unknown words mostly focused on proper nouns (Lee 1993, Lee, Lee and Chen 1994, Huang, Hong and Chen 1994, Chen and Chen 2000).

Roark and Charniak (1998) used the co-occurrence of words as features to classify nouns.

Ciaramita (2002) boosted the lexical acquisition system by simple morphological rules and found a significant improvement.

The focus of most other Chinese unknown word research is on identification of proper nouns such as proper names (Lee 1993), personal names (Lee, Lee and Chen 1994), abbreviation (Huang, Hong and Chen 1994), and organization names (Chen & Chen 2000).
