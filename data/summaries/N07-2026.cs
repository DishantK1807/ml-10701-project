In Maskey and Hirschberg (2006), the task is to recognize soundbites (which make up of a large portion of the “other” role category in Liu (2006)).
N06-2021
All the transcripts were automatically tagged with named entities using the NYU tagger (Ji and Grishman, 2005).
P05-1051
Previous work in this line includes speaker role detection (e.g., Liu, 2006; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006) and speaker diarization (e.g., Canseco et al., 2005).
N06-2021
Liu (2006) combined a generative HMM approach with the conditional maximum entropy method to detect speaker roles in Mandarin BN, reporting a classification accuracy of 81.97% against the baseline of around 50%.
