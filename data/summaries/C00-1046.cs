M~tior works done to create English POS taggers (henceforth, "taggers"), for example, include (Church 1988), (Kupicc 1992), (Brill 1992)and (Voutilaincn et al.1992). The problem with this framework, however, is that such reliable corpora are hardly awdlable duc to a huge amount of the labor-intensive work required.

In the meantime, (Brill 1995a) (Brill 1995b) proposed a method to acquire contcxt-dcpendent POS disambiguation rules and created an accurate tagger, even from a very small aunotated text by combining supervised and tmsupcrviscd learning.

In choosing adequate levels of abstraction or specification of POS in the context, we grouped together those POS tags which influence the choice of POS of a focus word in a similar lnanner as one super-POS tag, as in (Haruno & Matsumoto 1997).

One viable approach then is to utilize plain text corpora instead, as in (Mikheev 1996).

But The method proposed by (Mikheev 1996) has its own weaknesses, in that it is restricted in scope.
