SRL: bootstrapping a corpus with semantic roles Ever since the pioneering article of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), there has been an increasing interest in automatic semantic role labeling (SRL).

This pair-wise approach is analogous to earlier work by van den Boschetal.(2004)andTjongKimSangetal.(2005) inwhichinstanceswerebuildfromverb/phrasepairs from which the phrase parent is an ancestor of the verb.

However, we encountered one system (Hacioglu, 2004) that did not participate in the CoNLL-shared task but did use the same data and was based on dependency structures.

Erk and Pinkal, 2003) has adopted FrameNet with good results.

There were seven systems with an F1 performance in the 75-78 range, seven more with performances in the 70-75 range andfivewithaperformancebetween65and70(Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).

The optimal set of features for a classifier can be found by employing bi-directional hill climbing (van den Bosch et al., 2004).

A system that did not participate in the CoNLL task, but still provides interesting material for comparison since it is also based on dependency structures, is the system by Hacioglu (2004).

On the other hand, despite the relevant work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), it is still an open issue whether FrameNet classes and frame elements can be obtained and used automatically because of the richness of the semantic structures employed (Dzikovska et al., 2004).

In choosing the feature set for our system, we mainly looked at previous research, especially systems that participated in the 2004 and 2005 CoNLL shared tasks on semantic role labeling (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).
