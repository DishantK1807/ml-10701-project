It is represented in Profit notation (Erbach, 1995) and describes the composition of the query frames (the elements that contribute to a query and their type) . A fragment of the semantic graph displayed in 2 will generate the following fragment of t-box: query > [about_company, about_state, about_phone, about_ext].

• interpretation of the input query, including parsing and semantic disambiguation, semantic interpretation and transformation of the query to an intermediary logical form (Hendrix et al., 1978; Zhang et al., 1999; Tang and Mooney, 2001; Popescu et al., 2003; Kate et al., 2005); • translation to a database query language (Lowden et al., 1991; Androutsopoulos, 1992); • portability (Templeton and Burger, 1983; Kaplan, 1984; Hafner and Godden, 1985; Androutsopoulos et al., 1993; Popescu et al., 2003) In order to recover from errors in any either of these steps, most advanced NLIDB systems will also incorporate some sort of cooperative user feedback module that will inform the user of the inability of the system to construct their query and ask for clarification.
