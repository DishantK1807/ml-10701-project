This information has long been used to discriminate between ambiguous interpretations and correct mistakes made by the speech recognizer (Fink and Biermann 1986; Smith 1992).

Heeman and Edmonds looked in particular at cases in which a referring expression uttered by one conversant was not understood by the other (Heeman and Hirst 1995; Edmonds 1994; Hirst et al.1994). Clark and his colleagues (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986; Clark 1993) have shown that in such situations, conversants will collaborate on repairing the problem by, in effect, negotiating a reconstruction or elaboration of the referring expression.

Allen and Perrault (1979), Perrault and Allen (1980) show how plan recognition can be used to understand indirect speech acts (such as the use of "Can you pass the salt"? as a polite request to pass the salt).

Abduction has been applied to the solution of local pragmatics problems (Hobbs et al.1988, 1993) and to story understanding (Charniak and Goldman 1988).

Plan-based approaches (Allen and Perrault 1979; Litman 1986; Carberry 1990; Lambert and Carberry 1991) start by applying context-independent inference rules to identify the agent's task-related plan, possibly favoring alternatives that extend a previously recognized plan.

Subsequent work by Lambert and Carberry (1991, 1992) introduces an intermediate, problem-solving level of plans that link the discourse-level acts to domain plans.

593). 44 44 Interpretations that have the right pragmatic force but inconsistent implicatures are ruled out as in 466 McRoy and Hirst The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings Traum and Allen (1994) extend the work to include a notion of social obligation, which serves much the same purpose as expectations in our model.
P94-1001
Several correction strategies have been suggested: • Generalize a description by selectively ignoring some constraints (see Goodman 1985; McCoy 1985, 1986, 1988; Carberry 1988; Calistri-Yeh 1991; Eller and Carberry 1992), • Make a description more specific by adding extra constraints (see Eller and Carberry 1992), and • Choose a conceptual "sibling", by combining generalization and constraint operations.
J88-3003 J88-3005 P85-1026 P86-1016
Work by Litman (1986) attempts to overcome some of the limitations of Allen and Perrault's approach by extending the plan hierarchy to include discourselevel metaplans, in addition to domain-level plans.
