Clustering of Text We used the automatic agglomerative mutualinformation-based clustering method of (Ushioda, 1996) to form hierarchical clusters from approximately 50 million words of tokenized, unannotated text drawn from similar domains as the treebank used to train the tagger.

We develop this method starting from a state-of-the-art maximum entropy POS tagger which itself outperforms previous attempts to tag this data (Black et al., 1996b).

The basic engine used to perform the tagging in these experiments is a direct descendent of the maximum entropy (ME) tagger of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) which in turn is related to the taggers of (Kupiec, 1992) and (Merialdo, 1994).

Typically, the local context around the 215 word to be sense-tagged is used to disambiguate the sense (Yarowsky, 1993), and it is common for linguistic resources such as WordNet (Li et al., 1995; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1998; Ramakrishnan and Prithviraj, 2004), or bilingual data (Li and Li, 2002) to be employed as well as more longrange context.

In these experiments we used the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) combined withCollinsâ€™parser(Collins,1996)toassignparse trees to the corpus.

(Black et al., 1996b) adopted a two-stage approach to prediction, first predicting syntax, then semantics given the syntax, whereas in (Black et al., 1998) both syntax and semantics were predicted together in one step.

(Lamjiri et al., 2004) also developed an ME-based system that used a very simple set of features: the article before; the POS before and after; the preposition before and after, and the syntactic category before and after the word being labeled.

Knowledge Sources 5.1 Lexical Dependencies Features derived from n-grams of words and tags in the immediate vicinity of the word being tagged have underpinned the world of POS tagging for many years (Kupiec, 1992; Merialdo, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and have proven to be useful features in WSD (Yarowsky, 1993).
H93-1052 J94-2001 W96-0213
The semantic tags we use can be seen as a form of semantic categorization acting in a similar manner to the semantic class of a word in the system of (Lamjiri et al., 2004).
W04-0833
Lower-order n-grams which are closer to word being tagged offer the greatest predictive power (Black et al., 1998).

The procedure is explained in detail in (Collins, 1996).
