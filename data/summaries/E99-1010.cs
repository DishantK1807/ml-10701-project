The described method to determine bilingual word classes is an extension and improvement of the method mentioned in (Och and Weber, 1998).

Various clustering techniques have been proposed (Brown et al., 1992; Jardino and Adda, 1993; Martin et al., 1998) which perform automatic word clustering optimizing a maximum-likelihood criterion with iterative clustering algorithms.

The tables 6 and 7 show the translation quality of the statistical machine translation system described in (Och and Weber, 1998) using no classes (WORD) at all, mono-lingually, and bilingually optimized word classes.

More details are given in (Och and Weber, 1998; Och and Ney, 1999).

We assume that every word fj is produced by the word e~j at position aj in the training corpus with the probability P(f~le,~i): J p(f lc ') = 1\] p(L Icon) j=l (7) The word alignment a J is trained automatically using statistical translation models as described in (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996).

The alignment a J that we use is the Viterbi-Alignment of an HMM alignment model similar to (Vogel et al., 1996).
