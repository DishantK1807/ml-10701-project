The fact that information consisting of nothing more than bigrams can capture syntactic information about English has already been noted by (Brown et al.1992). Our contribution has been to develop a largely unsupervised method for cutting a cluster tree that produces reliable classifications.

Precursors to this work include (Pereira et al, 1993), (Brown et al.1992), (Brill & Kapur, 1993), (Jelinek, 1990), and (Brill et al, 1990) and, as applied to child language acquisition, (Finch & Chater, 1992).

The total divergence to the average, based on the KL distance (Dagan et al, 1994), produced comparable results, but the the cosine measure (Schuetze, 1993) produced significantly poorer results.

The KL distance has been used previously (Magerman & Marcus (1990), Pereira et al.(1993)) 7Tagged corpora were provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu).

Clustering algorithms have been previously shown to work fairly well for the classification of words into syntactic and semantic classes (Brown et al.1992), but determining the optimum number of classes for a hierarchical cluster tree is an ongoing difficult problem, particularly without prior knowledge of the item classification.
