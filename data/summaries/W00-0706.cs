Exemplar-based learning is said to be the best option for WSD (Ng, 1997).

We think that the study of the domain dependence of WSD --in the style of other studies devoted to parsing (Sekine, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1999)-is needed to assure the validity of the supervised approach, and to determine to which extent a tuning pre-process is necessary to make real WSD systems portable.

For instance, (Ng et al., 1999) reports an accuracy rate of 56.7% and a Kappa value of 0.317 when comparing the annotation of a subset of the DSO corpus performed by two independent research groups.

A number of comparative experiments has been carried out on a subset of 21 highly ambiguous words of the DSO corpus, which is a semantically annotated English corpus collected by Ng and colleagues (Ng and Lee, 1996).

Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is claimed to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on supervised WSD in many papers (Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997; Leacock et al., 1998).

Further, in (Mooney, 1996) some of the previous methods are compared jointly with Decision Trees and Rule Induction algorithms, on a very restricted domain.

Unfortunately, the subset of the \[:)SO corpus studied by (Ng et al., 1999) and that used in this report are not the same and, thus, a direct comparison is not possible.

This measure estimates how strong a particular feature is as an indicator of a specific sense (Yarowsky, 1994).

Many standard M L algorithms for supervised learning have been applied, such as: Decision Lists (Yarowsky, 1994; Agirre and Martinez, 2000), Neural Networks (Towell and Voorhees, 1998), Bayesian learning (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), Exemplar-based learning (Ng, 1997), Boosting (Escudero et al., 2000a), etc.

Resolving the ambiguity of words is a central problem for large scale language understanding applications and their associate tasks (Ide and V4ronis, 1998).

Although some published works include the comparison between some alternative algorithms (Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997; Escudero et al., 2000a; Escudero et al., 2000b), none of them addresses the issue of the portability of supervised ML algorithms for WSD, i.e., testing whether the accuracy of a system trained on a certain corpus can be extrapolated to other corpora or not.

To avoid the effect of zero counts, a very simple smoothing technique has been used, which was proposed in (Ng, 1997).

Accuracy 2This set of attributes corresponds to that used in (Ng and Lee, 1996), with the exception of the morphology of the target word and the verb-object syntactic relation.

It has been used for measuring inter-annotator agreement during the construction of semantic annotated corpora (V~ronis, 1998; Ng et al., 1999).
