For example, the SRL system described in (Pradhan et al., 2005b; Pradhan et al., 2005a) achieves an Fscore of 81% when tested on the same genre as it is trained on (WSJ); but that score drops to 68.5% when the same system is tested on a different genre (the Brown corpus).

2.1 PropBank PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is an annotation of one million words of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994) with predicate-argument structures for verbs, using semantic role labels for each verb argument.

For two years, the CoNLL workshop has made this problem the shared task (Carreras and MÂ´arquez, 2005).

The Proposition Bank (PropBank) corpus (Palmer et al., 2005) avoids this issue by using theory-agnostic labels (Arg0, Arg1,..., Arg5), and by defining those labels to have verb-specific meanings.

Many researchers have investigated applying machine learning to corpus specifically annotated with this task in mind, PropBank, since 2000 (Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Moschitti, 2004; Yi and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2005b; Punyakanok et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2005).
