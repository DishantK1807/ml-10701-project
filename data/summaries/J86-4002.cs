KNOWLEDGE IN PREFERENCE Discourse knowledge concerns discourse structure, the flow of discourse, and the use of discourse to highlight parts of the real world (see Grosz (1977), Reichman (1978, 1981), Sidner (1979), Allen, Frisch, and Litman (1982), Litman (1983), and Polanyi and Scha (1984~ for detailed treatments on discourse).

The work of Grosz (1977, 1981), Reichman (1978, 1981), Webber (1978), and Sidner (1979) provided rules on deictics, anaphoric definite noun phrases, the use of pronominals versus nonpronominals, and so forth, that can be used to zero in on discourse problems.

A large corpus of dialogues concerning this task was collected by Cohen (see Cohen 1981, 1984; Cohen, Fertig, and Starr 1982).

Cohen (1981, 1984) presents a detailed analysis of the pragmatics of reference and the effects of different modalities of communication.

J84-2002
Focus and focus shifts are governed by many rules (Grosz 1977, Reichman 1978, Sidner 1979).

A description about the collection of these excerpts can be found in Cohen (1984).
