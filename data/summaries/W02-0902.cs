Theoretically, it is possible to use these methods to build a translation lexicon from scratch [Rapp, 1995].
P95-1050
The context vectors are constructed in the way proposed by Rapp [1999], with the di erence that we collect counts over a four noun window, not a four word window, by dropping all intermediate words.
P99-1067
The seminal work by Brown et al.[1990] at IBM on the Candide system laid the foundation for much of the current work in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT).
J90-2002
Rapp [1995, 1999] proposes to collect counts over words occurring in a four word window around the target word.
P95-1050 P99-1067
In related work, string edit distance (or, Levenshtein distance) has been used [Mann and Yarowski, 2001].

For experiments on training probabilistic translation lexicons from parallel corpora and similar tasks on the same test corpus, refer to our earlier work [Koehn and Knight, 2000, 2001].

Fung and Yee [1998] propose a similar approach: They count how often another word occurs in the same sentence as the target word.
P98-1069
Tiedemann [1999] explores the automatic construction of a string similarity measure that learns which letter changes occur more likely between cognates of two languages.

This measurement is called longest common subsequence ratio [Melamed, 1995].
