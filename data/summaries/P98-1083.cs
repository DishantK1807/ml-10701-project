Compared to recent stochastic English parsers that yield 86 to 87% accuracy (Collins, 1996; Magerman, 1995), 84.33% seems unsatisfactory at the first glance.

(Fujio and Matsumoto, 1997) constructed an EDR-based dependency parser by using a similar method to Collins' (Collins, 1996).
P96-1025
The other type of highprecision parser, which is based on dependency analysis was introduced by Collins (Collins, 1996).

SPATTER (Magerman, 1995) augmented the pure PCFG by introducing a number of lexical attributes.
P95-1037
The main reason behind this lies in the difference between the two corpora used: Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and EDR corpus (EDR, 1995).

Penn Treebank(Marcus et al., 1993) was also used to induce part-of-speech (POS) taggers because the corpus contains very precise and detailed POS markers as well as bracket, annotations.
