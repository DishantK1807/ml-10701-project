Introduction The Italian Content Annotation Bank (I-CAB) (Magnini et al., 2006) is a corpus of newspaper articles in the Italian language, manually annotated with semantic information ofvarioustypes, including TEMPORAL EXPRESSIONS, differenttypesofentities(suchas PERSON ENTITIE</context>

For more details on I-CAB please refer to (Magnini et al., 2006). 3. Annotating Expressions of Opinion and Emotion in I-CAB 3.1. The WWC markup language For annotating I-CAB by private states we decided to adopt an already available markup language, in order (a) </context>

This is completely in keeping with the policy adopted in (Magnini et al., 2006) for annotating ICAB along the other dimensions discussed in Section 1., given that (Magnini et al., 2006) adopted markup languages previously developed within the ACE program4. We chose to adopt (wh</context>

Consistently with the other types of annotation on I-CAB described in (Magnini et al., 2006), our EPSs annotations are encoded in MEAF (Bentivogli et al., 2003), an XMLbased format compliant with the guidelines set by the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).
