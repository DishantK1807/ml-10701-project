Introduction Since Eric Brill first introduced the method of Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) it has been used to learn rules for many natural language processing tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging \[Brill, 1995\], PPattachment disambiguation \[Brill and Resnik, 1994\], text chunking \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], spelling correction \[Mangu and Brill, 1997\], dialogue act tagging \[Samuel et al., 1998\] and ellipsis resolution \[Hardt, 1998\].

Indeed, a 'light' version of the #-TBL system., consisting of just one page of Prolog code, has been implemented \[Lager, 1999\].

But before it would be fair to compare with other methods for inducing Constraint Grammars from annotated corpora, e.g. the methods described ill \[Samuelsson et al., 1996\] or in \[Lindberg and Eineborg, 1998\], it remains to determine the optimal set of templates and the optimal settings of the accuracy threshold.

However, as pointed out in \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], the effect of this particular optimization method depends on the size of the ! Size ST 30k 2 60k 4 120k I.
