36 2 Related Work Conventional methods for RTE define measures for the similarity between T and H either by assuming an independence between words (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005) in a BoW fashion or by exploiting syntactic interpretations.

Initially we assume when judging the entailment relation that it holds for each T-H pair 1 We are using Minipar (Lin, 1998) and Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) as preprocessors, see also sec.

Unlexicalized parsers, on the other hand, achieved accuracies almost equivalent to those of lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003).

One the best two teams in RTE-2 (Tatu et al., 2006) proposed a knowledge representation model which achieved about 10% better performance than the third (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) based on their logic prover.

Another group (Zanzotto and Moschitti, 2006) utilized a tree kernel method for cross-pair similarity, which showed an improvement, and this has motivated us to investigate kernel-based methods.

Given an English sentence, we parse it with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and then generate paraphrases using the following syntactic transformations: 1.

In many cases, the combination of these approaches has been shown to improve the performance of a single approach both for controlled indexing (Aronson et al., 2004) and free text indexing (Byrne and Klein, 2003).
