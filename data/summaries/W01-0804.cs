Shieber (1993) suggested that some more sophisticated notion of equivalence is needed, which would count fewer semantic expressions as equivalent.1 In the present paper, a different response to the problem is explored, which keeps the notion of equivalence classical and prevents the generator from distinguishing between inputs that are logically equivalent (i.e., inputs that have the same truth conditions).

This negative result gives rise to the question whether Full Brevity may be approximated, perhaps in the spirit of Reiter (1990)’s ‘Local Brevity’ algorithm which takes a given intersective description and tests whether any set of properties in it may be replaced by one other property.

Whereas this programme, which might be called ‘logic-oriented’ generation, would constitute a fairly radical departure from current practice if applied to all of NLG (Krahmer & van Deemter (forthcoming); Power 2000 for related work), the main aim of the present paper is modest: to show that logic-oriented generation is standard practice in connection with the generation of referring expressions (GRE).

Section 3 proceeds by showing how other algorithms use the principle to legitimize the creation of more elaborate structures involving, for example, complex Boolean combinations (e.g., the union of some properties, each of which is the intersection of some atomic prop1See also van Deemter (1990) where, on identical grounds, a variant of Carnap-style intensional isomorphism was proposed as an alternative notion of equivalence.

(Cf. Stone and Webber 1998, Krahmer and Theune 1999, which interleave linguistic realization and generation).

Most GRE algorithms are limited to individual target objects (for an exception, Stone 2000), but we will present ones that refer to sets of objects (Van Deemter 2000); reference to an individual a17 will equal reference to the singleton set a18a19a17a21a20. 2.1 The Incremental Algorithm Dale and Reiter (1995) proposed an algorithm that takes a shared KB as its input and delivers a set of properties which jointly identify the target.

in GRE A key question regarding the foundations of Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the problem of logical form equivalence (Appelt 1987).

One description can be chosen over another, for example, because it fullfills some additional communicative goal (Dale and Reiter 1995, section 2.4; also Stone and Webber 1998).
