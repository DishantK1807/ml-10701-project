Our work should be seen as an extension of the approach of Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel (1984a, 1984b; hereafter referred to as Joshi).

Along with new cases where a response must be modified to not be misleading, we show how the cases enumerated in (Joshi 1984a) can be effectively computed given the model of the user.

We assume that the goals of the user in the immediate discourse are available by methods such as specified in (Allen 1983; Carberry 1983; Litman and Allen 1984; Pollack 1984, 1986).

Allen's (1983) work in recognizing intentions from natural language utterances makes the assumption that "people are rational agents who are' capable of forming and executing plans to achieve their goals" (see also Cohen and Levesque 1985).

Thus, a good response may also have to (i) assure the user that his underlying goal was considered in arriving at the response (McKeown, Wish, and Matthews 1985); (ii) answer a query that results from an inappropriate plan indirectly by responding to the underlying goal of the query (Pollack 1986); (iii) provide additional information aimed at preventing the" user from drawing false conclusions because of violated expectations of how an expert would respond (Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel 1984a, 1984b).
