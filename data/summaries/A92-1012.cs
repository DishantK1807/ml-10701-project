This also applies to our use of thematic roles in the semantics; see the examples of LKB entries for verbs given in Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992, this volume).

The way in which such a representation may be used in the treatment of logical metonymy was described in Briscoe et al (1990).

Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) describe the semi-automatic derivation of entries for English psychological predicates by augmenting LDOCE with thesaurus information derived from the Longman Lexicon.

This and other case., of more complex taxonomic inheritance are discussed b~ Vossen and Copestake (1991, forthcoming).

The differentia can be partially interpreted relative to the RQS type; in this example < rqs : origin > = "kip" is an indication that kippevlees comes from kip; eventually this will allow their lexical entries to be linked automatically by the appropriate lexical rule (Copestake and Briscoe, 1991; Copestake et al., 1992).

We encode a relatively rich lexical semantic structure for nouns (referred to as the 'relativised qualia structure', RQS) based on the notion of qualia structure, described by Pustejovsky (1989, 1991).

Briscoe et al.'s (1990' account of logical metonymy (Pustejovsky, 1989, 1991) Sanfilippo's (1990) representation of thematic and aspec.

Ageno et al.(1992) describe one way in which the type system can be integrated with tools for semi-automatic analysis of dictionary definitions.
A92-1044
The way we deal with this is discussed in detail in Copestake(1991, forthcoming), but since the problematic cases seem to arise relatively rarely in our particular application, we will not discuss the full definition here.
