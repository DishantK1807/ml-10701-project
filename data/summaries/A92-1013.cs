Once a good morphologic analyzer is available (the one used in our work is very well tested, and has first described in (Russo,1987)), problems such as verb detection, raised in (Brent, 1991), are negligible.

(Hindle, 1990; Hindle and Rooths,1991) and (Smadja, 1991) use syntactic markers to increase the significance of the data.
P90-1034 P91-1030 P91-1036
(Guthrie et al., 1991\] uses the subject classification given in machine-readable dictionaries (e.g.
P91-1019
The relatively high efficiency rate, as compared with the figures reported in (Brent, 1991), are due to the fact that Italian morphology is far more complex than English.
P91-1027
Even though (Smadja,1991) reports good performances of his system, it must be noticed that the precision and efficiency figures of the parser apply to a set of data that have been already (statistically) processed.
P91-1036
In (Smadja, 1989), (Zernik and Jacobs, 1990), the associations are filtered by selecting the word pairs (x,y) whose frequency of occurrence is above f+ks, where f is the average appearance, s is the standard deviation, and k is an empirically determined factor.
C90-1005 P90-1032
In (Guthrie el al., 1991), sets of consistently contiguous word~, ("neighbourhood") are extracted from machinereadable dictionaries, to help semantic disambiguation in information retrieval.
P91-1019
In (Calzolari and Bindi, 1990), (Church and Hanks, 1990) the significance of an association (x,y) is measured by the mutual information I(x,y), i.e. the probability of observing x and y together, compared with the probability of observing x and y independently.
C90-3010 J90-1003
In labeling concept pairs, we relied on our preceding work on semantic representation with Conceptual Graph \[Pazienza and Velardi, 1987\].
E87-1040
(Hindle and Rooths, 1991) proposes that a syntactic disambiguation criterion can be gathered by comparing the probability of occurrence of nounpreposition and verb-preposition pairs in V NP PP structures.
P91-1030
In (Hindle,1990; Zernik, 1989; Webster el Marcus, 1989) cooccurrence analyses augmented with syntactic parsing is used for the purpose of word classification.
P89-1022 P90-1034
Combining statistical and parsing methods has been done by (Hindle, 1990; Hindle and Rooths,1991) and (Smadja and McKewon, 1990; Smadja,1991).

The results of these studies have important applications in lexicography, to detect lexicosyntactic regularities (Church and Hanks, 19901 (Calzolari and Bindi,1990), such as, for example~ support verbs (e.g.
C90-3010 J90-1003
It has been noticed that representing only the semantics of verbs may be inadequate (Velardi et al.1988; Boguraev 1991; Macpherson 1991).

The reference output adopted to perform the evaluation is a syntactic graph (Seo and Simmons,1989)'.
