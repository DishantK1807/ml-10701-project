Computationally, it is possible to describe the grammar and heuristic rules for these constraints by ATN networks, logic grarnmars~ HPSG~ and categorical grammars(Kosy, 1986; Fong and Berwick, 1985; Huang, 1984; Boguraev et al., 1983; Blackwell, 1981; Niimi et al., 1986).

We are introducing some semantic taxonomy and the semantic distance measurement algorithm(Knight, 1993; Okumura and Hovy, 1994; Resnik, 1993).

of the conjunctions Coordinate conjunctions for MT systems present three difficulties(Kosy, 1986; Huang, 1983; Niimi et al., 1986; Okumura et ai., 1987).

In Japanese, the similarity is used for analyzing conjunctive structures and the method is found effective(Kurohashi and Nagao, 1992).
C92-1029
Theoretically, it is possible to describe the syntactic and semantic constraints that govern the acceptability of a structure in which two constituents are conjoined by the conjunction(Lesmo and Torasso, 1985; Gazdar, 1981; Schachter, 1977).
