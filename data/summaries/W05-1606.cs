A context set is defined as the set of the entities the addressee is currently assumed to be attending to â€“ this is similar to the set of entities in the focus spaces of the discourse focus stack in Grosz' and Sidner's [1986] theory of discourse structure.

Generating referring expressions is pursued since the eighties [Appelt 1985, Kronfeld 1986, Appelt and Kronfeld 1987].

Recently, algorithms have been applied to the identification of sets of objects rather than individuals [Bateman 1999, Stone 2000, Krahmer, v.

Subsequent years were characterized by a debate about computational efficiency versus minimality of the elements appearing in the resulting referring expression [Dale 1988, Reiter 1990, Reiter and Dale 1992].

To avoid the generation of redundant descriptions that is typical for incremental approaches, Gardent [2002] and Horacek [2003] proposed exhaustive resp.

Reference generation is typically conceived as a pure functional service, with no feedback, taking into account syntactic constraints, at best (e.g., [Horacek 1997]).

This is because these operators appear only in embedded boolean combinations [van Deemter 2002], which are the basis for building larger varieties of expressions [Horacek 2004].

An approach that fits better to our intentions is the work by Goodman [1987], which emphasizes reference identification and associated failures in task-oriented dialogs [Goodman 1986].

For example, [Edmonds 1994] and [Heeman and Hirst 1995] describe both plan-based methods, where a vague and partial description is produced initially, which is narrowed and ultimately confirmed in the subsequent discourse.
