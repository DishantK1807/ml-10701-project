BUNDLES AND SYNTACTIC ANALYSIS Dorothee Reim~un Zentraltnstitut f~Lr Sprachwtssenschaft AdW DDR, Berlin Syntactic analysis in our terms means to construct a description of the syntactic structures of a given sentence, starting from a formal description of the syntactic features of.the wordfo~ (the -result of a preceding wordform ane.lysls).
The description of the syntactic structure as well as the formal description of the wordfo~ms have to follow a certain model, in our case the Dependency Gre~nme~ by ~NZE (1975)o A central point of the model in respect 4o analysis ere the so-called bundles.
They represent the necessary syntactic knowledge of a language which is the base for analysi~ sentences of this le~guage.
The bundles ere parts of trees in a very generalized form.
If RI R3" N 1 N 2 N 3 is a bundle, then it means, that there are conditions for the nodes NO, N 1, N2, N 3, that there are relations between the • nodes expressed by the edses and their markings R 1, ~, R 3 and that there is some order condition for the nodes, in the example 1; 1 N 2 N O N 3.
Following the model, these bundles give us a high measure of surety, for the analysis.
244 The bundles are stored in the system in a very concentrated form.
For example for a noun group with a noun like "table" at the top there is only one budle with all possible facultative nodes.
So we have in a bundle informations about the mode of occurrence of a node, i.e. if a node is obligatory, facultative etc.
The bundles serve also as description for the dominance behaviour of wordforms (one part of the formal description of their features), thus we have a strong connection between a bundle and a wordformwhich can"stand" at the top of the bundle.
For this purpose ~he bundles have a special external shape for linguistic work.
For instance, a finite verb form of the German verb Sschreiben" has several bundles in its dominance component, one of these is FIN (ACT°A 0BJ3fA (PAT ~ DAS) °) FIN means, that the top is a finite verb form ACT ° there must be an actor (subject) OBJ3 f there can be an indirect object (PATA DAS) °there mue__~t be a direct object, either in the form of a noun group in " the accusative case (PAT) or as a sub• ordinate clause with the conjunction "dase" (DAS) Free modifications llke local and temporal circumstances are possible as well.
Of course, in the syntactic analysis system the bundles have another shape and~they contain more lnformatione There are two possibilities to use the bundles for syntactic analysis, the first one is to use them as proper rules, the eeco~ one is to use other methods, but to have the bundles as syntactic knowledge in the back@round.
The first possibility is outlined in my dissertation (AROLD 1976) as a strong 245 where bottom-up and multiple-path analys£8.
But for a working system we intend to follow the second way.
In the paper a short summary of the system will be given.
The syntactic analysts, of a sentence ~£ven by the formal description of the syntactic features of the wordforms iS made by three steps.
These three steps differ one from the other by d~fferent methods.
In the first step an nau~nented transition network n (ATe) is used to construct a rough structure of the sentence.
The second step uses the bundles which are members of t he dominance component of the wordforms to find out so-called subordlnntion possibllitiee.
The result of the second step is a loop-free ~raph, which is transformed dur£ng the third step to a ~aph contusing the dependency treem which desor£be the syntactic structures of the an~yeed sentence.
In the third step the conditions of the bundles (obligator7 and facultative nodes etc).
are used as well as the condlttonm com£n~ from the shape of the resulting graph.
Up to now we ~re only at the be~nn~ng of the ~nplementation of the system.
3ome remake about these problems am well as about the difficulties to include the analysis of coordtnated sentences w~ll be made in the paper too.
