proposals for beliefs of the first type, while wh-questions and yes-no questions produce proposals for the second and third types of beliefs, respectively, s In order to provide the necessary information for performing proposal evaluation and response generation, we hypothesize a recognition algorithm, based on Lambert and Carberry (1991), that infers agents' intentions from their utterances.

McCoy(1988) uses the system's model of the user's domain knowledge to determine possible reasons for a detected misconception and to provide appropriate explanations to correct the misconception.

However, Cohen analyzed argumentative texts and found variation in the order in which claims and their evidence are presented (Cohen 1987).

We call this type of subdialogue an information-sharing subdialogue (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995b).

The agents may also collaborate on the strategies used to construct the domain plan, such as determining whether to investigate in parallel the different plans for an action or whether to first consider one plan in depth (Ramshaw 1991).
P91-1006
Information-sharing subdialogues differ from information-seeking or clarification subdialogues (van Beek, Cohen, and Schmidt 1993; Raskutti and Zukerman 1993; Logan et al.1994; Heeman and Hirst 1995).

Response Generation Many researchers (McKeown, Wish, and Matthews 1985; Paris 1988; McCoy 1988; Sarner and Carberry 1990; Zukerman and McConachy 1993; Logan et al.1994) have argued that information from the user model should affect a generation system's decision on what to say and how to say it.

The library of generic recipes (Pollack 1986) contains templates for performing actions.

5. Determining Acceptance or Rejection of Proposed Beliefs 5.1 Evaluating Proposed Beliefs Previous research has noted that agents do not merely believe or disbelieve a proposition; instead, they often consider some beliefs to be stronger (less defeasible) than others (Lambert and Carberry 1992; Walker 1992; Cawsey et al.1993). Thus, we associate a strength with each belief by an agent; this strength indicates the agent's confidence in the belief being an accurate description of situations in the real world.

Further analysis shows that a couple of features distinguish collaborative negotiation from argumentation and noncollaborative negotiation (Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1995c).
P95-1019
To represent the different types of knowledge necessary for modeling a collaborative dialogue, we use an enhanced version of the tripartite model presented in (Lambert and Carberry 1991) to capture the intentions of the dialogue participants.

Heeman and Hirst (1995) investigated collaboration on referring expressions of objects copresent with the dialogue participants.

This feature differentiates collaborative negotiation from argumentation (Birnbaum, Flowers, and McGuire 1980; Reichman 1981; Flowers and Dyer 1984; Cohen 1987; Quilici 1992).

CORE applies the Express-Doubt discourse action (based on Lambert and Carberry \[1992\]) to simultaneously achieve these two goals, leading to the generation of the 377 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 3 Action: Appl Conds: Preconds: Body: Goal: Reevaluate-After-Invite-Attack(CA, EA, On-Sab(Lewis,1998), Kbelief tree~) ~believe(CA, On-Sab(Lewis,1998)) ~believe(CA,~On-Sab(Lewis,1998)) believe(CA,-~Tenured(Lewis)) believe(CA, supports(~Tenured(Lewis),~On-Sab(Lewis,1998))) results-in(believe(CA, Tenured(Lewis)),believe(CA, On-Sab(Lewis,1998))) MB(CA, EA,~Tenured(Lewis)) A MB(CA,EA, supports(~Tenured(Lewis),~On-Sab(Lewis,1998)) V MB(CA, EA, Tenured(Lewis)) V MB(CA, EA,~supports(~Tenured(Lewis), ~On-Sab(Lewis,1998))) Evaluate-Belief-Level(CA, EA, Kbelief tree >) belief-reevaluated( Kbelief tree>) Figure 9 Instantiated recipe for Reevaluate-After-Invite-Attack.

One user model attribute with such an effect is the user's domain knowledge, which Paris (1988) argues not only influences the amount of information given (based on Grice's Maxim of Quantity \[Grice 1975\]), but also the kind of information provided.
J88-3006
The collaborative planning principle in Whittaker and Stenton (1988); Walker and Whittaker (1990); and Walker (1992) suggests that "conversants must provide evidence of a detected discrepancy in belief as soon as possible'(Walker 1992, 349).

Moore and Paris (1993) developed a text planner that captures both intentional and rhetorical information.
J93-4004
Determine-Acceptance follows Walker's weakest link assumption (Walker 1992) and computes the strength of the evidence as the weaker of the strengths of the antecedent belief and the evidential relationship.

Edmonds (1994) studied an aspect of collaboration similar to that studied by Heeman and Hirst.

2. Related Work 2.1 Modeling Collaboration Allen (1991) proposed a discourse model that differentiates among the shared and individual beliefs that agents might hold during collaboration.
