A computational model for the semantic orientations of phrases has been proposed by Takamura et al.(2006). However, their method cannot deal with the words that did not appear in the training data.

Wilson et al.(2005) worked on phrase-level semantic orientations.

We can find a similarity also to the PageRank algorithm (Brin and Page, 1998), which has been applied also to natural language processing tasks (Mihalcea, 2004; Mihalcea, 2005).

Turney. 2002.

Takamura et al.(2006) proposed to use based on latent variable models for sentiment classification of noun-adjective pairs.

Turney (2002) applied an internet-based technique to the semantic orientation classification of phrases, which had originally been developed for word sentiment classification.

Takamura et al.(2005) proposed two kinds of criteria.

Hyperparameter β is automatically selected from 2Although Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) that κ for their dataset similar to ours was 0.83, this value cannot be directly compared with our value because their dataset includes both individual words and pairs of words.

In addition to individual seed words, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2006) used more complicated syntactic patterns that were manually created.

Baron and Hirst (2004) extracted collocations with Xtract (Smadja, 1993) and classified the collocations using the orientations of the words in the neighboring sentences.

However, word senses and subjectivity have strong interaction (Wiebe and Mihalcea, 2006).

of Lexical Networks We construct a lexical network, which Takamura et al.(2005) call the gloss network, by linking two words if one word appears in the gloss of the other word.

of Phrases Takamura et al.(2005) used the Ising model to extract semantic orientations of words (not phrases).

Some of them used corpora (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003), while others used dictionaries (Kobayashi et al., 2001; Kamps et al., 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).
