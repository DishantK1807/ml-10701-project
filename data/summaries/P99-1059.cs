The authors have developed an O(nT)-time parsing algorithm for bilexicalized tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992), improving the naive O(n s) method.

Other lexicalized formalisms include (Schabes et al., 1988; Mel'~uk, 1988; Pollard and Sag, 1994).

three models in (Collins, 1997) are susceptible to the O(n 3) method (cf.

We note that this construction can be straightforwardly extended to convert stochastic HAGs as in (Alshawi, 1996) into stochastic CFGs.

Our notation fol1Other relevant parsers simultaneously consider two or more words that are not necessarily in a dependency relationship (Lafferty et al., 1992; Magerman, 1995; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Chelba and Jelinek, 1998).

This means that for each string w, there is a lineartime 1-to-1 mapping between (appropriately de~Alshawi (1996) describes HAs as accepting (or equivalently, generating) zl and z~ from the outside in.
P96-1023
Several recent real-world parsers have improved state-of-the-art parsing accuracy by relying on probabilistic or weighted versions of bilexical grammars (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).
