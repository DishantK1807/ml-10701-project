Tree Path Features Previous studies have shown that the parse tree path feature, used by almost all systems since (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), is salient for argument identification.
J02-3001
As in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), this feature represents the path (consisting of step directions and PTs of the nodes traversed) from the node to the predicate, for example NP↑VP↓VB for a typical object.
J02-3001
Since the grammatical functions are not directly available from the parse trees, we investigated two approximations of dependency arc labels: first, the POSs of the head tokens; secondly, the PTs of the head node and its immediate parent (such labels were used in (Ahn et al., 2004)).
W04-0814
As in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), this was used to distinguish subjects from objects.
J02-3001
Features We used the following predicate features, all of which first appeared in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
