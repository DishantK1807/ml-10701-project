As an application <>f the meta:inference capability, let us describe the interactive Japanesp parser of the Japanese t<FEnglish m;u:hine translation system JETS (Maruyama, Watanabe, & Oginn 1990).

This is a generalization of the notion called am consistency (Mackworth 1977) or pair-wise cousisteucy, and is equlva\]ent tn the flrst two steps of Ka.sper's (1987) successive aptnvximatimL Algo rithms for achieving more global consistency by look: ins at mnltlple constraint matrices are possibh+, but as Carter (1990) argues in his paper on the experimen.

For example, sillce it is known that 1~ consecutive P\]'s ilave Cutalan(n) different p~zrses, it is possible to encode all PP-attachment ambiguities by renlemberiug only n and the position of tile PPs (Church ~ Patil 1982).

The parsing method of Constraint Dependency Grammar (Maruyama 1990) axldressed exactly these issues.

It, order to clarify the exl,ressiw~ power of fe~ture structures with general disjunctions, Kasper ~ Rounds (1986) defined a logic-be-led notation called FM1, A fornlula in FMI, can be rewritteu as an addc statement in JAUNT, and hence, constraints expre~ed hy a unification can also be expr~ssed in JAUNT.
