We used the Kyoto corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997) for evaluation data, and chose KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998) and CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) for comparison.

The main reasons are as follows: POS Conversion Error: As mentioned previously, we converted POS tags automatically since the POS system of the Kyoto corpus is 4Even if only top-10 parse results are considered, our CFG have a possibility to outperform KNP and CaboCha 5In some studies, it is said that lexical information has little impact on accuracy (Bikel, 2004).

the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)), and many parsing algorithms using CFGs have been proposed.

Conjunctive Structure: Conjunctive structure is not specified during syntactic parsing, instead their analysis is left for the subsequent processing (contrary to (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994)).

Dependency analysis is preferred in order to analyze Japanese sentences (dependency relation between Japanese phrasal unit, called bunsetsu) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), and only a few studies about Japanese CFG have been conducted.
