Note that in all these cases of grammar induction the intuition of the grammar builder plays a critical part whether it be in the choice of syntactic transformation rules (Brill 1993), or in choosing sense taggers and implicitly semantic rules (Wilks, 1998; Ciravegna and Wilks, 2003), or in choosing user supplied seed patterns (Yangarber, 2003).

The development of segmentation programs in these languages has certainly helped (Gao et al., 2005; Habash and Rambow, 2005).
P05-1071
There are instances in the part-of-speech tagging literature (Brill, 1993) and in IE where a corpus is used and words within a grammatical category help to extract rules and patterns comprising essential information about a domain or topic (Wilks, 1998; Yangarber, 2003).
P03-1044 P93-1035
Many of the adaptive IE systems rely on the existing part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Debnath and Giles, 2005) and/or syntactic parsers (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) for analysing and annotating text corpora.
P05-1047
One of the recent trends in (adaptive) IE has been motivated by the empirical argument that annotated corpora, either annotated automatically or annotated manually, can provide sufficient information for creating the knowledge base of an IE system (McLernon and Kushmerick, 2006).
