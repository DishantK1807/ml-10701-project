Proceedings of the ACL-2000 Workshop on Word Senses and Multi-linguality Held in conjunction with The 38th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics Sponsored by The ACL Special Interest Group for the Lexicon (SIGLEX),Organized by Nancy Ide Charles Fillmore Philip Resnik David Yarowsky 7 October 2000 Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Hong Kong 2000 The Association tor Computational Linguistics Order copies of this and other ACL workshop proceedings from: Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 75 Paterson Street, Suite 9 New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA i Tel: +1-732-342-9100 Fax: +1-732-342-9339 acl@aclweb, org PREFACE With an increasingly global economy and the explosive growth of the "World" in "World Wide Web", the computational linguistics community is faced as never before with the challenges and opportunities of mulfi-linguality.
3:14	At the same time, the community has returned with renewed enthusiasm to problems of word meaning, especially the delineation and discrimination of word senses.
4:14	An intimate relationship between the two issues is becoming apparent for example, in the consideration of translation equivalence in parallel corpora, the construction of mullilingual ontologies, and the examination of senses in relation to specific natural language applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, etc. The issue of multi-lingual approaches to sense distinctions was also a central topic of discussion at the first SENSEVAL conference in 1998, and is one of the areas to be covered at SENSEVAL-2 (to be held in Spnng 2001).
5:14	This workshop addresses problems of word sense disambiguation and delineation of appropriate sense distinctions, with specific emphasis on approaches that involve more than one language and the ways in which observations about cross-linguistic equivalence affect our consideration of sense divisions in the individual languages.
6:14	More generally, we seek to foster discussion and exchanges of insight in any area of computational linguistics where a non-monolingual approach to word sense issues is being taken.
7:14	Many people are owed thanks for their contributions to setting up this workshop.
8:14	We are especially grateful to David Yarowsky and the staff of the Human Language Technology Center at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for their work in producing these proceedings under a very tight schedule.
9:14	The SIGLEX'00 Program Committee enabled us to work within a very brief time frame, by quickly turning around reviews for the substantial number of submissions to the conference.
10:14	Finally, the Department of Computer Science at Vassar College provided administrative and organizational support.
11:14	All of them are responsible for the success of SIGLEX'00.
