<context>uistic Task The construction of the test suite focuses on collecting specific classes of inference problems for English adjectives. In order to define the set of such inference problems, we build on (Amoia and Gardent, 2006; Amoia and Gardent, 2007) who have shown that in order to correctly predict adjectival inferential patterns it is important to consider the fine interplay between the different properties of adjectiv</context>
<context>dNet sense (wns) and with the semantic class (adjClass) to which it corresponds. For the semantic class assignment, we use a refined version of the semantic classification of adjectives presented in (Amoia and Gardent, 2006), which includes about 30 semantic adjectival classes. We would like to stress that the information with which the adjectival items are tagged, i.e. WordNet sense and adjectival class, are semantic i</context>

The adjectival class assignment infact, points to a semantic representation of the adjective which is first order and compositional as described in (Amoia and Gardent, 2007). 3.
