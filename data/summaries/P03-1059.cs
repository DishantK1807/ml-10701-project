Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2002) determine a noun’s countability preferences from its semantic class, and show that semantics predicts (5-way) countability 78% of the time with their ontology.

Bond et al.(1994) suggested a division of countability into five major types, based on Allan (1980)’s noun countability preferences (NCPs).

Note that the proposed classifier design is that which was found by Baldwin and Bond (2003) to be optimal for the task, out of a wide range of classifier architectures.

This resulted in the precision–recall graph given in Figure 1, from which it is evident that mean recall is proportional and precision inversely proportional to corpus fre4In each case, the classifier is run over the best500 features as selected by the method described in Baldwin and Bond (2003) rather than the full feature set, purely in the interests of reducing processing time.

In the final system configuration, the system accuracy was 94.6%, comparing favourably with the 78% accuracy reported by Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2002), 89.5% of O’Hara et al.(2003), and also the noun token-based results of Schwartz (2002).

With the POS extraction method, we first Penntagged the BNC using an fnTBL-based tagger (Ngai and Florian, 2001), training over the Brown and WSJ corpora with some spelling, number and hyphenation normalisation.

This research is close in spirit to the work of Light (1996) on classifying the semantics of derivational affixes, and Siegel and McKeown (2000) on learning verb aspect.

The classifiers and their training are described in more detail in Baldwin and Bond (2003).

The full range of different classifier architectures tested as part of this research, and the experiments to choose between them are described in Baldwin and Bond (2003).
