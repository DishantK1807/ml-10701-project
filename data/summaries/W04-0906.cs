These are essentially scripts that provide information that is very useful in general reasoning as well as reasoning for NLP (e.g., Schank and Abelson 1977, Lin and Hovy 2000, Clark and Porter 2000).

Semantic analysis in OntoSem is described in some detail in Nirenburg and Raskin 2004; Nirenburg et al., 2004; Beale et al.1995, 1996, 2003; Mahesh et al.1997. Our description here will be necessarily brief.

In a recent evaluation, the basic analyzer was shown to carry out word sense disambiguation at over 90% and semantic dependency determination at 87% on the basis of correct syntactic analysis and on sentences of an average length of over 25 words with 1.33 unknown words on average per input sentence (see Nirenburg et al., 2004).

Few of the numerous current and recent machine learning and statistical processing experiments in NLP deal with the analysis of meaning at all; and those that do address partial tasks (e.g., determining case role fillers in terms of undisambiguated text elements in Gildea and Jurafsky 2002) in a rather “knowledge-lean” manner.

At this point, we rely on TMRs that are obtained automatically but improved through human interaction (see Nirenburg et al.2004 for details).
