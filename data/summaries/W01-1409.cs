We trained IBM Translation Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) both on our corpus alone and on the augmented corpus, using the EGYPT toolkit (Knight et al., 1999; Al-Onaizan et al., 1999), and then translated a number of texts using different translation models and different transfer methods, namely glossing (replacing each Tamil word by the most likely candidate from the translation tables created with the EGYPT toolkit) and Model 4 decoding (Brown et al., 1995; Germann et al., 2001).
