Finally, while the variant set mechanism provides some of the functionality of the lexical rules proposed by Flickinger et al.(1985), Calder (1989), and others, the structure of the ELU lexicon does not admit the full range of capabilities of these more powerful devices; cyclic rule applications cannot be simulated, for example.

Kasper and Rounds (1986) show general disjunctive unification to be intractable, since it involves an exponentially complex step of expansion to disjunctive normal form.
P86-1038
In the D-PATR environment presented by Karttunen (1986), all templates engage in defaulting: "... templates and other specifications that occur \[in lexical entries\] are processed sequentially from left to right.
C86-1016
Shieber (1986a: 59ff) also describes a type of default inheritance implemented in terms of a noncommutative 'overwriting' operation, in which constraint equations may be formulated so as to take precedence over existing structures.

See Karttunen (1984).

The 'template' facility of PATR-II (Shieber 1986a: 55ff) allows inheritance within the lexicon.
C86-1050
In particular, ELU does not have to convert from one representation to another at the interface to the lexicon, as does DATR when used within a unification grammar system (Kilbury et al.1991). 7.

Two inheritance modes 18 This is not to say that the two are not interconvertible--see Kilbury et al.(1991). 328 Graham Russell et al.A Practical Approach to Multiple Default Inheritance exist: 'normal,' a conventional shortest-path default method in which a slot is filled by information from the most specific accessible node in the hierarchy, and 'complete,' by which multiple values for a slot are obtained from a number of more general frames.

The defeasible constraints providing values for <psp_form> and <p_fin_form> in Verb 19 Blocking is a consequence of the architecture proposed by Calder (1989) and of the DATR language.

The user language resembles that of PATR-II (Shieber 1986a), but provides a larger range of data types and more powerful means of stating relations between them.

325 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 3 4.1 Defaults and Reentrancy The notion of 'default extension' employed here resembles the 'priority union' of Kaplan (1987: 180f) and the 'conservative addition' of Shieber (1986b).
C86-1050
Flickinger et al.(1985) present a model of the lexicon based on multiple default inheritance in the frame language HPRL (Rosenberg 1983).
P85-1032
As Bouma (1990) points out, the result of defaulting under this approach may depend on order of application.

See also Johnson and Rosner (1989) for a description of the earlier UD system on which ELU is based.
