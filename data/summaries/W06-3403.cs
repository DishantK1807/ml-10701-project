LSA has been successfully applied to tasks such as measuring semantic similarity among corpora of texts (Coccaro & Jurafsky, 1998), measuring cohesion (Foltz, Kintsch, & Landauer, 1998 ), assessing correctness of answers in tutoring systems (WiemerHastings & Graesser, 2000) and dialogue act classification (Serafin & Di Eugenio, 2004).
