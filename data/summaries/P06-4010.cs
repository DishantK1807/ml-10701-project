At the second stage, there are two kinds of NE constructions to be processed (Yao et al., 2003).
W03-1708
Yao. 2005.
W05-0401
Considering the actual requirements for domain knowledge, we omy and constructed conceptual relationships among Object, Movement and Property concept categories under the taxonomy in a lexical sports ontology (Yao, 2005).
W05-0401
Because of th versity and complexity of NERs, at the same time, considering portability requirement in the identification, we suggest a novel supervised machine learning approach called positive and negative case-based learning (PNCBL) used in this stage (Yao and Uszkoreit, 2005).
W05-0401
In order to reduce unfavorable influence, we utilize a trainable approach (Brill, 1995) to automatically generate effective rules, by which the first component can repair different errors caused by word segmentation and POS tagging.
