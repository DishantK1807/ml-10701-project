• Syntactic frame as described by Xue and Palmer (2004) 2 Experimental Setting and Results We trained the classification models using the complete training set (sections from 02 to 21).

Instead, we borrowed most of them from the existing literature (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004).

It happens that, in the case of full parses, this node selection strategy is equivalent to the pruning process defined by Xue and Palmer (2004), which selects sibling nodes along the path of ancestors from the verb predicate to the root of the tree2.

2With the unique exception of the exploration inside sibling PP constituents proposed by (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

• Governing category as described in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

• Constituent path as described in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002); All 3/4/5-grams of path constituents beginning at the verb predicate or ending at the constituent.

• Partial parsing path as described in (Carreras et al., 2004); All 3/4/5-grams of path elements beginning at the verb predicate or ending at the constituent.
