Most of the reported work on paraphrase generation from arbitrary input sentences uses machine learning techniques trained on sentences that are known or can be inferred to be paraphrases of each other (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Dolan et al., 2004; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Shinyama et al., 2002).
