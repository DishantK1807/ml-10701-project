More recently, morphologybased models have been shown to help reduce error rate for out-of-vocabulary words (Carki et al., 2000; Podvesky and Machek, 2005).

The parameters, Î¸, are estimated by numerical optimization as in (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

Several researchers have investigated techniques for improving automatic speech recognition (ASR) results by modeling the errors (Collins et al., 2005; Shafran and Byrne, 2004).

Model and Estimation In this work, we adopt the reranking framework of Charniak and Johnson (2005) for incorporating morphological features.
P05-1022
Further, the feature space could be enriched with syntactic features which are known to be useful (Collins et al., 2005).
P05-1063
We adopt a variant of this framework where the corrective model is based on a conditional model estimated by the maximum entropy procedure (Charniak and John391 son, 2005) and we investigate its effectiveness in modeling morphological features for highly inflected languages, in particular, Czech.
P05-1022
Incorporating syntactic features into the context has been at the forefront of recent research (Collins et al., 2005; Rosenfeld et al., 2001; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Hall and Johnson, 2004).
P04-1006 P05-1063
Collins et al.(2005) present a corrective language model based on a discriminative framework.
