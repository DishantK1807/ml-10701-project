Whereas Wittenburg (1987) tries to do away with ambiguous phrase structure as much as possible (it only arises where you need it) and Pareschi & Steedman (1987) use a chart parsing technique to recover implicit constituents efficiently, the strategy in this paper has been to go for complete ambiguity.

2. Structural Completeness In the next section we present a grammatical calculus, which is more flexible than the systems considered by Wittenburg (1987) and Pareschi & Steedman (1987), and therefore is attractive for linguistic purposes.
