The knowledge in wordnets has been typically utilized by expanding queries with related terms (Vorhees, 1994; Smeaton et al., 1994), concept indexing (Gonzalo et al., 1998), or similarity measuresasrankingfunctions(Smeatonetal., 1994; MÂ¨uller and Gurevych, 2006).

Recently, Wikipedia 2http://infobub.arbeitsagentur.de/ berufe/ 3http://de.wikipedia.org/ has been discovered as a promising lexical semantic resource and successfully used in such different NLP tasks as question answering (Ahn et al., 2004), named entity disambiguation (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006), and information retrieval (Katz et al., 2005).

Gur350 contains nouns, verbs and adjectives that are connected by classical and non-classical relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004).

Further research (Zesch et al., 2007b) indicates that German wordnet and Wikipedia show different performance depending on the task at hand.

Gurevych (2005) conducted experiments with two datasets: i) a German translation of the English dataset by Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965) (Gur65), and ii) a larger dataset containing 350 word pairs (Gur350).

Zesch and Gurevych (2006) created a third dataset from domain-specific corpora using a semi-automatic process (ZG222).

We use the semantic relatedness measure by Lin (1998) (referred to as LIN), as it consistently is among the best performing wordnet based measures (Gurevych and Niederlich, 2005; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).

As Wikipedia also models relatedness between concepts, it is better suited for computing 5http://www.taz.de semantic relatedness than GermaNet (Zesch et al., 2007b).

Wikipedia shares many of its properties with other well known lexical semantic resources (like dictionaries, thesauri, semantic wordnets or conventional encyclopedias) (Zesch et al., 2007a).
