2An instance of our head-corner generator (without an integrated treatment of movement) is the UCG-generator by Calder et al.\[Calder et al., 1989\] (modulo the use of unary category transformation rules) which relies, in addition, on the symmetry of syntactic and semantic head.

Another variant of a lexlcMized grammar by \[Dymetman ctal., 1990\] does not make use of the head-corner idea but rather corresponds to the top-down generation schema presented in Fig.1.

This means that both trees can merged into one tree by labeling the nodes with syntax-semantics-pairs: (xo, Xo) (~,x,) (~, x2) (s) In \[Shieber el al., 1990\] an ad-hoc solutiori was proposed to enforce termination when the semantic head has been moved.

For the phrasestructure tree rooted with s, there is no leaf which would fulfill the definition of a semantic head given in \[Shieber et al., 1990\] or \[van Noord, 1993\].

Alternatively, one could adopt a pure bottom-up strategy like the one which has been proposed in \[Shieber, 1988\] and which is presented in Fig.2 in a lfighly schematic manner.
