Related Formalisms Based on word-order facts from Turkish, Hoffman (1992) proposes an extension to CCG called {}-CCG, in which arguments of functors form sets, rather than being represented in a curried notation.

Becker, Tilman; Joshi, Aravind; and Rambow, Owen (1991).

Becker et al.(1991) argue that a simple TAG (and the other LIG-equivalent formalisms) cannot derive the full range of scrambled sentences.

The second assumption is that they "give a sufficiently enlarged domain of locality that allows localization of dependencies such as subcategorization, and filler-gap" (Vijay-Shanker, 1992, p.486).

These formalisms have been shown to be weakly equivalent to each other (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994); we will refer to them as "LIG-equivalent formalisms".

Third, a generalization of trees to "quasi-trees" (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in the spirit of D-Theory (Marcus et al., 1983) leads to the definition of a new formal system.

Staudacher (1993) defines a related system called distributed index grammar or DIG.
E93-1042
We follow Vijay-Shanker (1992, Section 2.5) in defining substitution as the operation of forming a quasi-node pair from a frontier node of one tree (which becomes the top node) and the root node of another tree (which becomes the bottom node).

Quasi-Trees Vijay-Shanker (1992) introduces "quasi-trees" as a generalization of trees.

Marcus, Mitchell; Hindle, Donald; and Fleck, Margaret (1983).

First, we can introduce the "integrity" constraint suggested by Becker et al.(1991) which restricts long-distance relations through nodes.
E91-1005
It can easily be seen that all examples discussed by Vijay-Shanker (1992) are derivations in QTSG.
