To the best of our knowledge, there are two preceding research papers on word sense acquisition (Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994; Pantel and Lin, 2002).
C94-2122
A great deal of research on WSD has been done over the past decade (Ide and Veronis, 1998).
J98-1001
Bilingual corpora or second-language corpora enable unsupervised WSD (Brown, et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994).
J94-4003 P91-1034
It is based on the sense-vs.-clue correlation matrix calculation method we originally developed for unsupervised WSD (Kaji and Morimoto, 2002).
C02-1058
32-39 Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003 similar distribution patterns (Hindle, 1990; Peraira, et al., 1993; Grefenstette, 1994).
