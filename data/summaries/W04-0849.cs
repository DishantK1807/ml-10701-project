Word-similarity classes (Lin, 1998) derived from clustering are also used to expand the pool of potential collocations; this type of semantic relatedness among words is expressed in the SimilarColl feature.

For details on the extraction of word clusters, see (Lin, 1998); and, for details on the definition analysis, see (O’Hara, forthcoming).
P98-2127
To alleviate this problem, class-based approaches augment word-level features with category-level ones (Ide and V´eronis, 1998; Jurafsky and Martin, 2000).
J98-1001
WordColl ∗ represents a set of non-sensespecific collocations (i.e., not necessarily indicative of any one sense), chosen via the G 2 criteria (Wiebe et al., 1998).

In the second Senseval competition, these features figured predominantly among the feature sets for the leading systems (Mihalcea, 2002; Yarowsky et al., 2001; Seo et al., 2001).
C02-1039
When formulating the features SimilarColl and DictColl, the words related to each context word are considered as potential collocations (Wiebe et al., 1998).
