Here, too, the syntactic structure of a sentence appears to provide more useful information than a bag of words (Chen et al., 2006), although the correct way to exploit it is still an open problem.
P06-1136
A tree kernel (TK) function which computes the number of common subtrees between two syntactic parse trees has been given in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).

system which achieves a 76% F1-measure (Moschitti et al., 2005).

Such tree kernel can be normalized and a Î» factor can be added to reduce the weight of large structures (refer to (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for a complete description).

Moreover, we define new kernel functions to exploit PASs, which we automatically derive with our SRL system (Moschitti et al., 2005) (Section 3).
W05-0630
An effective way to integrate syntactic structures in machine learning algorithms is the use of tree kernel (TK) functions (Collins and Duffy, 2002), which have been successfully applied to question classification (Zhang and Lee, 2003; Moschitti, 2006) and other tasks, e.g. relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Moschitti, 2006).
