This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that employs a learning framework called structural learning (Ando and Zhang, 2004), which seeks to discover shared predictive structures (i.e.

Following Pradhan et al.(2003), we used tinySVM along with YamCha (Kudo and Matsumoto 2000, 2001) as the SVM training and test software.

The fact that the error rate more than doubles when the seeds in Yarowsky's (1995) experiments are reduced from a sense's best collocations to just one word per sense suggests that the error rate would increase further if no seeds were provided.

Since Miller et al.(2004)'s experiments used a proprietary corpus, direct performance comparison is not possible.

The average performance of the SVD-based representations of 83% to 91% is satisfactory, although inferior by about 5% to 10%, to disambiguation with minimal manual intervention (e.g., Yarowsky \[1995\]).

Yarowsky has proposed an algorithm that requires as little user input as one seed word per sense to start the training process (Yarowsky 1995).

Many of these features required creating an automatic parse; in doing so we showed that the Collins (1999) parser when ported to Chinese achieved the best reported performance on Chinese syntactic parsing.

Collins parser for Chinese The Collins parser is a state-of-the-art statistical parser that has high performance on English (Collins, 1999) and Czech(Collins et al.1999). There have been attempts in applying other algorithms in Chinese parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel 2002; Levy and Manning 2003), but there has been no report on applying the Collins parser on Chinese.

Similarly, Miller et al.(2004) used word-cluster memberships induced from an unannotated corpus as features for named entity chunking.
