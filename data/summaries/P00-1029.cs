4.1 Pseudo-Disambiguation We evaluated our 3-dimensional clustering models on a pseudo-disambiguation task similar to the one described by Rooth et al.(1999), but specied to onset, nucleus, and coda ambiguity.

Two-dimensional EM-based clustering has been applied to tasks in syntax (Rooth et al., 1999), but so far this approach has not been used to derive models of higher dimensionality and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the rst time that it is being applied to speech.

In contrast to the application of twodimensional EM-based clustering to syntax (Rooth et al., 1999), where semantic relations were revealed between verbs and objects, the syllable models cannot a priori be expected to yield similarly meaningful properties.

Recently, Bouma (2000) has reported a word accuracy of 92.6% for Dutch, using a `lazy' training strategy on data aligned with the correct phoneme string, and a hand-crafted system that relied on a large set of rule templates and a many-to-one mapping of characters to graphemes preceding the actual g2p conversion.

We are condent that a judicious combination of phonological information of the type employed in our feasibility study with standard techniques such as g2p alignment of training data will produce a pronunciation system with a word accuracy that matches the one reported by Bouma (2000).

Syllable Clustering EM-based clustering has been derived and applied to syntax (Rooth et al., 1999).
