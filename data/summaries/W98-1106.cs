Another early system, PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993), requires domain-specific frames with keyword lists, CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995) requires an annotated training corpus, RAPIER (Califf and Mooney, 1997) requires filled templates, and LIEP (Huffman, 1996) requires keywords and annotated training examples.

~ The corpus-based algorithm that we used to build the semantic lexicon (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) requires five "seed words" as input for each semantic category, and produces a ranked list of words that are statistically associated with each category.

However, in previous work we showed that AutoSlog-TS achieved performance comparable to AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996b), which performed very well in the MUC-4 evaluation (Lehnert et al., 1992b).

For example, consider some of the manually defined case frames that were used to recognize terrorist events in the UMass MUC-4 system (Lehnert et al., 1992a).

Our approach builds upon earlier work on corpus-based methods for generating extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996b) and semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).
