In this paper we showed the performance of three flavours of Covington’s algorithm for non-projective dependency parsing on the ten languages provided for the CoNLL-X Shared Task (Nivre et al., 2007).

Additionally, since our feature vectors differed from those described in (Nivre, 2007), head-dependent-features vs.

Finally, for the Basque data we attempted to test the optimized version of the Covington algorithm (Nivre, 2007) against the three other versions discussed here.

Building heavily on the ideas of History-based parsing (Black et al., 1993; Nivre, 2006), training the parser means essentially running the parsing algorithms in a learning mode on the data in order to gather training instances for the memory-based learner.

(Nivre, 2007) describes an optimized version of Covington’s algorithm implemented in MaltParser (Nivre, 2006) with a running time c(n22 − n2) for an n-word sentence, where c is some constant time in which the LINK operation can be performed.

In this respect such a model is very restrictive and suffers from the pitfalls of the incremental processing (Nivre, 2004).

First, we investigate the impact of using different flavours of Covington’s algorithm (Covington, 2001) for nonprojective dependency parsing on the ten different languages provided for CoNLL-X Shared Task (Nivre et al., 2007).

Our first intuition about the results from the tests done on all the 10 languages was that the classification task suffered from a highly skewed class distribution since the training instances that correspond to a dependency relation are largely outnumbered by the “NO” class (Canisius et al., 2006).
