Language-Only Model We chose the LRC algorithm (Tetreault, 2001) to serve as the basis for our language-only model.

Model Overviews The models evaluated in this paper are based on Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Grosz & Sidner, 1986) and the algorithms devised by Brennan and colleagues (1987) and adapted by Tetreault (2001).

The development of an integrated multi-modal model of referring behavior can improve the performance of state-of-the-art computational models of communication currently used to support conversational interactions with an intelligent agent (Allen et al., 2005; Devault et al., 2005; Gorniak & Roy, 2004).

These include models based primarily on world knowledge (e.g., Hobbs et al., 1993), syntax-based methods (Hobbs, 1978), and those that integrate a combination of syntax, semantics and discourse structure (e.g., Grosz et al., 1995; Strube, 1998; Tetreault, 2001).

Thus, their approaches apply to explicit interaction techniques but do not necessarily support more general communication in the presence of shared visual information (e.g., see Chai et al., 2005; Huls et al., 1995; Kehler, 2000).

Yet, a number of discourse-based models of reference primarily rely on linguistic information without regard to the surrounding visual environment (e.g., see Brennan et al., 1987; Hobbs, 1978; Poesio et al., 2004; Strube, 1998; Tetreault, 2005).

To conserve space we do not reproduce the LRC algorithm in this paper and instead refer readers to Tetreaultâ€™s original formulation (2001).

And people are found to use shorter and syntactically simpler language (Oviatt, 1997) and different surface realizations (Cassell & Stone, 2000) when gestures accompany their spoken language.

Following prior work that demonstrated the utility of a visual decay function (Byron et al., 2005b; Huls et al., 1995), we implemented a three second threshold on the lifespan of a visual entity.
