Using the same model but less data, a French/English software manual of 400,000 words, Resnik and Melamed (1997) reported 94% precision with 30% recall.

Kitamura and Matsumoto (1996) present results from aligning multi-word and single word expressions with a recall of 80 per cent if partially correct translations were included.

For instance, Melamed (1997a) reports that his word-to-word model for translational equivalence produced lexicon entries with 99% precision and 46% recall when trained on 13 million words of the Hansard corpus, where recall was measured as the fraction of words from the bitext that were assigned some translation.

Melamed (1997b), however, proposes a method for the recognition of multiword compounds in bitexts that is based on the predictive value of a translation model.

2. Previous work Most algorithms for bilingual word alignment to date have been based on the probabilistic translation models first proposed by Brown et al.(1988, 1990), especially Model I and Model 2.

This can be seen as a generalization of the one-to-one assumption for word-to-word translation used by Melamed (1997a) and is exploited for the same purpose, i.e. to exclude large numbers of candidate alignments, when good initial alignments have been found.

3. Underlying assumptions As Fung and Church (1994) we wish to estimate the bilingual lexicon directly.

Dagan and Church (1994) reports that their Termight system helped double the speed at which terminology lists could be compiled at the AT&T Business Translation Services.

For this purpose, we use the phrase extracting program described in Merkel et al.(1994). 4.4 Basic operation The basic algorithm combines the K-vec approach, described by Fung and Church (1993), with the greedy word-to-word algorithm of Melamed (1997a).
