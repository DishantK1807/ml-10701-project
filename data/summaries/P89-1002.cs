5Further details of the use of shuffle in scoplng are siren by Pereira and Shieber (1985).

Wedekind (1988) achieves this goal by expanding first nodes that are connected, that is, whose semantics is instantiated.

It is exactly this mismatch between structure of the traversal and 2Pereira and Warren (1983) point out that Earley deduction is not restricted to a left-to-right expansion of goals, but this suggestion was not followed up with a specific algorithm addressing the problems discussed here.

Finally, Calder et al.(1989) report on a generation algorithm for unification categorial grammar that appears to be a special case of ours.

In particular, unlike an Earley deduction generator (Shieber, 1988), it allows use of semantically nonmonotonic grammars, yet unlike topdown methods, it also permits left-recursion.
C88-2128
In particular, we developed an architecture inspired by the Earley deduction work of Pereira and Warren (1983) but which generalized that work allowing for its use in both a parsing and generation mode merely by setting the values of a small number of parameters.

stating that an NP with agreement Agr and semantics Sera can be empty provided that the list of gaps in the NP can be represented as the difference list \[np(Agr)/SemlX\]-X, that is the list containing an NP gap with the same agreement features Agr (Pereira and Shieber, 1985, p.

In particular, generation from grammars with recursions whose welbfoundedness relies on lexical information will terminate; top-down generation regimes such as those of Wedekind (1988) or Dymetman and Isabelle (1988) lack this property, discussed further in Section 3.1.

Adding appropriate side conditions to the rules, following the constraints discussed by Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987) would not be difficult.

This is the correlate of the link relation used in left-corner parsers with topdown filtering; we direct the reader to the discussion by Matsumoto et al.(1983) or Pereira and Shieber (1985, p.

Although we believe that this algorithm could be seen as an instance of a uniform architecture for parsing and generation--just as the extended Earley parser (Shieber, 1985b) and the bottom-up generator were instances of the generalized Earley deduction architecture= our efforts to date have been aimed foremost toward the development of the algorithm for generation alone.

For example, a grammar with a gap-threading treatment of wh-movement (Pereira, 1981; Pereira and Shieber, 1985) might include the rule np(Agr, \[np(Agr)/SemlX\]-X)/Sem---> \[\].

and Coherence Wedekind (1988) defines completeness and coherence of a generation algorithm as follows.

In previous work (Shieber, 1988), however, one of us attempted to characterize these differing properties in such a way that a single uniform architecture, appropriately parameterized, might be used for both natural-language processes.
C88-2128
For example, the "complements" rule given by Shieber (1985a, pages 77-78) in the PATR-II formalism VP1 ~ VP2 X (VPI head) = (VP2 head) (VP2 syncat first) = (X) (VP2 syncat rest) (VP1 syncat) can be encoded as the DCG-style rule: vp(Head, Synca~) --> vp(Head, \[CompllSyncat\]), Compl.
