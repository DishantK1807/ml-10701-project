Other sequences exhibited what Hindle and Rooth (1993) call SEMANTIC INDETERMINACY, where the meanings associated with two attachments cannot be distinguished in the context.

The research presented here can thus be seen as investigating the application of several key ideas in Hindle and Rooth (1993) and in Resnik and Hearst (1993) to the solution of an analogous problem, that of compound noun analysis.

A very simple technique aimed at bracketing ambiguous compound nouns is reported in Pustejovsky et al.(1993). While attempting to extract taxonomic relationships, their system heuristically bracketed CNs by searching elsewhere in the corpus for subcomponents of the compound.

Subsequently, Hindle and Rooth's work has been extended by Resnik and Hearst (1993).
