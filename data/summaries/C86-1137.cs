4. Some consequences of this demonstration Berwick\[1982) provides a similarly semi-formal proof of the NP-hardness of parsing with respect to lexical-functional grammar, a formalism with many similarities to FU grammar, although his proof is radically different from the scheme presented here for FU grammar.

I. Functional Unification Grammar There is not space here to give a full definition of FU grammar (see Kay (1979, 1984, 1985), Ritchie(1984)); the aim is rather to outline how the problem of satisfiability of a propositional logic expression in conjunctive normal form (CNF) can be expressed as a derivation in FU grammar, thereby suggesting that the derivation question in FU grammar is "NP-hard" (Garey and Johnson (1979)).
