The Bayesian prior, P(O~i,l<--.->~j,p), can be estimated as per Gale and Church (1991) by assuming that it is equal to the frequency of distinct n-m matches in the training set.
P91-1023
In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994).
P94-1012
Successful approaches to alignment can be divided into two primary types: those that use comparisons of lexical elements between the documents (Wu, 1994; Chen 1993; Catizone, Russell and Warwick, 1989), and IThis research was funded under DoD Contract #MDA 904-94-C-E086 those that use a statistical decision process derived from byte-length ratios between alignment blocks (Wu, 1994; Church, 1993; Gale and Church, 1991).
P91-1023 P93-1001 P93-1002 P94-1012
Following Gale and Church (1991), the slope of the average of the length differences describes the average number of Spanish characters generated per English character.
P91-1023
The work by Simard, Foster and Isabelle (1993) as well as Church (1993) demonstrated that cognate-matching strategies can be highly effective in aligning text.
