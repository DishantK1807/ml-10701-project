(Sch¨utze, 1998) points out that single link clustering tends to place all instances into a single elongated cluster, whereas (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Purandare, 2003) show that hierarchical agglomerative clustering using average link (via McQuitty’s method) fares well.

While there has been some previous work in sense discrimination (e.g., (Sch¨utze, 1992), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1998), (Sch¨utze, 1998), (Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999)), by comparison it is much less than that devoted to word sense disambiguation, which is the process of assigning a meaning to a word from a predefined set of possibilities.

This paper presents a systematic comparison of discrimination techniques suggested by Pedersen and Bruce ((Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1998)) and by Sch¨utze ((Sch¨utze, 1992), (Sch¨utze, 1998)).

Work (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1998) propose a (dis)similarity based discrimination approach that computes (dis)similarity among each pair of instances of the target word.
