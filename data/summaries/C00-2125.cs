For the purpose of constructing more salient and robust dialogue systems, recent analyses on speech repairs, or more generally speaking, on speech disfluencies in spoken dialogues have tried to explore the distributional characteristics of irregular sequences in order to develop annotation systems to cope with speech repairs (Heeman and Allen 1999, Nakatani and Hirschberg 1994).
