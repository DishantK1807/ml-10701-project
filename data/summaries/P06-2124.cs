IBM-1 has global optimum; it is efficient and easily scalable to large training data; it is one of the most informative components for re-ranking translations (Och et al., 2004).

This include knowledge-based (Nyberg and Mitamura, 1992) and interlingua-based (Dorr and Habash, 2002) approaches.

Recent investigations along this line includes using word-disambiguation schemes (Carpua and Wu, 2005) and non-overlapping bilingual word-clusters (Wang et al., 1996; Och, 1999; Zhao et al., 2005) with particular translation models, which showed various degrees of success.

Most current approaches emphasize within-sentence dependencies such as the distortion in (Brown et al., 1993), the dependency of alignment in HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), and syntax mappings in (Yamada and Knight, 2001).

2.1 Baseline: IBM Model-1 The translation process can be viewed as operations of word substitutions, permutations, and insertions/deletions (Brown et al., 1993) in noisychannel modeling scheme at parallel sentence-pair level.

(1) 1We follow the notations in (Brown et al., 1993) for English-French, i.e., e â†” f, although our models are tested, in this paper, for English-Chinese.

For word alignment accuracy, F-measure is reported, i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall against a gold-standard reference set; for translation quality, Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) and its variation of NIST scores are reported.

Similar to the Pharoah package (Koehn, 2004), we extract phrase-pairs directly from word alignment together with coherence constraints (Fox, 2002) to remove noisy ones.
