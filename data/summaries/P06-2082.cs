They used the Redwoods treebank environment (Oepen et al., 2002) and discussed the reduction in annotation cost by an active learning approach.

The work most closely related to this paper is Hwa’s (Hwa, 2004), which proposed a sophisticated method for selective sampling for statistical parsing.

We converted the POS system used in the Kyoto Text Corpus into ChaSen’s POS system because we used ChaSen, a Japanese morphological analyzer, and CaboCha3 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), a dependency analyzer incorporating SVMs, as a state-ofthe art corpus-based Japanese dependency structure analyzer that prefers ChaSen’s POS system to that of JUMAN.

The study by Baldridge and Osborne (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004) is also very close to this paper.

At present, one promising approach to mitigating the annotation bottleneck problem is to use selective sampling, a variant of active learning (Cohn et al., 1994; Fujii et al., 1998; Hwa, 2004).

works To date, many works on selective sampling were conducted in the field related to natural language processing (Fujii et al., 1998; Hwa, 2004; Kamm and Meyer, 2002; Riccardi and Hakkani-T¨ur, 2005; Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001; Engelson and Dagan, 1996).

These verbs tend to form conjunctive structures and it is known that analyzing conjunctive structure is difficult (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994b).

Conventional methods of dependency analysis have assumed the following three syntactic constraints (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994a): 1.
