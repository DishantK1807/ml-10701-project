Therefore, it makes intuitive sense that verb semantics can be useful in determining these relations.2 In Subba et al.(2006), 1The corpus was collected opportunistically off the internet and from other sources, and originally assembled at the Information Technology Research Institute, University of Brighton.

Our model was trained and tested on RST-DT (2002) and achieves a performance of up to 86.12% F-Score, which is comparable to Soricut and Marcu (2003).

In the past, the problem of sentence level discourse segmentation has been tackled using both symbolic methods (Polanyi et al., 2004; Huong et al., 2004) as well as statistical models (Soricut and Marcu, 2003; Marcu, 2000) that have exploited syntactic and lexical features.

However, previous work (Marcu, 2000; Polanyi et al., 2004; Soricut and Marcu, 2005; Sporleder and Lascarides, 2005) in discourse parsing has relied on syntactic and lexical information, and shallow semantics only.

Relation Classifier In a preliminary investigation (Subba et al., 2006), we modeled the problem of identifying rhetorical relations as a classification problem using rich verb semantics only.
