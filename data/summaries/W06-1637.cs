Adopting a left-to-right processing order for a sentence is important, if the syntactic theory is to make psycholinguistically viable predictions (Niv, 1994; Steedman, 2000).

The results have demonstrated the existence of priming effects in corpus data: they occur for specific syntactic constructions (Gries, 2005; Szmrecsanyi, 2005), consistent with the experimental literature, but also generalize to syntactic rules across the board, which repeated more often than expected by chance (Reitter et al., 2006b; Dubey et al., 2006).

CCG has also enjoyed the interest of the NLP community, with high-accuracy wide-coverage parsers(Clark and Curran, 2004; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002) and generators1 available (White and Baldridge, 2003).
P02-1043 P04-1014
Previous work points out that priming is sensitive to frequency (Scheepers (2003) for high/low relative clause attachments, (Reitter et al., 2006a) for phrase structure rules).

Reitter et al.(2006b) present a different method to examine priming effects in the general case.

(See Reitter et al.(2006b) for a worked example.) In order to eliminate cases of lexical repetition of a phrase, e.g., names or lexicalized noun 3This approach uses a number of data points per target, looking backwards for primes.

Using the same regression technique as employed here, Reitter et al.(2006b) found a marked structural priming effect for Penn-Treebank style phrase structure rules in Switchboard.

Data 4.1 The Switchboard Corpus The Switchboard (Marcus et al., 1994) corpus contains transcriptions of spoken, spontaneous conversation annotated with phrase-structure trees.

Speech is often disfluent, and speech repairs are known to repeat large portions of the preceding context (Johnson and Charniak, 2004).
P04-1005
CCG parsers often limit the use of the combinatory rules (in particular: type-raising) to obtain a single right-branching normal form derivation (Eisner, 1996) for each possible semantic interpretation.
