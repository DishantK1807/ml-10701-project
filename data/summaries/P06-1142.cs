or a context-vector approach (Fung and Yee, 1998; Nie et al, 1999).

Virga and Khudanpur (2003) and Kuo et al (2005) adopted the noisychannel modeling framework.

In this case, the common generative models (Li et al, 2004) fail to predict the transliteration most of the time.

Lee and Chang (2003) proposed using a probabilistic model to identify E-C pairs from aligned sentences using phonetic clues.

Rapp. 1999.

The PSA therefore requires less training data for statistical modeling (Knight, 1998); on the other hand, the grapheme-based method gets rid of the letter-to-sound conversion, which is one of the main causes of transliteration errors (Li et al, 2004).
J98-4003 P04-1021
Another syllabification technique attempts to map the grapheme of an English word to syllables directly (Kuo and Yang, 2004).
P04-3003
Research on automatic transliteration has reported promising results for regular transliteration (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Li et al, 2004), where transliterations follow rigid guidelines.

It is noted that the state-of-the-art accuracy reported by Li et al (2004) for regular transliterations of the Xinhua database is about 70.1%, which leaves much room for improvement if one expects to use a generative model to construct a lexicon for casual transliterations.
P04-1021
Li et al (2004) took a different approach by introducing a joint source-channel model for direct orthography mapping (DOM), which treats transliteration as a statistical machine translation problem under monotonic constraints.

Most of these works are devoted to phoneme1-based transliteration modeling (Wan and Verspoor 1998, Knight and Graehl, 1998).
J98-4003 P98-2220
These include exploring query logs (Brill et al, 2001), unrelated corpus (Rapp, 1999), and parallel or comparable corpus (Fung and Yee, 1998; Nie et al, 1999; Huang et al 2005).
