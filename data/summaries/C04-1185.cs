In future work we will compare our semantics construction principles to the general model of Copestake et al.(2001). Acknowledgements I am greatly indebted to my colleagues at DFKI, especially the SProUT team members Witold Dro˙zd˙zy´nski, Hans-Ulrich Krieger, Jakub Piskorski and Ulrich Sch¨afer, for their technical support and advice.

While previous accounts (Daum et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2003) focus on shallow-deep integration at the syntactic level, Copestake aims at integration of shallow and deep NLP at the level of semantics.
