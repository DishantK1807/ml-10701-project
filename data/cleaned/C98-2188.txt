Abstract 
This paper studies and evaluates disambigua
tion strategies for the translation of tense be
tween German and English, using a bilingual 
cortms of al)pointment scheduling dialogues. It 
describes a scheme to detect complex verb pred
icates based on verb form subcatcgorization and 
grammatical knowledge. The extracted verb 
and tense infbrmation is presented and the role 
of different context factors is discussed. 
1 Introduction

A problem for translation is its context depen
deuce. For every ambiguous word, the part of 
the context relevant for disambiguation must be 
identified (disambiguation strategy), and every 
word potentially occurring in this context nmst 
be assigned a bias for the translation decision 
(disambiguation ildorination). Manual con
struction of disambiguation components is quite 
a chore. Fortunately, the task can be (partly) 
automated if the tables associating words with 
biases are learned from a corpus. Statistical 
approaches also support empirical evaluation of 
different disalnbiguation strategies. 
The paper studies disambiguation strategies 
for tense translation between German and En
glish. The experiments are based on a corpus 
of appointment scheduling dialogues counting 
150,281 German and 154,773 English word to
kens aligned in 16,857 turns. The dialogues were 
recorded, transcribed and translated in the Ger
man national Verbmobil project that aims to 
develop a tri-lingual spoken language transla
tion system. Tense is interesting, since it oc
curs in nearly every sentence. Tense can be ex

2 Words
Are Not Enough 
Often, sentence meaning is not compositional 
but arises fl'om combinations of words (1). 
(1) a. h:h habe ihn gestern gesehen. 
I have him yesterday seen 
I saw him yesterday. 
b. Ich sehlage Montag vor. 
I beat Monday forward 
I suggest; Monday. 
c. Ich m6chte reich be.schweren. 
1 'd like to myself weigh down 
I'd like to Inake a colnplaint. 
For translation, the discontinuous words must 
be amalgamated into single semantic items. 
Single words or pairs of lemma and part of 
speech tag (L-POS pairs) are not appropriate. 
To verify this claim, we aligned the L-POS pairs 
of the Vel'lmmbil corpus using the comph;tely 
language-independent method of Dagan et 
al. (1993). Below find the results tbr sehen 1

alignments for reflexive pronouns.

in tile corpus, it often occurs in questions. Present sehen 
was frequently translated into perfect discmmr.

3 Partial
Parsing 
A full syntactic analysis of the sort of unre
stricted spoken language text found in the Verb
mobil corpus is still beyond reach. Hence, we 
took a partial parsing approach. 
3.1 Complex
Verb Predicates 
Both German and English exhibit complex verb 
predicates (CVPs), see (2). Every verb and verb 
particle belongs to such a CVP and there is only 
one CVP per clause. 
(2) He would not have called me up. 
The following two grammar fragments describe 
the relevant CVP syntax for English and Ger
man. Every auxiliary verb governs only one 
verb, so the CVP grammar is basically 2 regu
lar and implementable with finite-state devices. 
S-+... VP... 
VP ~ hd:V (to) VP 
VP --+ hd:V ... (Particle) 
S --4... hd:Vfin ... (Refl) ... VC... 
S ~ ... (Refl) ... VC ... 
S -~ ... VC hd:Vfi n ... (Refl) ... 
VC --~ (VC) (zu) hd:V 
VC -4 SeparatedVcrbPrefix 
English CVPs are left-headed, while German 
CVPs are partly left-, partly right-headed. 
* CVP 
/ ~Vp~
/ v?-, \', / 
Er wird es get, an haben miissen 
he will it done have must 
He will have to have done it. 
'>The grammar does not handle insertion of CVPs into 
other CVPs and partially fronted verb complexes (3). 
(3) V'ersuchen hS~tte ich es schon gerne wollen. 
try 'd have I it liked to 
I'd have liked to try it. 
3.2 Verb
Form Subcategorization 
Auxiliary verbs form a closed class. Thus, the 
set sub(v) of infinite verb forms for which an 
auxiliary verb v subcategorizes can be specified 
by hand. English and German auxiliary verbs 
govern the following verb forms. 
• infinitive e.g. will 
• to-infinitive (T) e.g. want 
• past participle (P) e.g. get 
• P V T e.g. have 
• present participle V P V T e.g. be 
• infinitive (I) e.g. miissen 
• zu-infinitive (Z) e.g. scheinen 
• perf.part, with haben (H) e.g. t~ekommen 
• H V I e.g. werden 
• H V I V Z e.g. haben 
• perf.part, with sein V H V I V Z e.g.sein 
3.3 Transducers

Two partial parsers (rather: transducers) are 
used to detect English and German CVPs 
and to translate them into predicate argument 
structures (verb chains). The parsers presup
pose POS tagging and lemmatization. A data 
base associates verbs v with sets mor(v) of pos
sible tenses or infinite verb forms. 
Let m = I{mor(v) : Verb v}l and n = I{sub(v) : 
Verb v }\]. Then the English CVP parser needs 
n + 1 states to encode which verb forms, if 
any, are expected by a preceding auxiliary verb. 
Verb particles are attached to the preceding 
verb. The German CVP parser is more compli
cated, but also more restrictive as all verbs in 
a verb complex (VC) must be adjacent. It op
erates in left-headed (S) or right-headed mode 
(VC). In VC-mode (i.e. inside VCs) the order 
of the verbs put on the output tape is reversed. 
In S-mode, n + 1 states again record the verb 
form expected by a preceding finite verb Vfin. 
VC-mode is entered when an infinite verb form 
is encountered. A state in VC-mode records the 
verb form expected by Vfin (n + 1), the infinite 
verb form of the last verb encountered (m), and 
the verb form expected by the VC verb, if the 
VC consists of only one verb (n + 1). So there 
are rn, (n + 1) 2 states. As soon as a non-verb is 
encountered in VC-mode or the verb form of the 
previous verb does not fit the subcategorization 
requirements of the current verb, a test is per
formed to see if the verb form of the last verb

in VC fits the verb form required by Vfin. If it 
does or there is no such finite verb, one CVP has 
been detected. Else Vfin forms a separate CVP. 
In case the VC consists of only one verb that 
can be interpreted as finite, the expected verb 
form is recorded in a new S-Inode state. Sep
arated verb prefixes are attached to the finite 
verb, first in the chain. 
3.4 Alignment

In the CVP alignment, only 78 % of the turns 
proved to have CVPs on both sides, only 19 % 
had more than one CVP on some side. CVPs 
were further aligned by maximizing the trans
lation probability of the flfll verbs (yielding 
16,575 CVP pairs). To ensure correctness, turns 
with multit)le CVPs were inspected by hand. 
in word aligmnent inside CVPs, surplus tense
bearing auxiliary verbs were aligned with a 
tense-marked NULL auxiliary (similar to the 
English auxiliary do). 
3.5 Alignment
Results 
The domain biases the c, orpus towards the fll
ture. So only 5 out of 6 German tenses and 
12 out of 16 English tenses occurred in tile cor
pus. Both will and be going to were analysed as 
future, while would was taken to indicate con
ditional mood, hence present. 
• present (15,710) ,, perfect (344) 
• t)rcterite (331) • pluperfect (49) 
• future (150) 
1185 
• present (12,252; progressive: 358) 
• past (594; progressive: 23) 
• present perfect (227; progressive: 7) 
• past perfect (1; progressive: 1) 
• future (1,429; progressive: 23) 
• future perfect (10) • future in the past (3) 
In some cases, tense was ambiguous when con
sidered in isolation, and had to be resolved 
in tandem with tense translation. Ambiguous 
tenses on the target side were disambiguated to 
fit the particular disambiguation strategy. 
• G present/perfect (verreist sein) (39) 
• G present/past (sollte, ging) (229) 
• E pres./present perfect (have got) (500) 
• E pres./past (should, could, must) (1,218) 
4 Evaluation

Formally, we define source tense and target 
tense as two random variables S and T. Disam
biguation strategies are modeled as functions tr 
from source to target tense. Precision figures 
give the proportion of source tense tokens ts 
that the strategy correctly translates to target 
tense tt, recall gives the proportion of source
target tense pairs that the strategy finds out. 
(4) precisiontr(ts, tt) = 
P(T = ttl S = ts,tr(ts) = tt) 
recalltr ( ts, tt ) = 
P(tr(ts) = tt\[ S = ts,T = tt) 
Combined precision and recall vahms are formed 
by taking the sum of the frequencies in nmner
ator and denominator for all source and target 
tenses. Performance was cross-validated with 
test sets of 10 % of all CVP pairs. 
4.1 Baseline

A baseline strategy assigns to every source 
tense the most likely target tense (tr(ts) = 
arg maxt~P(ttlt,), strategy t). The most likely 
target tenses can be read off Figures 1 and 2. 
Past tenses rarely denote logical past, as dis
cussion circles around a future meeting event, 
they are rather used for politeness. 
(5) a. Ich wollte Sic fragen, wie das aussieht. 
I wanted to ask you what is on. 
b. iibermorgen war ich ja auf diesem Kon
grefi in Ziirich. 
the day after tomorrow, I'll be (lit: was) 
at this conference in Zurich. 
4.2 Full
Verb Information 
Three more disambiguation strategies condi
tion the choice of tense on the full verb in 
a CVP, viz. the source verb (tr(ts,vs) = 
arg maxhP(ttlts,vs), strategy vs), the target 
verb (tr(t,,vt), strategy vt), and the combina
tion of source and target verb (tr(G, {vs,vt)), 
strategy vst). The table below gives preci
sion and recall values for these strategies and 
for the strategies obtained by smoothing (e.g. 
v,t,v~,vt, t is %t smoothed first with v~, then 
with vt, and finally with t). Smoothing with t 
results in identical precision and recall figures.

We see that inclusion of verb inibrmation im
proves performance. Translation pairs approx
imate the verb semantics better than single 
source or target verbs. The full verb contexts of 
tenses can also be used for verb classifications. 
Aspeetual classification: The aspect of a 
verb often depends on its reading and thus can 
be better extrapolated from an aligned corpus 
(e.g. I am having a drink (trinken)). German 
allows punctual events in the present, English 
prefers present perfect (e.g. sehen, finden, tbst
stellen(discover, find, see); einfallen (occur, re
member); treffen, erwisdmn, sehen (meet)). 
World knowledge: In many cases perfect 
maps an event to its result state.

=~ be wrong

4.3 Subordinating
Conjunctions 
Conjunctions often engender different mood. 
• In conditional clauses English past tenses usu
ally denote present tenses. Interpreting hypo
thetical past as present increases performance 
by about 0.3 %. 
1186 
• In subjunctive environments logical future is 
expressed by English simple present. The verbs 
vorsddagen (s,ggest) (in 11 out of 14 cases) and 
sag'ca (say) (2/5) force simt)le present on verbs 
that normally prefer a translation to flmlre. 
(6) I suggest that we meet on the tenth. 
• Certain matrix verbs a trigger translation of 
German present to English fllture. 
4.4 Representation
of Tense 
Tense can not only I)e viewed as a single item 
(as sketched above, representation rt). In com
positional analyses of tense, source tense S and 
target tense T are decomposed into compo
nents (S1,..., Sn} and (T1,... ,Tn}. A disam
biguation strategy tr is correct if Vi : tr(Si) = 
T,:. 
One decomposition is suggested by the en
coding of tense on the surface ((present/past, 
O~ will~ be going to/werden, O / have/ haben/sein, 
0/be), representation r,). Another widely 
used framework in tense analysis (Reichenbach, 
1947) ((E</v/>R, R</~/>S, !progr), repre
sentation r,.) attalyses English tenses as follows: 
R,~S R,<S R>S 
E~R. t)resent past 
E<R present perf. past perf. flit. perf. 
E>R tilt m'e future past 
A similar classification can be used for German 
except that present and t)ert~ct are analysed as 
ambiguous between present and future (E>R~S 
and E<R_>S).

orates the expectation that tense disambigua
tion is helped by recognition of analytic tenses.

really hard step with Reichenbach seems to be

5 Conclusion

The paper presents a way to test disamtfigua
tion strategies oil real data and to measure tit(; 
influence of diverse factors ranging front sen
tence internal context to the choice of represen
tation. The pertaining disambiguation informa
tion learned fl'om the corpus is trot into action 
in the symbolic transfer component of the Verb
mobil system (Dorna and Emele, 1996). 
The only other emt)irical study of tense transla
tion (Santos, 1994) I ant aware of was conducted 
on a manually annotated Portuguese-English 
corpus (48,607 English, 43,492 Portuguese word 
tokens and 6,334 tense translation pairs). It nei
ther gives results tbr all tenses nor considers dis
ambiguation factors. Still, it acknowledges the 
surprising divergence of tense across languages 
and argues against the widely held belief that 
surface tenses can be mapped directly into an 
interlinguM representation. Although the find
ings reported here support this conclusion, it 
should be noted that a bilingual corpus can only 
give one of several possible translations.
