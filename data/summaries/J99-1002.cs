The ERG itself has been developed without making use of defaults up to this point, using the DISCO/PAGE system (Uszkoreit et al.1994), but it also runs within the LKB system (Copestake 1992).
C94-1072
We omit the details, since we want to keep the definition of the default operation as general as possible, and there are a number of different constraint languages within feature structure frameworks (e.g., Alshawi et al.1991; 70 Lascarides and Copestake Default Representation Carpenter 1992; D6rre and Eisle 1991; Emele and Zajac 1990; Gerdemann and King 1994; Krieger and Sch/ifer 1994; de Paiva 1993; Smolka 1989).
C90-3052 C94-2154
The most common linguistic application for default inheritance is to encode lexical generalizations (e.g., Boguraev and Pustejovsky 1990; Briscoe, Copestake, and Boguraev 1990; Vossen and Copestake 1993; Daelemans 1987; Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b, 1996; Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow 1985; Flickinger 1987; Flickinger and Nerbonne 1992; Kilgarriff 1993; Krieger and Nerbonne 1993; Sanfilippo 1993; Shieber 1986a), but defaults have also been used for specification in syntactic theory (e.g., Gazdar 1987; Shieber 1986b), and for the analysis of gapping constructions (Kaplan 1987) and ellipsis (Grover et al.1994). In Lascarides et al.(1996), we argued for the role of defaults both in descriptions of the lexicon and grammar and to allow the linguistic component to make defeasible proposals to discourse processing/pragmatics.

We therefore believe that it is desirable that defaults be explicitly marked, and, as shown by Young and Rounds (1993), this is a necessary condition for the order-independence of default unification (criterion 5, below).
P93-1028
YADU could not replace asymmetric default unification in Grover et al.'s (1994) treatment of ellipsis.

1. Introduction The utility of defaults in linguistic representation has been widely discussed (for an overview, see Daelemans, de Smedt, and Gazdar \[1992\]).
J92-2004
It is also not allowed in Young and Rounds (1993), which is the only order-independent version of default unification of which we are aware apart from PDU and YADU.
P93-1028
Thus, as demonstrated in Young and Rounds (1993) and Lascarides et al.(1996), criterion 1 above is a prerequisite to criterion 5.
P93-1028
Definitions of Default Operations on Feature Structures There have been a number of previous definitions of default unification, including those given by: van den Berg and Pr6st (1991), Bouma (1990, 1992), Calder (1991), Carpenter (1993), Copestake (1992, 1993), Russell, Carroll, and Warwick-Armstrong (1991), and Russell et al.(1993). These definitions were all based on Kaplan's sketch of priority union (Kaplan 1987) and are asymmetric since one feature structure (FS) is taken to be indefeasible while the other is defeasible.
J92-2003 P90-1021 P91-1028
However, in standard YADU, there is no way to express the idea that the coindexation between mother and non-head-daughter should hold instead of the coindexation between mother and head-daughter, since, as far as this structure goes, 11 Similar remarks also apply to the contrast between Bouma's (1990, 1992) and Carpenter's (1993) versions of asymmetric default unification.
J92-2003 P90-1021
Young and Rounds (1993) define an order-independent version of default unification using Reiter's default logic (Reiter 1980) to model the operation.
P93-1028
This would not be possible with some previous versions of default unification, including Russell, Carroll, and Warwick-Armstrong (1991), Russell et al.(1993), and the second version of the LKB default unification given in Copestake (1993).
