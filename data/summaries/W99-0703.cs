We then use error-tolerant finite state recognition \[Oflazer, 1996\] to perform "reverse spelling correction" for identifying the erroneous words the finite state analyzer accepts that are (very) close to the correct words in the test corpus that it rejects.

Currently the provisions we have for such constraints are limited to writing regular expressions (albeit at a much higher level), but capturing such constraints using a more natural language (e.g., \[Ranta, 1998\]) can be stipulated for future versions.

Morphological Analyzer Architecture We adopt the general approach advocated by Karttunen \[1994\] and build the morphological analyzer as the combination of several finite state transducers some of which are constructed directly from the elicited information while others are constructed from the output of the machine learning stage.
