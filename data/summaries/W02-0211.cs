Otherwise, the language axioms use information about tense and aspect and default orderings relative to these to guide inferences about temporal relationships ((Kamp, 1993; Dowty, 1986; Partee, 1984; Webber, 1988) inter alia).

It passes propositions and a goal to the sentence-level realization module which uses templates to build the deep syntactic structures required by the RealPro realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) for generating a string that communicates the goal.

Two main extensions from that work that we are making use of are: 1) proofs falling below a user defined cost threshold halt the search 2) a simple variable typing system reduces the number of axioms written and the size of the search space (Hobbs et al., 1988, pg 102).

The domain axioms will bind the body variables to their most likely referents during unification with facts, and previously assumed and proven propositions similarly to (Hobbs et al., 1988).

Abductive inference has a long history in plan recognition, text understanding and discourse processing (Appelt and Pollack, 1992; Charniak, 1986; Hobbs et al., 1993; McRoy and Hirst, 1995; Lascarides and Asher, 1991; Rayner and Alshawi, 1992).
