1 Introduction
Chomsky proposed that language is handled by a language specilic faculty, but this proposition has not been verified, especially ill the area of lan guage acquisili(:)n.
Although Berwick\[1\] showed tile existence of a special nlechanisnl sulfirielfl for the learning of syntax, there is still a question of whether or not the Illecha.tllslB iS lleCessary, l?lll "therlnore, his model does not explain acquisition of setnantics or eoncepis.
These were simply presupposed.
We started froln a geimral k!arning mecha niSlll alld succeeded ill explainiug a constraint on language acquisition.
Children learldng their ill'st language face and solve a big prol)hun of induction.
They lind (:)lit \]lOW words &l'e ased all(\] )'elated Ic, other words from lilni(ed informal\[on at a surprisingly ra.pid rate.
Ill tim fieM of (leveli)pmental psychology, many kinds of constraints have been pro posed to accounl for this I>henonten(m.
Most of these constraints (:olne froln the view that as sunles a specific fl'anlework far language acquisi tion, but there is altother view: language as an extension of other intellectuaJ faculties, and its acquisition as one resnlt of the universal learning process that leads to (mr acquisition of intellect.
We want to explain the children's ability ill terms of tile latter view.
'\['hus, we make a machine learning systenl, Rhea, which arcepts n-luple illplltS elms\[sting of instances froln it.
donlains (one from each (IonlaJn) and creates the rules that delilnil the imssibh, torah\[nations.
This framework b, very ~;eeera\[, and yet i\[" we choose (mi(:,r wc.'lds and lingl, islic des('riplions for thetil as tWO input donlains, it can be seen as a language arquisilion system without language specific constraints.
In this paper, we describe lhe nm<'hine h,arnin~ syslenl Rhea an(l its applicali<n: to Ihe donlain of language artluisition.
We show \[hal with(m! a pri(ll'i inl~.Jrulatio(I almut how outer worlds an, or,~anized, Rhea can learn lhe "'set ting for new word.~ '~, which children con\['rc, ldillg flew w(lrds s(!elll t(I possess.
The imim is how the model aeqlfir~,~ and tormalizes the "meaning" of an expression.
To achiew, this aut(:mOrlmusly, Rhea has its own rep resenlati(m language for outer-worlds.
If one lin guistir expression is repeatedly given along wilh (tifli, renl otHer-worlds, it builds up one ('OmnlOtl r(,im~senlati(m tbr ;tl\] lhe (mt(,r-worlds.
This in |el'llal I'e\[H'eselll;llioll that has a Olle Io ()tie correspondence to a linguistic expressi(m is regar(led as the "meaning" of the expression iu our model.

Markntan's experiment shows thai even though they are liahle to consider thematic relations in dmnains other than language acquisition, children hearing a new word attend Io taxonomic relations.
This tendency is called the "setting for' new words".
It is /tot cleat', however, if such constraints are innate or not, or more essentially if they call he derived froln restri<`tioas thai ally intelligent system should observe.
One way to <`\]arify this point is to examine whether tit(, model that does not contain the constraint can acquire it during the learning process.
8 An
overview of Rhea 3.1 Rhea as a machine learning system Fig.1 illustrates Rhea's learning process in two dif\[erent domains, A and B.
The system's task is to find general rules that predict which instance from l)olltain A can at(pear with a certain instal'tee front B, and vice versa.
Rhea accepts as input a \[)air of instances i = (a,b).
One instance is fronl l)omain A an(1 the other front l)omain B.
One pair is given at a time.
Rhea is equipped with an internal representation language for each domain, D.4 and De, and has predelined methods to extend the reprosentation languages in case of nee(l.
Sindlarities, generalization operations and specialization operations are defined upon ea<,h language.
Rhea represents all input pair using these languages and their extensions, anti makes all internal l'et tresentation D(i) (1)A(a), De(b)}, which is a pab" of a representation of" I)olnain A instan(:e att(I that of a l)omaill H instance.
More tha.ll one possible internal representation may exist for one input, but the one found first is stored.
When represelltations are acctHlflulated, R hea is able to find out rules, h tirst sorts intert~al representations into classes based on similarities.
Classes nlay or may not overlap.
Then Rhea generalizes representations of' each ('lass.
This process of <`lassili('ation and generalizatiol~ is, done oil demand.
When a partial input, (an instan<`e frotn l)omain A) is given and its <`otlnterpart b (front l)o nmizl B) is to he predlcte(I, tilt, ntodel first (:las stiles the partial input isle a class N using tlt(' infol'nlalion about a, makes the gelmraLiz;ltion of l)omain |l part ttf all the other reltresentalions ill <'\]ass :',: and expects one of its spe('ializalions to he b's rt,presentalion l)B(b).
The nmdel \[ortns classes so that reF.resentalions in ea(:h (:lass share sortie characteristics.
Two internal representations, (l),t(a\]), l)h,(bj )) an(l (l)A(a;\])~ I)B(b2)), belong to ihe same class if DA(al) and DA(a2 ) are sinlilar in the trite+ rion defitmd in the representation language I) A.
and l)B(bl) an(l I)B(b2) are also sindlar it\] the erileri(m defined in D~j.
In the extreme t'ase, if l)A(al ) equals 1) 4( a2), then I)H( bl ) nlusl equal DMb2) and viee versa, which n,eans that when two instarlces frt:,nt Olle domain are represented as the same, instances from the other (lonlain that altpear with them l`tttlst also }lave the Sallte lilt el'l`( a.l ropresett t at ion.

7 Discussion
7.1 Semantic concepts and input Other acquisition models Ihal cover semantic acquisition are the syslem of Takagi el.
al. \[4\], which accepts a sentence and visual input, Hill's language acquisition tnodel\[5\] and Selfridge's CtlILI)\[@ llowever these models assunte semantic concepts front the slarl, and their task is to associate linguistic entities with thetrt.
These systems, which receive a sentantic COtlCel)l to be associated with a linguistic expression as direct input, c81111ol 'ntisundersland I he tncaning of a linguistic expres:slon and cannot she(l light Oil tilt> difficulty of learnirtg the meaning of a cer tain expression.
'~'Ve do llOt a~%Sl=lllle senlalltic £OIl(;epts in representing scenes given to Rhea.
We formalize concepts as filnctions fi'onl the direct input to FOAs.
They must |)e fi:)rnted and 1ested in ac corda.nee with expressions anti other concepts.
We eqltiptled the model with filter=priutitives, which are means ofeslal>lishing the concepts.
We have designed filler-i>ritnitives to I)ecome equivalents of human abilities of recognitlotl, l"ilterprintitives are given fi'onl the beginning I)ecause human beings have the abilily to focus 1heir attention Oil objects, attributes or changes when they begin language acquisilion.
Rhea can se+ loot a \[)arameler frolll scelles alld make coilcrete lilter-elentents just like any child coming 1o distinguish imtmrtanl features in its world.
There ft)re, our formalization of con(:et)ts and its acquisilioll process is a more realistic Olle.
7.2 Acquisition
of a constraint The principle of contrasl is deriw,d from the gen eral constraint on how a (:lass shouhl I)e fortned to make useful l)rediclions, and as shown in sec tion 6, Rhea has no language-specifh: constraints but yel can acquire tile "setting for new words", because its \[ilterq)rimitives and classification criteria can tel)reduce the tendency thai was contained in the input pairs.
Ill Ollt' experilllellt, the one-word SelltellCeS given to llhea were often laxononli(' terms or attributes of any oltjecls in the scene and Rhea learned thai the best conjecture is that the oneword sentence presented with unknown objects refers lo ;i taxonomJ(; ieri'll of the lltOSt frequently describe<l objecl.
If we give a label for the biggest oil jeer ill the SCell(! whelleyer llhea llleel~s a scefle with muhiple objects lhal are not yel laheled, Rhea will make a tiller of a cal.egory that sorts el)jeers I)y size and exlracls l.he \[irsl one.
Our claim is thai chihh'en can also acquire the "selting for the new words" fi'om a few inputs of olle-wor(t selllellces, ~lll(I thai it lleed llOl to I)e set a priori.
8 Conclusion
This paper ha+'+ described Rhea, the model of language aequisillou, which uses wwy general aC<luisition procedure.
We assume neither semantic concept..,+ nor syntacli(' rules a priori, lnsiead, we have equipped the model with the general franlework to create the rules thai delimit tilt, possible conlhinatious of the input.
We applied the model to the (Ic,1llaillS of Otlter-wt:q'l(Is alld linguistic descriplions of thent.
The svsleIll Silk'cessfully made concepts that are consistent with giwm inputs.
"\['he experinlenl showed that il reproduced the "setting for lhe new words," a human lendency in language acquisition, without language-specific constraints or inforntation aS(mr hmv ouler worhls are orgattized.
