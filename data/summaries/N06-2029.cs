It uses a statistical test to check whether the obtained TMÂ¢LM scores of one MT output are significantly higher than those of another MT output (Akiba et al., 2002).

For evaluation, we used the BLEU metrics, which calculates the geometric mean of n-gram precision for the MT outputs found in reference translations (Papineni et al., 2002).
