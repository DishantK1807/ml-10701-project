The highest performing systems include large numbers of handcoded rules, or patterns, such as VIE (Humphreys et al.1996), the UMass system (Fisher et al.1997) and Proteus (Grishman et al.1992), but lately a high performance has been obtained by the use of statistical methods.

The only exception is in (Wacholder et al, 1997) where the reported performance for the sole semantic disambiguation task of PNs is 79%.
A97-1030
A recent study (Palmer and Day, 1997) established that the baseline performances of the PN recognition task for several languages and application domains vary between 34% and 71%.

Unknown proper nouns are identified initially by the Brill part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995).

This is a reasonable restriction supported by empirical evidence (see also (Gale et al.1992)). An alternative solution would be to select the "best performing" tags, and then apply 288 • (1)ev idence (Cpn j) = ~, (pl(esl i (x, PNj)) * amb(esl i (x, PN~))) (~ esll EESL a,C(PNI)=Ct,,, j Epl(esli(x,PNj) esl i ~ESL ~,anyPN + E (pl (esl i (w, PNj)) * arab (esl i (x, PNj))) ~ eslj,~ESL a .C(PN j )=Cp./ Epl(esl i(w,PNj) eslj EESL s,anyPN Figure 1 The evidence(Cpnj) computation formula some WSD algorithm to predict the precise sense• in running texts.

The shallow parser (Basili et al.1994), extracts from the learning corpus elementary syntactic relations such as subject-object, noun-preposition-noun, etc.

For example, Ny.mble (Bikel et al.1997) learns names using a trained approach based on a variant of Hidden Markov Models.

The plausibility is a measure of the statistical evidence of a detected syntactic link (Basili et al, 1994b), that depends upon local (i.e.

However, the parser assigns to each detected esl a statistical measure of confidence, called plausibility (Basili et al.1994b). learning corpus that include PN_U as one of its arguments.
