Another kind of popular approaches to dealing with query translation based on corpus-based techniques uses a parallel corpus containing aligned sentences whose translation pairs are corresponding to each other (Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996).

For a query term which is unable to be translated, our idea is to translate it into a set of translation candidates in an intermediate language, and then seek for the most likely translation from the candidates, which are translated from the intermediate language into the target language (Gollins et al., 2001; Borin, 2000).

On the other hand, the alternative approach using comparable or unrelated text corpora were studied by Rapp (1999) and Fung et al.(1998). This task is more difficult due to lack of parallel correlation between document or sentence pairs.
