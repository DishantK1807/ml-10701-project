In particular, information extraction (IE) systems like those built in the DAI:tPA Message Understanding Conferences (Chinchor, 1998; Sundheim, 1995) have revealed that coreference resolution is such a critical component of IE systems that a separate coreference subtask has been defined and evaluated since MUC-6 (Committee, 1995).

To our knowledge, the work of (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ge et al., 1998; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) are the only ones that are based on learning from an annotated corpus.

Since the accuracy of coreference resolution relies on the correct identification of the candidate noun phrases, both (Aone and Bennett, 1995) and (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) only evaluated their systems on noun phrases that have been correctly identified.

Our named entity recognition module uses the HMM approach of (Bikel et al., 1999; Bikel et al., 1997), which learns from a tagged corpus of named entities.

Our part-of-speech tagger is a standard sta285 tistical bigram tagger based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Church, 1988).

Also, the evaluation of (Aone and Bennett, 1995) and (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) only focused on specific types of noun phrases (organizations and business entities), and (Aone and Bennett, 1995) dealt only with Japanese texts.

Ge et al.(Ge et al., 1998) used a statistical model for resolving pronouns.

As explained in (Fisher et al., 1995), the reason for this is that it only concentrated on coreference relationships among references to people and organizations.

Both the work of (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) employed decision tree learning.

Moreover, both (Aone and Bennett, 1995) and (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) made simplifying assumptions in their experimental evaluations.

However, the features they used include domain-specific ones like DNP-F (definite NP whose referent is a facility) (Aone and Bennett, 1995), JV-CHILD-i (does i refer to a joint venture formed as the result of a tie-up) (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), etc.

Among the work that reported quantitative evaluation results, most are not based on learning from an annotated corpus (Baldwin, 1997; Kameyama, 1997; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997).
