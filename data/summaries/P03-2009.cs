Some previous work has used prosody to solve this kind of problem (as with Stolcke 2000).

Without discourse chunks With discourse chunks 53.68% (1385/2604 utterances) 65.44% (1704/2604 utterances) Table 5.1: Overall accuracy for the CBR tagger To put these results in perspective, human performance has been estimated at about 84% (Stolcke 2000), since human taggers sometimes disagree about intentions, especially when speakers perform more than one dialogue act in the same utterance.

Much of the recent DA tagging work (using 18-25 tags) scores around the mid-fifty to mid-sixty percentiles in accuracy (see Stolcke 2000 for a review of similar work).

Theories about the structure of dialogue (for example, centering [Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein 1995], and more recently Dialogue Macrogame Theory [Mann 2002]) have not generally been applied to the DA tagging task.

Much of the work in DA tagging (Reithinger, 1997; Samuel, 2000; Stolcke et al.2000; Wright, 1998) uses lexical information (the words or ngrams in an utterance), and to a lesser extent syntactic and phonological information (as with prosody).
