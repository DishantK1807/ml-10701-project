1 Introduction
Multi-word expression extraction is an important component in language processing that aims to identify segments of input text where the syntactic structure and the semantics of a sequence of words (possibly not contiguous) are usually not compositional.
Idiomatic forms, support verbs, verbs with speci c particle or pre/post-position uses, morphological derivations via partial or full word duplications are some examples of multi-word expressions.
Further, expressions such as time-date expressions or proper nouns which can be described with simple (usually nite state) grammars, and whose internal structure is of no real importance to the overall analysis of the sentence, can also be considered under this heading.
Marking multi-word expressions in text usually reduces (though not signi cantly) the number of actual tokens that further processing modules use as input, although this reduction may depend on the domain the text comes from.
It can also reduce the multiplicative ambiguity as morphological interpretations of tokens are reduced when they are coalesced into multi-word expressions with usually a single interpretation.
Turkish presents some interesting issues for multiword expression processing as it makes substantial use of support verbs with lexicalized direct or oblique objects subject to various morphological constraints.
It also uses partial and full reduplication of forms of various parts-of-speech, across their whole domain to form what we call non-lexicalized collocations, where it is the duplication and contrast of certain morphological patterns that signal a collocation rather than the speci c root words used.
In this paper, we describe a multi-word expression processor for preprocessing Turkish text for various language engineering applications.
In the next section after a very short overview of relevant aspects of Turkish, we present a rather comprehensive description of the multi-word expressions we handle.
We then summarize the structure of the multi-word expression processor which employs a series of components for tokenization, morphological analysis, conservative non-statistical morphological disambiguation, and multi-word expression extraction.
We nally present results from runs over a large corpus and a small gold-standard corpus.
1.1 Related
Work Recent work on multi-word expression extraction, use three basic approaches: statistical, rule-based, and hybrid.
Statistical approaches require a corpus that contains signi cant numbers of occurrences of multi-word expressions.
But even if the corpus consists of millions of words, usually, the frequencies of multi-word expressions are too low for statistical extraction.
Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) indicate that two-thirds of verb-particle constructions occur at most three times in the overall corpus, meaning that any extraction method must be able to handle extremely sparse data.
They use a rulebased method to extract multi-word expressions in the form of a head verb and a single obligatory preposition employing a tagger augmented with an Second ACL Workshop on Multiword Expressions: Integrating Processing, July 2004, pp.
64-71 existing chunking system with which they rst identify the particle chunked and then turn back for the verb part of the construction.
Piao et al.(2003) employ their semantic eld annotator USAS, containing 37,000 words and a template list of 16,000 multi-word units, all constructed manually from various resources, in order to extract multi-word expressions.
The evaluation indicates a high precision (over 90%) but the estimated recall is about 40%.
Deeper investigation on the corpus has indicated that two-thirds of the multi-word expressions occur in the corpus once or twice, verifying the fact that the statistical methods ltering low frequencies would fail.
Urizar et al.(2000) describe a Basque terminology extraction system which covered multi-word term extraction as a subset.
As Basque is a highly in ected agglutinative language like Turkish, morphological information is exploited to better de ne multi-word patterns.
Their lemmatizer/tagger EUSLEM, consists of a tokenizer followed by two subsystems for the treatment of single word and multiword expressions, and a disambiguator.
The proposed term extraction tool uses the tagged input as the input of a shallow parsing phase which consists of regular expressions representing morphosyntactic patterns.
The nal step uses statistical measures to eliminate incorrect candidates.
The basic disadvantages of rule-based approaches are that they usually lack exibility, and it is a time-consuming and never ending process to try to cover a high percentage of the multi-word expressions in a language with rules and prede ned lists.
The LINGO group which de nes multi-word expressions as a pain in the neck for NLP (Sag et al., 2002), suggests hybrid approaches using rule based approaches to identify possible multi-word expressions out of a corpus and using statistical methods to enhance the results obtained.
2 Multi-word expressions in Turkish Turkish is an Ural-Altaic language, having agglutinative word structures with productive in ectional and derivational processes.
Most derivational phenomena take place within a word form, but there are certain derivations involving partial or full reduplications that are best considered under the notion of multi-word expressions.
Turkish word forms consist of morphemes concatenated to a root morpheme or to other morphemes, much like beads on a string.
Except for a very few exceptional cases, the surface realizations of the morphemes are conditioned by various morphophonemic processes such as vowel harmony, vowel and consonant elisions.
The morphotactics of word forms can be quite complex when multiple derivations are involved.
For instance, the derived modi er sa glamla‚st rd g m zdaki1 would be represented as:2 sa glam+Adj DB+Verb+Become DB+Verb+Caus+Pos DB+Adj+PastPart+P1sg DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+Pnon+Loc DB+Adj This word starts out with an adjective root and after ve derivations, ends up with the nal part-ofspeech adjective which determines its role in the sentence.
Turkish employs multi-word expressions in essentially four different forms: 1.
Lexicalized Collocations where all components of the collocations are xed, 2.
Semi-lexicalized Collocations where some components of the collocation are xed and some can vary via in ectional and derivational morphology processes and the (lexical) semantics of the collocation is not compositional, 3.
Non-lexicalized Collocations where the collocation is mediated by a morphosyntactic pattern of duplicated and/or contrasting components hence the name non-lexicalized, and 4.
Multi-word Named-entities which are multiword proper names for persons, organizations, places, etc.
2.1 Lexicalized
Collocations Under the notion of lexicalized collocations, we consider the usual xed multi-word expressions 1Literally, (the thing existing) at the time we caused (something) to become strong. Obviously this is not a word that one would use everyday.
Turkish words (excluding nonin ecting frequent words such as conjunctions, clitics, etc).
found in typical text average about 10 letters in length.
2Please refer to the list of morphological features given in Appendix A for the semantics of some of the non-obvious symbols used here.
whose resulting syntactic function and semantics are not readily predictable from the structure and the morphological properties of the constituents.
Here are some examples of the multi-word expressions that we consider under this grouping:3;4 (1) hi olmazsa hi (never)+Adverb ol(be)+Verb+Neg+Aor+Cond+A3sg hi _olmazsa+Adverb at least (literally if it never is ) (2) ipe sapa gelmez ip(rope)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Dat sap(handle)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Dat gel(come)+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg ipe_sapa_gelmez+Adj worthless (literally (he) does not come to rope and handle ) 2.2 Semi-lexicalized Collocations Multi-word expressions that are considered under this heading are compound and support verb formations where there are two or more lexical items the last of which is a verb or is a derivation involving a verb.
These are formed by a lexically adjacent, direct or oblique object, and a verb, which for the purposes of syntactic analysis, may be considered as single lexical item: e.g., sayg dur(literally to stand (in) respect to pay respect), kafay ye(literally to eat the head to get mentally deranged), etc.5 Even though the other components can themselves be in ected, they can be assumed to be xed for the purposes of the collocation, and the collocation assumes its morphosyntactic features from the last verb which itself may undergo any morphological derivation or in ection process.
For instance in (3) kafay yekafa(head)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Acc ye(eat)+Verb... 3In every group we rst list the morphological features of all the tokens, one on every line (with the glosses for the roots), and then provide the morphological features of the multi-word construct and then provide glosses and literal meanings.
4Please refer to the list of morphological features given in Appendix A for the semantics of some of the non-obvious symbols used here.
5Here we just show the roots of the verb with denoting the rest of the suf xes for any in ectional and derivational markers.
kafay _ye+Verb... get mentally deranged ( literally eat the head ) the rst part of the collocation, the accusative marked noun kafay, is the xed part and the part starting with the verb yeis the variable part which may be in ected and/or derived in myriads of ways.
For example the following are some possible forms of the collocation: kafay yedim I got mentally deranged kafay yiyeceklerdi they were about to get mentally deranged kafay yiyenler those who got mentally deranged kafay yedi gi the fact that (s/he) got mentally deranged Under certain circumstances, the xed part may actually vary in a rather controlled manner subject to certain morphosyntactic constraints, as in the idiomatic verb: (4) kafa(y ) ekkafa(head)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Acc ek(pull)+Verb... kafa_ ek+Verb... consume alcohol (but literally to pull the head ) (5) kafalar ekkafa+Noun+A3pl+Pnon+Acc ek+Verb... kafa_ ek+Verb... consume alcohol (but literally to pull the heads ) where the xed part can be in the nominative or the accusative case, and if it is in the accusative case, it may be marked plural, in which case the verb has to have some kind of plural agreement (i.e., rst, second or third person plural), but no possessive agreement markers are allowed.
In their simplest forms, it is suf cient to recognize a sequence of tokens one of whose morphological analyses matches the corresponding pattern, and then coalesce these into a single multi-word expression representation.
However, some or all variants of these and similar semi-lexicalized collocations present further complications brought about by the relative freeness of the constituent order in Turkish, and by the interaction of various clitics with such collocations.6 When such multi-word expressions are coalesced into a single morphological entity, the ambiguity in morphological interpretation is reduced as we see in the following example: (6) devam etti devam(continuation)+Noun+A3sg +Pnon+Nom *deva(therapy)+Noun+A3sg+P1sg+Nom et(make)+Verb+Pos+Past+A3sg *et(meat)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom DB+Verb+Past+A3sg devam_et+Verb+Pos+Past+A3sg (he) continued (literally made a continuation ) Here, when this semi-lexicalized collocation is recognized, other morphological interpretations of the components (marked with a * above) can safely be removed, contributing to overall morphological ambiguity reduction.
2.3 Non-lexicalized Collocations Turkish employs quite a number of non-lexicalized collocations where the sentential role of the collocation has (almost) nothing to do with the parts-ofspeech and the morphological features of the individual forms involved.
Almost all of these collocations involve partial or full duplications of the forms involved and can actually be viewed as morphological derivational processes mediated by reduplication across multiple tokens.
The morphological feature representations of such multi-word expressions follow one of the patterns: 1) ! ! 2) ! Z !, 3) ! +X ! +Y 4) !1 +X !2 +X where ! is the duplicated string comprising the root, its part-of-speech and possibly some additional morphological features encoded by any suf xes.
X and Y are further duplicated or contrasted morphological patterns and Z is a certain clitic token.
In 6The question and the emphasis clitics which are written as separate tokens, can occasionally intervene between the components of a semi-lexicalized collocation.
We omit the details of these due to space restrictions.
duplications of type 4, it is possible that !1 is different from !2.
Below we present list of the more interesting nonlexicalized expressions along with some examples and issues.
When a noun appears in duplicate following the rst pattern above, the collocation behaves like a manner adverb, modifying a verb usually to the right.
Although this pattern does not necessarily occur with every possible noun, it may occur with many (countable) nouns without much of a further semantic restriction.
Such a sequence has to be coalesced into a representation indicating this derivational process as we see below.
(7) ev ev (!
!) ev(house)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom ev+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom ev+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom DB+Adverb+By house by house (literally house house ) When an adjective appears in duplicate, the collocation behaves like a manner adverb (with the semantics of -ly adverbs in English), modifying a verb usually to the right.
Thus such a sequence has to be coalesced into a representation indicating this derivational process.
(8) yava‚s yava‚s (!
!) yava‚s(slow)+Adj yava‚s+Adj yava‚s+Adj DB+Adverb+Ly slowly (literally slow slow ) This kind of duplication can also occur when the adjective is a derived adjective as in (9) h zl h zl (!
!) h z(speed)+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom DB+Adj+With h z+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom DB+Adj+With h z+Noun+A3sg+Pnon+Nom DB+Adj+With DB+Adverb+Ly rapidly (literally with-speed with-speed ) Turkish has a fairly large set of onomatopoeic words which always appear in duplicate and function as manner adverbs.
The words by themselves have no other usage and literal meaning, and mildly resemble sounds produced by natural or arti cial objects.
In these cases, the root word almost always is reduplicated but need not be, but both words should be of the part-of-speech category +Dup that we use to mark such roots.
(10) har l hurul (!1 +X !2 +X ) har l+Dup hurul+Dup har l_hurul+Adverb+Resemble making rough noises (no literal meaning) Duplicated verbs with optative mood and third person singular agreement function as manner adverbs, indicating that another verb is executed in a manner indicated by the duplicated verb: (11) ko‚sa ko‚sa (!
!) ko‚s(run)+Verb+Pos+Opt+A3sg ko‚s(run)+Verb+Pos+Opt+A3sg ko‚s+Verb+Pos+ DB+Adverb+ByDoingSo by running (literally let him run let him run ) Duplicated verbs in aorist mood with third person agreement and rst positive then negative polarity, function as temporal adverbs with the semantics as soon as one has verbed (12) uyur uyumaz (!
+X ! +Y ) uyu+Verb+Pos+Aor+A3sg uyu+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg uyu+Verb+Pos+ DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs as soon as (he) sleeps ( literally (he) sleeps (he) does not sleep ) It should be noted that for most of the nonlexicalized collocations involving verbs (like (11) and (12) above), the verbal portion before the inectional marking mood can have additional derivational markers and all such markers have to duplicate.
(13) sa glamla‚st r r sa glamla‚st rmaz (!+X !+Y ) sa glam+Adj DB+Verb+Become DB+Verb+Caus DB+Verb+Pos+Aor+A3sg sa glam+Adj DB+Verb+Become DB+Verb+Caus DB+Verb+Neg+Aor+A3sg sa glam+Adj DB+Verb+Become+ DB+Verb+Caus+Pos DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs as soon as (he) forti es (causes to become strong) Another interesting point is that non-lexicalized collocations can interact with semi-lexicalized collocations since they both usually involve verbs.
For instance, when the verb of the semi-lexicalized collocation example in (5) is duplicated in the form of the non-lexicalized collocation in (12), we get (14) kafalar eker ekmez In this case, rst the non-lexicalized collocation has to be coalesced into (15) kafalar ek+Verb+Pos DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs and then the semi-lexicalized collocation kicks in, to give (16) kafa_ ek+Verb+Pos DB+Adverb+AsSoonAs ( as soon as (we/you/they) get drunk ) Finally, the following non-lexicalized collocation involving adjectival forms involving duplication and a question clitic is an example of the last type of non-lexicalized collocation.
(17) g zel mi g zel (!
Z !) g zel+Adj mi+Ques g zel+Adj g zel+Adj+Very very beautiful (literally beautiful (is it)? beautiful ) 2.4 Named-entities Another class of multi-word expressions that we process is the class of multi-word named-entities denoting persons, organizations and locations.
We essentially treat these just like the semi-lexicalized collocation discussed earlier, in that, when such named-entities are used in text, all but the last component are xed and the last component will usually undergo certain morphological processes demanded by the syntactic context as in Figure 1: The architecture of the multi-word expression extraction processor (18) T rkiye B y k Millet Meclisi’nde ....7 Here, the last component is case marked and this represents a case marking on the whole namedentity.
We package this as (19) T rkiye_B y k_Millet_Meclisi +Noun+Prop+A3sg+Pnon+Loc To recognize these named entities we use a rather simple approach employing a rather extensive database of person, organization and place names, developed in the context of a previous project, instead of using a more sophisticated named-entity extraction scheme.
3 The
Structure of the Multi-word Expression Processor Our multi-word expression processor is a multistage system as depicted in Figure 1.
The rst component is a standard tokenizer which splits input text into constituent tokens.
These then go into 7In the Turkish Grand National Assembly.
a wide-coverage morphological analyzer (Oflazer, 1994) implemented using Xerox nite state technology (Karttunen et al., 1997), which generates, for all tokens, all possible morphological analyses.
This module also performs unknown processing by postulating possible noun roots and then trying to parse the rest of a word as a sequence of possible Turkish suf xes.
The morphological analysis stage also performs a very conservative non-statistical morphological disambiguation to remove some very unlikely parses based on unambiguous contexts.
Figure 2 shows a sample Turkish text that comes out of morphological processing, about to go into multiword expression extraction.

The rst stage handles lexicalized collocations and multi-word named entities.
2. The second stage handles non-lexicalized collocations.
3. The third stage handles semi-lexicalized collocations.
The reason semi-lexicalized collocations are handled last, is that any duplicate verb formations have to be processed before compound verbs are combined with their lexicalized complements (cf.
examples (14) (16) above).
The output of the multi-word expression extraction processor for the relevant segments in Figure 2 is given in Figure 3.
The multi-word expression extraction processor has been implemented in Perl.
The rule bases for the three stages are maintained separately and then compiled of ine into regular expressions which are then used by Perl at runtime.

4 Evaluation
To improve and evaluate our multi-word expression extraction processor, we used two corpora of news text.
We used a corpus of about 730,000 tokens to incrementally test and improve our semi-lexicalized rule base, by searching for compound verb formations, etc.
Once such rules were extracted, we tested our processor on this corpus, and on a small corpus of about 4200 words to measure precision and recall.
Table 2 provides some statistics on these corpora.
Table 3 shows the result of multi-word expression extraction on the large (training) corpus.
It should be noted that we only mark multi-word namedentities, not all.

When we consider all classes except named-entities, we have a recall of 60.1% and a precision of 100%.
An analysis of the errors and missed multi-word expressions indicates that the test corpus had a certain variant of a compound verb construction that we had failed to extract from the larger corpus we used for compiling rules.
Failing to extract the multi-word expressions for that compound verb accounted for most of the drop in recall.
Since we are currently using a rather naive named-entity extraction scheme,9 re8Since this is a very large corpus, we have no easy way of obtaining accurate precision and recall gures.
9As opposed to a general purpose statistical NE extractor that we have developed earlier (T r et al., 2003).
call is rather low as there are quite a number of foreign multi-word named-entities (persons and organizations mostly) that do not exist in our database of named-entities.
On the other hand, since namedentity extraction for English is a relatively mature technology, we can easily integrate an existing tool to improve our recall.
5 Conclusions
This paper has described a multi-word expression extraction system for Turkish for handling various types of multi-word expressions such as semilexicalized and non-lexicalized collocations which depend on the recognition of certain morphological patterns across tokens.
Our results indicate that with about 1100 rules (most of which were extracted from a large training corpus searching for patterns involving a certain small set of support verbs), we were able get almost 100% precision and around 60% recall on a small test corpus.
We expect that with additional rules from dictionaries and other sources we will improve recall signi cantly.
