Though we do not discuss the problem of determining semantic orientation, we assume availability of state-of-the-art methods that perform this task (Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006, etc.).

In contrast to sentiment classification, opinion extraction aims at producing richer information and requires an indepth analysis of opinions, which has only recently been attempted by a growing but still relatively small research community (Yi et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005, etc.).

Among various classifier induction algorithms for tree-structured data, in our experiments, we have so far examined Kudo and Matsumoto (2004)’s algorithm, packaged as a free software named BACT.

For example, Tateishi et al.(2004) implement five syntactic patterns and Popescu et al.(2005) use ten syntactic patterns.

Open-domain opinion extraction is another trend of research on opinion extraction, which aims to extract a wider range of opinions from such texts as newspaper articles (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wiebe et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006).

negative. This direction has been forming the mainstream of research on opinion-sensitive text processing (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002, etc.).

Kim and Hovy (2006) proposed a method for extracting opinion holders, topics and opinion words, in which they use semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to label opinion holders and topics.

An exception is the model reported by Kanayama et al.(2004), which uses a component of an existing MT system to identify the “aspect” argument of a given “evaluation” predicate.

Choi et al.(2006) address the task of extracting opinion entities and their relations, and incorporate syntactic features to their relation extraction model.

Most previous work on customer opinion extraction assumes the source of information to be customer reviews collected from customer review sites (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005).

For example, our previous paper (Kobayashi et al., 2005) addresses the task of extracting 〈Subject,Aspect,Evaluation〉.

The notion of Evaluation in our term has also been introduced by previous work (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Tateishi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2005, etc.).

In open-domain opinion extraction, some approaches use syntactic features obtained from parsed input sentences (Choi et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006), as is commonly done in semantic role labeling.

“the door” in the above example) and the related entity (“the room”) (Bunescu, 2003; Poesio et al., 2004).
