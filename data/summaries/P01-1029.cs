The fact that we pass through a (topological) phrase structure in order to relate dependency and word order distinguishes our approach from usual dependency grammars (Mel'cuk & Pertsov, 1987; Bröker, 1998; Kahane et al., 1998; Duchier & Debusmann, 2001).

It is possible to obtain a polynomial parser provided that we limit the number of nodes simultaneously involved in non-projective configurations (see Kahane et al.1998 for similar techniques).
