An important discourse feature of the dialogs is the degree of redundancy of the times mentioned (Walker 1996).

Busemann et al.(1997) also annotate temporal information in a corpus of scheduling dialogs.

Intercoder reliability was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistic (~¢) (Siegel & Castellan 1988, Carletta 1996).

Instead, the algorithm processes anaphoric references with respect to an Attentional State (Grosz & Sidner 1986) structured as a linear list of all times mentioned so far in the current dialog.

This prevents a number of the above errors and suggests that changes in tense, aspect, and modality are promising clues to explore for recognizing subdialogs in this kind of data (cf., e.g., Grosz & Sidner 1986; Nakhimovsky 1988).
J86-3001 J88-2004
A ~¢ value of 0.8 or greater indicates a high level of reliability among raters, with values between 0.67 and 0.8 indicating only moderate agreement (Hirschberg ~ Nakatani 1996; Carletta 1996).
J96-2004 P96-1038
Recently in the literature, Walker (1996) has argued for a more linear-recency based model of Attentional State (though not that discourse structure need not be recognized), while Rosd et al.(1995) argue for a more complex model of Attentional State than is represented in most current computational theories of discourse.

Although we found domain knowledge and taskspecific linguistic conventions most useful, we observed in the NMSU data some instances of potentially exploitable syntactic information to pursue in future work (Grosz et al.1995, Sidner 1979).
J95-2003
Rose et al.(1995), Alexandersson et al.(1997), and Busemann et al.(1997) describe other recent NLP systems that resolve temporal expressions in scheduling dialogs as part of their overall processing, but they do not give results of system performance on any temporal interpretation tasks.

As will be shown in the next section, very few errors can be attributed to the wrong entities being in focus due to not handling subdialogs or "multiple threads" (Ros6 et al.1995). 6 Global Focus The algorithm is conspicuously lacking in any mechanism for recognizing the global structure of the discourse, such as in Grosz ~ Sidner (1986), Mann & Thompson (1988), Allen & Perranlt (1980), and their descendants.

Although related, this problem is distinct from tense and aspect interpretation in discourse (as addressed in, e.g., Webber 1988, Song & Cohen 1991, Hwang & Schubert 1992, Lascarides et al.1992, and Kameyama et al.1993). Because the dialogs are centrally concerned with negotiating an interval of time in which to hold a meeting, our representations are geared toward such intervals.

As in much recent empirical work in discourse processing (e.g., Arhenberg et al.1995; Isard & Carletta 1995; Litman & Passonneau 1995; Moser & Moore 1995; Hirschberg & Nakatani 1996), we performed an intercoder reliability study investigating agreement in annotating the times.

The algorithm does not include a mechanism for handling global focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986), for centering within a discourse segment (Sidner 1979; Grosz et al.1995), or for performing tense and aspect interpretation.
