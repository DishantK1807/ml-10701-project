In recent years, many statistical solutions have been proposed: lexical associations (see (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)); error-driven transformation learning (see (Brill and Resnik, 1994), extensions by (Ye h and Vilain, 1998)); backedoff estimation (see (Collins and Brooks, 1995), extended to the multiple PP attachment problem by (Merlo et al., 1997)); loglinear model (see (Franz, 1996b), (Franz, 1996a, pp.

One reason is that the best reported disambiguation results for binary PP attachment ambiguities (84.5%, (Collins and Brooks, 1995); 88.0% using a semantic dictionary, (Stetina and Nagao, 1997)) are for English.

If there are more than three possible interpretations, standard techniques for reducing to several triples can be used (backed-off estimation, see for example (Katz, 1987), (Collins and Brooks, 1995)).

Experiments showed that it is a good strategy to prefer complement interpretations over adjunct interpretations, which are described in the following steps, s Attachment cases where prepositional objects as complements are involved are the easy ones for statistical disambiguation techniques (see for example (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)); in a hybrid system, one can expect such complement information to be in the lexicon, at least in part.

This is known as systematic ambiguity (or systematic indeterminacy, see (Hindle and Rooth, 1993, p.
