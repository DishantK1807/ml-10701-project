Like the Penn English Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004a; Miltsakaki et al., 2004b), the CDTB project adopts the general idea presented in (Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999; Webber et al., 2003) where discourse connectives are considered to be predicates that take abstract objects such as propositions, events and situations as their arguments.

This approach closely parallels the annotation of the the verbs in the English and Chinese Propbanks (Palmer et al., 2005; Xue and Palmer, 2003), where verbs are the anchors of predicate-argument structures.
