Dynamic programming is applied to bilingual sentence alignment in most of previous works (Brown et al., 1991; Gate and Church, 1993; Chen, 1993).

In the case of Japanese-English texts, the wordbased nlethod in Brown et al.(1991) inight be better than tile character-b~ed method in Gale and Church (1993).

2The term bead is taken from Brown et al.(1991). 3We basically use dictionary-based bilingual sentence alignment method originMly reported in Murao (1991).

What we adopt are simple co-occurrence-frequency-based techlfiques in Gale and Churcl, (1991) aaM Kay and lfiSscheisen (1993).

In order to inlprove the accuracy of sentence align inent, we need to combine our word-correspondencebased method with those length-based methods in Brown et al.(1991) and Gale and Church (1993).

For example, sentence alignment of bilingual texts are performed just by measuring sentence lengths in words or in characters (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993), or by statistically estimating word level correspondences (Chen, 1993; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).

Let w, and w~ be words in the texts S and T respectively, we define the following frequencies: freq(w~,,wt) = (frequency of wa and wt's co-occurring in a sentence head) f','eq(w,) = (frequency of 'w.~) freq(wt) = (frequency of wt) N (total number of sentence beads) Then, estimation functions of Gale's (Gale and Church, 1991 ) and Kay's (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993) are given a.s below.

So fitr, we have implemented the following,: sentence ~dignment btLsed-on word correspondence information, word correspondence estimation by cooccnl'rence-ffequency-based methods in GMe mid Church (19.~H) and Kay and R6scheisen (1993), structured Imttehlng of parallel sentences (Matsumoto et a l., 1993), and case Dame acquisition of Japanese verbs (Utsuro et al., 1993).

Structured bilingual or multilingual corpora serve as richer sonrces for extracting linguistic knowledge (Klavans and Tzonkermann, 1990; Sadler and Vendelmans, 1990; Kaji, Kida attd Morimoto, 1992; Utsuro, Matsnmoto and Nagao, 1992; Matsumoto, l.shimoto and Utsuro, 1993; Utsuro, Matsumoto and Nagao, 1993).

Then, those structurally matched parallel sentences are used as a source for acquiring lexical knowledge snch as verbal case frames (Utsuro et al., 1992; Utsuro et al., 1993).
