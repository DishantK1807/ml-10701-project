(Clarke et al., 2001; Prager et al.2004b)) employ redundancy as a significant feature of operation: if the same answer appears multiple times in an internal top-n list, whether from multiple sources or multiple algorithms/agents, it is given a confidence boost, which will affect whether and how it gets returned to the end-user.

We have demonstrated elsewhere (Prager et al.2004b) how using multiple corpora can improve QA performance, but in this paper we achieve similar goals without using additional corpora.
P04-1073
The LCC system (Moldovan & Rus, 2001) uses a Logic Prover to establish the connection between a candidate answer passage and the question.
P01-1052
(Brill, 2002), answer types in QA systems typically correspond to the types identifiable by their named-entity recognizer (NER).
W02-1033
ANSWER SELECTION modules typically work either by trying to prove the answer is correct (Moldovan & Rus, 2001) or by giving them a weight produced by summing a collection of heuristic features (Radev et al., 2000); in the latter case candidates having a larger number of matching query terms, even if they do not exactly match the context in the question, might generate a larger score than a correct passage with fewer matching terms.

The work here is a continuation of previous work described in (Prager et al.2004a,b).
P04-1073
As reported in (Prager et al.2004a), an estimated 79% of the questions in TREC question sets can be inverted meaningfully.
P04-1073
It has long been known in IR that stemming or lemmatization is required for successful term matching, and in NLP applications such as QA, resources such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) are employed for checking synonym and hypernym relationships; Extended WordNet (Moldovan & Novischi, 2002) has been used to establish lexical chains between terms.
C02-1167
More examples of this problem were given in (Prager et al.2004a). Moriceau (2006) reports a system that addresses part of this problem by trying to rationalize different but “similar” answers to the user, but does not extend to a general-purpose equivalence identifier.
P04-1073 W06-1808
The first such systems were natural-language interfaces to expert systems, e.g., SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972), or to databases, e.g., LIFER/LADDER (Hendrix et al.1977). CHAT-80 (Warren & Pereira, 1982), for instance, was a DCG-based NL-query system about world geography, entirely in Prolog.
