Expression (1) calculates the score between two neighboring letters; UK(i) = E E M~(wj,wi+d;d ) x,q(d) (1) d=l j-=i--(d--1) where wl as an eveN;, d as the distance between two eveN;s, dmax as the maximum distance used in the processing (we set drnax -~ 5), and g(d) as the weight fimction on distance (for this system g(d) = d-2(Sano et al., 1996), to decrease tile influence of tile d-bigrams when the distance get longer (Church and Hanks, 1989)).

Sequence Extraction Nobesawa et a1.(1996; 1999) proposed a system which estimates the likelihood of a string of letters be a meaningfifl block in a sentence.
C96-2099
Our system introduces the linking score, which indicates the likelihood that two letters are neighboring as a (part of) meaningful string(Nobesawa et al., 1996).

Ananiadou(1994) proposed a methodology based on term recognition using morphological rules.
