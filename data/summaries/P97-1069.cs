Other related results to be reported in the future include: (i) an extension o\[ the polynomial parsing algorithm of (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1990) for CCG-Std to CCG-GTRC (Komagata, 1997), (ii) application to a Japanese parser which is capable of handling non-traditional constituents and information structure (roughly, topic/focus structure).
P90-1001
For example, a grammar involving (T\z)/(T\v) can generate a language A"B"C"D"E" which CCG-Std cannot (Hoffman, 1993).
P93-1045
The following order-preserving constraint, which follows more primitive directionality features (Steedman, 1991), limits the directions of the slashes in GTRCs.
P91-1010
IOur lexieal rules to introduce type raising are non-recursive and thus do not suffer from the problem of the overgeneration discussed in (Carpenter, 1991).
J91-3003
But CCG-Std cannot handle the generalization of type raising that has been used in accounting for various linguistic phenomena including: coordination and extraction (Steedman, 1985; Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1996), prosody (Prevost and Steedman, 1993), and quantifier scope (Park, 1995).
