The hypernyms used to label the internal nodes of that hierarchy are chosen in a simple fashion; pattern-matching as in Hearst (1992) is used to identify candidate hypernyms of the words dominated by a particular node, and a simple voting scheme selects the hypernyms to be used.
C92-2082
Hearst (1992) found individual pairs of hypernyms and hyponyms from text using pattern-matching techniques.

P99-1016
We chose three clusters produced by a program similar to Roark and Charniak (1998) except that it is based on a generative probability model and tries to classify all nouns rather than just those in pre-selected clusters.
P98-2182
In Caraballo (1999), we construct a hierarchy of nouns, including hypernym relations.

(See, e.g., Riloff and Shepherd (1997), Roark and Charniak (1998), Carahallo (1999), and Berland and Charniak (1999)).

See Caraballo (1999) for a detailed description of a method to construct such a hierarchy.
