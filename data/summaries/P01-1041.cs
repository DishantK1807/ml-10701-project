Several statistical methods have been reported in the literature (Bikel et al., 1999; Borthwick, 1999; Sekine et al., 1998; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000).
C00-2102 C00-2167 W98-1120
IREX (Information Retrieval and Extraction Exercise, (Sekine and Eriguchi, 2000; IRE, 1999)) was held in 1999, and fifteen systems participated in the formal run of the Japanese NE excercise.
C00-2167
Cowie (1995) interprets a decision tree deterministically and uses heuristic rewriting rules to get consistent results.
M95-1013
Brill’s rule generation method (Brill, 2000) is not used for NE tasks, but it might be useful.
W00-1301
Sekine’s system (1998) is similar to the above ME systems, but C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) is used instead.
W98-1120
Recently, unsupervised or minimally supervised models have been proposed (Collins and Singer, 2000; Utsuro and Sassano, 2000).
C00-2102
Gallippi. 1996.
C96-1072
Gallippi (1996) employs hundreds of hand-crafted templates as features for decision tree learning.
