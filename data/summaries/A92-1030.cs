These operations keep track of the derivational history and update attributes stated in form of feature structures as defined in the framework of unification-based tree-adjoining grammar \[Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988\].

The parser uses the following two-pass parsing strategy (originally defined for lexicalized grammars \[Schabes et al., 1988\]) which improves its performance in practice \[Schabes and Joshi, 1990\]: • In the first step the parser will select, the set of structures corresponding to each word in the sentence.

Our next developments effort will be concerned with introducing parallelism in the interface (actors), adding new features like an undo mechanism (using the Item list data structure proposed by Dannenberg \[1990\]), and extending XTAG for handling meta-rules \[Becker, 1990\] and Synchronous TAGs \[Shieber and Schabes, 1990b\] which are used for the purpose of automatic translation \[Abeill~ et ai., 1990b\] and semantic interpretation \[Shieber and Schabes, 1990a; Shieber and Schabes, 1991\].

As is shown in Figure 3, the tree display module handles the bracketed display of feature structures (in unification-based TAG, each node is associated two feature structures: top and bottom, see Vijay-Shanker and Joshi \[1988\] for more details).

XTAG provides all the utilities required for designing a lexicalized TAG structured as in Schabes et al.\[1988\]. All the syntactic concepts of lexicalized TAG (such as the grouping of the trees in tree families which represents the possible variants on a basic subcategorization frame) are accessible through mouse-sensitive items.

• Morphological lexicons for English \[Karp et al., 1992\] • A tree-adjoining grammar for English that covers a large range of linguistic phenomena.
C92-3145
The morphological lexicons for English \[Karp el al., 1992\] were built with PC-KIMMO's implementation of two-level morphology \[Antworth, 1990\] and with the 1979 edition of Collins English Dictionary.

2The TAG derivation tree is the basis for semantic interpretation \[Shieber and Schabes, 1990b\], generation \[Shieber and Schabes, 1991\] and machine translation \[Abeill~ et al., 1990b\] since the information given in this data-structure is richer than the one found in the derived tree.

Skeletons of such workbenches have been previously realized on Symbolics machines \[Schabes, 1989; Schifferer, 1988\].

Tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) \[Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985; Joshi, 1987\] and its lexicalized variant \[Schabes et al., 1988; Schabes, 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1991\] are tree-rewriting systems in which the syntactic properties of words are encoded as tree structured-objects of extended size.
