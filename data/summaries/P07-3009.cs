Examples include Markov decompositions in M3N (Taskar et al., 2006) and dependency-based factorization for MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005).

This intuition has spurred a growing interest of related research in the machine learning community, which in turn has led to improved results in a wide range of applications in NLP, including sequence labeling (Lafferty et al., 2001; Taskar et al., 2006), constituent and dependency parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2002; McDonald et al., 2005), and logical form extraction (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005).

Two broad categories of solutions to this problem have been common in literature, both of which rely on the structure of the domain: • Subset selection: instead of working with the complete range of outputs, only an “interesting” subset is used, for instance by repeatedly finding the most violated constraints (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) or by using N-best search (McDonald et al., 2005).

Our system can be seen as a unification of the two best-performing parsers presented at the CoNLL-X Shared Task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).

A similar model was previously used by McDonald et al.(2005), with the difference that we here represent the parse tree as a sequence of actions in the incremental algorithm rather than using the dependency links directly.
