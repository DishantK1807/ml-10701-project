This value of !1 is transferred to the expression s:evory(X,li,S) by partial execution (Pereira Shieber, 1987; Steedman, 1990; Park, 1992).

While there are undoubted differences in degree of availability among readings dependent upon semantics or discourse preference (Bunt, 1985; Moran, 1988), we will focus on all-or-none structural possibilities afforded by competence grammar.

Hobbs & Shieber (1987) show that among these, the reading in which two representatives outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes three companies is not available from the sentence.

And there are computational approaches that screen unavailable and/or redundant semantic forms (Hobbs Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991).

One is to use elementary categories, such as np or s, in encoding both syntactic types and logical forms (Jowsey, 1990; Steedman, 1990; Park, 1992).

The other is to associate the entire lexical category with a higher-order expression (Kulick, 1995).

Quantifying-in is a technique originally introduced to produce appropriate semantic forms for de re interpretations of NPs inside opaque operators 1 For instance, the result would transfer to Synchronous "I~ee Adjoining Grammar (Shieber & Schabes, 1990) without much change.

This is exactly predicted by the present CCG framework, extending Geach's observation regarding (6) (a), since the coordination forces the two NPs, most customers and three cars, to be composed first (Dowty, 1988; Steedman 1990; Park 1992).

A related example is (b), where in one reading a referential NP a company arguably outscopes most samples which in turn outscopes every representative (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987).
