Many data-driven techniques have been proposed for letter-to-phoneme conversion systems, including pronunciation by analogy (Marchand and Damper, 2000), constraint satisfaction (Van Den Bosch and Canisius, 2006), Hidden Markov Model (Taylor, 2005), decision trees (Black et al., 1998), and neural networks (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987).

Conversely, a method like pronunciation by analogy (PbA) (Marchand and Damper, 2000) is considered a global prediction method: predicted phoneme sequences are considered as a whole.
