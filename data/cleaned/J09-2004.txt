Here, under the table seems to refer to a location, and it is from that expresses the

Third, we may see differences in the local interpretation of a PP and the same PP
in a wider context. One popular example is the verb put, where both a static and a

Finally, we see a variation in how different languages express locatives. Some
languages have rich case systems, whereas others use adpositions to express locatives.
ThefocusofthisarticleislocativeprepositionsinNorwegianandEnglish.Wewillnot
consider locative case systems here, but we will see differences in which locatives are
lexicalized as prepositions, as shown in Example (15), where the Norwegian locative
derfraisalexicalizationofthecorrespondingEnglishcomplexPPfromthere.

Our goal in this article consists of three parts. First, we take recent developments
within formal semantic approaches to locatives (in particular Kracht 2002) and show
howthesecanbeimplementedinMinimalRecursionSemantics(MRS;Copestakeetal.
2005),aﬂatandcomputationallytractablesemanticmeta-languageforﬁrst-orderlogic.
Second, we determine the degree to which the insights from this particular approach
tolocativescanbeimplementedinanon-transformational,uniﬁcation-basedcomputa-
tionalgrammarbasedonHPSG(PollardandSag1994).Andthird,weinvestigatewhat
consequences the current analysis has for syntax and the syntax–semantics interface.
Our implementation is of a fragment of Norwegian. Norwegian is in many respects
similartoEnglish,andwheretheyaresimilarwewilluseexamplesfromEnglish.There
are also some interesting differences, and we will use them to illustrate how the new
representations can be exploited in an experimental semantic transfer-based machine
translation system, like the LOGON system (Oepen et al. 2004), which uses transfer
representationsbasedonMRS.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we consider various
approaches to locatives, before we describe the formal semantic approach proposed
by Kracht (2002) and introduce MRS in Section 3. In Section 4, we start to present our
own solution to how these two approaches can be combined. We proceed to classify
Norwegianlocativeadverbsandprepositionsandshowhowvariousconstructionscan
be handled in Section 5. In Section 6, we describe the main results from our imple-
mentation of a grammar producing the intended Kracht-style MRS representations. In
Section 7, we argue that the current analysis is useful for a range of NLP applications,
and sketch how it can be applied in a machine translation system. Finally we compare
ourapproachtoothercomputationalapproachesinSection8,discussevaluationofthe
analysisinSection9,andconcludeinSection10.

There is a growing literature on language and space, but not all of it is relevant for
ourpurposes.Weareinterestedinhowlocativesshouldbehandledinacomputational

Q3. Howisthedistinctionbetweenstaticanddirectionallocativeshandled?

A prominent question in the literature on locative prepositions is the geometric
structureofparticularprepositions:forexample,whatgeometricrelationshipbetween
the ball and the cup has to be realized for an expression like theballisinthecupto be
true(e.g.,Herskovits1986)?Asinterestingasthesequestionsare,wethinktheybelong
tothelexiconandthelexicalsemanticdomainandfalloutsidethescopeofthisarticle.
There isalso interesting work which relatesthemeaningofindividualprepositionstovar-
ioustypesofpsychologicalstudies;inparticular,studiesofunderwhichconditionsthe
variousprepositionsareused(see,e.g.,manyofthereferencesinBloometal.[1996]and
invanderZeeandSlack[2003]).Butagainthisplaysacomplementaryroletoourwork.
One particular question in the lexical semantics of prepositions is the distinction
between what Zwarts and Winter (2000), following Herskovits (1986), call projective
and non-projective prepositions. A non-projective preposition, like outside,requires
onlyspatialknowledgeofthelocationofthetwoobjects,whileaprojectivepreposition,
likebehind,requiressomefurtherinformationaboutdirectionsfromthereferenceobject.
Levinson (1996) makes a further distinction between three types of reference frames
called (i) intrinsic, where behind the house means on the other side of the house than
whatwouldbeclassiﬁedasthefrontsideofthehouse,(ii)extrinsic,wherebehindthehouse
is on the opposite side of the house than the speaker, and (iii) absolute, which applies
to expressions likenorthofthehouse. We also think that these distinctions belong to the
lexicalsemanticdomain.
2.2Hjelmslev’sTheoryofCases
OneoftheearliestcontributionstothestudyoflocativesisHjelmslev’s(1935)theoryof
cases. Hjelmslev views case as a relation between two objects (Q1 above), which may
be nominal or verbal (Q1/Q2). Cases may be either complements or modiﬁers (Q2),
and are expressed through adpositions or inﬂections. These observations are based on
data from a wide range of languages, including languages with locative case systems,
suchasHungarianandtheCaucasianlanguageTabasaran.Hjelmslevproposesathree-
dimensionalcasesystem(Q3),wherethedimensionsexpressdirectionality,coherence,
and subjectivity. The directional dimension consists of approach, neutrality, and sep-
232
JørgensenandLønning MinimalRecursionSemanticAnalysisofLocatives
aration. The coherence dimension has two interpretations, inherence (enclosure) and
adherence (contact). And ﬁnally, the subjectivity dimension describes the dependence
relationbetweenthepointofviewandthelocation, beingeithersubjective,objective,
or neutral. For example, whereas behind or left of is dependent on the point of view,
underisnot,accordingtoHjelmslev.
Hjelmslev’stheoryofcasesrelatestoallthreequestions,andithasformedthebasis
of much of the later work done on locatives. Even though we will focus on languages
where locatives are expressed by prepositions in adpositions, and ignore languages
where locatives are expressed through inﬂectional case, it is a point for us to base our
approachonformalismsthatalsoextendtolanguageswherelocativesareexpressedby
case. When it comes to the dimensions, directionality is particularly important for the
questionsweraisedintheintroduction,whilethelattertwodimensionsrelatetolexical
semantics,whichwewillnotpursuehere.
2.3Bierwisch’sGrammarofLocatives
Bierwisch(1988)givesadetailedaccountofbothsyntacticandsemanticaspectsofloca-
tive prepositions in German, and is particularly interested in the relationship between
the denotation of locatives (Q1) and the consequences for the syntactic treatment of
locatives (Q2). Bierwisch notes that locative PPs serve as predicates (Example (16)),
arguments(Example(17)),andmodiﬁcationaladjuncts(Examples(18)–(19))(examples
takenfrom[1988,page5];ourtranslations).

Bierwisch notes that even though predication, complementation, and modiﬁcation
are clearly distinct syntactic relations, distinguishing between locatives as adverbial or
optionalcomplementsisinmanycasesarbitrary(Q2).Bierwischarguesthatdirection-
ality is a syntactic feature, ±DIR, on locatives. But as we shall see, a more complex in-
ventoryofsyntacticfeaturescorrespondingtodifferenttypesofdirectionalityisneeded.
Bierwisch (1988) discusses two different positions with respect to the denotations
oflocativePPs(Q1):Thereferentialinterpretation,wherelocativePPsdenoteregions,
just like NPs denote things, and the modiﬁcational interpretation, where the locative
PPsdenotepropertiesofbeinglocatedatacertainplace:
ThereferentialinterpretationseemstobeappropriateforPPsinargumentposition,

introublewithPPsinargumentposition.Fromthis,onemightbetemptedtodrawthe
conclusionthatbothinterpretationsarepartiallyrightandthattheybothareneeded.
(Bierwisch1988,page8)
We will not discuss predicatives in this article, but refer to Kracht (2002) for treatment
of adnominal locatives as a property of individuals. The duality with respect to the
interpretationoflocativesasreferentialormodiﬁcationaliscentraltoourarticle,andwe
willshow,buildingonKracht,howthiscanbehandledinacomputationalgrammar.
2.4Jackendoff’sConceptualSemantics
Ray Jackendoff’s (1983, 1990) conceptual semantics is a decompositional theory of
meaning, heavily inﬂuenced by X-bar theory. Conceptual semantics organizes a reper-
toire of major conceptual categories, the semantic parts of speech, into function–
argument structures. Lexical entries are encoded as Lexical Conceptual Structures
(LCSs), as exempliﬁed by the entry for the preposition in in (Example (20)), where
we ﬁnd the lexeme, the part-of-speech category, the selectional restriction, and the
semanticsonfourseparatelines.
Particularly interesting in our context is the semantic analysis of static and direc-
tional locatives (Q1/Q3), and how they combine with verbs (Q2). The LCSs of static
locatives are claimed to have one layer, a Place function (Example (20)), as opposed
to the LCS of directional locatives, which have two layers, a Path function as the
outerfunction,andaPlacefunctionastheinnerfunction(Example(21)).Accordingto
Jackendoff,thereareﬁvedifferentPathfunctions:TO,FROM,TOWARD,AWAY-FROM,
andVIA.ThesemapfromaPlacetoaPath.

Furthermore, Jackendoff (1990, page 45) treats directional locatives as arguments to
motion verbs, such that, for example, run subcategorizes for an optional directional
locative argument (Q2), where the optionality is represented with angle brackets, note
the LCS for run given in Example (22). In the analysis of Example (23) the optional PP
argument of run is coindexed with the PP into the room. Through co-indexing (j)this
results in the conceptual structure in Example (24), where the path denoted by the PP
enters into the function GO(subjectentity,path) and thereby expresses the traversing of
thepath.Byconvention,theentityindexediistakentobethesubjectposition.

Jackendoff’sdescriptionclearlyshowsthatmattersaremorecomplexthantheusual
static/directional distinction. First, he introduces a ﬁner classiﬁcation between the dif-
ferentdirectionals.Second,heproposestherebeacommoncore,theplace,todifferent
prepositions(e.g.,inandinto)andtothedifferentusesofapreposition(e.g.,theplace-
useandtheTO-andVIA-usesofunder).Bothobservationswillbepartofouranalysis.
But there are several problems with Jackendoff’s approach. First, one will have to
specify for any verb which can be modiﬁed by a directional PP, that the modiﬁer is an
optional part of the verb’s semantics (or LCS). Because one and the same verb (e.g.,
run) can be combined with several directional PPs at the same time, as in Example (6),
onewouldneedawaytocombinethesemanticsofthedifferentlocativePPs.Whether
this should be done by merging the directionals into a single path, or by accepting
multiple PP complements, is unclear in Jackendoff’s theory. We believe incorporating
the optional modiﬁer’s semantics into the verb’s lexical entry leads to a very elaborate
andinﬂexiblesemantics,andwouldprefertoavoidthis,ifpossible.
The second, and more serious, weakness is that static and directional locatives
are treated differently in the syntax. Static locatives are regarded as adjuncts, whereas
directional locatives are regarded as complements of motion verbs. Unless there is
provided syntactic evidence for this distinction, this violates the autonomy of syntax,
as the semantics of the construction (whether it is the event or its participants being
located) governs the syntactic analysis (whether the construction is analyzed as an
adjunct or a complement). There are of course different syntactic restrictions on what
kindofverbsstaticanddirectionalPPscanmodify,butthisappliestomanymodifying
PPs, and is not in itself sufﬁcient to warrant different syntactic analyses. We believe
thatauniformtreatmentoflocatives,givingthesamesyntacticanalysisindependentof
directionality,wouldprovideamoresoundandconsistentanalysis.
2.5Fong’sDirectionalsasDiphasicEvents
Fong(1997) analyzes directional locatives. Shefocusesonthelocative cases ofFinnish,
but includes comparisons to other languages, including English. Her main focus of
interest is on how directional locative case in Finnish and directional prepositions in
English can be used when there is no movement involved. In Finnish one uses expres-
sionswhichliterallywhentranslatedintoEnglishwouldbecomeforgotmywalletintomy
car, and in English we have formulations like abridgefromBudatoPest. Whereas other
approachestakethespatialuseasbasic,andconsiderthemoreabstractusesasderived,
Fong takes the opposite stand. The locative case is not in itself about paths. It has a
moreabstractmeaning,andcanbeusedwhenthereisanunderlyingordereddomain,
togetherwithapropositionchangingtruthvalue,eitherfromfalsetotrueorfromtrue
to false along the ordering. This abstract structure can be mapped to a more concrete
structure,includingspaceinEnglish,andspaceortimeinFinnish.ThusinExample(25)
there is an ordering in space such that Example (26) is false at the beginning of this
ordering,andtruetowardstheendoftheordering.

ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
Kracht (2002) compares his approach to Fong’s. One problem is that Fong’s ap-
proach does not extend to the VIA-reading (in Jackendoff’s terminology) of sentences
like Example (3). From our point of view, it is also a point that she does not describe a
compositionalanalysis.Alsoourfocusinthisarticleisstrictlyonthespatialreadingsof
thelocatives.
2.6Zwarts’sVectorSpaceSemantics
In a series of papers, Zwarts (1997, 2003a, 2003b, 2005; Zwarts and Winter 2000) has
developed a semantics for locatives based on vectors. A main motivation for this pro-
posalistheobservationthatlocativesmaybemodiﬁedbyphrasesexpressingdistance
or direction; for example, a measure phrase (ten meters), an adverb( diagonally), or a
dimensionaladjective(far),asseeninExample(27).
(27) Supermanisfar/diagonally/tenmetersabovethebuilding.
Manyapproachestolocativeswillconsiderabovethebuildingtodenotearegionandlet
this be a set of points. It is then not obvious how the modiﬁer ten meters can apply to
this region. Zwarts and Winter (2000) propose instead to let the locative PP denote a
setofvectors(Q1).Vectorsaredirectedlinesegmentsbetweenpointsinspace.Loosely
speaking, we may say thatabovethebuildingdenotes the set of vertical vectors starting
in the building and ending above it. By then letting ten meters denote the vectors
having a length of ten meters, the modiﬁcation can be considered set intersection,
and the result are all vectors of length ten meters starting in the building and ending
verticallyaboveit.Syntactically,ZwartsandWinterconsiderlocativestobemodifying
adjuncts. They mainly consider how nouns are modiﬁed. Because nouns denote sets
of individuals, and locatives denote sets of vectors, they assume a primitive semantic
functionlocwhich maps individuals to their regions as sets of points (or vectors). This
is used for the landmark (e.g., the building in the locative PP above the building). When
a locative modiﬁes a noun, the inverse function is used, such that the set of vectors
is turned into the set of objects which are located within the set of (endpoints of) the
vectors.
Even though this approach seems to solve the semantic problem of this particular
type of construction, we are not sure how general it can be made. The compositional
analysis of Zwarts and Winter (2000) is applied to modiﬁcation of nouns and to pred-
icative uses of locatives; they do not consider verbal modiﬁcation. We can see how the
approach can be adopted to verbal modiﬁcation of static locatives in an event based
framework by introducing a function loc e, mapping events to regions, but we do not
seehowitextendstodirectionallocatives.Inlaterarticles,Zwarts(2003b,2005)extend
the approach to the directional PPs. A directional PP does not denote a set of vectors,
butasetofpaths.Apathcanbeconsideredasequenceofvectors.Forexample,inJohn

a compositional treatment that static PPs and directional PPs are ascribed denotations
of different types, unless they are also given different syntactic analyses (cf.discussion
onJackendoffinSection2.4).

2.7Kracht’sTwo-LayeredLocatives
In Kracht (2002), a novel approach to the semantics of locatives is described. Kracht
presentsasolutiontoBierwisch’s(1988)problemofthedualityoflocatives,byclaiming
that locatives consist of two layers (Q1/Q2). The lower layer, called a localizer phrase
(LP), deﬁnes a region or location, while the higher layer, called a modalizer phrase
(MP),deﬁneseventsofmotionwithrespecttothisregion(Q1).
Both from a semantic and syntactic point of view, Kracht claims a locative expres-
sionisstructuredas[

LP
LNP]].Here,LisalocalizerwhichtogetherwiththeNP

is motivated on the one hand by the dualistic nature of locative semantics, and on the
other hand by syntactic and morphological data. Locatives are realized differently in
differentlanguages.Somelanguagesusepre-orpostpositions,whereasotherlanguages
uselocativecase.Inparticular,caselanguageslikeFinnish,Hungarian,andTsezrealize

Kracht also claims that LPsonlyoccur inrestricted contexts, forexample, asacomple-
mentselectedbyaverborapreposition.TheLPdenotesalocation,andtheheadofan
LPisalocalizerfunction,whichdeﬁnesalocationinrelationtoitscomplement.
Furthermore, Kracht claims that verbs may select a PP complement of a certain
mode syntactically, but only interact with the LP semantically. In other words, the
verbtakes a location as the semantic argument. This is explained in more detail by
Kracht (2006). The principle governing this particular verb–PP interaction is called the
Emptiness Principle (where X corresponds to a preposition, and C to a PP for our
purposes):
EmptinessPrinciple.SupposethatXisasyntacticmarkerintheconstituentC.
SupposefurtherthatthepresenceofXinCisdeterminedpurelybynon-semantic
rules(forexampleselection,agreement,Sandhi).ThenthemeaningofXisempty,
namelytheidentityfunction.(Kracht2002,page204)
Thus, we end up with a theory that explains both the dualistic nature of prepositions
semantically,andhowthetwo-layeringinteractswiththesyntax.
2.8Summary
In this section, we have looked at several theories on locatives. These theories each
haveadifferentfocusanddifferentgoals.Returningtoourinitialquestions,weseethat
both Kracht (2002) and Jackendoff (1990) preserve the two-layered nature of locatives.
But where Kracht’s solution allow directional locatives to be modiﬁcational adjuncts,
Jackendoff is committed to treating directionals as referential complements of motion
verbs.Furthermore,Fong’s(1997)diphasiceventsareinsufﬁcienttocapturethenature
of Kracht’s transitory and approximative modes. In addition, neither Jackendoff nor
Fong provides a formalized compositional semantics to the same extent as Kracht.
Furthermore, we ﬁnd Kracht’s approach to be of greater cross-linguistic validity, and
portingtheanalysistolanguageswithlocativecaseoramixofcaseandprepositionsis
thereforepossible.Forthesereasons,wehavechosenKracht’sproposalasthebasisfor

we will do here is to present Kracht’s formal ontology and semantics for the locatives

ambition is not to give full-ﬂedged analyses of sentences containing locatives; he only

To describe the semantics formally, Kracht uses a typed lambda calculus with the

likeExample(34)sayssomethingabouttherelationshipbetweentheregionwhereKim
is driving and the region within the city of Paris. To achieve this, Kracht assumes a
primitive function taking objects to their regions, LOC. As objects can be moving, this
function has to be time-dependent, hence of type e → (i → r). Thus if t is a particular
time point, t: i, and the term paris of type e is the name of Paris, LOCparis(t), which is
oftype r,expressestheregionofParisattimet.
TheLPcannotdenotesuchasimpleregion,however,buthastobeasetofregions,
what Kracht calls a neighborhood. In the example, this will be the set of all regions
that can be claimed to be in Paris.

Moreover, such neighborhoods may also vary
with time, cf. behind the car. Hence the denotation of the LP has to be a parameterized
neighborhood,oftype i → (r → t).
AnMPhasthestructure[M[LNP]].IfweassumethecontributionfromtheNPto

local relations. For example, i,oftype(r × r) → t, is a particular relation between two
regions locating the second region within the ﬁrst region. The localizer IN can then be

If we write L for the logical representation of the LP, the static MP can be written
ST(L). Here ST is a modalizer, a function of type (i → (r → t))→ (v → t). Kracht

Zwarts and Winter’s treatment of modiﬁcation as intersection, as in ten meters
above the house, can be reconstructed within this framework if we consider it as LP-
modiﬁcation. This means that tenmeters, which intuitively is a set of vectors, V, hence
of type p → t, has to be lifted to type i → (r → t). One can take the temporal part to be
constant.Fortheregionalpart,apossibilityistoadmitallregionsconsistingofvectors

This is a little simpliﬁed, though, because for a hot air balloon to be ten meters above
the house one cannot request all parts of the balloon to be ten meters above the house.
But that is as much a challenge for Zwarts’ original proposal and it does not belong to
thecompositionalsemanticstosolve.
This analysis has a problem with compositionality, though. In an expression like
under the top, the preposition under is interpreted as M+L, and under the top as an MP.

3.2IntroducingMinimalRecursionSemantics
MRS (Copestake et al. 2005) is a framework for semantic representations in large-scale
grammars. The main goals for MRS is to be expressively adequate allowing linguistic
meaningtoberepresentedproperly,tobecompatiblewithothermodulesinagrammar,
to be computational tractable, and to support underspeciﬁcation. The semantic repre-
sentations in MRS can be considered a meta-level language for representing an under-
lying object language which is typically ﬁrst-order logic with generalized quantiﬁers.
Example (46) is an MRS structure for the sentence in Example (45). The basic building
blocksaretheelementarypredications(EPs),likedog(x)andchase(x,y),correspondingto
atomicformulas.
(45) Everydogchasessomecat.
(46) 〈h0, h7, {h1:every(x, h2, hA), h3:dog(x), h4:some(y, h5, hB), h6:cat(y),

MRSisoftendescribedasaﬂatsemantics,becausetheMRSstructuresaresyntacti-
callynon-recursive.Thisisachievedbylabelingall EPswithhandles.InExample(46),
h3 is the label on the predication dog(x).Inaddition,anEP may have handles as argu-
ments (cf. the argument h2ofevery(x, h2,hA)). Quantiﬁers introduce special relations
inanMRS,correspondingtogeneralizedquantiﬁers.Theﬁrstargumentofaquantiﬁer
relation is the bound variable, the second is the restriction, and the third is the body.
These handles are employed in the mapping from the ﬂat meta-level representation to
theobject-languageexpressionswithexplicitrepresentationsofscope.

JørgensenandLønning MinimalRecursionSemanticAnalysisofLocatives
ScopeunderspeciﬁcationisrepresentedinMRSbyhavinghandlesinargumentpo-
sitionsof EPsthatarenotthelabelsofother EPs.Thehandlesarelinked(orequated)in
the construction of object-language expressions. The unconstrained handle arguments
hA and hB in Example (46) may be linked in two ways to construct the expressions in
Examples (47) and (49), corresponding to the FOL expressions in Examples (48) and
(50),respectively.
(47) some(y, cat(y), every(x,dog(x), chase(x, y)))
(48) ∃y(cat(y)∧∀x(dog(x) → chase(x, y)))
(49) every(x,dog(x), some(y, cat(y), chase(x, y)))
(50) ∀x(dog(x) →∃y(cat(y)∧chase(x, y)))
To constrain the possible linkings of handles and thereby the possible scope relations,
MRSsmaycontainso-calledequalitymoduloquantiﬁers.Theconstraintforthehandle

orsomenon-repeatingchainofoneormorelabelsofquantiﬁerEPsintervene.Anobject-
languageformulaisdescribedbytheMRSstructureonlyifitrespectsalltheconstraints
andallvariablesarebound.
The general form of an MRS can be considered a four-tuple 〈GT,LT,R,C〉 where
R (relations) is the bag of EPs, and C (constraints) is a bag of all the qeq constraints.
In addition, GT (global top) is the label of the topmost EP of the structure, while LT
(localtop)isthelabelofthetopmost EPofasub-structure.TheLT isneededforrulesof
semanticcomposition.Furthermore,theGTisalwaysqeqtotheLT oftherootphrase.
Semantic composition in MRS is performed as follows: The bag of EPs(R)andthe
bagofqeqconstraints(C)ofthedaughternodesareappendedonthemothernode.Fur-
thermore,theglobaltops(GT)ofthedaughtersareequatedonthemothermode.Scopal
and intersective combination are treated differently. For intersective combination, the
local tops (LT) are equated. For example, if black corresponds to the expression in
Example(51)andcatcorrespondstoExample(52),thenblackcatcorrespondstoExample
(53).(Thecoindexationofxandyisdonethroughtheinteractionwiththegrammar.)
(51) 〈h0, h1, {h1:black(y)}, {}〉

toprobablysleeps.
(54) 〈h0, h1, {h1:probably(h2), h3:sleep(x)}, {h2=
q
h3}〉
For quantiﬁers, the scopal argument is the restriction of the quantiﬁer, whereas
the body of the quantiﬁer is left unconstrained. This means that the handle variable
in restriction position is qeq to the label of the restriction’s LT. For example, if every
243
ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
corresponds to the expression in Example (55) and cat corresponds to Example (56),
theneverycatcorrespondstoExample(57).
(55) 〈h0, h1, {h2:every(x, h3, h4)}, {}〉
(56) 〈h0, h5, {h5:cat(x)}, {}〉
(57) 〈h0, h1, {h2:every(x, h3, h4), h5:cat(x)}, {h3 =

4.MRSAnalysisofLocatives
Kracht’s analysis is based on higher order functions and functional application. How
can that be ported to a system based on (ﬁrst-order) predication where composition is
built by uniﬁcation? And how shall the phenomena be described in a grammar? We
will work our way top down starting with how MPs are combined with other phrases
and then proceed to the inner structure of MPs. We will take as our starting point
the large-scale computational English Resource Grammar, ERG (Flickinger 2002),
6
an
HPSG grammar using MRS as the format for semantic representation (see Flickinger
2002 and Section 6 of Copestake et al. 2005). ERG uses a Davidsonian approach where
verbs introduce events, and adverbial intersective modiﬁcation involves coindexation
oftheeventvariablesoftheverbalrelationandthemodiﬁerrelation.BecauseKracht’s
approach is also event-based and he considers all adverbial locative PPs (i.e., MPs) as
intersectivemodiﬁers,theanalysisofMPscanbeexpressedstraightforwardlyinMRSs
andis,infact,similartotheanalysisinERG.
4.1MRSAnalysisofModalizerPhrases(MPs)
TheMPcanberepresentedwithan EPcontaininganeventvariable.Schematically,the
MRS structures in Examples (58) and (59) are composed into Example (60). As we de-
scribedintheprevioussection,intersectiveadverbialmodiﬁcationinMRSisexpressed
by coindexation of the labels of the intersected EPs. Shared labels are treated in MRS
as implicit conjunctions, and coindexation of labels will thus have the same effect as
conjoiningthetwo EPs.(Theeventvariablesarecoindexedthroughtheinteractionwith
thegrammar.)

4.2MRSAnalysisofLocalizerPhrases(LPs)
We now turn to the question of the inner structure of the MP, the representation of the
LP, and how the MP is constructed from the LP. This is more delicate, as in Kracht’s
formalism an L representing an LP is a higher order function—of type (i → (r → t)).
Thisfunctionoccursontheonehandasanargumenttootherfunctions,forexample,to
themodalizerfunctions, ST, CF, CI, TR, APasinExample(36),andontheotherhandas
afunctor(orrelation)whenthedeepersemanticsofthemodalizersarespelledout,for
instance,asinExample(42).
Our solution is based on a division of semantic representations into several layers.
We will distinguish between a surface level and deeper levels. The surface level will
represent all semantic information that is grammaticalized, and it will be appropri-
ate for parsing and generation, and possibly other types of applications. The surface
representation does not have to represent all the deeper semantic meaning explicitly,
but the deeper meaning should be derivable from the surface representation. Thus,
for this particular example, it sufﬁces with a surface representation corresponding to
Example(36)sincewehavedemonstratedhowExample(42)canbederiveddetermin-
istically. Because an LP will always be argument to an M or to a verb, it is possible
to give representations where we only see such Ls in argument positions. We may
therefore consider the type (i → (r → t)) of parameterized neighborhoods a primitive
type l in our surface representation language. A modalizer function, like CI, takes ﬁrst
a parameterized neighborhood, L, and then an event, and yields a truth value. It is of
type (i → (r → t))→ (v → t). This corresponds to being of type ((i → (r → t))× v) → t,
or (l × v) → t. Hence it can be represented in MRS as a relation, ci mod, taking two
arguments. Ignoring the analysis of the table, this yields the MRS representation in
Example (62) for the MP in Example (61). The full semantic representation of Exam-
ple(7)isshowninExample(63).

Forapplications,wecanconvertthissimplesurfaceinterpretationtoKracht’sdeep

approachtothatwhichCopestakeetal.(2005,page312)andERGtakefortense.InERG,
tense is treated as a simple feature on events; there are no variables corresponding to,
forexample,timepoints.Copestakeetal.arguethatsucharepresentationispreferable
since it simpliﬁes parsing and generation, and it sufﬁces if it is possible to derive the
deeper representation from this representation. Consider our analysis of the MP into
Paris in Example (64). The meaning of in loc(l, paris) is that the localizer function

is the analysis according to Kracht. If we then use Kracht’s deﬁnition of IN in terms of

ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
the local relationithis can be spelled out as Example (67), and if we use the deﬁnition
for CFthiscanbetranslatedfurtherintoExample(68).

A similar translation can be applied in the case of the other mode relations, including
static. This means that from our simpler surface representations, we can construct
Kracht’srepresentationsforapplicationpurposeswhenitisdesirable.
ThelocationvariablelisunboundintheMRSrepresentations. Aswitheventvari-

itscopesoverthemodalizerandlocalizerrelations,andisoutscopedbyallquantiﬁers
binding referential indices, including the quantiﬁer introduced by the complement of
the PP. Moreover, this quantiﬁer will be a quantiﬁer claiming that there exists exactly
one such region. Though the quantiﬁers are not explicitly represented, the translation
intoKracht’sfunctionallanguageproceedsasiftheywerethere.
One could ask why we bother to decompose the preposition at all. Why do we
choose to analyze Example (61) as Example (62) when we could use the simpler
Example(69).
(69) 〈h0, h1, {h1:under(e, x)}, {}〉
There are several reasons why we want to decompose. First, a preposition like
under can be interpreted in any of three ways {h1:st mod(e,l), h1:under loc(l,x)},
{h1:cf mod(e,l), h1:under loc(l,x)},or{h1:tr mod(e,l), h1:under loc(l,x)}.Asimple
translation procedure would have to propose all these three when the preposition is
translatedintoadeeperrepresentation.Butbyhavingthemodeexplicitlyrepresented,
we can to a certain degree disambiguate between the different modes during parsing.
As this disambiguation is performed during the syntactic analysis, we believe that
the disambiguated structure should also be reﬂected in the semantic representation.
Second, we will see in Section 5.2 that the decomposition simpliﬁes the interpretation
of sentences where several prepositions co-occur. Third, we ﬁnd anaphoric uses of
locative expressions, and an explicit representation is needed to describe the sentence
inExample(70).

5.NorwegianLocatives
In this section, we will use Kracht’s (2002) theory for two purposes. We will ﬁrst
show how locative prepositions can be classiﬁed along the modalizer and localizer
dimensions, and secondly use the theory to explain differences between Norwegian
and English locative prepositions. In Norwegian, we ﬁnd no direct counterparts to
the English coﬁnal prepositions into and onto. Instead, one uses a combination of an
intransitive locative preposition, for example, inne (inside
st
) or inn (inside
cf
), followed
by the relevant preposition, for example, i(in)or p˚a (on). This was exempliﬁed in the
sentencesinExamples(11)and(12).Wereturntoouranalysisoftheseconstructionsin
Section5.2.Thus,thissectionwillfocusmostlyontheanalysisofNorwegianlocatives.
5.1ClassesofLocatives
LookingattheselectionalpatternsofNorwegianprepositions,weidentifythreedistinct
patterns:
1. PPtransitive.ThesetakePPcomplements.Themostfrequentarefra(from)

Furthermore,theanalysisweproposeisdecompositional,andweclassifylocatives
semantically along the modalizer and localizer dimensions. The modalizer dimension
seems to have an upper boundary, as Kracht (2002) claims to have found evidence for
ﬁvemodalizers.Thelocalizerdimensionhasinprinciplenoupperboundary.InTable1,
we show how the different types of locatives are distributed over the localizer and
modalizer dimensions. Prepositions in the same column share modalizer, and prepo-
sitionsinthesamerowsharelocalizer.ForeachNorwegianlocative,thecorresponding
Englishlocativeislistedinparentheses.
Recall that prepositions can function as heads of MPs and LPs. For Norwegian
and English, there is a general correspondence between the prepositions being heads
of static MPs and being LPs. It is also worth noting the transparent morphology the
intransitive prepositions show with respect to mode. The system is made up of a stem
and a sufﬁx, as follows: -e (static), -efra (coinitial), (coﬁnal), -om (transitory) and -over
(approximative).
5.2MoreontheInternalStructureofLocatives
We follow Kracht (2002) in assuming that locatives have an MP structure of the form
[M [L NP]]. Syntactically, this can be realized in several different ways. Relating the
classes of prepositions to the MP structure above is done as shown subsequently. The
underlined constituents of the MP structure correspond to the preposition of the class.

As mentioned, some intransitive prepositions may occur with a complement, as we
saw in Examples (11)–(14). We name these alternating locatives, and analyze them as
prepositions with an optional complement. When the alternating prepositions occur
with a complement, the mode relation scopes over both the contextually determined

The MRS for the LP complement analysis of Example (12) is given in Example (71)
(where we only show the elementary predications and omit the quantiﬁers). Note
that the sentence in Example (12) is syntactically and semantically ambiguous in our
grammar. It also has a reading where the PP i hullet is not a complement to inn,but
where both PPsmodify the main event. The two different types of readings are shown
inSection6.6.

6.Implementation
In this section, we ﬁrst describe the framework the grammar was implemented in.
We then proceed to describing the classes of locative prepositions described in Sec-
tion5.TheimplementationofKracht’s(2002)emptinessprinciplewillbecentraltoour
grammar.
6.1FrameworkfortheImplementation
MRS is a general format for representing different formal object languages and
may be combined with different syntactic models. It has in particular been com-
bined with HPSG grammars where it has been used in the large English Resource
Grammar (Flickinger 2002). HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) is a uniﬁcation-based
non-transformational theory, using multiple inheritance type hierarchies and uniﬁca-
tion of typed feature structures as central formal mechanisms. The analysis we have
presented so far is compatible with different syntactic models. We have made a small
fragment of an HPSG grammar to illustrate the analysis. This fragment was imple-
mented in the Linguistic Knowledge Builder (LKB) system (Copestake 2002). The LKB
system is an implementation environment for writing HPSG grammars. The grammar
wasbasedontheMatrix“starterkit”forbuildingHPSGgrammars(Bender,Flickinger,
andOepen2002).TheMatrixcontainstypesforbuildingMRSsasthesemanticcontent
of a sentence compositionally. Principles restricting the syntax-semantics interface, as
described by Copestake, Lascarides, and Flickinger (2001), are also encoded in the
Matrix. For instance, a sign (phrase or word) only exposes its handle, main internal
argument, and external argument to the rest of the grammar, such that, for example, a
verbcannot control the arguments of its complement. The description of the grammar

We now turn to the sentence in Example (7), for which we want to achieve the MRS in
Example(73).

ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
This is more complex, as we want to arrive at this MRS while still using the sign for
underfromFigure1.TherepresentationforfromactingasaPPtransitiveprepositionis
given in Figure 2. We have two different entries for the prepositionfromin the lexicon,
one where it is PP transitive and one where it is NP transitive. The entry for the NP
transitive from is more or less identical to under, except that it introduces different
semanticrelations(ci mod relandat loc rel).
The two signs in Figure 1 and Figure 2 together correspond to our imple-
mentation of the emptiness principle, by uniﬁcation of the constraint id rel on
COMPS<MRS.KEY-REL> in Figure 2 and MRS.KEY-REL in Figure 1. As we recall from
Section 2.7, the emptiness principle claims that when an element is ﬁxed regardless
of the interpretation of the sentence, it is interpreted as the identity relation. Kracht’s
claim is more radical than our implementation, as he claims that any element may be
empty.Wehaveonlyimplementedtheemptinessprincipleforprepositions.

Intransitive prepositions are implemented similarly to NP transitive prepositions, ex-
ceptthattheytakenocomplements(emptyCOMPSlist),andthattheyintroducealoc rel
withonlyonevariable.TheMRSweobtainisshowninExample(74).

AlternatingprepositionsareimplementedassomethingbetweenaPPtransitiveprepo-
sitionandanintransitivepreposition.TheytakeoptionalstaticPPcomplements,which
in turn are interpreted as LPs (identical to LP selection for PP transitive prepositions).
The location variable of the internal loc rel and the complement loc rel are coindexed,
suchthatthemod relpredicatesoverbothlocalizerrelations.TheMRSsforthesyntactic

Example(75).AsmentionedinExample(12)inSection5.2,Example(10)issyntactically

h6:def(y,h7,h8), h9:bridge(y)},
{h2 =

h4, h7 =

6.7PPTransitiveVerbs
ThemechanismsweintroduceforLPselectionandmodeunderspeciﬁcationhaveuntil
now been used to describe complex locative PPs. But the same mechanisms can be
used for other heads selecting PP complements, for example, verbs. Recall Bierwisch’s
(1988) claim that liegen (lie) is a relation between the subject and a location. This
can now be implemented directly, by stating in the description of the verb that it
selectsanLPcomplement,identicaltothecomplementofthePPtransitive(modalizer)
prepositions.
More interesting is the class of verbs known as put-verbs. Such verbs take both
static and coﬁnal complements, and express directionality in both cases as we saw in
Example (8). Kracht’s two-layering enables us to let the verb select the full PP (MP) as
thesyntacticargument,butonlythedenotationoftheLPasitssemanticargument.The
verbcanthusexpressthemovement,whilethePPcontributesthegoalofthemovement
tothesemantics.WeencodethisbydescribingthePPcomplementoftheverbtobean
LP (denoting a location) of static or coﬁnal mode (in COMPS<...,[MRS.KEY-REL]>).
Thus, we arrive at the same semantics for both sentences in Example (8). At the same
time we constrain the verbto only select PPs of static or coﬁnal mode. A simpliﬁed
AVM for the verb put is shown in Figure 4. A similar treatment can be given to any
verbthat semantically selects a location rather than an event as the denotation of the
PPcomplement.

7.MachineTranslation
Ouranalysiscanbeappliedinseveraltypesofapplications.Firstofall,itservesasthe
basis for a coherent analysis of locatives, for example, in that PP complements of both
prepositions and verbs are analyzed in a uniform manner. It also makes the syntax–
semanticsinterfaceclean,inimplementingthedualisticnatureoflocativesasreferential
andmodiﬁcational.Webelieveoneofthestrengthsofthisanalysisconcernsthechoice
of the level of representation. In an NLP system where spatial reasoning is required,
one may choose to spell out the details in the analysis, as shown in Section 4.2. In
other NLP applications, the superﬁcial representation is sufﬁcient, and one does not
wanttointroduceacomplexmodelinvolvingmovers,timepoints,andparameterized
neighborhoods.Inthissection,weshowhowouranalysismayserveasthebestlevelfor
representations in a transfer-based machine translation system, due to the interlingual
natureofthemodes.
Kracht (2002) argues that the modes can be found across a wide range of lan-
guages, making them good candidates for true interlingua predicates. The localizer

functions,however,arelanguage-dependent,andthereexistdifferentsystemsforloca-
tives in different languages. Also, whether the particular combination of modalizer
and localizer is lexicalized is language-speciﬁc, as we see in Section 7.2. We will
illustrate the ﬂow in a semantic-based transfer MT system from Norwegian to
English, with two examples. The modes are treated as interlingua predicates, whereas
the localizer functions are language-dependent, and thus transferred by the transfer
module. In Section 7.1, we consider an NP transitive preposition, and show how a
mode-disambiguated preposition may translate differently from the mode-ambiguous
preposition. And in Section 7.2, we describe how an intransitive preposition is trans-
lated into a complex PP consisting of a PP transitive preposition and an intransitive
preposition.

7.2TranslationofanIntransitivePreposition
Intransitive locatives, or context-dependent locatives, provide more interesting mis-
matches between Norwegian and English locative expressions. In Table 1 from Sec-
tion 5.1, we see that Norwegian has a rich inventory for expressing context-dependent
spatialrelations.OneexampleistheNorwegianlocativederfra,asseeninExample(15),
which translates to the English complex from there. These kinds of mismatches are
now easily explained. In Norwegian, we ﬁnd a lexicalization for the combination
of the coinitial mode and the localizer function der loc (semantically interpreted as
distal, and contrasted by proximal/close). In English, we do not ﬁnd this lexicalized
preposition, and the two semantic relations (modalizer and localizer, respectively) are
realizedasseparatelexicalitems.Thetranslationﬂowofthelocativederfraisshownin

8.OtherComputationalApproaches
In Section 2 we considered different linguistic approaches to locatives that were not
computational.Wewillherecompareourapproachtoearliercomputationalapproaches
withsimilargoalstoours.
8.1Crearyetal.
Creary,Gawron,andNerbonne(1989)describeafullyimplementedsystemfordatabase
queries. They propose to take locative PPs to be arguments rather than modiﬁers.
They observe that such an approach must explain occurrences of several PPs as in
Example(79).
(79) AlworksonMassAveinBostonnearMIT.
Their solution is to let each PP denote a region. The denotations of the three PPs are
intersected(aspointsets)resultinginoneregionsatisfyingallthreeofthem.Thisregion
isthentakenasanargumenttothesemanticsoftheverb.
Such a solution seems to work for this example. But all the examples in the article
are static PPs. This approach does not so easily extend to directional prepositions
becausedirectionalprepositionscannotbetakentodenoteregions.
8.2TheCoreLanguageEngine
IntheCoreLanguageEngine,ordinaryPPsareconsideredmodiﬁers(Alshawi1992).Se-
mantically,anordinaryprepositionisarelationbetweentwoarguments,thelandmark
object,andtheeventdenotedbytheverbinthecaseofverbalmodiﬁcation.Thereisno
specialtreatmentoflocativeprepositionsandnodistinctionismadebetweendirectional
and static prepositions. This is in many ways a baseline approach to prepositions in
event-basedcomputationalgrammars,andwesketcheditinExample(69).Inaddition
to the ordinary PPs, four other classes of PPs are recognized where one is the class of
subcategorized prepositions which are semantically empty, as inhandedabooktoMary.

WearguedinSection4.2forwhywethinkourreﬁnedanalysisisanimprovementover
thebaselineapproach.
8.3VerbMobil
In VerbMobil the semantics of prepositions are also considered relations between the
landmark and the event (or object) it modiﬁes (Buscbeck-Wolf 1995). Syntactically,
directional PPs may be complements, but they are still considered semantic modiﬁers.
In addition to relations and arguments, the semantic representations in VerbMobil are
decorated with additional information which is exploited in the transfer step of the
translation.Inparticular,therepresentationsforPPsandthelexicalentriesforpreposi-
tionscontainafeatureROLEaspartoftheargument(tobe)ﬁlledbythelandmark.This
ROLE can contain information likeway rel for directionality, and its negation for static
PPs. In German, this property will correspond to whether the case of the landmark is
accusativeordative.
Though this extra ROLE information may be a useful tool in translation, it lacks
a denotational meaning. Moreover, this approach does not explain how we can make
referencetolocations,northestructureofthePPtransitiveprepositions.
8.4Trujillo’sSpatialPrepositionsandMachineTranslation
Trujillo (1995) analyzes locatives in the context of transfer-based machine translation.
He ﬁrst develops a general format for a ﬂat semantic representation called indexed
lexemelists, and shows how transfer between English and Spanish can be carried out
onsuchrepresentations.HetheninvestigatesdifferencesinpropertiesbetweenEnglish
and Spanish spatial prepositions, and discusses the proper semantic representation of
locativesandhowthiscanbeexploitedintranslation.
The semantic representations used by Trujillo are quite similar to MRSs and in-
troduce many properties that can also be found in the MRS formalism. One differ-
ence between the two is that indexed lexeme lists lack an equivalent to the scoping
mechanism in MRS, and Copestake et al. (2005) show how this can be a problem for
semantic disambiguation and translation. The MRS formalism can be considered an
improvementovertheindexedlexemelists.
Trujillo does not decompose the prepositions. Syntactically, both static and di-
rectional prepositions are considered adjuncts and semantically they are considered
modiﬁers. Prepositions denote relations between the event denoted by the verb and
the landmark object. Trujillo observes that prepositions can be stacked as in Exam-
ple(7)fromtheintroduction,repeatedasExample(80).Heproposesananalysiswhere

Thelasttwoarguments,ARG1

in the Core Language Engine approach. When the two prepositions are combined, the
lowerpreposition,under,modiﬁestheobjectwhichisthe ARG0offrom,andatthesame
timetheobjectwhichisthe ARG0ofthelowerprepositionistakentobethelandmark,
the ARG2offrom.
Though this solution might work technically for translation purposes, we have
problems making sense out of the status of these objects. Trujillo (1995, page 172) says
that “these correspond to the place objects that Sondheimer (1978) proposes, although
forthepurposesofthisthesistheybecomeplaceholdersforspatialrelations.”TheERG
also uses a representation with some of the same properties, and we will return to a
more detailed comparison to our proposal in the following section. Trujillo does not
decompose the prepositions, but he classiﬁes the prepositions with respect to different
semantic properties including whether they are static or directional and different di-
rectionality types, and places them in a semantic type hierarchy. We think that such a
type hierarchy might be useful for selecting the translations of the locative part of a
preposition, but from our perspective, this belongs to the lexical semantic properties
andisbeyondthescopeofthisarticle.
8.5TheEnglishResourceGrammar
The English Resource Grammar (Flickinger 2002)
8
is similar to our proposal in using
MRS as the semantic formalism in a linguistic-based computational grammar, but the
treatmentoflocativesisdifferentfromours.BecausetheERGtreatmentofprepositions
isquiteelaborate,treatingdifferentprepositionsindifferentwaysandinterleavingthe
semantic analysis with the grammar, we will not be able to give a full and fair presen-
tation of the full ERG analysis, but we will try to sketch some of its main properties
regardinglocatives,andcomparethemtoourapproach.
8.5.1 Prepositions
in ERG. In Example (82) we see a simpliﬁed logical representation
of the relevant aspects of the MRS representation ERG ascribes to Example (1). The

preposition like down also modiﬁes the main event and introduces its own event, as
seenintheERGanalysisofExample(9),showninExample(83).Thisanalysisissimilar
to the ERG analysis of intersective adverbs, likefast. Syntactically, a locative PP can be
adjoined to any kind of VP and modify the VP event. In addition, there is a class of
directional verbs, like go, run,anddrive, which can take a locative PP as an argument.
Semantically, however, this is interpreted as modiﬁcation. Thus even though sentence

two cases. When the PP is argument to the verbthe preposition is constrained to be
directional (Example (86)), but not when it is adjoined to the VP (Example (85)). The
thirdclassofprepositions,representedbyto,into,andonto,whichwewouldclassifyas
directional,canheadPPsinbothtypesofconstructions,butascribeidenticalsemantics
tothetwo(Example(84)).
The main differences between ERG and our proposal so far are the following.
ERG does not decompose prepositions semantically. ERG introduces a distinction be-
tween directional and static, but does not distinguish between different modes of
directionality. In ERG there is a correspondence between syntax and directionality, as
PPs that are syntactic arguments of motion verbs have to be read directionally. On
the other hand, unambiguously directional prepositions are also allowed to be non-
arguments and modify any VP. In our analysis, a semantically modifying PP is syn-
tactically always adjoined to the verb. We do not postulate a syntactic ambiguity in
Example (2). And even in semantically ambiguous sentences, like Example (3), we
assign only one syntactic structure and keep the mode underspeciﬁed in the syntax–
semanticsinterface.
8.5.2Put-Verbs.Example(8)getstheanalysisinERGshowninExample(87).Themain
point of the analysis is that put takes two individual arguments, corresponding to the

JørgensenandLønning MinimalRecursionSemanticAnalysisofLocatives
the unambiguously directional ontothetable, that is, now put is a relationship between
the subject, the object, and the proposition expressing that the relationship onto holds
between the book and the table. But what should it mean that the relation onto holds
between the two objects? In our analysis, as discussed in Section 6.7 and illustrated in
Example(88),theverbexpressesarelationshipbetweenanobjectandalocationdirectly.
The sentence with onto ends up with exactly the same semantic representation as the
sentencewithon.
8.5.3 Alternating
Prepositions. When an intransitive preposition is followed by a PP, as
in Example (10), repeated here as Example (89), ERG provides two different analyses.
The ﬁrst is that the two locatives both modify the main event,e
1, of the sentence inde-
pendently of each other as in Example (90). This analysis corresponds to our analysis
where two PPs modify the same VP (note Example (76) in Section 6.6), presented in
logical forminExample (92).Wereadthesecond ERGanalysis (Example(91))asdown
modifying the running event. At the same time down introduces its own event e
2,and
this event is modiﬁed by under the bridge, in the same way as under the bridge would
modifyaverb.

1,y)))
WeunderstandthisasERGrecognizingthesameambiguityinExample(89)aswedo,
and that ERG tries to capture the reading we analyzed as Example (75), presented in
logical form in Example (93), in this way. But it is neither obvious what kind of event
isintroducedbydown,norhowthiseventdiffersfromtheeventintroducedbyrun.We
think there is only one event involved here. In this event the child moves downward
and ends up under the bridge. Hence it is a coﬁnal movement where the location is
constrained both by down and under the bridge. In the ﬁrst reading, where the two PPs
modify the VP independently (Example (92)), there is still only one event, but because
thetwoPPsmighthavedifferentmodes—e.g.,downmaybecoﬁnalandunderthebridge
may be static—two different locations are considered. The coﬁnal down considers the
location where the movement ends, while the staticunderconsiders the location of the
wholeevent.
Another difference between our approach and ERG is that ERG ascribes the same
twotypesofanalysistoasentencelikeExample(94).
(94) Achildwentdownfromthebridge.
261
ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
We do not ﬁnd this sentence ambiguous in the same way as Example (89). We think
it can only mean that both PPs modify the VP. This is the only possible analysis in
our approach, because from the bridge cannot be argument to down,asdown in our
grammar only allows static PPs as complements (interpreted as LPs), whereas from is
unambiguouslycoinitial.
8.5.4 PP
Transitive Prepositions. Example (7) gets an analysis like Example (95) in ERG,
and our analysis is presented in Example (96). The analysis in Example (95) resembles
the one in Example (91), namely, from is treated as if it were intransitive and its last
argument place is not ﬁlled; the variable u does not occur elsewhere. As with the
analysis in Example (91), we have problems in understanding exactly how the event
e

8.5.5LexicalizedLocatives.ERGalsocontainsaquitedifferentanalysisforsomelocative
and temporal prepositions and adverbs. We only consider the locative ones here. The
adverb(intransitivepreposition) homeinExample(97)isanalyzedinERGasamodiﬁer

1,y)))
(99) def(x,child(x),go(e
1,x)∧cf mod(e
1,l)∧home loc(l))
ERG’s lexicalized locatives (Example (98)) bear some similarities to our analysis
(Example (99)) if one considers the individual place y in Example (98) to correspond
to the location l.Theunspec loc-relation in ERG corresponds to the modalizer cf mod
in our analysis. But whereas the unspec loc-relation is unrestricted and will represent
any directionality type or static, the modes in our analysis can be constrained by the
lexiconandsyntaxtoonlyrepresentasetofpossiblemodes.Inthisexamplethemode
will be unambiguously co-ﬁnal. A more principal difference between ERG and our
analysis is that ERG introduces two quite different analyses of the locative intransi-
tive prepositions (adverbs), the one exempliﬁed by Example (98) and the analysis in
Example (83) of Example (9). We ascribe the same type of analysis to Example (9) and
Example(97).
262
JørgensenandLønning MinimalRecursionSemanticAnalysisofLocatives
8.5.6 Consequences
for Translation. Our analysis, following Kracht, is meant to be uni-
versal across different languages. A locative expression always has the same form
st/ci/cf/tr/ad(e,l)∧“localizer relation”(l,x). Which parts of the sentence contibute
whichpartsofthisrepresentationmightvaryacrosslanguages.Inatransfer-basedMT
system this means that the mode part will be interlingual, whereas the transfer rules
will cater for the localizer. In spirit, this is quite similar to the treatment of temporal
prepositionsintheLOGONsystem(Oepenetal.2004).OntheERGanalysis,thereisno
reason to expect such a parallelism between two languages. What we have classiﬁed
as an intransitive use of a locative preposition may be analyzed as either a simple
intersective adverbor as a noun combined with the unspec loc-relation in each of the
twolanguages.Thisyieldsfourdifferenttypesoftransferrules,andwhichruletypeto
invoke for each word pair cannot be predicted without inspecting the relevant lexical
entriesinthegrammarsforthetwolanguages.
Moreover, there is also a third type of analyses of intransitive uses of locatives in
ERG, where the locative introduces an adjective, the noun place (sted in Norwegian),
and an implicit quantiﬁer just like the lexicalized locative in Example (98). But instead
of the unspec loc-rel, it introduces a full transitive preposition, like from or to.Thisis
illustratedbyExample(100)whichintheNorwegianLOGONgrammarisanalyzedas
Example(101).
(100) Barnet gikkherfra.
Child.DEFwenthere-from.
‘Thechildwentfromhere.’
(101) def(x,barn(x), def(y,sted(y)∧her(e
3,y), g˚a(e
1,x) ∧ fra(e
2,e
1,y)))
(102) def(x,child(x), implicit q(y, place(y)∧here(e
3,y), go(e
1,x) ∧
from(e
2,e
1,y)))
In this case, such an analysis works well for transfer into English because it can be
directlytransferredintotherepresentationforfromhereinExample(102).Ifweexchange
herfra with hit, a similar analysis of Norwegian would exchange fra with til in Exam-
ple (101). The most natural translation into English would be The child went here,and
one would need yet another transfer type. Thus one might end up with nine different
possible types of transfer relations between intransitive locative prepositions if both
languagesallowforthethreedifferenttypesofanalyses.
8.6 NorGram
NorGram is a computational Lexical Functional Grammar for Norwegian. It has been
extended to produce MRSs, as part of the LOGON system (Oepen et al. 2004).
10
The
NorwegianMRSsareusedasinputtotransferintoEnglishMRSs.NorGramfollowsthe
same design principles for MRS constructions for locatives as ERG, but departs from
ERG in the analysis of PP transitive prepositions. If the NorGram analysis had been
10 Seehttp://www.emmtee.netfortheLOGONproject.
263
ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
applied to the English sentence in Example (7), we would get the analysis given in
Example(103).

see some parallels, where from(e

) corresponds to ci mod(e

corresponds tounder loc(l,y). Seen this way, the NorGram analysis of prepositions can

meansthat,technically,onecouldusetheNorGramformalismasasurfacerepresenta-
tion for these types of constructions and translate into our representation at a deeper
level.Butsuchatranslationwouldnotbeuniform;othercorrespondenceswouldhave
to be applied for other constructions. Moreover, we think our representation is cleaner
and conceptually clearer. All the introduced variables get used, and have a natural
interpretation in our analysis. In particular, the variable connecting the two parts, l,
is a location, whereas in the NorGram analysis, the connecting variable, is typed as an
event,anditisnotclearwhatkindofdenotationcouldbegiventothisevent.

and 30,348 words. There are 2–3 reference translations into English of the sentences,
and ERG has been adopted to parse the English part. In the Norwegian part, 15.4% of

Kracht: Adverbiallocativesareanalyzedaccordingtotheﬁvemodes.Adnominalstatic
locatives are treated similarly to static adverbials, but denote entities and not

ERG: All locatives in the lexicon are underspeciﬁed with respect to denotation type,
and are constrained by uniﬁcation with the modiﬁed element to either an entity
(adnominal)oranevent(adverbial).
9.2.2 Directionality. Directional locatives can (in the general case) modify directional
or motion verbs as in Example (t.2), but not static verbs as in Example (t.4). Static
locatives can modify both classes of verbs, as in Examples (t.1) and (t.3). We specify
on the directional prepositions that they only modify directional verbs, whereas static
prepositionscanmodifyallverbs.

mode locates the event itself. Directional verbs are deﬁned indirectly, in that
directionalPPsonlymodifyverbsdenotingeventsthathaveaneligiblemover.
14
ERG: Directional prepositions are a subtype of ordinary prepositions. When selected
by a directional verb, the preposition is constrained to be of the directional sub-
type. But all locatives, directional or not, can modify all VPs; hence, for example,
Example(t.4)isaccepted.
Note that the distinction between static and directional verbs is hard to make, and
that some verbs, for example, manner of motion verbs, can be coerced to a directional
reading when modiﬁed by an explicit directional locative as in Example (t.5). The
directionalreadingisnotavailablewhenmodiﬁedbyanambiguouslocative,however
(Examples(t.6andt.7)).

ERG: A locative PP can be adjoined to any type of VP. In addition, directional verbs
take directional PPs as arguments. PP arguments of put-verbs may be either
directionalorstatic,asdescribedinSection8.5.Notreatmentoflocationdenoting

NPs (Example (t.11)), no complement (Example (t.12)) or alternate between no com-
plementandPPselection(Example(t.13)).Asthealternatingprepositionstakeoptional
complements, they are ambiguous with respect to being the head of a complex PP or
the ﬁrst of two separate PPs (Example (t.13)). Furthermore, under in Example (t.13)
is three-ways ambiguous with respect to mode (cf. Section 4.2). We also include an
alternatinglocative(Example(t.14))wherethesucceedingPPisblockedfrombeingan
LP complement, because the latter PP is coinitial mode, whereas alternating locatives
onlymayselectstaticPPcomplementsasLPs.

ERG: The analysis is discussed more in Section 8.5, where we gave examples of how
ERG handled the different constructions. In particular, ERG does not distinguish
between Examples (t.13) and (t.14) but ascribes the same number of analyses to
them.

The mode ambiguity may be resolved by the syntactic context, as we see in Exam-

disambiguatewherepossible.

Suite. Based on these dimensions, we have constructed a small test suite in
order to summarize and evaluate our approach. The test suite is given in Table 2.
We present the total number of syntactic and semantic analyses produced by ERG.
For our grammar we present the number of syntactic analyses and two numbers for

producedbythesystem.Theymaybeunderspeciﬁedwithrespecttomode.Thesecond
number is the number of speciﬁed semantic analyses these underspeciﬁed analyses
represent. We compare these to what we believe are the correct number of semantic

prepositions in a complex locative PP is interpreted as a non-locative (e.g. analyses of
underasadegreespeciﬁerinExamples(t.10)and(t.13)).
From the test suite, we see two problems for our analysis. The ﬁrst is the un-
dergeneration for Example (t.5), as we do not cope with static verbs and directional
modiﬁcation. This was discussed in Section 9.2.2. The second problem we ﬁnd in our
analysisofExample(t.13).Forthereadingwherebothlocatives,nedandunderbordet,are

is 2 in this example. ERG gets a better result in this example because the directional
reading of under is only obtained when under heads a PP which is argument to a
directional verb. Because a directional verb only takes one PP argument, that reading
is not obtainable in this sentence. On the other hand, ERG allows the PP from the table
in Example (t.14) to either modify down or the VP. These two analyses result in two
different semantic representations, which we ﬁnd hard to motivate. Taking the correct

We have in this article described a treatment of locative prepositional phrases, which

Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, we are able to give a far more
detailed semantic analysis of the locative prepositions, and at the same time preserve
asimple surface representation ofthecomplex semantics of locative prepositions. This
