Such functions have been used in tandem with statistical functions in experiments on disambiguation (for instance Alshawi and (',a.rter 1994).

Although we have not provided a denotatio.al semantics for sets of relation edges, we anticipate that this will be possible along the lines developed in m(motonic semantics (Alshawi and Crouch 1992).

Although such an approach was applied with some success in a limited-domain system translating logical forms into database queries (Rayner and Alshawi 1992), it is likely to be impractical for language translation with tens of thousands of sense predicates and related axioms.

Although hypothetical, this design and its components are similar to those used in existing database query (Rayner and Alshawi 1992) and translation systems (Alshawi et al 1992).
