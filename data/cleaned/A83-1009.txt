ABSTRACT A major problem In automatically anaiy~dng the text of m~lltary messaq;les In m~lar to synthesize data b~le elements is separating fact from opinion, I.e., Ident~n9 factual statements versus evaluative commentary such 4,; degree Of belief or confidence In the parameters of s particular event, comparative evaiual~ons of entitles and events, predictions of future events, etc.
This paper desmlbes a m~iel which accmmta for the range of factual to evaluative Information In the message traffic, and dlocusses a means for repreaenUng such Ioformation In the context of an oxperlmentsJ system for automated data bale generstlo~ 1.0 EIACI~GFIOUND For several years, with some Inl;erroptlone, a research end development effort hal been In procmm In the Operating Systems Division of Logicon (and its predecame' company, OpereUng Systems, Inc).
aimed at the automated creation of data base elements from the text ~f electronically transmitted military messages.

Although some effort has been devoted to primarily Interactive approaches to the problem, and to mwmages which have highly predictable cniumnar summary formats, the majority of the research and development work has concentrated on the more difficult task of analyzing unformatted narrative l:axt with user Interaction limited to occasional sssistmlca to the automated system.
A teethed system called MATRES has been constructed In Prolog to run under the UNiX operating system on the POP 11/70.
MATRES Is a knowledge based system for undorotanding the natural language text of eventoriented massages tn the domains of air activities and space/missile (S&M) activities.
The knowledge structures In MATRES, called "templates a, are essentially frames or scripts describing entities and events, which answer the military u~er's bsolc questions about these 1.

MlenmmmL as Illustrated In the simplified view of an event template prlmentod In Figure 1.
The templatee are hierarchically organized; lower level templates deal with ot)Jects or times, mid level with evarlts containing objects and times, higher level with activities composed of events.
The slots in the tamplates contadn procedures which operate upon the output of the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantlata the templatlm.
We are currently using a corpus of spprcximstaF/ 125 messages In the S&M domain s~ a basis for developing a scenario for evaluation of the extended MATRES teatl~bed, ms well ms a teethed for a related knowledge baaed ayltem, the Active/Introspective information System \[desCribed In Montgomery and Ruapini 1981, and Ruapinl 1982\] for which MATRES serves an a front end.
The scanmlo Involves two simulated nations, the Delta Col~edaratton of the Atlantic States and the Epsilon Repobllk:.
Both netlone have space programs, and each Is interested in monitoring the technological progress of the other, using their own sataillte and sensor resources mid those of other friendly neUon8.
The sot of fifessages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports of space and satellite launches and orbital activities of the Delta Confederation, which are being monitored and evaluated by the Epsllon RepubUc.
The text o1' messages used In the scenario has the structure and format of actual messages reporting on S&M activities, although the lexicon is substantially different.
All discumled In several previous technical reports prepared under earlier contracts with RAOC (~Kuhns and Mantgamary 1973\], \[Silva at el 19790\], \[Silva et sl 1979b\]), the subset ot' the English language on which the text Of Intelligence messages 18 based Is essentislly a specialized language for reporting events.
Intermixed with factual statements reporting on entitles and events, however, Is much evaluative commentary.
Moreover, proms announcements of the Oeita Confederation are Included In the reports, and evaluative comments are made both about the events reported In the press announcements and the announcements themselves.
In synthesizing data base elements from these messages, it is crucial to sort out these different levels of information.
This paper defines an approach to identifying and labelIng those types of Information so that they can be exploited In the context of MATRES and the data base systems which It serves.

2.0 THE
RESEARCH PROBLEM /Ul noted above, the subiengusge of the message carpore for the air sotivitJes and S&M domains Is essentially a vehicle for ~ng events.
Kuhns and Montgomery \[1978\] presented • detailed.:ethodology for classifying the various types of events described In the .:essages, which Is shown In Figure 2, and summmtzed below.
Before describing the event clmlflcatlon, however, It Is enlightening to review briefly soma example .:esaages In order to understand the motivation for this rather complex model Some mmsgas w for example, those encountered In our previotm research on the air activities domain -may report only primitive events.
However, as noted shove and IlluatTerted in Figure 3, s message may in fact be a report of • report-that Is, It may Include e report of an event by so.:e other source than the originator of the message.
The "announcement m Is thus a row0rt of • • launch m event, which Is the basic or prlmiUve event being reported.
The mmnrmunoementm \],., an event, but It Is clearly not on the same level as the primitive event.
Rather, it is s report about the launch, s .:eta-event that Incidentally introduces s new Infatuation source of different credibility than the originator of the .:esaege.
However, this dlsUnotJon alone Is not sufficient to account for the difference between the Initial two sentencea of the sxa.:pia message end the third sentence, whloh contains an evaluation of the announce.cent, statIng that It wu characterized by "routine" wording.
It Is thus an evalueUve com.:entary on the press snrmunce-,:ant of the launch event Since the announcement has been defined am s .:eta-event, the comment represents another mete-leveL In fact, In reviewing additional example8 of the .:emsege traffic in this scenario, it Is clear that, In order to accurately distill and represent Information contained in the text of these messages, the enalyl:lcal .:ethodo~ogy must Identify end uniquely label the following types of information: Mate-events llon.-meta-evm~bn OIbsel, vational events Primitive events AtUtbutlva events Relational events World point events (location events) World point qualification events (location event qualifications) N(m-world point events, or events involving or more objects or locations Figure 2.

a.o AMALYTICAL MLrrHoDQLOGY ~mdyticaJ methodology IS baaed on • model of the mW world situeth=n which underlies the scenmto.
Part of the modet derives from the event clmificaUon schema mentlmled shove, and Illustrated in Figure 2, which was deveiooed to account for the levels of content occurlng in the event-oriented message disooume, in this clanslficetion, there are two major types of events, mete meats and n~t-mete event I.
Of the letter, events may bo al~lorvartkNlei, Or prlmltive.
An obaervetlonaJ evenf~ la a direct perception of an event, which may be a visual percopUon (e.g., "observe", "sightS), Or In Ute cane of a sensor, an electronic measurement of the emitted energy charanterizlng the event.
A primlt|ve event is thus a physical event of some kind which does not Involve an obaervaUon Or per~epUQn.
Primitive evento may be attributive Or relatloeai.
An attribuUve event doacriben a situation In which a particular entity hag • partiooiar attribute at a certain time or during a particular time Interval (other than the attribute location, which Is coveted under relational events), for example: WTerrex 534 operates In the high density mode".
A relational event Involves entitles which stand In an n-sty relation with oath other st a certain Urea or during s fixed time period.
The Importance of the subclasses of world point and world point qualification event8 la in defining the world lira of sn entity, say the track cf s ship or submarine.
Of these distinctions, the moat relevant for this discussion ere those Involving mete-events and memete events, and of the latter, primiUve vef=us obaervetkmad events.
In torero of the scenm'io described aDQve, a primitive ovwrt many occur, say, • aatelllte launch by tllo Delta Confederation, am Illustrated In Figure 4.
This event, like any other event, Involves the emission of energy.
Such in omission 18 perceived by a sensing device of the El~ilml RopubllG.
The device genefetoe (down arrow) a report of the giv|m event, In terms of the partlcuisr attributes of the event It la designed to measure.
This sefmer report Is an obaervetlonaJ event, entailing an obaervetlml of a primitive evonL An S&M analyst for the Repubilk: ancemles (up arrow) this report, which contains digitized Information generated by the sensor, Ilttefll~to this Information ~1 • launch event, and Issues his own report about that event.
HI8 rel~rt, which la an IntsrpretaUon of the primitive event baned on the obaervetionW event, Is s zeroth m~lm.
mete-event= the common denominator of the ruesmlge traffic.
At the same time, the Deltas may release an Internal report about the launch, which would also (mnstltlxte s zeroth order mote-event.
Based on that aport, the Delta prim agency, NYT, may Issue an snnounomaent of the primitive event, the snnmmoemsnt thus e~nwUtutea s f~der mete-event.
An Epsllon Republk: rq~rter may then make an Interpretation of.
that ennota~enent~ In the form of a report, which being a report of 4 first-order mete-event -Is therefore m aecmtd ~ mete-event.
Corrections or other changes made by El=~lllon reporters to these messages constitute a third mete level of reporting event, since they may reference reports of reports of events.
The m(xlet thul fair accounts for the event reporting structure which undmtioa the Delta/Epsilon scenario, but we must slam acm~alt for the repo~ar's comments about the event -Le., his interpretation or evaluation of the event -which can occur at any of these levels.
The moortor~s goaJ Is to Identify and denoribe all the relevant parameters of an event (exemplified by the ~ots In the template for a launch event, shown in the center of Figure 5) based on the observational report produced by the sensor and any other information he may hive (e.g., knowledge that a replacement of s nonfunctioning communications satellite is likely within a given time frame).
However, if the reportor's Information Is Incomplete or Imprecise, he cannot exactJy describe the parameters of an event, but will give his best Interpretation of the event baaed on whet he knows.
Thus he may report a launch of "an unidentified satellite", "a probable television support satellite", "s possible CE satellite".
In some cases, ho may have enough Information to make a comperaUve evaluation with launch events which have occurTed In the pest: "a new ESV", "the second CE satellite to be successfully orbited by the Deitim this year".

SATELLITE WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE HARRI88URG MJS.51LE AND 8PACE COMPLEX (HM8C) AT 1808Z ON 20 8avur.MBER 1988.
THE BR02 LAUNCH SYSTEM WAS U8ED TO PLACI THE ~TELJJTE INTO A 3 DEGREE ORBIT.
WSJ OBJECT NUMBER 8018 HA8 BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE PAYLOAD, However, when hi8 Informat~n Is Impremiao and hie Imowledge can add little to it, he must rmmrt to the qualified or mota-Gommented typos of messages dlm(~rJbed above.
In order to accommodate such qualified end mete~mmectary types of Informatkm, each event templets may have emaciated with It one or more mote templates contA~ing Interpretive or evaluative Information.
Thus, 88 represented In Figure 5, an Imitantiated launch tentplate produced frmn an obaervaUonal event and a primitive event (a zeroth order reporting event, ea illustrated in Figure 4) may have several additional quallficetlorm (exemplified by, hut not Ilmlted to, the mete templates llh~streted In the figure).
So, for example, a meta evaltmttve template 2 mmoclated with • laundl template exl=reales the Epalion reporterJs degree of belief or m=nfidenco In the launch parameters he rep(x~a: the object in the event template 18 belaeved by the Epalion reporter to be a CE (or Crop Enhancement) satellite from the Infometion presented In the observational relx~ by the sensor, end from hht owvl knowledge of pest occurrences of CE satellite launches, as wail as expeateth:me of pG88iblc replacement ieunchee, etc., during p~rtlculer Use Intervals.
All or none of the listed psi'easters for • launch event may be qualified In this way.
Thus, in Figure 5, the Epalk=n reporter believes that, to the best of hhl knowledge, the space object Involved In the major launch event 18 a "probable" CE or crop enhancement satellite, and that the time of launch IS "approximate\[y" 113OZ.
Each mete template ha8 field8 which Identify the source, am weft ms the Use and date of the Interpretive Informatill.
As opposed to the "infosouroe= parameter of these mote templates -which shows the ulUmate source of the Information contained in the Instantlatad templets -2.
The template and mats template structures shown in this figure are Intended to be Illustrative only: for example, the object, date/time group, and deorbit information constitute embedded templates linked to the main "launch" event template by pointers.
In addition, there are several alternatives for more economical Internal representation of mete template Ioformation, which are currently under review for the ~'~uai design and Implementation o1' this information within MATRES and within the Actfvs/Irrm~pective InformaUon System (a knowledge-based Intelligent 88alatsnt, as menUonod above), which MATRES feeds.
• Termx 584") Is NY'r, the new8 agency of the Delta Corffederetiofl, Indicating that this InformaUon came from in NYT proml wmounoement quoted (and Interpreted) by an Epalion reporter.
This distinguishes such Information frmu that relmremented by the "mmignn mete template, where the Epellon Republic reporting staff ~8algn an Identmcetlon number of their own to the satellite payload far futwe referMme.

An I~ fINtOUolt of mite templates Is to represent pimdkrtJve In/~N~tJons I.o., descriptk:m8 of events expe,~ed In the future, based on other events which have ocmHyed In the pelt, or are currently In process.
The "expect e template in Figure 5 expresses the presumable or expected pMsJlrleters of mission duration, and conaoqueRtly, the deorbit event which 18 mltlclpated for (~tober 2~ To summarize, the function of the mete templates Is to Identify and delimit evaluative commentary, which isolates the factual InformaUon presented In most zeroth order mote event reports, and Identifies Information pertaining to credibility of the event occurrence, comperebllll~/ with otilcr aim\[Jar entitles and events, prediction8 of fUtlKe related ovento, etc.
On the other hand, In addiUon to distinguishing the vsrlo4J8 Iovehl of event occuffenGe, observation, and reportIng, the fonotJon of the mete event structure Illustrated in Figures 2 and 4 Is to clearly demarcate the "Oetta versus Epallon" (in terms of the scenario described above) aspects of the messages.
The reporters of the Epailoll Republic "assign" "Specold" and "WSJ" IdeITtlflcation numbers for space object Inventory purposes; the De\[iN "denlgnate" their own apace objects with par*,JctdaJ, clanaea of object names, e.G., "Tarrex 5~59".
