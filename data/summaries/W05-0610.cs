Perceptron is a simple, fast and effective learning algorithm, which has successfully been applied to named entity recognition (Carreras et al., 2003).

Another approach is to divide the problem into several sub-problems in two layers, each of which has less imbalanced training set than the original one (Carreras et al., 2003; Sitter and Daelemans, 2003).

Table 1 presents the results of our system using three learning algorithms, the uneven margins SVM, the standard SVM and the PAUM on the CONLL2003 test set, together with the results of three participating systems in the CoNLL-2003 shared task: the best system (Florian et al., 2003), the SVM-based system (May eld et al., 2003) and the Perceptron-based system (Carreras et al., 2003).

Moreover, PAUM could be used in combination with other classi ers or in the more complicated framework such as the one in Carreras et al.(2003). Since many other tasks in Natural Language Processing, like IE, often lead to imbalanced classi cation problems and the SVM has been used widely in Natural Language Learning (NLL), we can expect that the uneven margins SVM and PAUM are likely to obtain good results on other NLL problems as well.

Statistical systems learn a statistical model or classi ers, such as HMMs (Freigtag and McCallum, 1999), Maximal Entropy (Chieu and Ng., 2002), the SVM (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; May eld et al., 2003), and Perceptron (Carreras et al., 2003).

Isozaki and Kazawa (2002) compared three commonly used methods for named entity recognition the SVM with quadratic kernel, maximal entropy method, and a rule based learning system, and showed that the SVM-based system performed better than the other two.
