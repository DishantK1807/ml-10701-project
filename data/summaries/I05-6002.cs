The project was announced on June 1 on the 2 Proposed Procedure We used a bilingual corpus (Utiyama and Isahara, 2003) to examine which semantic frames of BFN contained LUs relevant to the Japanese verb osou.

Other ongoing projects, i.e., the German FrameNet or “SALSA” (Erk et al., 2003), the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), and the Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2003), are trying to build lexical resources that are compatible with the BFN, but for Japanese at least, no data has been released in a usable form, except for a few annotation examples for verbs of motion.

11 (BFN) (Baker et al., 1998) is an ongoing research project that is attempting to meet the demand for resources that encode deeper lexical semantics by providing a semantic frame lexicon (sometimes called the “FrameNet”) and a corpus annotated for semantic information encoded in terms of semantic frames.

The anonymous reviewers of our paper pointed out that there have been some similar projects and other methodologies that have tried to translate BFN into other languages automatically, such as BiFrameNet (Chen and Fung, 2004) and Romance FrameNet2, and that it would have been better to include the comparison against them.
