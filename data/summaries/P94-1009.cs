Plan-based computational models have been proposed for similar discourse interpretation problems, e.g. indirect speech acts \[Perrault and Allen, 1980, Hinkelman, 1989\], but none of these models address the interpretation of indirect answers.

Most previous formal and computational models of conversational implicature \[Gazdar, 1979, Green, 1990, Hirschberg, 1985, Lasearides and Asher, 1991\] derive implieatures by classical or nonclassical logical inference with one or more licensing rules defining a class of implicatures.

Furthermore, our discourse-plan-based approach avoids problems faced by licensing-rule-based approaches in handling backward cancellation and multipleutterance responses \[Green and Carberry, 1992\].

Coherence relations have been used in generation \[MeKeown, 1985, Hovy, 1988, Moore and Paris, 1988, Horacek, 1992\] but none of these models generate indirect answers.
