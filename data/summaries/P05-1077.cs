Feature Vectors Having collected all nouns and their features, we now proceed to construct feature vectors (and values) for nouns from both corpora using mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989).

Corpus We parse a 6 GB newspaper (TREC9 and TREC2002 collection) corpus using the dependency parser Minipar (Lin, 1994).

Curran and Moens (2002) also report comparable results for Minipar features and simple word based proximity features.
