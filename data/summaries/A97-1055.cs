(Dolan, 1994) and (Krovetz and Croft, 1992) claim that fine-grained semantic distinctions are unlikely to be of practical value for many applications.

Semantic tags are assigned from on-line thesaura like WordNet (Basili et al, 1996) (Resnik, 1995), Roget's categories (Yarowsky 1992) (Chen and Chen, 1996), the Japanese BGH (Utsuro et al, 1993), or assigned manually (Basili et al, 1992) 1.

For example, in (Brill and Resnik, 1994) clustering PP heads according to WordNet synsets produced only a 1% improvement in a PP disambiguation task, with respect to the non-clustered method.
C94-2195
Semantic tagging has been proven useful for learning and categorising interesting relations among words, and for systematic lexical learning in sublanguages, as shown in (Basili et al, 1996) and (Basili et al, 1996b).

The set-generation algorithm is an iterative application of the algorithm proposed in (Hearst and Shutze, 1993) for creating WordNet categories of a fixed average size.
W93-0106
High ambiguity, entangled nodes, and asymmetry have already been emphasised in (Hearst and Shutze, 1993) as being an obstacle to the effective use of on-line thesaura in corpus linguistics.

Among these, in (Grishman and Sterling, 1994) a method is proposed to cluster syntactic triples, while in (Pereira and Tishby 1992, 1993), (Dagan et al., 1994) pure bigrams are analysed.
C94-2119 P93-1024 P94-1038
This approach is adopted in (Chen and Chen, 1996) and in (Basili et al, 1996) where only a dozen categories are used.
C96-1038 J96-4006
The most intuitive evaluation of the effectiveness of distributional approaches to the problem of word generalization is presented in (Grishman and Sterling, 1994).
C94-2119
In (Agirre and Rigau, 1996) a method called Conceptual Distance is proposed to reduce this problem, but the reported performance in disambiguation still do not reach 50%.

386 5 Concluding Remarks It has already been demonstrated in (Basili et al, 1996) that tagging a corpus with semantic categories triggers a more effective lexical learning.
