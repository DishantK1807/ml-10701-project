For comparison, we also apply the iterative algorithm developed by Swier and Stevenson (2004), using the same bootstrapping parameters.

In related unsupervised tasks, Riloff and colleagues have learned “case frames” for verbs (e.g., Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), while Gildea (2002) has learned roleslot mappings (but does not apply the knowledge for the labelling task).

Two exceptions are the subcategorization frame based work of Atserias et al.(2001) and the bootstrapping labeller of Swier and Stevenson (2004), but both are evaluated on only a small number of verbs and arguments.

This is achieved by adopting the scoring method of Swier and Stevenson (2004), in which we compute the portion %Frame of frame slots that can be mapped to an extracted argument, and the portion %Sent of extracted arguments from the sentence that can be mapped to the frame.

As a point of comparison, we apply the iterative backoff model from Swier and Stevenson (2004), trained on 20% of the BNC, with our frame matcher and test data.

However, the best supervised systems, using automatic parses to identify full argument phrases in PropBank, achieve about .82 on the task of identifying and labelling arguments (Pradhan et al., 2004).

The primary way that we apply the knowledge in our lexicon is via a process we call frame matching, adapted from Swier and Stevenson (2004).

To address this, we use the existing labelled corpus of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), and develop a mapping for converting the FrameNet roles to corresponding VerbNet roles.

Recent years have seen a wealth of research on one important component of semantic interpretation—automatic role labelling (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Hacioglu et al., 2004, and additional papers from Carreras and Marquez, 2004).

and Methods 5.1 The Target Verbs For ease of comparison, we use the same verbs as in Swier and Stevenson (2004), except that we measure performance over a much larger superset of verbs.
