1. INTRODUCTION Using mutual information for measuring word association has become popular since \[Church and Hanks, 1990\] defined word association ratio as mutual information between two words.

Looking at Table 3 below, if we had to ignore cooccurrences with frequency less than five (as \[Church and Hanks 1990\] did), there would be very little data.

Rather than considering significance of joint frequencies of word pairs as \[Church and Hanks, 1990\] did, our algorithm uses joint frequencies of pairs of word groups instead.

\[Brown et.al. 1992\] proves that, under the assumption of a bi-gram class model, the perplexity of a corpus is minimized when the average mutual information between word classes is maximized.

3) word associations can be used in parsing and understanding natural language, as well as in natural language generation \[Smadja and McKeown, 1990\].

\[Resnik 1992\] reported a word association ratio for identifying noun classes from a preexisting hierarchy as selectional constraints on the object of a verb.

\[Hindle 1990\] confirmed that word association ratios can be used for measuring similarity between nouns.
