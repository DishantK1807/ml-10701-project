Most recently, Chen et al.utilized FERGUS (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000) and attempted to make it more domain independent in (Chen et al., 2002).

Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 2002) and Oh and Rudnicky (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000) both studied surface generators for the air travel domain.

This problem was not discussed in (Chen et al., 2002).
C02-1138
(Chen et al., 2002) is the first paper to this authorâ€™s knowledge that attempts to create a stochastic domain independent generator for dialogue systems.
C02-1138
Work was done to try and use an independent LM, but (Rambow et al., 2001) found interrogatives to be unrepresented by a WSJ model and fell back on air travel models.
H01-1055
Bangalore et al.describe some of the quantitative measures that have been used in (Bangalore et al., 2000).
