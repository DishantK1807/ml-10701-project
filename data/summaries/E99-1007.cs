Manual classification of large numbers of verbs is a difficult and resource intensive task (Levin, 1993; Miller et ah, 1990; Dang et ah, 1998).
P98-1046
Verbs are very important sources of knowledge in many language engineering tasks, and the relationships among verbs appear to play a major role in the organization and use of this knowledge: Knowledge about verb classes is crucial for lexical acquisition in support of language generation and machine translation (Dorr, 1997), and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998).
P98-1112
First, for each verb occurrence subjects and objects were extracted from a parsed corpus (Collins 1997).
P97-1003
This assumption is not uncontroversial (Briscoe and Copestake, 1995; Levin, 1993; Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, 1997).
C96-1055
Learning Other work in automatic lexical semantic classification has taken an approach in which clustering over statistical features is used in the automatic formation of classes (Pereira et al., 1993; Pereira et al., 1997; Resnik, 1992).
P93-1024
This kind of extension of meaning does not modify subcategorization distributions (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998), although it might modify the rate of causativity, but this is an unavoidable limitation at the current state of annotation of corpora.
P98-2184
For causativity, the same counting scripts were used for both groups of verbs, but the input to the counting programs was determined by manual inspection of the corpus for verbs belonging to group 1, while it was extracted automatically from a parsed corpus for group 2 (WSJ 1988, parsed with the parser from (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
Although these properties are redundant with the intransitive/transitive distinction, recent work in machine learning (Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998) has shown that using overlapping features can be beneficial for learning in a maximum entropy framework, and we want to explore it in this setting to test H3 above.
P98-2177 W97-0301
The same can be said for crafting the rich lexical representations that are a central component of linguistic knowledge, and research in automatic lexical acquisition has sought to address this ((Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, 1997), among others).
C96-1055
Yet there have been few attempts to learn finegrained lexical classifications from the statistical analysis of distributional data, analogously to the induction of syntactic knowledge (though see, e.g., (Brent, 1993; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Resnik, 1992)).
