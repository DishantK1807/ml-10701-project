In other cases, as also descrit)ed in the work of Roche and Schabes (1995), a given structure fiTdls to undergo a rule as a consequence of s()me earlier rule ("bleeding").

Using the Brill-tagger, it also has to be taken into account that rules can be undone by a later rule (see also Roche and Schabes (1995)), as in tile word "feuilleteer" (Bug.: "leaf througlf').

Both corpora serve as input tbr the "transtbrmation rule learner" (Brill, 1995).
