Unlike in dialogue analyses carried out on completed dialogues (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), the dialogue manager needs to maintain a stack of all open discourse segments at each point in an on-going dialogue.

Other applications (Litman et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998) have been in domains that were sufficiently limited (e.g., queries about train schedules, or reading email) that the system could presume much about the user's goals, and make significant contributions to task initiative.
P98-2129 P98-2219
We also follow (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1997) in distinguishing task initiative and dialogue initiative.

This grammar is used to provide all the language modeling capabilities of the system, including the language model used in the speech recognizer, the syntactic and semantic interpretation of user utterances (Dowding et al., 1994), and the generation of system responses (Shieber et al., 1990).

Interpretation and Generation The language used in CommandTalk is derived from a single grammar using Gemini (Dowding et al., 1993), a unification-based grammar formalism.
P93-1008
In QuickSet, the user is required to confirm each spoken utterance before it is processed by the system (McGee et al., 1998).
P98-2136
Most of the agents that compose CommandTalk have been described elsewhere !for more detail, see (Moore et al., 1997)).

The CommandTalk Spoken Dialogue System* Amanda Stent, John Dowding Jean Mark Gawron, Elizabeth Owen Bratt, and Robert Moore SRI International 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025 {stent,dowding,gawron,owen,bmoore}@ai.sri.com 1 Introduction CommandTalk (Moore et al., 1997) is a spokenlanguage interface to the ModSAF battlefield simulator that allows simulation operators to generate and execute military exercises by creating forces and control measures, assigning missions to forces, and controlling the display (Ceranowicz, 1994).

While we make no theoretical claims about the nature and structure of dialogue, we are influenced by the theoretical work of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and will use terminology from that tradition when appropriate.
