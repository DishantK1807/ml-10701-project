Baron and Hirst (2004) extracted collocations with Xtract (Smadja, 1993) and classified the collocations using the orientations of the words in the neighboring sentences.

Wilson et al.(2005) worked on phrase-level semantic orientations.

Many researchers have developed several methods for this purpose and obtained good results (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kamps et al., 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Kobayashi et al., 2001).

of Semantic Orientations The semantic orientation classification of words has been pursued by several researchers (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kamps et al., 2004; Takamura et al., 2005).

This problem will be solved by incorporating other resources such as thesaurus or a dictionary,orcombiningourmethodwithothermethods using external wider contexts (Suzuki et al., 2006; Turney, 2002; Baron and Hirst, 2004).

Turney (2002) applied an internet-based technique to the semantic orientation classification of phrases, whichhadoriginallybeendevelopedforwordsentiment classification.

Some researchers are starting to work on this problem (e.g., Popescu and Etzioni (2005)).
