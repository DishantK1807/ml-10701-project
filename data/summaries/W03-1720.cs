Therefore, we introduce a Support Vector Machine(below SVM)-based chunker (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) to cover the errors made by the segmenter.

Kudoh and Matsumoto (2001), Zhang and Johnson (2003)).
N01-1025
During the testing phase, we used automatically assigned POS and chunk tags by Tsuruoka?s tagger4(Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2005) and YamCha chunker5(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
