Figure 2: Traditional Kimmo-Style System Architecture 3 History In 1989 and 1990, with colleagues at ALPNET (Beesley, 1989; Beesley, Buckwalter and Newtoil, 1989; Buckwalter, 1990; Beesley, 1990), I built a large two-level morphological analyzer for Arabic using a slightly enhanced implementation of KIMMO-style two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983, 1984; Gajek, 1983; Karttunen, 1983).

The twolc rule compiler (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) is able not only to recompile the rules automatically but to intersect them into a single rule fst.
