In fact, in Shieber and Schabes (1990) it is shown how to construct a semantic representation, which itself is a TAG.

and has been exemplified by Kaplan, et al., (1989) for LFG, Beaven etal.

The underlying formalism for the transfer is "synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars" (Shieber and Schabes \[1990\]) 1.

We rely on the French and English LTAG grammars (Abeille \[1988\], Abeille \[1.990 (b)\], Abeilld et al.\[1990\], Abeill6 and Schabes \[1989, 1990\]) that have been designed over the past two years jointly at University of Pennsylvania and University of Paris 7-Jussieu.

The underlying formalism achieving the transfer of derivations is "Synchronous Tree-Adjoining Grammars" (as described in a companion paper by Shieber and Schabes \[1990\]).
