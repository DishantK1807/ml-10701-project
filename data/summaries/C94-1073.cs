Therefore, simple syntactic heuristics had been used to collect the extra input \[Brent, 1993; Sekine, 1992\].

work Previous natural language acquisition models couht be characterized as interactive acquisition \[tang & tIirschman, 1988; Liu & Soo, I993a, 1993b; Velardi ct al., 1991\], corpus-based acquisition \[Brent, 1993; 3acobs & Zernik, 1988; Zernik, 1989\], dictionary-based acquisition \[Montemagni & Vanderwende, 1992; Sanfilippo & Pozanski, 1992\], statistics-based acquisition \[Smadja, 1991; Sekine et al, 1992\], and connectionistbased acquisition \[Paisal & Kwasny, 1990; McClelland & Kawamoto, 1986\].

of the hypothesis generation module To compare the performance of SEP with a learner that is provided with extra input, a set of sentences that had been tested in previous experiments \[Liu & Soo, 1993a, 1992a, 1992b\] was entered to SEP.
