METEOR was chosen since, unlike the more commonly used BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), it provides reasonably reliable scores for individual sentences.

The Pangloss system and work by several other researchers attempted to combine lattices from many different MT systems (Frederking et Nirenburg 1994, Frederking et al 1997; Tidhar & KÃ¼ssner 2000; Lavie, Probst et al.2004). These systems suffer from requiring cooperation from all the systems to produce compatible lattices as well as the hard research problem of standardizing confidence scores that come from the individual engines.
