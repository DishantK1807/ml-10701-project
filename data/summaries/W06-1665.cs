We use the following pointwise MI (Church and Hanks 1989): )()( ),(log),( kj kj kj wPwP wwPwwMI = We only keep meaningful combinations such that 0),( >kj wwMI . By these filtering criteria, we are able to reduce considerably the number of biterms and triterms.

Smadja, F., McKeown, K.R., 1996.

The principle of our approach is more similar to (Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
Our work is also related to (Smadja and McKeown, 1996), which tries to determine the translation of collocations.
J96-1001
The same compound (or its variant) would be difficult to 552 detect in a document talking about traveling to Java: the two words may appear at some distance or not in some specific syntactic structure as required in (Lin, 1997).
P97-1009
(Lin, 1997) also tries to solve word ambiguity by adding syntactic dependency as context.
P97-1009
The proposed approach follows the same principle as (Yarowsky, 1995), which tried to determine the appropriate word sense according to one relevant context word.
P95-1026
Again, there is much less constraint for our related terms than translations in (Smadja and McKeown, 1996).
J96-1001
Several other studies tried to filter out noise expansion (or translation) terms by considering the relations between them (Gao et al., 2002; 558 Jang et al.1999; Qiu and Frei, 1993; Bai et al.2005). However, this is insufficient to detect all the noise.
