Similarly, Hua Wu (Wu and Zhou 2003) applied synonyms relationship between two different languages to automatically acquire English synonymous collocation.

Lin (Lin 1997) described a distributional hypothesis that if two words have similar set of collocations, they are probably similar.

Smadja (Smadja 1993) proposed a statistical model by measuring the spread of the distribution of cooccurring pairs of words with higher strength.

Dagan (Dagan 1997) applied similaritybased smoothing method to solve the problem of data sparseness in statistical natural language processing.

The precision rate using the lexical statistics approach can reach around 60% if both word bi-gram extraction and n-gram extractions are taking into account (Smadja 1993, Lin 1997 and Lu et al.2003). The low precision rate is mainly due to the low precision rate of word bigram extractions as only about 30% 40% precision rate can be achieved for word bi-grams.

Church and Hanks (Church and Hanks 1990) employed mutual information to extract both adjacent and distant bi-grams that tend to co-occur within a fixed-size window.

Study in collocation extraction using lexical statistics has gained some insights to the issues faced in collocation extraction (Church and Hanks 1990, Smadja 1993, Choueka 1993, Lin 1998).
