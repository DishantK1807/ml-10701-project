In the worst case axioms are interdependent, and general algorithms for the unification of disjunctive constraints, such as the ones of Kasper (1987b) and Eisele and D6rre (1988) are likely to out-perform the techniques described here.

This work is closely related to a similar translation scheme given in Mellish (1988), but because our scheme works with slightly different labelings the results are a bit easier to understand.

He then implements the key operation of unification by applying a general technique for unification of disjunctive feature descriptions (Kasper 1988).
C88-1063
Kasper (1987a, 1987b) has designed algorithms that involve the encoding of both system networks and the associated realization rules as constraints expressed within a feature logic involving disjunction.
P87-1033
The translation of system networks into logical axioms is very similar to the one described in Mellish (1988), but by adopting a slightly different labeling scheme we obtain a little extra clarity, which helps when we come to design algorithms that make use of the axioms produced.
J88-1004
Mellish (1988) reports an application in which this route was taken with satisfactory results.
J88-1004
Our approach is very close to that of Mellish (1988), as well as to a multitude of other formalisms involving partial descriptions, such as Shieber (1986).
J88-1004
While Kasper's approach involves the translation of system networks into a more general constraint formalism, Mellish (1988) displays encodings that reduce the key operations of systemic classification to straightforward manipulations of PROLOGlike terms.
