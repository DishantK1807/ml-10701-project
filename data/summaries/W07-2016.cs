For the fine-grained All Words sense tagging task, which has always used WordNet, the system performance has ranged from our 59% to 65.2 (Senseval3, (Decadt et al., 2004)) to 69% (Seneval2, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002)).

The high scores here were foreshadowed in an evaluation involving a subset of the data last summer (Chen et al., 2006).

Since the SFG annotation is semantically oriented, the work also bears some resemblance to Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005).

OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) is a project that has annotated several layers of semantic information ??including word senses, at a high inter-annotator agreement of over 90%.

For instance, in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) senses are grouped until a 90% inter-annotator agreement is achieved.

Dependency trees have been used in a variety of NLP applications, such as relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005).

Ding and Palmer (2005) introduced a version of probabilistic extension of Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars (SDIG) to deal with the pervasive structure divergence.

Traditionally, SRL systems have been trained on either the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005) ??for two years, the CoNLL workshop (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) has made this their shared task, or the FrameNet corpus ??Senseval-3 used this for their shared task (Litkowski, 2004).

Scores were calculated using the srl-eval.pl script from the CoNLL-2005 scoring package (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Morpho-syntactic annotation of the English references and hypotheses is performed using the constraint grammar parser ENGCG (Voutilainen, 1995), and the Spanish texts are annotated using the FreeLing analyser (Carreras et al., 2004).

The main components of the systems are the following: 2.1 Linguistic processing Firstly, each text-hypothesis pair is preprocessed in order to obtain the following information for the entailment decision: ??POS: a Part of Speech Tagging is performed in order to obtain lemmas for both text and hypothesis using the Freeling POS tagger (Carreras et al., 2004).

An effort to alleviate the training data bottleneck is the Open Mind Word Expert (OMWE) project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) to collect sense-tagged data from Internet users.

Text is automatically annotated, using the SVMTool (Gimenez and M`arquez, 2004), Freeling (Carreras et al., 2004), and Phreco (Carreras et al., 2005) packages.

PoS-tagging and lemmatization are provided by the SVMTool package (Gimenez and M`arquez, 2004), and base phrase chunking is provided by the Phreco software (Carreras et al., 2005).

In English, the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) is combining sense tags with the Penn treebank.

Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.

This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources ??FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) ??that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.

Overall, however, this data indicates that the approach suggested by (Palmer, 2000) and that is being adopted in the ongoing OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) does result in higher system performance.

This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras & Marquez (2004) and Carreras & Marquez (2005)).
