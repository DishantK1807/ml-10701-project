Robust statistical syntactic parsers, made possible by new statistical techniques (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004) and by the availability of large, hand-annotated training corpora such as WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993) and Switchboard (Godefrey et al., 1992), have had a major impact on the field of natural language processing.

• Passive Structures: As noted above, Roland and Jurafsky (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998) have noticed that written language tends to have a much higher percentage of passive structures than spoken language.

Our experiments show that 4The 14 verbs used in Briscoe and Carroll (1997) are ask, begin, believe, cause, expect, find, give, help, like, move, produce, provide, seem and sway.

We used the 14 verbs 4 selected by Briscoe and Carroll (1997) and evaluated our results of these verbs against the SCF entries in two gold standards: COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) and a manually constructed SCF set from the training data.

This Dependency F-measure differs in detail from similar measures in Xue and Palmer (2004).

As noted in Engel et al.(2002), statistical parsers usually condition the probability of a constituent on the types of its neighboring constituents.

For example, SCFs have been used for verb disambiguation and classification (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Lapata and Brew, 2004; Merlo et al., 2005) and SCCs for semantic role labeling (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Punyakanok et al., 2005).

All these results seem to suggest that adding punctuation in speech transcription is of little help to statistical parsers including at least three state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Bikel, 2004).

In addition, this way of evaluating the extraction of SCCs also matches the practice in some NLP tasks such as semantic role labeling (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

Roland and Jurafsky (1998) have suggested that there are substantial subcategorization differences between written corpora and spoken corpora.

Following Manning (1993), we empirically determined the value of p.
P93-1032
Again, Roland and Jurafsky (1998) have suggested that one major subcategorization difference between written and spoken corpora is that spoken corpora have a much higher percentage of the zero-anaphora construction.

Extraction System We briefly outline our SCF extraction system for automatically extracting SCFs from corpora, which was based on the design proposed in Briscoe and Carroll (1997).

Our evaluator has two parts: the Binomial Hypothesis Test (Brent, 1993) and a back-off algorithm (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000).

Both Roark (2001) and Engel et al.(2002) report that removing punctuation from both training and test data (Switchboard) results in only 1% decrease in their parser’s accuracy.
