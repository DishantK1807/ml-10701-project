An example (Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998)) is the case in which fk represents a syntactic relation between we C~ and another word in its context.

We assume that arguments are not statistically independent (in case they are, the representation of a concept is more simple, see Bruce and Wiebe, (1999)).

Again, see Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998) and Bruce and Wiebe, (1999) for examples of similarity functions.

See Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998) for examples.

Let us consider the probabilistic context-based algorithm in Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998), where a feature is defined by: fk: (syntactic_relation, wl, wi) (e.g.

An analysis of this issue as applied to probabilistic WSD learners may be found in Bruce and Wiebe (1999).

For example, the Mutual Information measures the strength of a correlation between co-occurring arguments, and the Plausibility (Cucchiarelli, Luzi and Velardi (1998)) assigns a weight to a feature vector, depending upon the degree of ambiguity of its arguments and the frequency of its observations in a corpus.
