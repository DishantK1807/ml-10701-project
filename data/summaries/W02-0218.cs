DMT is then related to another dialogue analysis method (Carletta, Isard et al.1997). DMT is an exercised framework, meaning that it has been applied to dialogues from a diversity of situations.

For example, given an ordinary context, DMT might represent the question “Do you have a stone circle at the bottom?” and also the question “Towards what?” ((Carletta, Isard et al.1997) p.

One of the well known dialogue analysis schemes, 6 used in the Edinburgh Maptask, is described in (Carletta, Isard et al.1997) (Carletta, Isard et al.1996) How does MAP compare to DMT?

In designing the MAP representation, this was recognized: “It is also theoretically possible at any point in the dialogue to refuse to take on the proposed goal… .Often refusal takes the form of ignoring the initiation … However, it is also possible to make such refusals explicit… . These cases were sufficiently rare …that it was impractical to include a category for them.” (Carletta, Isard et al.1997), p.
