also basically used the above method, but they proposed a soft clustering scheme, in which membership of a word in a class is probabilistic (Pereira et al., 1993).

Brown et al.proposed a class-based n-gram model, which generalizes the n-gram model, to predict a word from previous words in a text (Brown et al., 1992).

the similarity between classes (step 3) In step 3, we measure the similarity between two primitive classes by using the method given by Hindle (Hindle, 1990).
P90-1034
Using this model, they successfully l)redieted which unobserved cooccurrenccs were more likely than others, and estimated the probability of the cooecurrences (Dagan et al., 1994).
P94-1038
proposed a similarity-based model in which each word is generalized, not to its own specific class, but to a set of words which are most similar to it (Dagan et al., 1993).

Since a handmade thesaurus is not slfitahle for machine use, and expensive to compile, automatical construction of~a thesaurus has been attempted using corpora (Hindle, 1990).
