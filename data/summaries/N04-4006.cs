algorithm Our discriminative n-gram model training approach uses the perceptron algorithm, as presented in (Roark et al., 2004), which follows the general approach presented in (Collins, 2002).

As suggested in (Collins, 2002), we use the averaged perceptron when applying the model to held-out or test data.
