Abstract
The lack of internal information of Chinese
synthetic words has become a crucial prob-
lemforChinesemorphologicalanalysissys-
tems which will face various needs of seg-
mentationstandardsforupperNLPapplica-
tions in the future. In this paper, we first
categorizeChinesesyntheticwordsintosev-
eraltypesaccordingtotheirinsidesemantic
and syntactic structure, and then propose a
methodtorepresenttheseinsideinformation
of word by applying a tree-based structure.
Thenwetrytoautomaticallyidentifythein-
ner morphological structure of 3-character
syntheticwordsbyusingalargecorpusand
try to add syntactic tags to their internal
structure. We believe that this tree-based
word internal information could be useful
in specifying a Chinese synthetic word seg-
mentationstandard.
1 Introduction
Chinesewordsegmentationhasalwaysbeenadiffi-
cult and challenging task in Chinese language pro-
cessing. Several Chinese morphological analysis
systems have been developed by different research
groups and they all have quite good performance
when doing segmentation of written Chinese. But
therestillremainsomeproblems. Thebiggestoneis
that each research group has its own segmentation
standard for their system, which means that there
is no single segmentation standard for all tagged
corpora which can be agreeable across different re-
search groups. And we believe that this situation
slowsdowntheprogressofChineseNLPresearch.
Among all the differences of segmentation stan-
dards, the segmentation method for Chinese syn-
thetic words is the most controversial part because
Chinesesyntheticwordshaveaquitecomplexstruc-
ture and should be represented by several segmen-
tion levels according to the needs of upper applica-
tionssuchasMT,IRandIME.
For instance, a long(upper level) segmentation
unit may simplify syntactic analysis and IME ap-
plicationbutasmall(lowerlevel)segmentationunit
might be better for information retrieval or word-
based statistical summarization. But for now, no
Chinese morphological analysis system can do all
kindsoftheseworkwithonlyonesegmentationstan-
dard.
Furthermore,althougheverysegmentationsystem
has goodperformance, intheanalysisofrealworld
text, there are still many out-of-vocabulary words
whichcouldnotbeeasilyrecognizedbecauseofthe
flexibility of Chinese synthetic word construction,
especiallypropernamesthatcouldalwaysappearas

InordertomakeourChinesemorphologicalanal-
ysis system to recognize more out-of-vocabulary

we try to analyze the structure of the internal infor-

2 Detailed
study of Chinese synthetic
words
2.1 Definition
of Chinese words
There has always been a common belief that Chi-
nese 'doesn't have words', but instead has 'charac-
ters', or that Chinese 'has no morphology' and so is
'morphologicallyimpoverished',becauseinChinese
a'word'isbynomeansaclearandintuitivenotion.
ButactuallyfornativeChinesespeakers,theyknow
that words are those lexical entries which represent
acompleteconceptandoccurinnatelyintheformof
specificlanguagerulesbasedonthespeaker'smental
lexicon.
ThoughtherearealotofwaystoclassifyChinese
words,webelievethatChinesewordsshouldbefirst
divided into single-morpheme words and synthetic
words according to the way of construction of their
internalparts.
Single-morpheme words are those that could not
be divided into smaller parts when representing as
thewholeconcept. Inotherwords,ifwedividesin-
gle morpheme words into characters or parts, the
meaningofindividualpartsbecomeindependentand
doesnotindicateanyconnectionwiththemeaningof
the original word. Following are the three different
typesofsingle-morphemewords:
 one-characterwords:
人[human],马[horse],车[vehicle]
`one-morphemewords:
鹌鹑[quail],翡翠[jadeite]
鸳鸯[mandarinduck]
´transliterationwords:
比萨[pizza],肯德基[Kentucky]
阿司匹林[aspirin]
The first kind is obvious single words in that an
ordinarycharacterinChinesestandsforanindepen-
dentmorphemewithoneorseveralsenses. Thesec-
ondkindshowsthosewordswhicharecomposedof
several characters and always used as a whole. For
the last kind, as can be seen from the above exam-
ples, if we divide肯德基[Kentucky] into '肯[can]',
'德[moral]' and '基[base]', it definitely can not indi-
cate the meaning of the well-known fried chicken
restaurant chain from those three characters. So
thesethreekindsofsingle-morphemewordsshould
be segmented as one word in any morphological
analysissystems.
However, it becomes much more complicated
whendealingwithsyntheticwords. Generally,syn-
thetic words are the type of words which are com-
posed of single-morpheme words and represent a
newentityormeaningwhichcanbeindicatedfrom
the internal constituents. According to this defini-
tion,ifwedividesyntheticwordsintosmallerparts,
we could still somehow guess the original meaning
from the meaning of internal parts despite the fact
thatitmaynotbeaverypreciseone. Forexamplethe
word司机[driver]. Ifwedon'tknowthemeaningof
'司机',butwedoknowthemeaningof'司'is'control'
and the meaning of '机' is 'machine'. Then we can
guessthemeaningof'司机'maybeconnectedwith
'control'and'machine',andactuallytherealmeaning
isthepersonwhodrives(controls)acar(machine).
In Chinese language, according to the encoding
standard of GB2312, there are about 6,763 com-
monlyusedcharacters. Andinourownsystemdic-
tionary which has about 129,440 word entries, the
numberofone-characterwordsisonly6,188(about
4.78%). Fromthesefigures,weknowthatmostChi-
nese words belong to synthetic words and a deep
analysisforsyntheticwordsisnecessaryforChinese
languageprocessing.
2.2 Classification
of Chinese synthetic words
The Synthetic words may be understood as the re-
sult or 'output' of a word-formation rule in Chi-
neselanguage. ClassificationoftheseChinesesyn-
theticwordsisadifficulttaskbecausethe'formation
rule' is not so obvious and sometimes even a native
speaker can not determine which category a word
54
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
Figure1: TypesofChinesesyntheticwords
should belong to. However, since it is quite impor-
tant to understand the structure of Chinese words,
there have been a lot of research on classification
ofChinesesyntheticwordsfrombothlinguisticand
computational points of view until now. Each of
themhasdividedsyntheticwordsintodifferentcat-
egories according to their own criteria. In our re-
search,basedonourexperienceonChinesemorpho-
logicalanalysisandunknownworddetection,wedi-
vide Chinese synthetic words into the categories as
shown in Figure 1 to help us understand the inner
constituentsofthem.
2.3 Compound
words
Compoundwords,whoseinternalconstituentshave
some syntactic relations with each other, can be
divided into the following six kinds according to
(YuanjianHe,2004 ).
• Subject-predicate[主谓式]
words that only have subject and predicate
parts. This type is subdivided into two types:
SVandVS.
VS:搬运/工[porter],裁判/员[referee]
SV:胃/下垂[gastroptosia],地/震[earthquake]
• Verb-object[动宾式]
words that have verb and object parts, which
containstwotypes: VOandOV.
OV:党/代表[representativeofparty]
VO:理/发[haircut],反/政府[anti-government]
• Verb-modification[动词偏正式]
wordsthathaveaverbpartandanadjunctpart
whichareneithersubjectnorobjectoftheverb.
The adjunct part always shows the property of
the verb part or be the media of the verb's ac-
tion.ThistypecontainsVXandXV.
VX:放大/器[amplifier],冲印/店[printshop]
XV:自动/控制[automaticcontrol]
批/发[wholesale]
• Predicate-complement[述补式]
words that have a verb part and a complement
part,whichshowstheresult,directionoraspect
of the action. This type also have two kinds:
VVandVA.
VV:跑/出来[runningoutof]
打发/掉[getridof]
VA:染/红[dyeingred]
• Parallel-combination[联合式]
words that have a coordinate structure where
themeaningsofconstituentsaresame,similar,
relatedoropposite.
Example:开/关[switch],学/习[learning]
国/家[nation],兄/弟[brother]
中/日/韩[China,JapanandKorea]
• Noun-modification[名词偏正式]
wordsthathaveanounpartwhichistherootof
theword,andamodificationpartwhichshows
thepropertyofthenounpart.
Example:电/脑[computer],书/架[bookshelf]
汽车/站[busstop]
Herewehavemadesomecompromiseswiththese
categories mentioned above based on the simplic-
ity of machine learning process and our experience
on tagging compund words. For example, we only
55
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
define SV and VS as the subject-predicate type be-
cause it will make machine learning process much
easier when it comes to those words with a struc-
turelikeSVOorSVX.Futhermore, inthecasethat
a word with an internal constituent which has both
NN and VV parts of speech, even human annota-
tors can not easily tell which type this word should
be categarized into between noun-modification and
verb-modification. So we tagged all these words to
verb-modification when they have an internal part
withbothNNandVVpartsofspeech.
2.4 Morphologically
derived words
Morphologically derived words are those which
have specific word formation. It can be categoried
intothefollowingtypes:
• Merging
words that are composed of two adjacent and
semantically related words, which have some
characters in common. It could be seen as a
kindofabbreviation.
Example:中学+小学 中小学
[middleandpreliminaryschool]
上文+下文 上下文[context]
北京市+市长 北京市长
[mayerofBeijingcity]
• Reduplication
words that contain some reduplicated charac-
ters. There are eight main patterns of redu-
plication: AA, ABAB, AABB, AXA, AXAY,
XAYA,AABandABB.
Example:听/听[listen],雄/赳赳[valiantly]
研究/研究[research]
• Affixation
words that are composed of a word and an af-
fix(eitheraprefix,asuffixoraninfix).
Example:副主席[vicepresident]
总工程师[ExecutiveEngineer]
看不到[can'tsee]
听得见[canhear]
调查局[bureauofinvestigation]
安全厅[securityagency]
2.5 Exceptions
Apart from compound words and morphologically
derivedwords,therestillexistsometypesofwords
which need discussion about whether they belong
to synthetic words or not. However, we can use
someothermethodsliketimeexpressionextraction
ornamedentityrecognitiontodealwiththesekinds
ofwords.
• Abbreviations
expressions that have a short appearance, but
standforalongterm.
Example:中共 中国共产党
[CommunistPartyofChina]
• Factoids
expressions that indicate date, time, number,
money,scoreorrange. Thiskindofexpressions
havealargevariationintheirappearance.
Example: 2007.1.30
五点半[fivethirty]
三块五毛六[3.56yuan]
• Idioms,proverbs,sayingsandpoems
expressions that usually consist of more than
three characters and always have a special
meaning.
Example:门可罗雀[sparselyvisited]
先天下之忧而忧
[betheFirsttobearhardships]
3 Previous
research and tree-based
method
3.1 Previous
research
Until now, there is little specific research on Chi-
nesesyntheticwords. However,everyinstitutionhas
itsownwayofdealingwithsyntheticwordsintheir
segmentationstandardwhendoingChinesemorpho-
logical analysis. There are two main previous re-
searchesontheanalysisofChinesesyntheticwords.
The first one is done by Microsoft ( Andi Wu,
2003 )bycreatingacustomizablesegmentationsys-
temofChinesemorphologicallyderivedwords. This
system uses a parameter driven method which can
divide synthetic words into different levels of word
56
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
components based on some pre-defined rules, ac-
cording to the needs of different NLP application.
For instance, in machine translation, we will trans-
late '烤面包器' into 'toaster' if our system dictio-
nary has this kind of information. But if we do
not have this entry in our dictionary, we have to
split '烤面包器[toaster]' into lower level such as
'烤[bake] /面包[bread] /器[machine]', the transla-
tionofwhichwillprobablygiveussomeinformation
about the original meaning of the whole word. Al-
thoughthissystemachieveshigherscorethanother
systems that do not have synthetic analysis, it only
takes morphologically derived words into account,
which means it does not contain information about
internalsyntacticrelations.
The second one ( C. Huang, 1997 ) is actually a
proposal of segmentation standard rather than a de-
tailed synthetic word analysis research. It is first
used by Sinica when doing the tagging task of Chi-
nese word segmentation. If the tagging object is
a synthetic word, one tag among w0, w1 and w2,
whichstandfor'faithful','truthful'and'graceful',will
be selected for it. For example, if we have a syn-
thetic word '北京市安全厅[security agency of Bei-
jingcity]',thistaggingmethodwilldividetheword
asfollows:
<w2 >
<w1 ><w0 >北京</w0 ><w0 >市</w0 ></w1 >
<w1 ><w0 >安全</w0 ><w0 >厅</w0 ></w1 >
</w2 >
Again,thiskindofmethoddoesnottakewordin-
ternal syntactic relations into account either. Fur-
thermore,itevendoesnothavethePOSinformation
of different levels of word, thus can not be used to
constructacustomizablesystem.
3.2 Synthetic
word analysis with tree-based
structure information
For specifying consistent Chinese segmentation
standardforourmorphologicalanalysissystemand
fertilizingtheinformationofourdictionary,wepro-
pose a synthetic word analysis method with tree-
basedstructureinformation.
We assume that words which are already in our
currentsystemdictionarycouldbewordcomponents
of other out-of-vocabulary synthetic words. So the
first thing to do is to classify all synthetic words
inourcurrentdictionaryintothecategoriesdefined
insection2.2. Becauseintuitivelymost2-character
words,thoughtheycouldhaveinternalsyntacticre-
lations, are often used as single words by native
speakersandhavealreadybeenregisteredaslexical
entries in our Chinese dictionary, we can first clas-
sify all 3-character words into those categories and
link their internal components to 1-character words
and2-characterwordswhicharealreadyinourdic-
tionary.
After finishing the internal structure annotation
for 3-character words, we can easily construct 4-
character or 5-character words' structure by using
3-character and 2-character words' information and
storethesestructureinformationintosyntheticword
dictionary.
Finally, when we get a long synthetic word, we
can build a tree structure recursively like in Figure
2 byusingtheconstituentwords'internalstructures,
whichhavealreadybeenstoredinoursyntheticword
dictionary.
Figure 2: Synthetic word tree of '副国务院发言人
[vicespokesmanofStateDepartment]'
When constructing this kind of tree, we can use
someruleswhichhavethefollowingform:
A+B Category
or A+B+C  Category
where A, B and C are parts of speech, affixation
orotherpropertiesofwordcomponents.
3.3 Annotation
of morphologically derived
words in system dictionary
Usually, in Chinese, 2-character words are thought
and used as single words by native speakers. And
words which have more than two characters are of-
ten synthetic words which can be categorized into
57
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
compoundwordsormorphologicallyderivedwords.
So during our work of analyzing Chinese synthetic
words,wefirstchoose3-characterwordsasourmain
target in that starting from 3-character words will
give us a good chain effect when analyzing words
whichhavemorethanthreecharacters.
At first, there is no other resource at hand ex-
cept for the morphological analysis system dictio-
nary with 129440 entries. Because a standard set
with all category information of Chinese synthetic
words is needed in further research, we first ex-
tracted 1000 3-character words from our dictionary
and annotated them by hand according to the cate-
gories introduced in section 2. As the result of hu-
subject-predicate 4.8%
verb-object 2.0%
verb-modification 21.3%
predicate-complement 3.2%
parallel-combination 0.2%
noun-modification 62.9%
single-morphemeword 5.4%
Table1: Compoundwordsin1000words
manannotation,Table 1 and 2 showthedistribution
of compound words and morphologically derived
words. In Table 1 , although about 6% of the 1000
words are single-morpheme words, we still can see
thatnoun-modificationwordsoccupythelargestpart
(62.9%)insyntheticwordsfromasyntacticpointof
view. Table 2 givesustheinformationthatmostsyn-
prefix infix suffix merging reduplication

Table 2: Morphologically derived words in 1000
words
theticwords(83%)haveaninternalstructurewitha
suffix.
Since most 3-character Chinese words have the
structure such as 'two+one' or 'one+two' character
formation, it is obvious that we should first look at
noun-modification words with frequently used suf-
fixesasthebeginningofouranalysis. Wecouldget
a list of characters of possible affixation from this
processtoo. Furthermore,wealsofindthatparallel-
combinationwordsandreduplicationwordstendto
have some fixed structures which makes them easy
torecognize.
4 Experiment
on Morphologically derived
words
In order to apply our proposed tree-based analysis
method, we first have to annotate all 3-character
words in our dictionary with their internal parts
linked to 2-character and 1-character words. Be-
causemostChinese3-characterwordshaveprefixor
suffixstructure,weassumethatitwillbemucheffi-
cientforustoannotate3-characterwordsifwecan
classifythemfromtheaspectofmorphologicallyde-
rivedwords.
Becausewedon'thaveanyotherusefulresources
exceptChineseGigaword(CGW),Wefirstcomputed
mutualinformationforall3-characterwordsintwo
ways by referencing the CGW. For example, if we
haveawordABCandweassumethatA,C,ABand
BCareallindependententriesinourdictionary,we
compute the mutual information Mi-pre for A and
BC, and the mutual information Mi-suf for AB and
C.
SinceA,C,ABandBCareallindependentwords,
iftheresultshowsMi-pre <Mi-suf,wecouldsaythat
therelationbetweenAandBCismoreindependent
thantherelationbetweenABandC,whichmeansit
is more possible that A and some other 2-character
word XY cound form the word AXY. So the possi-
bilityofAbeingaprefixisgreaterthanthepossibil-
ityofCbeingasuffix. Thenwecouldconcludethat
thewordABChasaprefixinternalstructure. Other-
wise,wecouldsayithassuffixinternalstructure.
Afterthisprocess,wegotaMi(Mi-preorMi-suf)
andapossibleinternalstructure(prefixorsuffix)for
every 3-character word in system dictionary. By
comparingtheseresultstothe1000extractedwords
whoseinternalstructurehasbeenalreadyknown,we
caneasilygetthecorrectoneswhosepossibleinter-
nal structure is the same as the ones annotated by
hand.
Except for the ones which have infix, merging
or redplicationstructure, thereare920wordsinthe
1000 extracted words which are tagged as prefix or
suffix structure by hand. After comparing, we got
58
Sixth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing
676 out of 920 words(73.48%), which was divided
correctly by only looking at the internal mutual in-
formationinalargecorpus(ChineseGigaword).
The above result shows that overall accuracy is
quitelowbyonlytakingaccounttheinternalmutual
informationwhenclassifyingprefixandsuffixstruc-
ture. Someexamplesofwronglyclassifiedwordsare
showninTable 3 .

Table3: Examplesofwronglydividedwordsbyonly

As shown in Table 3 , most uncorrect ones are
words having suffix internal structure but wrongly
classified to have prefix internal structure. This is
becauseweonlycountedthefrequenciesofinternal
partsofwordswithoutconsiderringtheirproperties
such as parts of speech and the frequencies that the
internalpartsshowoutataparticularposition,etc.
Inordertoimprovethewholeaccuracywhenrec-
ognizingprefixorsuffixinternalstructureautomati-
cally,weusedanSVMclassifierwiththefollowing
features(inthecaseof3-characterstringABC):
1.internalpart: A,C,BC,AB,ABC
2.posofeachinternalpart:
pos(A),pos(C),pos(BC),pos(AB),pos(ABC)
3.frequencyofeachpartinChineseGigaword:
fre(A),fre(C),fre(BC),fre(AB),fre(ABC)
4.mutualinformationofinternalpart:

(In the actual classification process, we set the fre-
quency range by 2000 and the mutual information
rangebylog 10)
Afterdividing80%of920wordsintotraningset
and20%intotestingset,theaccuracyofSVMclas-
sifieris94.02%. Theprecisionandrecallareshown

Table 4: Results of Recall and Precision for words
whichhaveprefixorsuffixstructure
nallywegettheresultofexperiment(B)showninthe
secondrowofTable 4 .
This result is quite unbalanced because there
are only a few intances of prefixes both in
training(72/736=9.78%)andtesting(18/184=9.78%)
sets. This is the reason of low recall in classifying
instances of prefixes. The following words are the
oneswhichwerewronglyclassified.
主色调，土坷垃，大批量，小卖部，山大王
市中心，菲军方，零备件，学联会，罗影剧
It turns out that these words contains mainly two
types: the first type contains word like '大批量', a
prefixstructurewordwhoselastcharacterhasaquite
highprobabilitytobeasuffix. Thismakesitdifficult
forSVMtodeterminetowhichclassthewholeword
shouldbeclassified; anexampleofthesecondtype
is suffix structure word like '罗影剧', whose front
part'罗影'doesnotappearintheChineseGigaword
independently, which in the end make it unsure for
SVMtoclassifyitintosuffixstructureword.
Though there are some words that were wrongly
categorized, we still got a overall accuracy of
94.57% which would be much higher if we recur-
sivelyuseSVMsforclassification. Webelievethat
this method could classify morphologically derived
wordsquiteefficientlyifweaddsomemorerulesfor
recognizing merging and reduplication words. And
byapplyingthetree-basedmethod,wecouldusethis
methodonwordswithmorethan3charactersinfu-
ture.
