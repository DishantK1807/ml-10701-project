Gerdemann and van Noord (1999) implement leftmost longest-match replacement in FSA as the operator replace(Target, LeftContext,RightContext), where Target is a transducer defining the actual replacement, and LeftContext and RightContext are regular expressions defining the leftand rightcontext of the rule, respectively.

We performed several experiments, in which the amount of' training data, the algorithm (Brill's original formulation and 'lazy' variants (Samuel et al., 1998)), and the number of rule templates varied.
P98-2188
Karttunen (1995) argues that many phonological and morphological rules can be interpreted as rules which replace a certain portion of the input string.
P95-1003
Samuel et al.(1998) therefore propose an efficient, 'lazy', alternative, based on Monte Carlo sampling of the rules.
P98-2188
To improve the performance of our system, we used transformation-based learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995).

State Calculus As argued in Kaplan and Kay (1994), Karttunen (1995), Karttunen et al.(1997), and elsewhere, many of the rules used in phonology and morphology can be analysed as special cases of regular expressions.

4 Transformation-based grapheme to phoneme conversion Brill (1995) demonstrates that accurate part-ofspeech tagging can be learned by using a two-step process.

experiments For the experiments with TBL we used the #-TBLpackage (Lager, 1999).
