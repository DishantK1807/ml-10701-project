Webber, Bonnie L., and Baldwin, Breck (1992).
P92-1013
Webber and Baldwin (1992) have examined the phenomenon called "context change" in discourse, which refers to the movement from subdialog to subdialog (or from segment to segment).
P92-1013
Earlier researchers who have investigated this insight are Erman et al.(1980), Walker (1978), Fink and Biermann (1986), Mudler and Paulus (1988), Carbonell and Pierrel (1988), Young (1990), and Young et al.(1989). The expected utterances from subdialogs other than the current one can indicate that a shift from the current subdialog is occurring.

Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991) extend the plan recognition model of Litman and Allen (1987) to consider variable initiative dialog.
P91-1004
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) propose a definition of dialog control based on the utterance type of the speaker: question, assertion, command, prompt.

Grosz and Sidner (1986) use the notation DP and DSP to stand for "discourse purpose" and "discourse segment purpose".

This is the intentional structure of Grosz and Sidner (1986), the goaloriented mechanism that gives direction to the interaction.

The semantic interpretation of sentences in realistic situations sometimes can be enabled by abduction mechanisms, as described by Hobbs et al.(1988). Abduction is needed when a literal interpretation of incoming tokens will not match the items or relationships in the existing database; it provides a mechanism to "coerce" a specific and literal meaning into a meaning that accounts for the sentence context.

Many researchers have studied the properties of such segments, including linguistic and intonational markers to delineate them (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986), the resolution of noun phrases within the context of a segment (Grosz 1978; Reichman 1985), and their semantic self-consistency (Hobbs 1979).

These are called "segments" by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and constitute the linguistic structure defined in their paper.

This concept is described, for example, in Kobsa and Wahlster (1988, 1989), Chin (1989), Cohen and Jones (1989), Finin (1989), Lehman and Carbonell (1989), Morik (1989), and Paris (1988).

For example, Damerau (1981), Miller, Herschman, and Kelly (1978) on the LADDER system, and Biermann, Ballard, and Sigmon (1983) reported software failures at the rates of approximately 5, 2, and 2 percents, respectively.

This is the attentional structure described by Grosz and Sidner (1986), and its most important function in our system is to predict the meaning structures the user is likely to communicate in an input.

10. Theoretical Issues from the Literature Grosz and Sidner (1986) have given a high-level theory of dialog.

See, for example, Allen and Perrault (1980), Allen (1983), Kautz (1991), Litman and Allen (1987), Pollack (1986), and Carberry (1988, 1990).

A third interesting project has produced the TINA system (Seneff 1992), which uses probabilistic networks to parse token sequences provided by a speech recognition system, SUMMIT, created by Zue et al.(1989). The networks and their probabilities are created automatically from grammatical rules and text samples input by the designer.

This is a variable initiative dialog, as studied by Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991), Novick (1988), Whittaker and Stenton (1988), and Walker and Whittaker (1990).

According to Hobbs et al.(1988), the second sentence will require proving there exists x lube-oil (x), and the problem is to find a logical connection between the fluid of sentence one and the "lube oil".

Expectation of user responses provides a model of the attentional state described by Grosz and Sidner (1986).
