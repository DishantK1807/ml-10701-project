1:35	Text Summarization Branches Out Proceedings of the ACL-04 Workshop Marie-Francine Moens and Stan Szpakowicz, co-chairs Held in cooperation with ACL-2004 25-26 July 2004 Forum Convention Centre Barcelona, Spain A Word from the Co-Chairs Text summarization is still largely in a research phase, and has so far focused on news text, but it is increasingly becoming a tool for information search and selection in a variety of media.
2:35	For example, summarizing is a necessity when showing content on the screen of a mobile device.
3:35	Texts integrated in multimedia documents have different genres or types, but they all require the same flexibility in the presentation of summaries by allowing parameterized compression rates and integration in a mixed-media format.
4:35	Recently, text summarization technologies have advanced a lot, thanks in a large measure to the Document Understanding Conferences (DUC), sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the USA.
5:35	The ACL-2004 text summarization workshop in Barcelona aims both to broaden the scope of summarization beyond textual news stories and to make more people interested in this challenging field that intersects natural language processing and information retrieval.
6:35	That was the thinking behind the title of our workshop: Text Summarization Branches Out.
7:35	We received 33 papers from 12 countries: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Spain, UK and USA.
8:35	The submissions covered a diverse selection of cuttingedge topics.
9:35	We accepted 14 full papers and 3 short papers.
10:35	Curiously, the most prominently represented is work on the quality of summaries.
11:35	Reliable evaluation metrics and procedures are essential if we want to advance the state of the art in summarization.
12:35	There are interesting studies that compare various summarization technologies and compute how their results correlate with human-made summaries.
13:35	Another sizable group of papers discuss sentence compression and information fusion, novel and useful approaches to summarization in a world of small mobile devices with their miniature screens.
14:35	The workshop moves beyond news stories: we have papers that deal with legal texts, figures and graphics, subtitles, technical reports, computer product reviews and email.
15:35	As far as the summarization techniques are concerned, the papers show a mix of statistical techniques and linguistically motivated natural language processing techniques, including semantic analysis and discourse analysis.
16:35	Automated reasoning techniques allow fusion and understanding of content.
17:35	Machine learning, supervised or unsupervised, still has a major role to play.
18:35	The workshop features two panels.
19:35	The first panel will look backward, attempting to summarize (yes)!
20:35	progress especially in the last ten years.
21:35	The second panel will look forward to the near and more distant future of summarization technologies.
22:35	We are hugely obliged to Roxana Angheluta for being the chair of our instance of CyberChair, Richard van de Stadts fantastic application that helped us organizing the workshop.
23:35	We thank Eduard Hovy and Dragomir Radev for their crucial advice and valuable comments.
24:35	We are indebted to Inderjeet Mani for agreeing to give the invited talk.
25:35	We acknowledge the assistance of the ACL2004 workshop chairs, and of local organizers who helped schedule the event.
26:35	Last, but certainly not least, we are very grateful to the members of the Program Committee for the time they generously devoted to reviewing the papers.
27:35	Three referees read each paper in a blind-reviewing process.
28:35	Welcome to the ACL-2004 workshop Text Summarization Branches Out.
29:35	Enjoy!
