LIN~~JISTICS Alexander T Borgida 68 ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS MINUTES: 16th Annual Business Meeting 26 July 1978 University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois Jonathan Allen, President, presiding MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING Allen noted that the minutes of the previous meeting had been published in the Finite String, Volume 14, Number 3-, Microfiche 65 of the American Journal of Com~utational Linauis tics.
14:781	FINANCIAL STATUS Don Walkw, Secretary-Treasurer, reviewed the financial status of the Association, a copy of which is attached to these Minutes.
15:781	He presented income and expehses both for 1'977 and for 1978 through 21 July.
16:781	The balances of $6,332.19 for 1977 and $7,060.63 for 1978 constitute ajs9et9 of $13,39r.82.
17:781	However, the major costs for AJCI, for the current year are yet, to be incurred, and dues for AFIPS have not yet been billed, At the same time, the $1,000 advance to cover costs of the TINLAP-2 Meeting is likely be returned, along with a portion of the excess of income over expenses, which will be shared with ACM/SIGART.
18:781	The indebtedness of the Association ta the Center for Applied Linguistics, which housed the previous Secretariat, has been paid off.
19:781	Of the total of $13,486:06, funds from the previous Secretariat provided $9,913.92; $3,572.14 was taken out of income for 1977.
20:781	I Walker remarked that the income item from AFIPS for 1977 of $2,365, which refledted a disbursement of surplus funds from the National Computer Conference, was unlikely to be repeated again soon.
21:781	AFIPS is in the process of creatAfig 2 new journal, ABACUS, modeled after Scientific American, and future surpluses probably will be used to defray or at least to backup the startup,costs.
22:781	The journal is expected to be self-sustaining, and might eventually show a profit.
23:781	The current balance in the TINLAP-1 Account is $109.41; approximately 75 copies remain.
24:781	MEMBERSHIP Walker reported membership figures for 1977 of 500 individual and 201 institutional, for a total of 701.
25:781	The current figures for 1978, through 21 July, are 405 individual and 208 institutional, for a total of 613.
26:781	A slightly more detailed breakdown is attached to these Minutes.
27:781	EDITOR 'S REPORT Dave Hays, Edito-r of the AJCL, announced thaG he was resigning, effective at the end of tb year.
28:781	The next issue will include the TINLAP Proceedings; the final issue of the current year will contain a complete index for the five years of its publication.
29:781	The Jourrlal wa3 established in 1974 as an NSF-sp,onaored experiment in microfiche pub1icat;ion.
30:781	Anticipating the implications of George Heidornta survey (see below), Hays remarked that this mode of publication is likely to be replaced by microprocessor technology and might never repeive a full scale trial.
31:781	Allep expressed the gratitude of t,he Association to Hays for his devotion, his constructivenes~, and his tireless efforts in establishing and sustaihing the A JCL . This tribute was affirmed by the members.
32:781	Allen then announced that Heidorn, currently Associate Editor, would replace Hays as Editor in January.
33:781	A NEW FORMAT FOR THE AJCL Heidorn presented the results of his survey of the qembership regarding a new format for the AJCL.
34:781	Of 513 questionnaires mailed (to both current members and to members ~ho paid for 1977 but not yet for 1978); 212 were ret;'urned.
35:781	The responses favored crea'tion of a hard copy edition, similar in format to the Communications of the ACM, with or without an acoompanying microfiche version.
36:781	Most members felt that such a change would encourage a wider readership and an increase in the submission of techical articles, A more comprehensive report by Heidorn is included elsewhere in this iswe.
37:781	Allen reported that the ExecubSve Committee, after reviewing Heidorn's findings, has decided to issue the Journal in the new format with both hard copy and microfiche versions sent to each membep, beginning with the first issue of 1979.
38:781	The microfiche also may contain appendixes for technical articles, program listings, and other material of interest to the membership but less appropriate for Inclusion in hard copy form, like the list of members.
39:781	NEXT MEETING Allen stated that a decision about the time and place of the 1979 meeting had not yet been made.
40:781	Asiloalar, near Monterey in California, is being considered, possibly around the time of the next International Joint Conference on Artificial IntelLlgence, which wj-11 be held in Tokyo from 20 to 24 August.
41:781	In the discussion, members expressed concern that the choice should not discourage attendance by graduate students.
42:781	For 1980, the Executive Committee recommended that a third TINLAP meeting be held.
43:781	The President, Vice President, and Secretary-Treasurer constitute an interim opmmittee to investigate this possibility and to negotiate with SIGART, a3 appropriate.
44:781	Allen also remarked that an offer already had been received from Aravlnd Joshi to host TINLAP-3 at the Universi ty of Pennsylvania.
45:781	NOMINATIONS FOR OFFICERS FOR 1979 Aravind Joshi, reporting for the Nominating Committee (Joshi, Petrick, and Chapin), announced the following nominat5ons for officers for 1979: Nominating Committee: Jonathan Allen, MIT, Executive Committee: Stanley Roaenschein, RAND Secretary-Treasurer: Donald Walker, SRL International Vice President: Bonnie Lynn Webber, University of Pennsylvania President: Ronald Kaplan, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center No additional nominations were received from the floor.
46:781	Allen called for a vote, which was unanimous, and the alate was declared elected.
47:781	NEW BUSINESS Carol Lane presented a resolution supporting the ratification of the Equql Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
48:781	After extensive discussion and after motions to amend and to table were defeated, the members affirmed the following substitute resolution by a vote of 20 to 13: WHEREAS, inclusion in the Constitution of these United States is the basic unalienable right of every citizen; WHEREAS, the Association for Computational Linguistics views as intolerabl.
49:781	the selective exclusion of over one-half the pophation of this country; WHEREAS, the Equal Rights Amendment, writing women into the Constitution, must be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38) prior to its incorporation THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that all future conventions, rneetlngs, and conferences of the Association for Computational Linguistics will, for the duration of time durlng which the Equal Rights Amendment is under consideration by the several states of the United States, be held only in those states that have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.
50:781	RESOLUTIONS HavQng set out in advance the syntax of his report for the Resolutions Committee, Ron Kaplan expressed the gratitude of the AssocYation to Dave Waltz, his session organizers, and the Unlverdty of Illinois for the organization and conduct of the meeting; to the National Science Foundation, and particularly to Carol Ganz Brown, for its financial support; to the current officers for their constructive-efforts during the first part of their elective term (and with encouragement to contlnue these efforts for the rest of the year); to the retiring members of the AJCL Editorial Board--Robert Barnes, Fred Damerau, Gary Martins, John Olney, and Naomi Sager--for five years of effective service; to Dave Hays for his countless hours and fruitful endeavors in realization of the AJCL; and to George Heidorn for his willingness to become the new editor.
51:781	Dave Hays called attention to the efforts of Martin and Iris Kay in the preparation of the AJCL ~ibliography, and they were duly included in the list of resolutions.
52:781	The members, affirmed these sentjments enthusiastically, and Allen directed the Secretary-Treasurer to express the appreciation ~f the Association formally to Dave Waltz.
53:781	, The meeting adjourned.

173:781	,Gumb Temple University The concent of an evolving theory [3] is a natural extension of concepts in free tense lopic with equality.
174:781	In the semanticr of free tense logic, an individual can have a property at one time Mat tt does not ab another, the domain of discourse can vary with the passage of time as individuals are born an8 die, an8 individual terms can refeq at one time but not at another.
175:781	understand in^ a theory to be a set of sentences in the languape of free tense logic with equality, an evolvinq theory is an indexcd eet of theories ordered In time.
176:781	Intuitively, an evolvinp theory mip;htreoresent the life work of a thinker, where the individual theories in the evolvinp theory correspond to chapters of the life work written at different ti&es.
177:781	The evolving theory reflects chan~es in the thinker's views with the passape of tfme.
178:781	Evolvinp theories have been studied from both semantic and roof theoretic ~erspectives, and various concents such as the semantic conce~t of satiafiability and the woof theoretic concept of consistency have been extended to anply to evolving theories [3].
179:781	The semantics is given Ih terms of metaphor theory which stands intermediate between Leblanc'e truth-value semantics and moddl theory and translates readily into both.
180:781	'The deductive system far (a class of) evolving theories Is celled the forest method because a tree is generated for each point in time.
181:781	The forest method, in effect a jqeneralization of Kripke tableaux construct ions, is mechanlzable, The forest method is correct with res~ect to the semantics 131.
182:781	The forest' method can be &n~lled whemer the1 restriction on the temporal order relation has the com~utable Krinke closure ~ro~erty, a property of m roper ties of relations whlch has been characterized model theoretically in [?I . The eornput'able Krlpke closures are a subclass pf the monotonic closures r7], which have closure properties much like transitivity (a computable Kripke and monotonic closure).
183:781	A preservation theorem giving the syntactic form of axiornatizatione of the first-order monotonic cloeures [7] suagests a peneralizatton of the Roy-Warshall transitive closure algorithm.
184:781	The preservation theorem might also be used to determine (much as an entry in an engineer in^ handbook) whether, given a property of relations Pr, there is a Pr-closure algorithm.
185:781	Evolving: theories can be based in other intensional loales such as as modal [4] and intuitionistic lopics.
186:781	Some (but notr?all) of the loeics underlying kinds of evolvin~ theories where the forest method is ap'alicable can be axiomatized 11, 6J* In certain (but not all) cases, the forest method (or restrictions of) can be used to give effective proofs of me extended Joint consiatencg theorem, a result whlch incornorates the Craip and Lyndon interpolation lemmas and.the Robinson joint consistency theorem.
187:781	Roughly, the theorehi nates that two theories TI an8 T2 are mutually inconsistent justin case there is a separating sentence F such that F (not F) is a logical consequence of TI (T2) and F "talks about'" only individual@ and relation8 Chat both TI an8 T do.
188:781	Effective proofs of the theorem are 2 well-known in standaydl first-order logic, and sjmilar results hkwe been established' In free lq~ic with equality [5] and in a family of free modal lo,qics with.
189:781	equality[4].
190:781	Since the roof Is effective, a (de~th first) algorithm can be e~trlctea from it for constructing, piven a closed forese for the union of TI and T2, a senarating sentence F. Evolving theordes, outfitted with additional devices to enhance their plausibility, appear to be a natuial for representinp ttemporal knowledge.
191:781	When the extended joint canal-stency theorem holgs for the representation langulsge of a knowleaae base and when an effective proof has bean given, the separating sentence algorithm might be a useful tool for ~in~ointing inconsistencies in the knowleifve base 2.
192:781	Only very restricted versions of the al~orithms mentioned.

196:781	This reflects the development of MAT as a more practical al-ternah. tive to pure machine translation and its position as one of the only areas of computational lingustics that has progressed to the point of wide scale appl ication.
197:781	A few other ground rules have been followed.
198:781	First, since the field continues to change so rapidly and this is a state-of-the-art survey, few references over a decade old are included.
199:781	Second, where a single MAT system is described almost identically in several research reports and/or publications in several languages, only a single reference is given, in Engl ish where possibTe.
200:781	Third, works deal ing stric'tly with hardware advances such as new graphics display techno1 ogy, micropragramnabl e di spl ay fonts, or mu1 ti1 ingual printers are a1 so excluded.
201:781	This bib1 iography was compiled from a much larger one containing nearly 750 entries and is intended to\ provide a concise summary of the current work in the field with strong focus as stated above on machine aided translation systems that are presently in opera ti^^.* * ThiQ research was conducted under a subcontract to Analytics from Chase, Rosen and Wallace, Inc. with funds provided by the Office of Research and Development, Central Intel 1 igence Agency.

290:781	ISBN 0-262-03065-9 Reviewed by WILLIAM L. BENZON Language, Literature and Communications Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, New York 12181 The comments on the dust jacket for the third edition of Colin Cherry's On Human Communication come from reviews of previous editions whf-ch appeared in such diverse places as the Canadian Journal of Psychology, Physics Today, and Romance Phllolo~ ahd lndicllte that it fs a broad ranging and fascinating book.
291:781	The range is certainly broad, so broad that I have included a tableof contents as an appendix to this review rather than attempting to summarize the contents of the hook.
292:781	But it is no longer fascinating.
293:781	Students of human c~mmunication have thought and debated much and even learned a little between the publication of the first edition of On Hman Communication in 1957 and the publication of the third edition in 1978.
294:781	But very little of that material has become part of the substance of Cherry's book @though some of it is cited).
295:781	Thus, while the first editf on may well hkve been "A Review, a Survey, and a Criticism'' (the book's subtitle), the third edition is not.
296:781	Too much is left unconsidered.
297:781	The most serious gap is in the consideration of natural languages.
298:781	Cherry gives the impression that infomation theory, statistics, Fourier analysis, and perhaps a little logic are the most important fonnal tools for the analysis of natural language.
299:781	That may have been true when Cherry mote the first edition of the book, but it is cqrtainly not true now, Cherry does make a few references to Chomsky, but none of the substance of the Chomskian revolution (not to mention post-Chomskian developments) has affected Cherry's treatment of natural language.
300:781	The texture of theorizing and model building in lin@istics, psycholinguistics, and cognitive psychology has undergone considerable change since the Fifties, but little of that has become part of the substance of On Human Communication.
301:781	Similarly, a great deal of work: has been dove on nonverbal commur~ication in the last two decades.
302:781	While cherry alludes to some of this work, he midies no attempt t~ summarize any of the major lines of inquiry.
303:781	As with modern linguistics, the material is too diverse to cover it a11 in the sort of survey which Cherry intends On Human Congmicatidn to be.
304:781	What I find so disheamtening is that so little of thls material is mentioned at all, especially when one realizes that Cherry has added a new chapter ("~uman Communication: Peeling, Knowing, and Understanding") to,the third edition for the purpose of talking ab~ut what is specifically human about human communication.
305:781	That Cherry should devote ten pages to Zipfvs law while not even mentioning the work of Paul Ekman, Carroll Izard, aad Manfred CJJrnes (to mention only the work which comes mqst readily to my mind) on the expression and cmnunication of emotion is biearre, -Pinally, Cherry's treatment of semiotics is relatively insulated from most of the-semiotic research of the last tqo de&es.
306:781	Semiotics is itself such a diverse and amorphous enterprise (as diverse and amorphous as the study OF human communication is) that it is perhaps unfsir to criticis* Cherry for shortchanging it.
307:781	Rut Cherry introduced the t3piC of ritual into his final chapter and that is a subject on which semioticians have had a great deal to say (I am thinking of structural anthropologists such as Claude Levi-Stmuss, Edmund Leach, and Victor Turner).
308:781	C,onsequently I am inclined to view Cherry's neglect of Semiotics perhaps more harshly than I otherwise would.
309:781	No doubt Cherry catlld be charged with other sinssf oniinission, but the three I've mentioned are serious enough, It is equally beyond doubt that an edition of On Human Communication which $ncluded this material would be a very different book, not Colin Cherry's book at all.
310:781	If Cherry had, attempted and achieved a synthesis of his material, then its value as a synthesis might well outweigh the dated nature of some of the elements of the synthesis.
311:781	Rut Cherry wasn't after a synthesis; he simply wanted to see what was out there.
312:781	There is now much out there which Cherry hasn't seen.
313:781	Consequently On Human Communication is not a good guide.
314:781	The person -who wants or negds a general introduction to the subject of human communication which reflects the current state of the art(s) will have to look elsewhere.

321:781	1975 KENNETH F. BALLIN Department of Linguistics SUNY at Buff a10 Amherst, New York 14261 JUrgen Kunze establishes his dependency grammar with four components.
322:781	The syntactic is the most important.
323:781	The three non-syntactic components are the paradigmatic component, theselectional component, and the assigning component.
324:781	In the first chapter of his book ABHANGIGKEITSGRAMMATIK (Dependency Grammar) the reader gets introduced to some of the basic concepts useful in understanding the notions explicated later sn.
325:781	Subordination or dependency is introduced by way of a diagram, known as a tree, consisting of several connected points.
326:781	A point or node that is connected to one closer to the top of the page is subordinate to it.
327:781	This is called direct dependency.
328:781	Indirect subordinat'ion is when two nodes are connected with one or more points in between them.
329:781	These three nodes comprise a part tree.
330:781	Kunz review 48 Obviously there are several part trees which combine to make a tree.
331:781	If the bottom-most node of our lfttle part tree is not superordinate to any other point then the part tree is an end complex.
332:781	Every node is an en& complex with itself as its only member.
333:781	Once one decides to attach words to these nodes it changes from a connethe dots game to some sort of meaningful diaexam T&e first step in this change is to bring order to the diagram.
334:781	Since language is the object of study here and the language the book was written in procedes from left to right, the author has ordered his tree from left to right.
335:781	This type of tree is known as a W tree, i.e. Ghere each node is attached to a word.
336:781	The book deals with M trees.
337:781	These are trees in which the nodes are connected to signal combinations (Merkmalkombinationen).
338:781	A marked tree is one in which a11 the connections are subordinate relations on one kind or another from a set containing all the kinds of subordinate relations possible.
339:781	In making his investigatiods, Kunze has limited his field of study to modern day written German.
340:781	This suffices as for in any pure theoretical investigation it is acceptable to assume the observed language is a set of given sentences.
341:781	The practicability of his theory depends on finding a standard of correctness.
342:781	In this case tapping the knowledge of a native speaker is of no help Four ways are suggested as possibilities for this standard of correctness.
343:781	The first is grammatical correctness in which all sentences are acceptable as long as they function as members of their classes, i.e. nouns as nouns, verbs as verbs.
344:781	Second is a more refined gramatital correctness taking the meaning of the verb into account.
345:781	Third is the suggestion of a very strict grammar Kunz review 49 bordering on grammar and semantics including semantic categories such as ABSTRACT or CONCRETE.
346:781	The fourth consideration is a semantic grammatical correctness.
347:781	Though this standard of correctness is needed to make the theory work, measuring correctness is not a major factor.
348:781	There is, says Kunze, a base language and base structures that can express semantic and syntactic ambiguities.
349:781	It is important when studying these structures to consider which categories and qualities are contained in it.
350:781	A category is a variable with set value ranges, for example, in German, case.
351:781	Qualities are restrictions imposed for ordering, appearance or non appearance of sentence fragments.
352:781	Plainly-not all categories and qualities are in every sentence of a language.
353:781	An expansion of the base language leads to a simplification of the descriptive system but also costs quite a bit as far as analysis is concerhed.
354:781	On starting into the meat of the matter tha author writes that in no way can one expect such a simple tool as dependency trees to encompass the linguistic relations within the sentence that are conditioned through language.
355:781	This inadequacy is evidenced by the following situation.
356:781	Every grammatical structure has an ordered dependency tree.
357:781	It is however possible to have two different structures represented by the same tree.
358:781	This is one of the principles for the representation of sentence structures using dependency trees.
359:781	Reduction is another principle by which we get sentences like 'My friend will bring the book' from sentences like 'My friend will bring you the book tomorrow.
360:781	An additional principle removes those nodes which were dropped from the latter sentence to arfive at the former This procedure is only permisKunz review sible when the middle steps are somewhat acceptable.
361:781	An interesting concept is introduced by the author.
362:781	He calles it the configuration criterion.
363:781	It ways that one element is substitutable for another it it has all the same grammatical properties.
364:781	This concept is used frequently in deciding what is dependent on what.
365:781	The fourth chapter deals with the non-syntactic components.
366:781	Paradigmatic categories are established.
367:781	The categories are Gknus, commonly called gender, Person, and Number.
368:781	Each of these three categories is established on the basis of data similar to the following example.
369:781	I saw him.
370:781	We saw him.
371:781	These two sentences are syntactically equal but paradigmatically quite different.
372:781	This illustrates the category of number, the first person singular changes to the first person plural.
373:781	The author splits these categories again to account for the phenomenon of endings in German.
374:781	It is possible to have a possessive pronoun with a masculine ending referring to a female person.
375:781	Quasi categories are also established.
376:781	These are tempus, modus, and case, and they are only quasi categories because they affect other parts of speech in a sentence.
377:781	Kunze constructs a list which enumerates the category responsible for their relations, e.g. a noun is paradigmatically related to its apposite through case.
378:781	The separation of the paradigmatic from the selectional is due to the ease with which the former are presentable.
379:781	Selectional relations are more narrowly defined in this case than in generative grammar.
380:781	As with the paradigmatic relations there are nine selectional relations, five of which belong to the inKune review.
381:781	ventory and the other four don' t . There are demands made on a system of subordinate relations.
382:781	The first of these is that the marked tree should be an adequate reeresentation of the syntactic structure of the sentence.
383:781	Secondly, the subordination relations must allow all categories, qualities, and relations in the base structure To represent and differentiate the paradigmatic and selectional relations that can't be expressed through assigning.
384:781	Affectation ways (Wirknngswege) are dashed lines connecting two nodes dominat+ed by a third node (see diagram).
385:781	They represent other relations that exist between nodes aside from subordination.
386:781	That these affection ways of both the paradigmatic and selectional relations must be represented through subordination relations is another demand made on the system.
387:781	The last demand made is that the conditions for the paradigmatic and selective points (Vorgaben) must also be represented.
388:781	The principle called the differentiation principle proves these last two are met.
389:781	The system makes this determination by using a a knowledge of dependency trees, a fixed inventory of paradigmatic and selectional relations, and a fixed language base in a way which yields the required relations.
390:781	The last concept developed by the author is that of bundles.
391:781	Kunz review 52 There are four types of bundles a simple bundle, an elementary bundle, a complex bundle, and a complex implication bundle.
392:781	A bundle is a tree used to represent not a sentence but a set of sentences, i.e. trees.
393:781	In a complex bundle the paradigmatic and selective properties need only be given once.
394:781	Chapter 8 is a discussion of some questions that were brought out as a result of this theory.
395:781	American Journal of Computational Linguistics GLANCING, REFERRING AND EXPLAINING IN THE DIALOGUE SYSTEM HAM-RPM W, WAHLSTER, A, JAMESON, W, WOEPPNER Project: 'Simulat ion of Language Understand1 ng ' Germanisches Seminar der Universitat Hamburg von-Melle-Park 6, D-2000 Hamburg 13, West Getmany SUMMARY This paper tocusses on three components ofthe dialogue system HAM-KYM, which converses in natural language about visible scenes.
396:781	F~rst, ~t is demonstrated how the system's communicative competence is enhanced by its imitation of human visual-search processes.
397:781	The approach taken to nounphrase resolution is then described, and an algorithm for the generation of noun phrases is illustrated with a series of examples: Finally, the system's ability to explain its own reasoning is discussed, with emphasis on the novel aspects of its implementat~on.
398:781	1, THE TREATMENT OF VISUAL DATA The natural language dialogue system HAM-RPMu converses with a human partner about scenes which either one or both are looking at directly (or have a photograph of).
399:781	At present the system, which is implemented in FUZZY (~eFaivre 1977), 1s being tested on two domains: the interior of a living room and a traffic scene.
400:781	Since it is assumed that both partners begin the dialogue with relatively little specific knowledge about the scene, most of the specific information used by the system during the conversation must be, obtained by a process more or less analogous to looking at the scene.
401:781	we have found it worthwhile to make the analogy qulte close, requiring the system to retrieve its visual data by doing something like casting a series of glances centered on various points in the scene.
402:781	Fig.
403:781	I is a schematic drawing of a section of our traffic scene, showing a tree with a parking lot in front of it.
404:781	How easy is it to recognize the various objects in Fig.
405:781	1 when glancing at point A?
406:781	CAR9 and CAR8 will be about equally easy to recognize as cars.
407:781	TREE4 will probably be recognized more easily, since it is equally close to point A, and very large, and since there are no simi lar types of objects.
408:781	On the other hand, CAR3 wi 11 be less easily recognizable, since it is farther away.
409:781	MAN^ is probably too far away to be recognizable as a man at all (he is recognizable only from the points nearest him, as is shown by the four arrows pointing away from h~m).
410:781	Just this information is stored In HAM-RPM in a separate associative network corresponding to point A. In all, there are about a hundred such small networks (represented by the small dots in Fig.
411:781	I), corresponding to possible glances at the scene.
412:781	The statements about the nature of the various objests which are recognizable from the point in question are ordered, in a way characteristic of the FUZZY programing language, in terms of their recognizability, so that they will automatically be retrieved in that order2.
413:781	T.he system's overall structure is described in (v. Hahn et al. 1978) as are the goals and methodological principles which guide the research wi thin the project.
414:781	2, These networks are implemented as CONTEXTS in the sense introduced by tile l anguage CONN I VER.
415:781	Fig.
416:781	1.
417:781	"The man in front ot the tree" A simple example will show how the data stored in this way can be used by the system.
418:781	When interpreting the defin~te description the man In front of the tree, assuming %hat TREE4 is the one meant, the system enters several CONTEXTS in front of TREE4, within each retrieving the internal names of the men recognizable from that point.
419:781	It doesn't flnd MAN^ until it has entered the CONTEXT corresponding to point 0.
420:781	It then enters a couple more, and, finding no further men, assumes that it has found the referent of the definite description.
421:781	Information not only about the respective types of the various objects, but also about their other attributes is stored in a similar way.
422:781	Why is it worth all this trauble to make the systan sensitive to the recognizability of the various facts about a scene from the various points within it?
423:781	After all, the facts themselves could be stored very straightforwardly.
424:781	Our principal justification is that, for a dialogue system which is supposed to communicate effectively with a hunlan partner, the bare facts about the scene are less important than the way the partner himself would be likely ro perceive them.
425:781	If only the facts thenlselves are known, intorrnation may be lacking which is essential for the production of a connnunicatively adequate response.
426:781	For example, the definite description whose interpretation was just sketched was, strictly speaking, ambiguous, as there is a second man in front of the tree whom the system would have considered to be the referent of the description if MAN2 hadn't been there.
427:781	Yet the system didn't even notice this ambiguity, since it stopped shortly after flnding the first man. To be sure, the resolution of such ambiguities could also be achieved by giving the system general Information on the recognizability of objects for human beings and letting it choose on that basis which of the potential referents of the description was the one which the partner was most llkely to have intended to refer to.
428:781	Instead of doing this, we have made the system itself a model of its partner, so that instead of referring to a model, it only has to 'be itself' or 'act naturally' in order to comnunicate effectively'.
429:781	In add~tion to the interpretation of ambiguous utterances, there are other situations in which this approach can be applied elegantly (Fig.
430:781	2).
431:781	SITUAT ION l NFORMATI ON 1) Interpretation of an ambiguous definite description 2) Generation of a definite description 3) Description of a part of a scene Fig.
432:781	2 Which object the speaker is probably referring to Which reference points will be easy fqr the l i stener to f iad Which objects the speaker might be ~nterested in hearing about Two of the reports (v. Hahn 1978a, 1978b) which have been issued by the HAM-RPM group deal with the question of the nature of the relation between the dialogue partner model and the human partner in some detail.
433:781	When describing the location of arl object with reference to other objects, the systeii~ wi ll usually find a nun~bet of potential reference points; in general, it should mention those which are visually easiest for the listener to find.
434:781	This is likely to happen if it itself finds these reference points partlculdrly easily.
435:781	When answering a vague question, such as a request to describe what is on the other side of the street, the system will have to select among the many visible facts those which the listener might be interested in hearing about.
436:781	In many cases, these will be the visually most salient facts.
437:781	2.
438:781	NOUN-PHRASE RESOLUTION Two of the components of HAM-RPM which make use of the visual data are those responsible for noun-phrase resolution, that is, the determination of the potential referents of a noun phrase, and noun-phrase generat ion, that is, the construction of noun phrases to identify objects uniquely.
439:781	The procedures which resolve noun phrases wo~k on the shallow structure af the input sentence.
440:781	Th~s IS what IS obtained after multiple-word phrases and idioms have been replaced with canonical expressions, the words have been looked up in the lexicon, and a simple morphological analysis has been performed.
441:781	A definite noun phrase is recognized within the shallow structure as a structure consisting of a definite article, possibly one or more attributes, a noun, and possibly a relative clause (Ritchie 1977).
442:781	In a way reminiscent of Winogred's SHRDLU (Winograd 1972), processes involviqg semantics and pragmatics are activated in HAM-RPM as soon as possible during the analysis of the input sentence.
443:781	The noun-phrase interpreter tries to find a unique referent for each definite noun-phrase by using the knowledge stored in the conceptual and referential semantic networks and performing visual search algorithms.
444:781	For example, the definite description The prcture hanglng to the left of the red chair, referring to Fig.
445:781	3, is replaced with the internal object-name PICTURE1 in the shallow structure of the sentence.
446:781	This strategy can save a good deal of unnecessary processing: if no object is found which satisfies the description, there is no further parsing, but rather fed-back to Fig.
447:781	3 the conversational partner.
448:781	In the .case where more than one potential referent IS found, the one mentioned most recently IS assumed to be the referent.
449:781	If none of them has been mentioned recently.
450:781	the system asks the partner for further details, assuming, as it were, that he does have some particular object in mind.
451:781	These details take the form of a noun phrase, which may be either complete or elliptical.
452:781	Further attributes of the intended object may be specified, it may be characterized in terms of Its spatial relations to other objects, or the noun originally used in the descript~on may be replaced wi th a more specific one.
453:781	Not all noun phrases, of course, can be replaced immediately w~th a specific referent.
454:781	One such case IS exemplified by the description the chalr rrl front of the red cupboard.
455:781	Appl led to the scene i~ Fig.
456:781	3, the noun phrase the red cupboard cannot be replaced, because there is more than one red cupboard, but it cannot be ignored, either, because there is more than one chair.
457:781	The entire noun phrase can only be interpreted when it is recognized that there is only one pair bf objects which stand in this relation to one another.
458:781	Another case where a definite noun phrase can't simply be repidced directly by its referent is the generic description with definite article, as in the sentence The cha~ 1s somet-hrng to sit on.
459:781	Lately we have been thinking about what formal features of a sentence might be helpful in recogn I z i ng such descr ipt ions (see Grosz 1976) . Two clues which tend to favour a generic interpretation are the absence of any referential attribute and the presence of an adverb such as usually or normally.
460:781	On the other hand, a generic interpretation becomes somewhat less plausrble if the noun phrase is the object of a local preposition, as In on the chair, if the sentence is in the past tense; or if the verb can be generally classified as one involving visual perception or spatial relations.
461:781	We assume that, no matter how many weak inference rules of this sort are incorporated into the system, there will still be some ambiguities which can only be resolved by other means, including interaction with the speaker.
462:781	A general goal in this connection is a sort of compatibility between noun-phrase resolut ion and noun-phrase generat ion, in the sense that the system should be able to understand any kind of noun-phrase that it can generate, and vice versa.
463:781	3.
464:781	NOUN-PHRASE GENERATION The method we have developed for the inverse process, noun-phrdse generation, is distinguished from earlier approaches mainly in three respects.
465:781	The f ~rst is its use of what might be called a iworst-case-firsti strategy.
466:781	The second is the way it takes into cons~deration the ease with which the l~stener will be able to interpret the description it generates, when more than one uniquely identifying description is possible (~errmann G Laucht 1976).
467:781	The third is its use of complex spatial relations to deal with the 'worst cases', that is, those in which several objects are indistinguishable on the basis of their properties alone.
468:781	Let's exatnine a fewexamples of the behavior of the algorithm First, two trivial cases.
469:781	Fig.
470:781	4 The street in Fig.
471:781	4 has a proper name, and is thus referred to simply as Schluterstrasse.
472:781	The tree is the only one in the discourse world, and hence is identified as the tree.
473:781	The number of interesting possible strategies becomes greater when the object to be described is one of several belonging to the same conceptual class.
474:781	Consider for example MAN1 in Fig.
475:781	4.
476:781	The system looks among its properties for one which distinguishes it from MAN2 and MAN3, and describes it as the small man. A similar process underlies the generation of the noun phrase the blg man with the umbrella to refer to MAN3.
477:781	Note that the system uses redundant labels.
478:781	This is a consequence of the sequential nature of its noun-phrase generation: First, the property 'big' is found.
479:781	When the system notices that there is another big man in the scene, it looks for a Furkher dist iw*-shing property and finds the umbrella.
480:781	This property would in fact be adequate in itself, but the system doesn't attempt to find a minimal characterizing set of attributes.
481:781	This sort of redundancy, which is often found in human beings, saves time both in the generation and in the interpretation of definite descriptions.
482:781	HAM-RPM frequently uses negative characterizations of various kinds, as, for example, when MAN2 is described as the bry man without an umbrella.
483:781	Now let's turn to some more complex problems of noun-phrase generation.
484:781	So that the pictures don't get too cluttered, we will use examples from a simple GREEN SQUARE3 Fig.
485:781	5 domain of geometrical figures (fig.
486:781	5).
487:781	Consider CIRCLE1 in Fig.
488:781	5.
489:781	Note that there are two green circles in the scene.
490:781	The presence of several objects which are indistinguishable on the basis of their attributes alone is the worst case which can occur.
491:781	The reason why we have spoken of a 'worstcase-f irst' strategy is that the system checks for this case early, rather than trying immediately to construct a simpler characterization such as those in the last few examples given.
492:781	Informal observation shows that human beings also often notice the presence of identical objects in a scene immediately.
493:781	The only way to distinguish these two circles is by reference to spatial relations, for example, the green clrcle in front of the red square.
494:781	We may note in passing two ways in which the form of a description may be constrained by the form of the question which is being answered.
495:781	First, properties wh~ch have been presupposed in the question should not be ment ioned i n a descr i pt ion.
496:781	Cons i der the ques t ion Which square is red?.
497:781	The answer The red sguare is clearly unacceptable, so instead the system answers he square in front of the green triangle (= SQUARE I i n F tg . 5) . A second constraint of this sort is that the system sphould not produce circular Fig.
498:781	6 descr~ptions.
499:781	For example, when answering the question Where is the red triangle?, the system should not answer To the left of the green square whlch is to the rlght of the red triangle, a l though each ha1 f of thi s description is perfectly natural when considered in isolation.
500:781	It sometimes happens that objects chosen as spatial reference points In a description in turn have to be identified with the help of other reference points.
501:781	For example, CIRCLE2 in Fig.
502:781	5 is described as the green circle ln front of the green square which 1s to the left of the red triangle.
503:781	As this example shows, the products of such recursive applications of the generation algor~thm can soon become difficult to understand.
504:781	We have made the maximum allowable depth of recursion a parameter which can be set to varlous values for experimental purposes.
505:781	Perhaps the most difficult problem in noun-phrase generation is the unique identification of an object when there are objects with exactly the same prsperties in its immediate neighbourhood (fig.
506:781	6).
507:781	This is a task which often causes difficulties even for a human speaker.
508:781	To set the stage, suppose that CIRCLE6 in Fig.
509:781	6 IS to be identified.
510:781	The system first describes its position relative to the other circles in its group: the r~ghthand clrcle Then it identifies the group of which CIRCLE6 is a member with63 In the see-ne as a whole, distinguishing it first fra CROUP2: in ftont (ind to tl~c* left and then f ro~n GROUP3 : which 1s to the left of the square.
511:781	Thus the complete descr ~ption is The right-hand czrcle in front and to the 1 tjft wlil cdr rs to tllr left of th~ squnra.
512:781	TO put the point more generally, complex scenes sometimes have a hierarchical.struct~re in which groups of s~milar objects serve as units which have to be identified in much the same way that objects themselves are.
513:781	The remarks we have made about circular descriptions and recursion depth apply on the level of groups as well.
514:781	Concluding this sketch of HAM-RPM's .noun-phrase interpreter and generator, we would like to stress that all these algorithms are doma~n-independent.
515:781	4.
516:781	EXPLANATION Although all of the examples d~scussed up to now have involved some sort of description of visible aspects of a scene, HAM-RPM frequently makes use of general knowledge and inference rules to draw conclusions.
517:781	For example, the system might be asked Is the park3ng zone tarred?, where the parking zone in question, though part of the scene, is hidden from view.
518:781	It would then try to answer the question using approximate inferences based on fuzzy knowledge (~ahlster 1978), concluding that the parking zone might very well be tarred, because a parking zone is in a sense a part of a street, and streets, like thoroughfares in general, are usually tarred.
519:781	Inferences which stand on such shaky ground as this one are of limited use to the conversational partner unless the system can describe the reasoning which underlies them.
520:781	Furthermore, not just any description will be satisfactory: the system ought to act in accordance with the following 'three maxims, as formulated by (Grice 1975): 1.
521:781	Hake your contribution as informative as is required.

523:781	Don't make your contribution more informative than is required.

527:781	Three processes are essential.
528:781	First, while the ruasorilng is being performed, a sort of trace of the Inference process is stored in a separa'te date base called INFERENCE-MEMORY.
529:781	Second, after an explanation of the conclusion has been requested, this part of memory is traversed to find those of the assumptions used which are on a conr~~uo~catively appropriate level of detail.
530:781	Finally, these assumptions are expressed in natural language.
531:781	An cbbent~al role in the first two of these phases is played by the ineta-knowledge associated with each inference rule which is available to the systenl.
532:781	As you can see from the two inference-rule definitions in Fig.

562:781	American Journal of Computational Linguistics A CRITICAL LOOK AT A FORMAL MODEL FOR STRATIFICATIONAL LINGUISTICS Alexander T. Borgida Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A7 SUMMARY We present here a formalization of the straiificational model of linguistics proposed by Sampson C131 and investigate its generative power.
563:781	In addition to uncovering a number of counterintuitive properties, the results presented here bear on meta-theoretic claims found in the linguistic literature.
564:781	For example, Postal [llj claimed that stratificational theory was equivalent to context-free phrase-structure grammar, and hence not worthy of further interest.
565:781	We show, however, that Sampson's model, and several of its restricted versions, allow a far wider range of generative powers.
566:781	In the cases where the model appears to be too powerful, we suggest possible alterations which may make it more acceptable.
567:781	1.
568:781	Introduction Linguistic theories are at least partially interested in presenting the regularities found in natural languages.
569:781	Given the current dominance of the Transformational Generative (TG) school in the field of linguistics, it seems necessary for theories competing for attention to possess a formal model, In addition to the advantages normally derived from presenting results through a formalism, such as precision, succinctness and verifiability, one can also comment on the veracity of metatheoretic claims.
570:781	It was using such formal arguments that Chomsky and his collaborators demonstrated the inability of finite automata and of context-free grammars to describe all natural language constructs.
571:781	Similarly, the formal work of Peters and Ritchie [8,91 was important in uncovering inadequacies of two notions of TG theory namely, the "recoverability of deletions condition" and the "universal base hypothesis".
572:781	Finally, since many generative linguists want grammatical theories which characterize natural languages, they fault any theory which is .too powerful" in the sense of being able to describe languages which clearly cannot be natural languages, such as nonrecursive sets.
573:781	Furthermore, computer scientists working on natural languages will have to give in the future more consideration to the work of linguists, especially on "exotic" languages, in order to be able to observe a wider range of phenomena.
574:781	Such access will be facilitated if the formalismsin which the grammaTs are prese'nted lend themselves to computer implementation for purpose$ such as parsing, testing, etc. This entails, among other things,that linguists should avoid as much as possible features which make their grammars generate non-recursive sets, and hence it is one of the purposes of the present paper to point out such features and discuss possible ways of avoiding them.
575:781	In this paper we will discuss one model proposed for the stratificational theory of linguistics.
576:781	This theory, advanced by S. Lamb, H.A. Gleason Jr. and their collaborators (C51,[61,C71), advocates that langdages be described in terms of several subsystems, known as strata.
577:781	Each stratum has its own set of units and a tactics specifying the tlcorrectfl ("all~wable'~) structures that stratum.
578:781	specific grammar might for example have strata corresponding roughly to semantics, syntax-morphology and phonology, although this is by no means standard.
579:781	Furthermore, the strata are linearly ordered as levels, and there is a realization relation which connects adjacent strata by attaching to every well-formed structure on one stratum, zero or more accompanying structures on the adjacent strata.
580:781	Note therefore that a particular utterance has simultaneous expression on each stratum.
581:781	In this paper we examine the formal model for stratificational linguistics proposed by Sampson (L131).
582:781	This model uses rewrite grammars G1,G2,  to describe the tactics, while the realization relation is essentially a rewrite system R acting as a transducer between the languages of-the tactics.
583:781	More specifically, realization connects adjacent tactics G and Gj+l j by matching sentences u in the language generated by G with those sentences j v in the language of Gj+l which can be derived from u by using rules from R. An important property of the linguistic realization relation is the fact that' every structure on some stratum can have only a finite number of llrealizates" on the next stratum.
584:781	This means that the rewrite system R must be constrained so that it has no recursive symbols.
585:781	Such a rewrite system will be called acyclic.
586:781	We investigate here the effect of acyclic rewrite systems acting as transaucers on axiom sets, varying the type of the derivations and rules allowed.
587:781	We prove in this paper that regular languages are closed under transduction by acyclic rewrite systems, but that the linear context-free languages are mapped onto the recursively enumerable sets.
588:781	This implies that stratificational grammars with non-selfembedding ta~ctics would be too weak while those with even one context-free tactics would be too strong.
589:781	If the realization derivation is restricted to be in some sense "leftmost", then we show that the transduction can be performed by a finite,state device known as an a transducer.
590:781	Furthermore, if productions with null right-hand sides are not allowed in an acyclic rewrite system then all the derivations can be made leftmost.
591:781	This provides one possible method of restricting the generative power of acyclic rewrite systems.
592:781	By deriving a recursive characterization of the languages generated with n-strata in terms of (n-1)-stratal languages, we can show that if the realization is restricted to being leftmost, then the languages described are homomorphic images of the intersections of the languages generated by the tactics.
593:781	In particular, this means that we can find natural families of stratificational grammars which generate far example the sets recognized in real time by nondeterministic multitape Turing machines.
594:781	This result partially confirms a hitherto unproven claim by Sampson, and discredits Postal's Clll classiciation of stratlficational grammars as just another variant of context-free phrase-structure grammars.
595:781	Finally, we investigate the use of ordered rules in linguistic grammars and prove that in several models they allow the generation of sets which are not even recursively enumerable a clearly unsatisfactory situation.
596:781	The remainder of the paper is structured as follows, In Section 2, we present the formal definitions and notation to be used, including the formal model for stratificational grammars.
597:781	In Section 3, we examine the properties of "acyclic rewrite systemsw, which form the principal novel component in our definition of stratificational grammars.
598:781	We then return in Section 4 to examine the generative power of st'ratificational grammars and relate the results to linguistics.
599:781	2.
600:781	Definitions We repeat here some important definitions from (121, and assume that the reader is familiar with the other basic notions of formal language theory.
601:781	+ A vocabulary V is a finite set of symbols, and we use V to denote the set of all nbn-null strings consisting of symbols * from V; using e to denote the null string, we also define V to be A rewrite system RW is a pair (V, R) where V is a vocabulary and R is a finite set of rules (productions) of the form u + v, + * where u E V and v E V ; u is known as the left hand slde of the production (Ihs ).
602:781	and v is its right hand side (rhs ).
603:781	+ A word x E V is said to directly derive or generate -in R * another word y E V (denoted by x =>R Y) iff there exist words U,V,W,Z such that x = wuz, y = wvz and u + v belongs to R. Let =+>R be the transitive closure of =>R, and =*> its transitive reflexive R closure.
604:781	A sequence of words w1,w2,,~, such that w1 =>R w2 => . . .
605:781	=> w is said to be a (free) .R-derivation (or R R n simply a derivation) of w from w n 1' * Given a rewrite system RW = (V,R) and a subset AX of V the language generated by R from axiom set AX with free derivations is defined to be the set ~(AX,RW) = {wlueAx, u=*> w).
606:781	R Given the rewrite system RW = (V,R), define the domjnance relation < on V x V by: d<b iff xby + udv is one of the productions in R (for some strings x,y,u,v) or if there exists some c in V such that d<c and c<b. Then RW is defined to be acyclic (abbreviated a . iff the relation < is anti-symmetric and anti-reflexive.
607:781	If u + v is a production in a fewrite system, it will be called a null rule if v is the null string e, and it will be called context-free if 11.11, the length of u, is 1.
608:781	A rewrite grammar G is a quadruple (N,T,S,P) where N and T are the sets of nonterminals and terminals respectively, distinguished nonterminal and f = (NUT) P) is a rewrite system.
609:781	In this case, if =*?
610:781	w then this is called a G-derivation, or a derivation in G, and the language generated by,G,denoted by * L(G), is defined to be the set (tl~ =*> t in G, t6T . We assume the reader is familiar with the terminology of type 0 (recursively enumerable or RE), type 1 (context sensitive), type 2 (context free) and type 3 (regular) languages, and corresponding families of grammars and automata.
611:781	A type 2 grammar will be called linear if all its productio~l~ are of the form A + aBb, where A,B E N, a,b E T u {el, and will be called selfembedding if for some AEN there is a G-derivation A =*> uAv where u and v are not null.
612:781	New languages can be obtained from old ones through such set operations as union, intersection and concatenation.
613:781	One can also definemappings over strings and then extend them to sets of strings in the obvious way.
614:781	One such mapping is the substitution s which associates with every symbol b of some alphabet T, a set of words ~(b) over another alphabet Tt; &fining s (xy) = s(x)s (y) and s(e) = e, a substitution can be extended to strings.
615:781	If the sets s(b),are regular, finite or e-free then s is said to be regular, finite or e-free respectively; if s(b) contains a single word then s is called a homomorphism, and the braces for sets are dropped.
616:781	A homomorphism h can also be e-free, or it can be length-preserving, if lh(b) 1 = 1 for all symbols b. If L is a family of languages then we use H ( L ) and 0 H ( L) to represent the families of languages obtained from elements of L through e-f ree homomorphisms and ~omomorphisms respectively.
617:781	One final operation on strlngs is reversal defined by &v(b) = b if lbl ( 2 and Rev(xy) = Rev(y)Rev(x).
618:781	Ohe can also use automata to perform mappings between 0 strings.
619:781	The a-transducer M = [K,T,T,k F,) is an extension 12 of the finite automaton, where T1 and T2 are the input and output 'dr * alphabets, and T is a finite subset of K x T1 x T2 x K (the transi* * tion set) . The relation Iis defined on K x TI x T2 by the rule (k,uv,z) I(kf,v,zx) if (k,u,v,kT) E T. The output of M for input-word w is one of the strings in the set 0 * {zl (k,be) I(k,e,z), keF).
620:781	An a-transducer is said to be e-output free if for an$t (r,u,v,s) in T, the string v cannot be null.
621:781	A collection of languages A is said to be closed under the operation o if a(L) E A whenever L E A. A (full) trio is a family of languages containing at least one nun-empty set, closed under efree homomorphism (arbitrary homomorl?hism), inverse homomorphism, and intersection with regular languages.
622:781	Flnally, omitting detailed justification (see C 33), the following formal definition captures the essential aspects of the notion of stratificational grammar, as presented by Sampson C 131: Definition An n-stratal rewrite grammar (n-RSTRAT) is a 5tuple RST = (n,TCT,RLZ,V V ), where VC and VE are the set of "content C' E units1!
623:781	and tlexpression unitst1 respectively, TCT = (G19G2, . .,Gn) is a vector of n rewrite grammars, and RLZ = (RO,R1,  , R ) is a n vector of ~+1 acyclic rewrite systems.
624:781	The transduction perfo~med + by such a grammar will be defined by T-RSTRAT(RST) = { (u,v) lw0=u~vC, * * W n+l =vcVE, there exist w c L(G).
625:781	such that w = >w~+~ j via R J j j derivations for j = 0,1,.
626:781	, nl.
627:781	Its language is described by In this formal model, the grammar is thought of as transducing "meaningu into vtsound" in the following manner : starting with a string of "content units" (expressing the meaning of *an utterance), the realization rewrite rules are repeatedly applied until a string of "expression units" is obtained.
628:781	The realization derivation is constrained by the requirement that for each tactics there exists an intermediate stage in the realization derivation which conforms to the tactics specifications (i .e. belongs tb the language generated by the tactics) . The above formalism is based mainly on Lamb s version of strati Eicationa~ linguistics ; an alternate approacki, closer in spirit to Gleason's model, is presented in C31.
629:781	3.
630:781	Generative power of acyclic rewrite systems To begin with, we remark that the formal definition of s tratif icational grammars in C 13 1 allows in the reali zation sys tern rewrite rules with null left-hand sides (i .em rules of the form e + u).
631:781	Unfortunately, such rules could be applied to some string an arbitrary number of times.
632:781	In our stratificational model, this would result in any string having an infinite number of realizates . Furthermore, rules of the form e + u can also be used to establish context-free dependencies in strings generated even from singleton axiom sets.
633:781	For example, if R = ({c,d),{e+cd}) * then (el R ) = {w~wE(c,~}, w has the same number of "c" and "dl!
634:781	symbols}, which is known to be a non-regular centext-free wage.
635:781	The phenomena described above do not appear to have linguistic equivalents, and run counter to the s tratif icational philosophy which envisages only flnitely many realizations for any structure . As it turns out, in practice rules of the form e + u are only required to introduce in the realization derivation syntactically determined elements, such as "do" in questions.
636:781	Such inserti~ns need however be performed only once, at the end of every realization derivation between two tactics.
637:781	Therefore they can be accomplished through normal acyclic rules if each e + u in R is replaced by rules v + uw and v -+ wu for all v + w in R. For this reason, we will continue to use the definition of rewrite systems which only allows productions with pon-null lefthand sides.
638:781	We next investigate the effect of a.r. on simple types of axiom sets.
639:781	Theorem 3.1 Let AX be a regular set over alphabet T and let E be some alphabet disjoint from T. If RW = (V,R) is an a.r. then * ~(AX,RW) n E is also a regular set.
640:781	Proof Let G = (N,T,S,P) be a type 3 grammar generating AXy and without loss of generality assume that N n VR is empty.
641:781	FurtherG more, normalize R so that all its rules are of the form a+bc, a+e or bc+d. This can be accomplished in a 3-step process: first, * replace rules of the form u + abv (a,beV, u,vd ) by rules u + aa, a -+ bv where a is a new symbol; repeat this until all rules have rhs.
642:781	no longer than two symbols.
643:781	Next, replace rules of the form abu -+ v by ab + a, au -+ v, until all lhs.
644:781	of rules are at most two symbols.
645:781	Finally, eliminate rules of the form a + b by adding to R a rule y + zbzl whenever y + zazl is in R. Our goal is to produce a type 3 grammar such that Rderivations are Mprecomputedu in its productions, For example, if the grammar G originally had productions X+aY and Y+bZ, while R contained the rule ab+d, then the final grammar would contain production X+dZ.
646:781	Fbr this purpose, consider the following iterative construotion: INITIALIZATION: Eet GI be G; let T9 = T u VR.
647:781	CONSTRUCTION 1: For every integer i, given grammar Gi = (Ni,Ti,SG,Pi), construct from l't a type 3 grammar Gi+l T' 9SG,Pi+l) as follows: for every aaTi, let P(i.a) be the set of all productions in Gi which have the symbol ??a1' on the rhs.
648:781	to begin with, let Pi+l contain P. , 1 and Ni+l contain Ni; IF b+cd is a production in Ry THEN for every A+bB in P(i,b), ADD ta N,+l a nonterminal [A;B;b+cd], and ADD to P i+l productions A+c[A;B;b+cd~-and [A;B;b+cd]+dB; IF b+e is ih R, THEN for every A+bB in P-(i,b) ADD production A+B tp Pi+l; IF bc+d is in R, THEN for every pair of productions A+bB in P(i,b), and C+cD in P(i,c), ADD to Pi+l the new production A+dD if B=>*c in Gi; END ; Suppose that we were able to establish that From the construction it is easy to see that P is always a subi set of Pi+l (and hence L(G).
649:781	c L(Gi+l)), and if 1 G =G for some index m m m+ 1 (i.e. no new productions are added to G in Construction I), then m G would be equal to G for every j > m. I m But, if such an m exists then L(L(G);R) = U L(G).
650:781	= L(G ) i=l 1 m and G is the type.3 grammar we are looking for.
651:781	Therefore, it m remains to establish equalities (1) and (2).
652:781	To,prove (I), we first define a new type of derivation ("singl&, left-right pass") relation "=o>~ " as follows: =Q='~ v iff there exists integer n such that for j = l,,n x + y. is a rule in R and z is some string with the property that J J j u = z x z' 'x z and v = z y z y z 0 1 1' n n 0 11 n n (if n = 0, then u = v).
653:781	We then claim that L(Gi+$ = Iw(3 veL(G).
654:781	such that v =o>~ W) 1 This, equaLi ty can be demonstrated by straightforward inductions on, res-a, SA~ ~hengt-r sd d~&v;n.ric~ 3% e, i+l ' and the integer n appearing in the definition of In both case% the Important points are that if A => bB in G (A,BNi, bcT).
655:781	i 1 n then either A => bB in Y~+~ (by step 2 in Construction 1) or A => uB if b + u is in R (by steps 3 or 4); and if A => bB =*> bc => bc~ in G then A => dD in Gi+l in case bc -+ d is in R (step 5).
656:781	1 We are now in a position to prove (1).
657:781	First, suppose that w belongs to Z(L(G),R) and w was obtained from u E L(G) = L(G~) in an R-derivation with n steps: u = u1 => R U2 ->R  -> R u n => W. If we note that for any strings x,y x =>R y implies x =o> y R thenby (3) we have for i = 1,n thatu.
658:781	c L(G.1.
659:781	But then 1 00 1 w = un must belong to L (G ), and hence to U L (G. ) . Conversely, 00 n i-1 1 if to " L(G).
660:781	then there must exist an index m such that 1-1 a w c L(G ) Using (3) it is then trivial to prove by induction on m m that there exists v E L(G) such that v = vl =o>~ v2 =o>  *=o> R R Vm = W for some'v E L(G).
661:781	(1 = 1,m. But in that case w E &(L(G),R) i 1 because by definition x =o>~ y implies that x =*> y for any R strings x,y. This concludes the proof of identity (1).
662:781	To prove (Z), one night try to demonstrate that the construction halts after some precomputable number of steps.
663:781	This approach unfortunately runs into the following problem: the addition of a new production to G in step 4, allows new pairs of i variables B ' and C ' to be connected by a derivation B '=>*c 9 this may aPlow new production A'+dD1 to be added to Gi+14 in step 5, which in turn may eventually allow step 4 to add a new rule to for some The above compels us to look for an alternative prod of (2): exhibiting a grammar GO such that every Gi is a subgrammar of GO.
664:781	This would mean that the increasing sequence of grammars G1,GZ, is bounded above, and hence converges to one of its elements.
665:781	To construct GO, remember that by definition of R there is an anti-symmetric relation < on V R' Using this, we assign to every symbol in V and every production in R a unique index number, according to the following algorithm: INDEXING ALGORITHM: 1.
666:781	I(b) := 0 for every beV such that there is no daV and d>b; 2, FOR i=O to IvI DO WHILE not all symbols have an index; IF I(b)=i 6 b+cd is in R, THEN I(c) := I(d) := i+l and I(b+cd) := i+l; IF I(b)=i 6 I(c)si 6 bc+d is in R THEN I(d) := i+l and I(bc+d) := i+l; PF I(b) = i 6 I(c)ai 6 cb+d is in R THEN I(d) := i+l and I(bc+d) := i+l; IF I(b) = i and b+e is in R THEN I(b+e) := i*l; END END By the acyclicity of R, the above algorithm produces a unique value for every symbol and production.
667:781	Suppose the highest index value assigned is n. Then GO will be c~nstructed from G by repeated modification in n passes through the following: CONSTRUCTION 2: Let GO = (N',T',s,P') be G initially; FOR i=l toqn DO * in the i-th pass, add to GO all possible productions representing derivations by index i rules */ I 1.
668:781	For every symbol Id' in VR such that I(d) = i, let P(d) be the set of all productions currently 0 In G, with 'd' on the rhs.
669:781	2.
670:781	IF b-tdc (or b+e) 1s in R and has index i (iff I (b) i), THEN alter GO in exact.1~ the same way as in steps 3 (or 4) of CONSTRUCTION 1; (except that PO and NO are used instead of Pi+l and N ) . i+l 3.
671:781	IF bc+d is in R and has index i, THEN for every pair of productions A-tbB i.1 P(b) and C+cD in P(c), ADD to PO the new production A+dD (whether or not Note that in the i-th pass the only prbductions added to GO have on the rhs: a terminal symbol of index strictly greater than i. Therefore, in successive passes through the loop after the i-th one, P(d) remains unchanged for all symbols I1d" with L(d) i. Furthermore, the output GO remains unchanged if passed through CONSTRUCTION 2 a second time.
672:781	Secondly, note that if some grammar K remains unchanged by CONSTRUCTION 2 then it does so through CONSTRUCTION 1 as well, because every rule in R is eventually considered in CONSTRUCTION 2, and in each case at least those productions which would have been added by CONSTRUCTION 1 are added by CONSTRUCTION 2.
673:781	0 Therefore, since G is a subgrammar of G, Gi will be so for every i greater than 1, and the proof is completed.
674:781	0 Increasing the range of sets from which we choose the axiam sets, we obtain the following: Theorem 3.2 Let G = (N,T,S P ) be an arbitrary type 0 grammar.
675:781	G' G Then there exists a linear context-free language LING+ and an a.r. R (which is dependent only on the set N u T), such that 0 Proof (Notational convention: let V = N u T, and if E-,-,v) then use V to represent the set {&la~V}, and alw *aj if w = al-.aj ).
676:781	It is known (Cll) that there exist two linear context-free languages L1 and L2, as well as a homomorphism h, such that L(G) = h(L1 n L2).
677:781	We have constructed (C3'1) pairs of new such laqguages: + v . VG $Rev (v ) = v i-1 for i = 1,.
678:781	.,m-13 1 m+i-1 and a' IUN N V + L2 = {%wla .w %$%w~+~ %p ln>O, w.aV for icn, n 2n 1 and Rev(w ) => w G n+i+l for i = 0,  , n-11 n-i In this case, the homomorphism h is defined as h(;) = x if xeT, null otherwise.
679:781	Observe that L1 is dependent solely on the vocabulary V and it only checks whether the strings around the central .I %sG%$%' are mirror images of each other.
680:781	But the fallowing rewriting system does exactly the same job, and, in addition, performs the homomorphism h : v Ro = (fS B$Fe, %Fey G+e for all XEV~, a+a for aeT) G * Then T n de (L~,R~) = h(L1 n L2) = L(G) and by observation it is 0, clear that R is acyclic.
681:781	0 This result is surprising, especially from a linguistic point of view, and demonstrates the power of acyclic rewrite systems.
682:781	Since it is undesirable that linguistic mechanisms be so powerful, we will attempt to put bounds on them.
683:781	One way to do so is to restrict the places where steps in derivations can occurl.
684:781	Essentially, in a k-leftmost derivation there is a k-symbol wide "windoww on the derivational forms where rewriting can occur, and this window is only allowed to move to the right.
685:781	Definition 3.1 Let wo => w =>  1 => Wn be an R-derivation, where for i = 1,  , n productions ui+vi are used to obtain w = x.v.u i rii from w~-~ x.u.y.,,(x 111 i,yi,wicv--), For any integer k, this is said to be a k-Jeftmost derivation if for all i = 1, . . n-1 there exist * s and t in V such that xi = t.s with 1s.l 5 k a~d 1t.I.s iti+l i i 11 1 1 I This definition of R-derivations gives rise to the new language * %(Ax,Rw,~-Id) = Iw ~XEAX, x=>~w in k-leftmoht derivation).
686:781	Theorem 3.3 Given an a.r. RW = (V,R), there exists an a-transducer OR such that $ (AX,R,k-ld) = $$AX) . Proof By the acyclic nature of the rules in R, any string of t length k can be rewritten into a string of length at most kd where d 5s the length of the longest rhs.
687:781	of a rule in R, and t is the.
688:781	nufiber of symbols in V. Therefore, if we define a Turing machine transducer O which simulates on its wofking tape k-leftmost RR derivations, then it need have only a bounded, f inite-length tape.
689:781	But this can obviously be kept in a finite memory, and hence OR can be made into an a-transducer, 0 Theref~re, leftmost carl3traints on R-derivation6 lead to a much more rest,ricted version caf rewrite ~ystems because all trios (in particular LINEAR-CFL) are closed under atransduction.
690:781	A second method of bounding the power of a.r. is to restrict the .form of the productions allowed in R. Thporem 3.4 If RW = (V,R) is an a.r. with no null productions, then for every axiom set AX, ~(AX,RW) = oe(AX,RW,k-ld) for some Proof Suppose R has r rules involving t symbols and let c be the length of the longest lhs.
691:781	of a production.
692:781	Now observe * t that if v =>R w, then no symbol in w can have more than k=c .~ncestors in v, all of which must be adjacent in v (i.e. the presence of a symbol in w can depend only on the presence of at most k adjacent symbols in v).
693:781	Thi's value of k can be obtained as follows: since the rules are acpcllc, new symbols must appear after every application of a production and hence every symbol in w can be the result of applying ae most t.productions; since each of these uses at most c t symbols as context, we get the value of c . The adjacency requirement comes ffom the condition that there be no e-r-ules in R. * Consider now some R-derivation tXv =*> t: (t,?,~e~, XEV), where no symbol in t is rewritten, but X is. IVe will prove by induction on the length of the derivation that there is an equivalent kleftmdst derivation.
694:781	Basis.
695:781	If the derivation has 0 6r 1 steps then it is clearly k-leftmost.
696:781	Inhction step.
697:781	Break up the dfiivatiom into steps, to see where X is rewritten: where we used rule Xw A'Yz in stcp 0.
698:781	Now find the 1as.t production in @ which produces only non-ancestors of Y. (a) 11 thsre is no such production, then by wr opening remarks @ must be k-leftmost, and hence @ can be made k-leftmost by induction.
699:781	(b) Otherwise, suppose that the last such rule was a+p. Then we claim that the derivatiod in further detail is N tXv =*> tXu cry => tXu pu =*> tXh* 'pu => tY zu pu =*> t?
700:781	0 2-@ 2@,e = z'@ 2@ The signifitant part of this chin is that no prdduction in @ affects the string pu2, and this is true hy our choice of a+p as the last production generating non-ancrstors of Y, hence of Yz, and the necessary contiguity of ancestors.
701:781	But now note that step @ can bc ~ostponed to yield the following reordered derivation: By repeating the construction in part (b) on @ = @@ this time (instead of @ @@ ) we will eventually (by a second induction, if desired) achieve case (a), and thus complete the proof.
702:781	# Note that in the above proof we had only excluded the use of null rules (the symbol p could not be null) so that other productions with left-hand sides longer than right-hand sides are still allod in R. Finally, we include for completeness the following result whose proof :is trivial . Propositiori 3.5 Let RW = (V,R) be an a.r . which has only context free rules.
703:781	Then there exists a finite substitution sR such that for every axiom set AX, &(AX,RW) = sR(AX).
704:781	# 4.
705:781	Stratificational Grammars We now return to the notion of stratificational grammar which led us originally to consider acyclic rewrite systems.
706:781	To begin with, note that the original definition of n-RSTRAT grammar has *o constraint on the derivations occuring on the tactics, while in practice linguists appear to view the derivations asbeing leftmost (1.
707:781	e. the leftmost nonterminal is the one rewritten) . Therefore, throughout the following discussion we will examine the differences arising out of this variation.
708:781	First, we present a recursive characterization of the n-RSTMT languages.
709:781	For this purpose, define the language generated by a 0-RSTRAT grammar RST' = (0, (), (R'),VC,VE) as L.-RSTRAT (RST') * &($,R*) n VE.
710:781	Then the following theorem is an obvious consequence of the definition of L-RSTRAT: Theorem 4.1 If RST = (n(G G ),(Ro,  , n R-),VC,VE) is an n n-RSTRAT gramman, and TOP (RST) is the (n1) -RSTRAT grammar (n-l,(G1,  , G' ),(Ro,,R n1 n1 ),.V T ), then L-RSTRATCRST) = C9 n Using Theorems 4.1, 3.1 and the known closure properties of the regular languages, it is easy to see that if all the tactics G1:  , GI of an n-RSTRAT grammar arc non-sclfcmbcdding then the n, stratiTic-ational grammar can generate only a regular language.
711:781	On thc other hand, as soon as one or the tactics is a/llowed to bc of type 2 and selfembcdding, then by Thaorcms 4.1 and 3.2 the.RSTRAT grammar can generate an arbitrary RE set.
712:781	Evermore surprisingly, this can be accomplished using a "universal realization relationM, mea-n-ing that to obtain any RE set we need only vary the tactics, not the realization rewrite system.
713:781	This situation is similar to that found for TG in C91, where the transformational component can be varied while the base grammar is kept fixed.
714:781	Therefore, in this stratificational model there seems to be no alternative between the insufficient descriptive power of finite,autornata and the excessive poker of arbitrary Turing machines.
715:781	These results hold even if the derivations on the tactics are cons trained to be leftmost.
716:781	We must therefore search for further limitations on the realization process.
717:781	In section 3 we considered several possible ways of d6ing this, namely eliminating null or context-dependent rules, or making the realization derivation leftmost.
718:781	In linguistic grammars there is a clear need for context-dependent realization ~ules, hence these cannot be eliminated.
719:781	Although in Sampsonts model nu11 realizaA> tion rules appear to be needed (more on this below), it is possible to envisage alternative models which avold them.
720:781	By Theorem 3.4, the absence of null rules is equivalent to rest~ictl%~ the realization derivatidn to being k-leftmos t. Furthermore, based on current linguistic literature there appears to be no objectiofi to limiting the realization to being k-leftmost.
721:781	Therefore, we will examine the generative power of n-RSTWT grammars under rhi-s cans traint . Theorem 4.2I6 STR = (n,CG1, .,Rn),(RO, . . .,R n ),VC,VE] is an n-RSTRAT grammar with realisation derivations restricted to be k-leftmost for some, integelr k, then there exist homombrphism h and languages L1,.
722:781	., L such that for i = 1,.
723:781	.,n L(G).
724:781	is of the n I same type1 as.Li, and L-RSTRAT[STR) = h(L1 nn L ).
725:781	n Proof The proof is based on a number of results aboutjtrios, which we summarize here from [4]: (a) For i =, 1,n the families of languages of the same type as L(G).
726:781	are trios.
727:781	1 6 1 If L is a trio then H(L) is a trio and H'(L) is a full trio.
728:781	(c) If LIP-mb,Ln are trios then H(H(L~ n .n ) n L n ) is a trio and it is equal to H (L1 n. . . n Ln-l n L 1; similarly n 0 HO(H(L~ n.*-n -1 nLnI = H IL1 neben L,-l n L) n is a full trio.
729:781	(d) trios are closed under intersection with regular sets and e-output bounded a-transduc'tions, while full trios are also cl-osed under arbitrary atransduction.
730:781	We now Trove the.
731:781	theorem by induction on n. Basis.
732:781	For n=l, by Theorems 4 .I and 3.3 there exist a, * transducers O and O such that L-RSTRAT(RST) = o~(O~(VE)~I,(G~~)~V~; 1 0 then our theorcm holds by notes (a) and (d) above with h being the identity map.
733:781	induction step.
734:781	For the .cam n+l, by Theorem~r4.1 and 3.3 there exis ts atransducer Onvl such that L-RSTRAT(RST) is equal to * On+ 1 (L-RSTRAT(TOP(RST)) n L(G )) n V,.
735:781	n+ 1 (4) 1 Meaning type 3, type 2, type 1, type 0, linear language.
736:781	But by induction, there exist homomorphism hM and languages L:, .,,.
737:781	, Ltt such that L-RSTRAT(TOP(RST)) = hTt(L!i n . nLt\3 . n n Substituting this in (4) and appllying notes (a), (b) and (c) we find a homomarphism h and languages LI,.
738:781	.-, L n+l of the same type as L';,  , Ltt and L(Gn,+l) such tkat L RSTRAT(RST) = h(Ll fi . . .
739:781	nL ) . # n n+ 1 Remark that by Theorems 34.4 and 3.5 the same result holds in the case when the realizations do not contain null rules, and by examining the above proof it can be seen that the homomoxphism h can be restricted to being e free in this case.
740:781	The following canverse to Theorem 4.2 can be easily established: Theorem 4.3 Given homomorphism h from T to TI.
741:781	, and rewrite grammars G . . .,G with terminal alphabets T, then for i = 0,  .,n 1' n there exist context-free acyclic rewrite systems Ri such that Proof For j cn, define R. to be {a+al aaT], by the definition of 3 RSTRAT-derivations this will simulate the intersection of the languages generated by the tactics.
742:781	Finally, define R to be n {a+h(a) 1 ad), thus perf~rm~ng the horrtomorphism on the intersection.
743:781	6 To begin with, the above theorems partially confirm Sampson's hitherto unproven claim (C 13 : page 111) that stratificational languages are the ~esult of intersecting the languages of the tactics.
744:781	Note however two important qualifications to this claim: the realization derivation must be k-leftmost and a homomorphism must be applied to the intersection of the languages.
745:781	Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 show that with k-leftmost realization derivations, the type i languages (i = 1,2) can be obtained by using a type i grammar on one of the tactics, and making the other ones non-selfembedding.
746:781	If all the tactics generate context-free languages (as in the case when tactic-derivations are leftmost) then n-RSTRAT grammar can generate the hornornorphic intersections of the CFLs.
747:781	For 1122, this is known to equal the RE sets if null realizations are allowed; if null realization rules are not allowed then for ns3 the n-RSTRAT grammars generate the family QUASI of sets recognized by nondeterministic Turing machines in real or linear time (C 21) . These observations demons t~ate that n-RSTRAT grammars can be appropriately modif ied . so that they generate various language families intermediate between the regular and RE sets.
748:781	Unfortunately, even when the realization derivation is restricted to being k-leftmost' 1-RSTRAT grammars with context-sensitive tactics and 2-RSTRAT grammars with context-free tactics can generate the RE sets, unless null realizations aro restricted.
749:781	The baslc problem with restricting null rules lies in the pronounced bias of this mob1 towards the realization of terminal units from one tactics to the next.
750:781	In practice, in order to describe linguistic phenomena it is necessary to hwc information about the enti-rc derivation process on some tactics.
751:781	Sampson accomplishes this by introducing "pseudoterminalsvv into strings; for example, if the application of production x-+y is to be noted for later use, then either rule x+py or xtyp would be used in the tactics to introduce p as a marker of the occurrence of x+y. The chief drawback of this approach is that the npseudo-terminals" such w p must eventually be delete-d, making nhll rules necessary.
752:781	One possible solution may be to discover some bound on the number of null rule applitations needed, resembling the "cpzling functiontf proposed by Peters and Ritchie (C91).
753:781	Another solution is to consider a new form'al model which allows rgallzation to access u~iformly all parts of the derivations on tactics; this approach is considered in C31.
754:781	Before concluding, we take a brief look at thc prablams raised by one addition to the basic model discussed so far, namely ordered yules.
755:781	It has often been found useful in linguistic descriptions to use rules af the form "A+u if some c,ondition C hlds, otherwise A+vv; basically, these types of r~leS' av~id stating the negation of ~ondi~tion C, which may be cumbersome.
756:781	In certain stratifi~at~onal descriptions.
757:781	this has lapsed into the use of rules of the form "A+u if this can lead to a completed derivation, otherwise A+vu.
758:781	This notion is formalized by Sampson through the assignment of 'lwcightsr' or "preference values" to certain rules.
759:781	Thus A+u may be given value 1 while A+v receives value 0, and these values fire accbmulilt%d throughout the derivation.
760:781	At the end, only those expression strings resulting from some content strlng are taken which have derivations with maximal preference values.
761:781	The fundamental problem with this use of flordered rulesv is that even in context-sens-itive grammars it is in general recursively undecidable whether a certain derivation can be successfully completed or not.
762:781	In faat, we show that using "ordered rules" we can genelate even non-recursively enumerable sets, an obviously undsirable situation.
763:781	Theorem 4.4 There exists a context-sensitive grammar G with one "ordered ruleu which generates a non-RE language.
764:781	Proof The proof rests on the we11 known result that there exists an RE language LO over some alphabet T, bhose complement is not -3 RE and that there is a type 1 grammar GO = (NO,T~,S',P~), where TO = T u {b,#), such that L(G') = {uf#b i (w) we^', i(w) is some integel; depending on w 1 (1 . Consider the grammar N G' = (N1,T?,Sf,Pr) where Nf *= NO u TO u {Y,Sv,Z), To' = T u T, Pt contains PO and additional productions as described below, The grammar G' behaves informally as follows: * (a) from St, we gene~ate some string wSf such that weT, using productions from Hf + as9 I BET-); (b) then wc apply thk ordered rule " St -+ YSO wlth weight 1, S' -+ ?Z with weight "0"; the plan is that the new nontermlnal Y can be rewritten Into a terminal, 7, if and only if Y appears in a L string $clanging to {wYwlf} {b} (i .e. iff rules of GO can be 3 uscd to ~ewrite SO into somc w#b, where w is thc same as the guess 0 made in fa)).
765:781	Once some de~ivation from S is completed, it is clear that context-sensitive rules can bebused to check out the aoove condition for Y. In addition, the same rules can place tvbarsv over all the symbols thus checked, resulting, if successful, ---j in a sentence of the form w#w#b .
766:781	(c) Z on the other hand simply travels across the string w and places ffdotsvl on top of every symbol, using rules from {sZ + ZS~S~T} ---c The result will be that L(Gv) = (w#wtbj lwcI,O) u {~Iw~L') . Suppose that L(Gf) is RE, and let h be the homomorphism which deletes all symbols not in T, and removes the dots from the others.
767:781	Then h(C(G1)) is also RE because the RE sets are closed under homomorphism; but h(L(Gt)) is the complement of LO, and thus not in RE by our choice of LO.
768:781	Therefore by contradiction, L(G1) is not RE.
769:781	A similar pr0o.f can be given fo'r stratificational grammars with two or more context-free tactics.
770:781	These results draw attention to the need to redefine the notion of "ordered yule" in stratificational usage, and point out that care must be taken whenever f~rmalizing aspects of linguistic practice.
771:781	In -conclusiofl, om investigation of the formal properties of the stratificational model proposed by Sampson revealed certain unintuitive properties which make it less desirable as a tool for natural languitge description.
772:781	Thus, the use of realiz$tion rulcs with null lcfthafftd sides was shown to allow unbounded number of realizations for certain strings.
773:781	More significantly, we showed that n-RSTRAT grammars with even one tactics allowing selfembedding could generate all RE sets.
774:781	Since there are well known problems raigea by this possibility, most significant being the inability to decide grammaticality, we identified a lipguistically acceptable restriction on the realization, namely k-leftmost derivations*, which led to improvements in some situations.
775:781	Under this addi t3onal constraint, classes of n-RSTRAT grammars were shown.
776:781	to variously generate the context -f ree languages, the QuasA-realtime languages and the context-sensitive languages.
777:781	Unfortunately, even in this case n-RSTRAT grammars could generate non-recursive sets, unless null realizations were restricted, and we discussed the problems inhepcrrt in this approach.
778:781	Finally, we examined the definitio~ of "ordered rulesff used in some stratificatichal gxammars, and formalized by Sampson, showing that it allowed the generatton of even non-RE sets with type, 1 tactics.
779:781	The above formal results about the generative power of stratifgcational grammars hopefully answer the requests of critics such as Pittha ([101), and demonstrate the inaccuracy of Postal's classification of stratif icational grammars a$ simply vaniants 01 context-free phrase structure grammarsThe 'results also indicate same of the problcm areas in this formal model for stratification~l linguistics.
780:781	We emphasize though that the problems arc specific to this particular formalism, ahd should not bc taken a% condemnations of stratificatibnal linguistics iq general, since there are other stratificational models which avoid these pitfallsAcknowledgements I would like tp thank Professor Ray Perrault for his much appreciated advice and help both during my graduate student career and aftt6r it.
