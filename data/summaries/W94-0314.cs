4.1 Head-driven Bottom-up Generation I adopt a head-driven bottom up generation algorithm (Calder/etal, 1989; Shieber/etal-89; vanNoord-90) that takes advantage of lexical information as well as the topdown input provided by the planner.
E89-1032
This algorithm is very similar to the (Calder/etal, 1989) algorithm for Unificational Categorial Grammar (UCG).
