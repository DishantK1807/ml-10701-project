A widely cited method is that of Hearst (1992), who argues that specific lexical relations are expressed in well-known intrasentential lexico-syntactic patterns.
C92-2082
For some experiments, relations were considered between noun phrases, labelled using LT CHUNK (Mikheev and Finch, 1997).
A97-1054
Hearst and others learn relations between either noun phrases or single words, while Morin (1999) discusses how hypernyms learnt between single words can be projected onto multi-word terms.
P99-1050
The algorithm was implemented using the GATE NLP framework (Cunningham et al., 2002) and texts preprocessed using the tokeniser, sentence splitter, and part-of-speech (POS) tagger provided with GATE.
P02-1022
Berland and Charniak (1999) report what they believed to be the first work finding part-whole relations from unlabelled corpora.
P99-1008
Morin (1999) reported a semiautomatic implementation of Hearstâ€™s algorithm.
