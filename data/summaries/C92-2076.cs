1. INTRODUCTION It has become common to make a distinction between a language for file description of feature structures and feature structures themselves, which are seeu as directed acyclic graphs (dags) or automata (see, for instance, Kasper and Rounds, 1986).

There is an important body of research concerned with the development of algorithms that avoid the expensive expansion to DNF (e.g., Kasper, 1987).

3). Translating between feature descriptions and feature structures and checking that a description is valid (that is, corresponds to a valid feature structure) is computationally trivial, and does not rely on the (potentially expensive) application of equivalence rules as in Kasper and Rounds (1986).
