In bilingual terminology mining from specialized comparable corpora, the terminology reference lists are often composed of a hundred words (180 SWTs in (Déjean and Gaussier, 2002) and 97 SWTs in (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002)).

This corpus comparability is discussed by lexical alignment researchers but never demonstrated: it is often reduced to a specific domain, such as the medical (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or financial domains (Fung, 1998), or to a register, such as newspaper articles (Fung, 1998).

extraction programs The terminology extraction programs are available for both French1 (Daille, 2003) and Japanese2 (Takeuchi et al., 2004).

This approach differs from that used by (Robitaille et al., 2006) for French/Japanese translation.

For single-item French-English words applied on a medical corpus of 0.66 million words, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) obtained 61% and 94% precision on the top-10 and top-20 candidates.

For lexical alignment from comparable corpora, good results on single words can be obtained from large corpora — several millions words — the accuracy of proposed translation is about 80% for the top 10-20 candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002).

(Cao and Li, 2002) have achieved 91% accuracy for the top three candidates using the Web as a comparable corpus.

The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Peters and Picchi, 1998; Rapp, 1999) slightly modified to handle both singleand multi-word terms.

For an MWT of length a25, (Robitaille et al., 2006) produce all the combinations of MWU elements of a length less than or equal to a25 . For example, the French term syndrome de fatigue chronique (chronic fatigue disease) yields the following four combinations: i) a27syndrome de fatigue chroniquea28, ii) a27syndrome de fatiguea28a29a27chroniquea28, iii) a27syndromea28a30a27fatigue chroniquea28 and iv) a27syndromea28 a27fatiguea28a31a27chroniquea28 . We limit ourselves to the combination of type iv) above since 90% of the candidate terms provided by the term extraction process, after clustering, are only composed of two content words.
