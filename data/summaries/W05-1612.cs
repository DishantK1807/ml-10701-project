One possible direction here is to exploit the relatively rich linguistic representation of the input sentences (POS tags, lemmas and dependency structures), for instance, along the lines of [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000].

alignment In this section, we describe the alignment algorithm that we use (section 3.1), and evaluate its performance (section 3.2). 3.1 Tree alignment algorithm The tree alignment algorithm is based on [Meyers et al., 1996], and similar to that used in [Barzilay, 2003].

The table also shows the Îº-score, which is another commonly used measure for inter-annotator agreement [Carletta, 1996].

Initially work focused on word-based alignment, but more recent research also addresses alignment at the higher levels (substrings, syntactic phrases or trees), e.g.,[Gildea, 2003].

Starting point was the sentence fusion model proposed by [Barzilay et al., 1999; Barzilay, 2003] in which dependency analyses of pairs of sentences are first aligned, after which the aligned parts (representing the common information) are fused.

The alignment algorithm is tested with the following NODEMATCH function: NODEMATCH(v,vprime) = 8> >>> >< >>>> >: 10 if STR(v) = STR(vprime) 5 if LABEL(v) = LABEL(vprime) 2 if LABEL(v) is a synonym hyperonym or hyponym of LABEL(vprime) 0 otherwise 1In the original formulation of the algorithm by [Meyers et al., 1996], there is a penalty for skipping edges.

Similar work is described in [Pang et al., 2003], who describe a syntax-based algorithm that builds word lattices from parallel translations which can be used to generate new paraphrases.

In this paper, we take a closer look at sentence fusion [Barzilay, 2003][Barzilay et al., 1999], one of the interesting variants in text-to-text generation.

Such applications are sometimes referred to as text-to-text generation applications (e.g., [Chandrasekar and Bangalore, 1997], [Knight and Marcu, 2002], [Lapata, 2003]), and may be likened to earlier revision-based generation strategies, e.g.
