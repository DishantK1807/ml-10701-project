The separation of these two requirements 7 A more precise account of what it means to be able to identify an object is beyond the scope of this paper; for further details, see the discussions by Hobbs (1985), Appelt (1985), Kronfeld (1986, 1990), and Morgenstern (1988).

To formalize this relation, we rely on Kronfeld's (1986, 1990) notion of an individuating set.

These purposes and their interrelationships form the intentional structure of the discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

P86-1032
Once an OCP recognizes the initiation of a new discourse segment, it must determine the relationship of that segment's DSP to the other DSPs underlying the discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
The Expert should then communicate that information to the Apprentice (Pollack 1986b).
P86-1032
Grosz and Sidner (1986) also describe a contributes relation between DSPs that is the inverse of the dominates relation.
J86-3001
Moore and Paris (1993), however, have begun to look at the problem of participating in longer discourses and in particular at the problem of responding to follow-up questions.
J93-4004
A discourse is composed of discourse segments much as a sentence is composed of constituent phrases (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
Otherwise, if G1 does not understand the relevance of G2"s utterance, or 11 The recognition of propositional content from surface form has been studied by other researchers (e.g., Allen and Perrault \[1980\], Litman and Allen \[1987\], Lambert and Carberry \[1991\]) and is not discussed in this paper.
P91-1007
However, as Grosz and Sidner (1986) have argued, the OCP must be able to recognize initially at least a generalization of the DSP so that the proper moves of attentional state can be made.
J86-3001
This is also true of Lambert and Carberry's (1992) more recent work on modeling negotiation subdialogues.
P92-1025
We then compare our approach to discourse 528 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model processing with previous plan-based approaches (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987; Lambert and Carberry 1991; Ramshaw 1991) and show that our approach is aimed at recognizing and reasoning with a different type of intention.
P91-1006 P91-1007
For example, as Appelt points out (1985, 200), "the description that one 6 Basic-level actions are by their nature single-agent actions.

Ramshaw (1991) has augmented Litman and Allen's two types of plans with a different third type, exploration plans.

These mental attitudes may be ascribed on the basis of those of the OCP's beliefs that are in accord with the mental attitudes comprising the SharedPlan (Pollack 1986a; Grosz and Sidner 1990).

Their intentions guide their behavior and their conversational partners' recognition of those intentions aids in the latter's understanding of their utterances (Grice 1969; Sidner 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986).

For example, consider DSPs of the form "Intend that some agent intend to perform some physical task," as proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986, 179).
J86-3001
In their paper on discourse structure, Grosz and Sidner give several examples of the types of intentions that could serve as DSPs (Grosz and Sidner 1986, 179): 1.

Contextual Role of Intentional Structure An utterance of a discourse can either begin a new segment of the discourse, complete the current segment, or contribute to it (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
Clause (1) of the definition indicates that an agent does not need a recipe to perform a basic-level action, i.e., one executable at will (Pollack 1986a).
P86-1032
We reserve tlhe term mental phenomenon approach for those approaches, such as SharedPlans 536 Lochbaum A Collaborative Planning Model and Pollack's individual plans (Pollack 1986b, 1990; Grosz and Kraus 1996), that take mental states to be primary.
P86-1032
Approaches Lambert and Carberry (1991) have revised Litman and Allen's dichotomy of plans into a trichotomy of discourse, problem-solving, and domain plans.

4. Grosz and Sidner's Theory of Discourse Structure According to Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory, discourse structure is comprised of three interrelated components: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state.
J86-3001
Following Grosz and Sidner (1986), we will refer to that agent as the ICP for initiating conversational participant; the other participant is the OCP.
J86-3001
Our suspicion, however, is that as with interpretation, the augmentation process provides a model of discourse-level intentions, while work such as Moore and Paris's (1993) is really providing a model of utterance-level intentions.
J93-4004
Intentions such as these, as well as segment beginnings and endings, might be recognized on the basis of linguistic markers, utterance-level intentions, or knowledge about actions and objects in the domain of discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
More recent work (Litman 1985; Litman and Allen 1987; Lambert and Carberry 1991; Ramshaw 1991) has been concerned with the problems introduced by discourses containing subdialogues.
P91-1006 P91-1007
3. Reasoning with SharedPlans In more traditional plan-based approaches to natural language processing (e.g., the work of Cohen and Perrault \[1979\], Allen and Perrault \[1980\], Sidner \[1985\], Carberry \[1987\], Litman and Allen \[1987\], Lambert and Carberry \[1991\]), reasoning about plans is focused on reasoning about actions.
P91-1007
The recipe's constraints, however, require that D be of the appropriate sort, according to the constraint .T(6, Pi), for the identification of the parameter to be successful (Appelt 1985; Kronfeld 1986, 1990; Hintikka 1978).
P85-1025 P86-1029
They have argued that while previous work in generation (e.g., the work of McKeown \[1985\], McCoy \[1989\], Paris \[1988\], and Hovy \[1991\]) has been concerned with what information to communicate and how, responding to follow-up questions also requires maintaining a record of why the information is being communicated.
J88-3006
The operations on the focus space stack depend upon subsidiary rela561 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 4 tionships between SharedPlans in the same way that Grosz and Sidner (1986) describe the operations as depending upon DSP relationships.
J86-3001
We now show that this model satisfies the requirements set out by Grosz and Sidner's (1986) theory of discourse structure.
J86-3001
The intentional structure of the discourse, comprised of discourse segment purposes and their interrelationships, plays a central role in this process (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
As Pollack (1986b, 1990) has noted, however, these mental attitudes are typically transparent to the reasoning process.
P86-1032
For each utterance of a discourse, an agent must determine whether the utterance begins a new segment of the discourse, completes the current segment, or contributes to it (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
