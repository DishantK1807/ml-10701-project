810 rue Champagneur, suite 210 Montreal H2V 4S3, Quebec, Canada 1 Introduction During tim past few years we liave been concerned with developing models for the automatic planning and realization of report texts wittlin technical sublanguages of English and French.
Since 1987 we have been implementing Meaning-Text language models (MTMs) \[6, 7\] for the task of realizing sentences from semantic specifications that are output by a text planner.
A relatively complete MTM implementation for English was tested in the domain of operating system audit summaries in tile Gossip project of 1987-89 \[3\].
At COLING-gO a report was given on the fully operational FoG system for generating marine forecasts in both English and French at weather centres in Eastern Canada \[1\].
The work reported on here concerns the experimental generation of extended bilingual summaries of Canadian statistical data.
Our first focus has been on labour force surveys (LFS), where an extensive corpus of published reports in each language is available for empirical study.
Tire current LFS system has built on the experience of the two preceding systems, but goes beyond either of them 1.
Iu contrast to FoG, but similar to Gossip, LFS uses a semantic net representation of sentences as input to the realization process.
Like Gossip, LFS also makes use of theme/theme constraints to help optimize lexical and syntactic choices during sentence realizatiou.
But in contrast to Gossip, which produced only English texts, LFS is bilingual, making use of the conceptual level of representation produced by the planner as an interlingua from which to derive the linguistic semantic representations for texts in the two languages independently.
Hence the LFS interlingua is much "deeper" than FoG's deep-syntactic interlingua.
This allows us to iutroduce certain semantic differences between English and I,Â¥ench sentences that we observe in natural "translation twin" texts.
1The LFS Bystem is being developed by CoGenTex Inc.
under contract 36902-O-0749/Ol-XAF wich Communications Canada, Canadian Workplace Automation Research Centre.
Tim first four authors have current academic affiliations with the Universlt6 de Montr~al.
Polgu6re is now at the National University of Singapore.
LFS is based on a much more detailed text planning process than was attempted earlier, and results in texts of much greater length and complexity.
For example, sentence order within certain parts of statistical texts depends on data salience, therefore requiring locally dynamic text planning.
Text planning also includes tests that allow for appropriate use of certain quantifier expressions (e.g., all, mosO, evaluative words such as also and only, and intrasentential pronominalization.
LFS also incorporates some substantial extensions in our use of the Meaning-Text framework.
First, it makes more use of lexical functions (ef.\[8\]), the mechanism in MTMs that allows computation of appropriate collocations and semautieally related lexemes needed ill paraphrasing and ill conflict resolution during generation.
Second, the grammar is more extensive, covering important types of conjunction and ellipsis.
Generation in the domain of employment statistics is not new.
Roesner's Semtex system \[10\] produced German (and later, English) summaries of such data that are remarkably similar in style as well as coutent to our own.
The difference lies in our use of a powerflfl linguistic model that promises to simplify the problem of scaling up the generator to more complex and varied texts, or extend them to other varieties of text.
Furthermore, the LFS project is using feedback from domain experts to refine tile rules nsed in both text planning and realization.
2 Text
Planning for Statistical Reports Our approach to planning statistical reports is similar to that used on tile Gossip project \[2\].
A "conceptual frame" tree schema is mstantiated with input data to provide an initial characterization of the intended content of the reports.
Input data for the employment domain is in the form of relational taAcrEs DE COLING-92.

1992 bles which provide numerical values for employment, unemployment, participation rate, etc., broken down by age, sex, region and industry, for the current reporting period (e.g., month), as well as for previous comparison periods (e.g., preceding month, one year ago, etc.).
The instantiated tree gives a preliminary hierarchical structure for the future text, and provides a framework for further processing on the content to determine the details of text structure.
For example, comparisons of employment changes in various labour force groups will lead to ordering messages (future clauses) so as to highlight the most significant changes.
The tree structure is traversed and modified as a part of this process.
The conceptual text tree also carries annotations of theme and theme specifications which will constrain the set of possible texts which can be derived from it.
An important part of text planning is the identification of messages which can be grouped together into structures which will give rise to single sentences.
This includes conjoining two messages with identical theme to give marked structures that will produce linguistic conjunction and subject pronominalization later as in: (1) Employment increased by 20,000 among women while it decreased slightly among men.
Conceptual conjunction includes checking and marking similarities in thematic elements that may later lead to ellipsis, as in (2), with the possible introduction of lexical functions such as in (3) 2.
(2) Employment increased by 5000 in Manitoba, by 10,800 in Alberta and by 15,000 in Ontario.
(3) For the week ended November 18, 1989, the seasonally adjusted level of employment was estimated at 12,518,000, up 32,000from October.
It has been noticed \[5\] that certain types of report texts have complex internal dependencies that put special demands on the planning mechanism used.
In particular, top-down expansion of rhetorical operators is inadequate for generating statistical reports in our domain.
Our planning approach, by making use of the power of arbitrary tests and operations on tree schemata, allows us to adequately represent the cross-serial dependencies found among the pieces of content of these reports.
However, a more general, but appropriately constrained language for report planning seems to be a desirable goal for future research.
ZThe lexeme up is the value of tile lexical function Adv 1 applied to the verb ir.crea#e. 3 Interlingual Representation Published bilingual reports in our domain occasionally exhibit deep differences between corresponding English and French sentences, as in (4a) and (4b): (4a) Employment remained virtually unchanged.
(4b) L'emploi a pen vari4.
\["Employment changed little."\] Not only are the surface syntactic structures incomparable in this case, but they cannot be easily related on the level of linguistic semantics, because their semantic predicates are dissimilar.
We have therefore chosen to use a conceptual interlingua (the output of the text planning process) in order to derive separate semantic net representations of the sentences in each language.
Hence the sentences (4a) and (4b) are derived from non-isomorphic Meaning-Text semantic networks, which allow us to fully represent the two languages' different '~iewpoints" on the same conceptual material.
4 Realizer
Design Grammatical realization in the LFS system is the process by which the semantic nets produced by the planner for the incipient sentences are converted into surface sentences of each language.
Our realizer for English is based largely on the general Meaning-Text sentence realizer used in Gossip, with some additions to cover structures found in statistical texts.
A comparable realizer for French has been built for LFS.
As in the case of Gossip, we use four main linguistic levels of representation between conceptual structures and texts: semantic nets (SemR), deep syntactic dependency trees (DSyntR), surface syntactic dependency trees (SSyntR) and morphological strings (MorphR).
For each language, the first linguistic operation requires searching the semantic net for a given sentence to determine the communicatively dominant node.
This search is constrained by the theme/theme specifications which the SemR inherits from the conceptual structure (see \[9, 3\]).
The second operation consists of "replacing" single or complex (configurations of) meauing-bearing nodes in the semantic network by actual lexemes of the language, and replacing semantic features on those nodes by grammatical features which will be attached to the nodes of the future deep-syntactic tree.
These operations lead to a reduced semam tic graph (RSemR), which is intermediate between SemR and DSyntR.
In fact, the SemR is not modi~ ACIES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 ^ot~r 1992 I 0 2 0 PROC.

23-28, 1992 fled, but rather it is used as a blueprint for building the RSemR, just as each subsequent representation is built by mapping rules from its ancestor representation.
The production of the DSyntR tree out of the RSemR, called "arborization", entails the mapping of predicate-argument relations to deep syntactic relations using information about potential dominant nodes of tim RSemR and grammatical features.
The SSyntR is built by mapping deep-syntactic nodes and relations into their surface-syntactic counterparts.
Single DSyntR nodes corresponding to phrasemes (i.e., locutions) give rise to syntactic subtrees in SSyntR, and some grammatical lexemes are introduced, including auxiliary verbs, articles and syntactically motivated prepositions.
The next mapping, to MorpbR structure, determines word order and all syntactically motivated morphological features.
A final operation produces actual text by computing the final (graphical) wordforms based on the morphological features attached to lexemes in MorphR.
5 Lexical
Functions The sublanguage of statistical summary reports shows a certain amount of variation in the syntactic structure and \[exieal choices used to express a given content.
We have used lexical functions to implement this paraphrastic variation in a systematic way within our Meaning-Text models, much as was done in Gossip \[3\].
Briefly stated, lexical functions (LFs) can be considered abstract meanings which have different lexical values depending on their argument lexemes.
LFs provide a way of delaying some idiosyncratic lexical realizations until after major syntactic choices have beeu made.
They also allow us to formulate very general paraphrase rules.
Our statistical reports, with their emphasis on numerical changes and comparisons of change, provide an excellent opportunity to use lexical flmctions, such as Magn ("intensifying" word), S O (action nominal) and Oper I (agent-oriented support verb).
For example, sentence (6) can be calculated to be a paraphrase of (5): (5) Employment decreased sharply in October.
(6) Employment showed a sharp decrease in October.
A general paraphrase rule states that a verbal lexeme (here, decrease), can be paraphrased by a syntactic construction where the new verb (i.e., show) is the value of Oper I operating on the nominalizatiou (i.e., S0) of the old verb.
This computation, carried out by successively looking up LF values in argument word lexieal entries, derives the new verb show by functional composition.
In the derived paraphrase sentence (6) this new verb takes as its syntactic object the nominalization of the old verb.
In a separate operation which if factored out of the paraphrase operation, the lexical value of the intensifier sharp is computed via the lexical function Magn operating on lexeme decrease.
It is simpler to delay its evaluation until after the change in grmnmatieal category of the head word.
The paraphrase rule which relates the two verbal constructions of (5) and (6) can be stated using only lexieal functions, lexical class (part-of-speech) symbols and grammatical relations, without reference to specific lexical |tents.
In addition to the above "well-known" lexical functions, our domain also makes use of Syn (synonym), AntiMagn (diminutive modifier), Locin (locative preposition), Adv 1 (locative adverb) and several more "exotic" ones.
Most LFs used in our system are introduced during the mapping from RSemR to DSyntR.
Exceptions include Syn, which is used during reduction of SemR to RSemR.
When there are two semantic nodes with identical lexemic meanings, the realizer uses Syn to lexicalize one differently from the other by finding a synonym.
6 Implementation
and Future Directions The LFS system is implemented in Quintus Prolog on Sun 4 workstations.
Adaptations to several specific varieties of employment reports have been carried out, including the multi-paragraph general summary reports for English and French, given below in Â§6.1 and Â§6.2 respectively.
The approach outlined here is now being extended to produce other varieties of statistical reports, dealing with different kinds of data (e.g., retail trade summaries).
The user interface, which currently allows various choices from among a set of options, is being made more flexible and dynamic by tying tile choices more directly to tile tree schemata that guide the planning process.
Until now, LFS paraphrasing capability has been implemented only for eases where variation is needed to avoid repetition within a given sentence.
The next step, now in preparation, is to enforce variation over longer stretches of text such as whole paragraphs.
