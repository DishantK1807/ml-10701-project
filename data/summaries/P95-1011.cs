The issue of efficient representation for I_'rAG 1 is discussed by Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992), who 1As with all fully lexicMized grammar formalisms, there is really no conceptual distinction to be drawn in I_TAG between the lexicon and the grammar: tile gramrnatical rules are just lexical properties.

with related work As noted above, Vijay-Shanker & Schabes (1992) have also proposed an inheritance-based approach to this problem.

But it is only more recently that grammars of non-trivial size have been developed: Abeille, Bishop, Cote & Schabes (1990) describe a feature-based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (\[_'lAG) for English which subsequently became the basis for the grammar used in the XTAG system, a wide-coverage \[_TAG parser (Doran et al., 1994b; Doran et al., 1994a; XTAG Research Group, 1995).

Following LTAG conventions (for the time being), the node labels here are gross syntactic category specifications to which additional featural information may be added 5, and are annotated to indicate node type: <> indicates an anchor node, and I indicates a substitution node (where a 3See, for example, Bleiching (1992; 1994), Brown & Hippisley (1994), Corbett & Fraser (1993), Cahill (1990; 1993), Cahill &: Evans (1990), Fraser &= Corbett (in press), Gibbon (1992), Kilgarriff (1993), Kilgarriff & Gazdar (1995), Reinhard & Gibbon (1991).

In this paper we explore this suggestion by showing how the lexical knowledge representation language (LKRL) DA'lR (Evans & Gazdar, 1989a; Evans & Gazdar, 1989b) can be used to formulate a compact, hierarchical encoding of an \[-'lAG.

They use monotonic inheritance to build up partial descriptions of trees: each description is a finite set of dominance, immediate dominance and linear precedence statements about tree nodes in a tree description language developed by Rogers & Vijay-Shanker (1992), and category information is located in the node labels.
