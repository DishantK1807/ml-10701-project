This view is, we believe, consistent with the more detailed formal interfaces to discourse semantics/pragmatics presented in (Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997; van den Berg, 1996), and also allows for multiple discourse relations (intentional and informational) to hold between discourse units (Moore and Pollack, 1992; Moser and Moore, 1995; Moser and Moore, 1996) and contribute to the semantic/pragmatics effects on the recipient's discourse model.
