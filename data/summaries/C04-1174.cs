As a response to these problems and following the work in (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999), we propose a method to construct Japanese nominal case frames from large corpora, based on an accurate analysis of “Nm no Nh” phrases using an ordinary dictionary and a thesaurus.

results of indirect anaphora resolution We conducted a preliminary experiment of our indirect anaphora resolution system using “Relevance-tagged corpus” (Kawahara et al., 2002).

In case of verbs, syntactic structures such as subject/object/PP in English or case markers such as ga, wo, ni in Japanese can be utilized as a strong clue to distinguish several obligatory cases and adjuncts (and adverbs), which makes it feasible to construct case frames from large corpora automatically (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002).

An input sentence is parsed using the Japanese parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).

Work which addressed indirect anaphora in English texts so far restricts relationships to a small, relatively well-defined set, mainly part-of relation like the above example (2), and utilized hand-crafted heuristic rules or hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as WordNet (Hahn et al., 1996; Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Strube and Hahn, 1999).

In case of Japanese text analysis, (Murata et al., 1999) proposed a method of utilizing “Nm no Nh” phrases for indirect anaphora resolution of diverse relationships.

Based on such an observation, (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999) proposed a semantic analysis method of “Nm no Nh”, consisting of the two modules: dictionary-based analysis (abbreviated to DBA hereafter) and semantic featurebased analysis (abbreviated to SBA hereafter).
