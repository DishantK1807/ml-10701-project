102 Following Iwayama et al (1994) and Fuhr (1989), we define the likelihood function by: Â£(c I d) = ~ P(c I t)P(tld) (1) t which is meant to be a relativization of the relationship between c and d to some index t (Fuhr, 1989); The index t could be anything from simple units such as a word, a bigram, or a trigram to more complex forms such as a phrase or a sentence.

One such function is proposed by Hearst (1994), where a text structure is determined by measuring the similarity between adjacent blocks of text.

In the past, the problem has been addressed mostly by computational linguists in relation to issues like coreference (Hobbs, 1978), anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lappin and Leass, 1994), or discourse center (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981; Walker et al., 1994).
