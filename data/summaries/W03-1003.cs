In a monolingual setting, the mutual information between lexical pairs co-occurring anywhere within a long “window” of each-other has been used to capture statistical dependencies not covered by a1 -gram LMs (Rosenfeld, 1996; Tillmann and Ney, 1997).

Specifically, stochastic translation lexicons estimated using the IBM method (Brown et al., 1993) from a fairly large sentence-aligned Chinese-English parallel corpus are used in their approach — a considerable demand for a resourcedeficient language.

Morphological analyzers, noun-phrase chunkers, POS taggers, etc., have also been developed for resource deficient languages by exploiting translated or parallel text (Yarowsky et al., 2001).

Alternately, they may also be obtained automatically from a parallel corpus of translated and sentence-aligned Chinese-English text using statistical machine translation techniques, such as the publicly available GIZA++ tools (Och and Ney, 2000), as done by Khudanpur and Kim (2002).
