This is in contrast to work by researchers such as Schiitze and Pedersen (1992), Brown et al (1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1995), where it is often the most frequent words in the lexicon which are clustered, predominantly with the purpose of determining their grammatical classes.

While Schiitze and Pedersen (1993), Brown et al (1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1993) all demonstrate the ability of their systems to identify word similarity using clustering on the most frequently occurring words in their corpus, only Grefenstette (1992) demonstrates his system by generating word similarities with respect to a set of target words.

Brown et al (1992), Futrelle and Gauch (1993)), comparisons with our work are difficult to draw, due to their use of the 1,000 commonest words from their respective corpora.

Brown et al 1992), the size of the corpus makes preprocessing such as lemmatization, POS tagging or partial parsing, too costly.

Positional information is also retained by Brown et ai (1992), who store collocation information as word n-grams.

Mutual information-based approaches, such as those of Brown et ai (1992) and Futrelle and Gauch (1993), measure word similarity in the context of a set of words to be clustered, typically with the aim of clustering for general similarity.

In Brown et al (1992), the authors provide some sample subtrees resulting from such a 1,000-word clustering.
