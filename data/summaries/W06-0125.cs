The above MIIM has been successfully applied in many applications, such as text chunking (Zhou 2004), Chinese word segmentation ( Zhou 2005), English named entity recognition in the newswire domain (Zhou et al 2002) and the biomedical domain (Zhou et al 2004; Zhou et al 2006).

In this competition, the SVM plus sigmoid classifier is used in Chinese word segmentation while a simple backoff approach as described in Zhou et al (2002) is used in named entity recognition.
