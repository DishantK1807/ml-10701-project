As mentioned earlier, our approach was motivated by Karttunen's implementation as described in Karttunen 1984.
P84-1008
Our definition was motivated by the linguistic intention of the negation operator as given by Karttunen (1984), where, for instance, we require that an automaton satisfying the formula case : --ndative have an atomic value for the case feature.
P84-1008
As discussed in Section 3.1, Kasper (1988a) used the operations of negation and implication in extending Functional Unification Grammar.
C88-1063 P88-1029
We have, however, seen examples of formulae where 3 l occurs in the scope of a negation (for instance, Kasper \[1988b\] uses the formula 3Mood-type--, Rank : Clause).
C88-1063 P88-1029
We also presented one particular three-valued interpretation for FDL, motivated by the approach to negation given by Karttunen (1984), that meets the conditions stated by Pereira.
P84-1008
Such elements, called feature structures, have been used in linguistic theories, such as Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; Gadzar et al.1985) and Lexical Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan 1983), and in computational formalisms, such as Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1979) and PATR-II (Shieber 1984).
P84-1075
In Dawar and Vijay-Shanker 1989 and the present work, we introduced the framework of three-valued logic as a means of defining the semantics of a feature structure description language with negation.
P89-1003
Kasper (1988a) discusses an interpretation of negation and implication in an implementation of Functional Unification Grammar that is extended to include conditionals.
C88-1063 P88-1029
We suggested that three-valued logic provides us with a framework appropriate for defining the semantics of a feature description logic (which we will call FDL) that includes a negation operator (Dawar and Vijay-Shanker 1989).
P89-1003
The property is stated in the following theorem (Rounds and Kasper 1986): Theorem 1.
P86-1038
A similar notion was used by Kasper (1988a), who introduces the notion of compatibility.
C88-1063 P88-1029
Karttunen (1984), for instance, provides examples of feature structures in which a negation operator might be useful.
P84-1008
Rounds and Kasper introduced a logical formalism to describe feature structures with disjunctive specification (Kasper 1987; Kasper and Rounds 1986; Rounds and Kasper 1986).
P86-1038
This interpretation is essentially the same one we presented earlier (Dawar and Vijay-Shanker 1989).
