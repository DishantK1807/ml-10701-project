particularly with regard to syntactic case frames, can be found in Ballard (1986).

Systems similar in goals to TELI but which revolve around logical form include TEAM (Grosz, 1983; Grosz, Appelt.
A83-1006
This brevity is largely due to the use of case frames that embody dynamically alterable selectional restrictions (Ballard, 1986).

and Ballard and Tinkham (1984).

Concerning the latter assumption, we note that (a) some important disambiguations, including problems of word sense, will have been made during parsing by reference to selectional restrictions (Ballard and Tinkham, 1984), and (b) minimal re-ordering does occur in converting parse trees into internal representations.
J84-2001 P84-1013
By way of overview, we note that the TELI system derives from previous work on the LDC project, as documented in Ballard (1982), Ballard (1984), Ballard, Lusth and Tinkham (1984).
J84-2001 P84-1013
By providing for an "extendible" class of constructs, we make the knowledge acquisition module of TELl independent of the natural language portion of the system, whose earlier version has been described in Ballard and Tinkham (1984) and Ballard.

Some of the systems which, like TEL1, seek to provide for user customization within the context of database query are ASK (Thompson and Thompson 1983, 1985).
