Previous work in automated essay grading and related technologies has been surveyed and discussed in several different forums (Burstein and Chodorow, 1999; Thompson, 1999; Hearst, 2000; Williams, 2001; Rudner and Gagne, 2001), and a thorough survey of the field has recently been published (Shermis and Burstein, 2003).
