We leave incorporating a more sophisticated response understanding model, such as Green and Carberry (1994), into our system for future work.

We evaluated the routing module performance on both transcriptions of caller utterances as well as output of the Bell Labs Automatic Speech Recognizer (Reichl et al.1998) based on speech input of caller utterances (Carpenter and Chu-Carroll 1998).

However, as discussed in Green and Carberry, (1994) and Hockey et al.(1997), responses to yes-no questions may not explicitly contain a yes or no term.

Our approach to call routing is novel in its application of vector-based information retrieval techniques to the routing process, and in its extension of the vectorbased representation for dynamically generating disambiguation queries (Chu-Carroll and Carpenter 1998).
