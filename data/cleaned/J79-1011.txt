included ir, such descrP~ticns.
Gne aspect cf language data--generally referred to as ~tylz--has been known fcz same time to be sub]ectivfly rather obvious but extrem~ly difficult ro characterize in objectiv2 tdrms, especially if one ignores the otvious rclc of lexical selection.
It uculd be ~ossibla to talk about style in nonsubjective terms If on WE able to identifv these surface ebments df language that appear to partlclgate in .stylistic variations and then to relate these to subsets of language data defined ky external criteria cf known genre, Frovenance, author, or situation.
However, zimple counts of elements with ~e~p~ct to such subsets have ncr provec to be cverly instructive, pri~arzly because it i~ presumably not the simple cccurrsncg of the elements which leads one to p~rce'ive a certain style but, rather, th~ far less obvious co-occurr~ac~ of SE~S cf elements (Karckucrth, 1973) . These co-occurr~~ces are ones whlch are not required by the grammar cf a language but which have a high probability of king linked in the genre in which they ccccx.
A useful definitio~; of style might be tHe overall pattern or gestalt perceivable Fn language data which transmits infcrmaticn ahcut an utterance with respect to the ~ersonal, sccial, and cultural relationshi~s assumed between speaker and hearer, the historical cr geographical Frcvenance of the scurce, and the bdenrity or mental state of the speaker, Reccqnitlcn cf such a qestalt allows the hearer or readex to assign the language data to a specific sub~oplaticn about which he already hast prototype information.
~ssuming this ~rcvidss a workable view of style, then the basic task cf an investigation of the phenomenon is 0x1 of generating hypot'hes~s about ~ossibls language-element ~arrici~ants in style-markifis constel latiom which can be investiqat~d i3 thema~lves and in pazterns cf co-or:currence, The results of such investigaticns, if success~ful in differentiating externally defined sut~opulations of language, will Frovide addit lonal data about lazguage to which any grammatical description must be responsible.
Genre, the focal ~cint of this study, is quite difficult to define in specific terms, As MarcKworth (1973, gp.
24-25) has noted: Genre tends to be a Humpty-Dumpty term, a useful ---concept which is redefined dithin tk~ limits of each discussion cf it with lit$le requirsment that such definitions have more than a superficial agreement with each cther.
---I Genre may distinguish Frose from poetry frcm drama; it may' distinguish historical Flays frcm Fxenc,h farces, scnnets from qics, mystery stories from all other novels, As a c-cnstruct it *has, ic fact, much in common with classif icaticn as def inad by pattern recognition ------------studies: a VouF of items alcng SON~ characteri~t ic (attribute) conti~uum uhcse members --------=A.-ars closer to each other than to their neighbors and which are not separated by a gaF across a critical perceptual bcundary or distance, The characteristic of the continuum and thg critical distance are continually zespecifiable in terms of the stimuli perceived and the fineness of'the 'I classificatory syseem required.
khsn viewed in these terms, it is immediately clear why qenre is at cnce such a vague and such a useful term, Co-fitinua based on a number of different characteristics may be used ss the basis for defining clusters of similar texts and the genrc classifications fcrmed on differcnt continua need not be parallel nor form mutually sxclusive gl;ou~s.
Some of ths continua used in genre classif icaticn are conteat, as in the case of the mystery story or the CavBlier love po~rs; -----intent r as in the case of humorous writing cr fantasy; fcrm as in the case of drama or the novel; and ---0 ccntext -----8 a z in the case of t~chnical or t~lletristic Frose.
This is not to claim that such character4stics are independent of each other or that any text may not be defined in terms of all four; simply that grou~ings along a coctinuum defined by any ons of them alone may be cited to establish ccntrast.ing genr9s.
This FapeE re~orts an inveStigation of a large variety of surfac~ syntzctic features, ranging frcm s~ntence type through el~ments of the verb, and the covariant pattsrns of cccurrcnce of such structures Tn five genres of written modern English.
It 1s rec,ognized, of course, that powerful 7 determiners of the xeccgnizability of various genre styles exist at both the infra-ssntential (e.
g., r~ecif ic lexical select ion) and su~,ra-sentential ((e., general content) lsv$l, but it is the aim o'f this study only to assess, at the level of the sentence, the cont ributicn of svntactic devic~s tc a measurable difference in genre-def ined styles.
PROCEDURE Thirty-six syntactic structures were selscted for considerati.cn on ths tasis of being possible contributors to the ccnstellaticn~ dftermini~ genre style.
They were chosen fzom four main categories: sentence-type, including the range of pcssible interrogative patterns; fccus phenomena of variouz sorts; dements of the main verb phrase: and a group of ccr joined or emEcdded structures.
17 is latter group included structures of noun-phrase modif icaticn, verbal complementation, sentence modification, and carallel el em en^ ccm]ciaihg.
Table 1 shows the svctactic structutes whose frequency cf occurrence was ccunted, along with the identification numbers assigned to each of these variables for use in subsequent tables and discussions.
Note that the, various structures are clearly hct ccmpletely indc padent of each cther.

Since these various flemerits arcl not complete1,y redundant, they are able to oFerats at i~ast semi-~ndependcntly as FOSS~~~€ !syntactic indicztor~ of style.
Five genres were chosen for investigaticn cc the basis cf scntext _c_f _ut_tfrz~cs which ~ermits identification by place cf ~ublicaticn..

contrcl variables associated with provenance.
F. complete de~cri~tion of this corpus anjd its ccntent may be found in Francis (19E4) or in Kucera & Fra~cis (1967).
A total sam~le of 560 sectences was drawn, 1 from each cf the five genres.
Each genre subset cf 1C4 consistsd cf tsn sentenczs frcm each of ten sentence-l~xgth blocks, Sentence length uas measured In words, and the blocks are ~hcwn in Table 2, These block lengths weif chosen to mirscr roughly the distribution of sentence lengths in the entire corpus, A st~uctursd sam~le of this kind was dkawn tc prevent sentence length as such from acting as a variable since sertenceler~gt h distributicn was already knc wn to differentiate among genres (Marckuorth G Eell, 1967), and also to guarantee that those syntactic devices which tad to be associated with greater sentence length wculd have equ~l c~portunitles to sppear within each genre sam~le.
Again, the emphasis in this study was on the sentkrce as the basic u~it cf analysis, and cn the CO-ccc urrence of syntactic structures within sentences, The reader should keep in mind, however, that a randcm sam~l~ cf ZentGnces would permit certain sentsnce TAELE 2 SENTENCE-LENGTH ELOCKS FOR SAMPIING -------------------------------C I-----------I-------------------.----------Block Number Block Length in Words lengths tc dcminate in sp~clfic gazes, ~cssibiy obscuring the CO-cccurr~nce ~attsrns of interest he re but, neverthsl~ss, ref'lectinq another property which can clearly he said to chariicter zeiqenre style, Each cf thE sarn~le sentences uas analyzed for the occurrEnce of the syntactic variables indicated in Table 1, and the cumber cf occurrences of each structure was recor6ed.
A discussicn cf the basis on whim the syntactic elements were identified may be found In Marckworth (1973, ~p.
4'4-48). The basic data for analysis thus consisted of 12 500 otservaticnq (ssntences) with ea~h observation scored on 56 variables and clIassified by genre and length.
The subsequent analysis cf these data was kased pqimarily d,n discriminaxit .functions 'which were used to determine how thg variabla~ rerved to distinguish one gare f rcm another.
Easically, discriminant tunction analysis is the multivariate extensicn cf the univariate F ratio which is used to distingulsh among previously estatlishsd groups.
Ir rrprezents, however, a contiderable incxease in both, complexity and analytical Fcuer since it focuses not only bn the simple.

It serves to maximize qxoup differences by developing maximally efficient weights whlch, when a~~lied to the original.daf2, will yield the clearsst disrinctions anong *he groups teing analyzed.
The mct hod of discrimina~t function analysis is discussed fully in Rulc~, et -al.

Because of this low incidence, inter ret tat ion of these variables would 1:~ difficult and tenuous so they were omitted from further a~alyses.
Each variable was first examined individually in an analysis cf varianc2 for the five genre groups and four tests were ruc cn ~ach to determine if th~ variable would dif f 2rentiat~: a, fiction frcm the ncn-fictipn genres, k, formal (Learced Journals ahd Government Documents) frcm Infcrmal (fjewspa,per Bepoeage and Popular Jc.urnale) ncn-f iction, c, Learn-ed Journals frcm G~vernment Cccuments, d.

Variable 6 (imperatives) wobld clearly distinguish between Ne wsFaFer Reportag6 and Popular Journals, which is,not surprising in vlew of the number of how-tc-do-it articles in the lattergare.
These two variakles (6 and 23) could be and were retained for the discriminant f uncticc znalyses, The remahlrg variables (1G, 52, 25, 30, 31,.
32, arid 34) showed nc distinction as univariat c indices cc the four tests but they were, neverthelesst alsc retain~d for the multivariat2 analysis since they cculd, uh~n ~r~alyzed in conjurction with other variakles, still ~rcvide irfcrmatioc for genre distinction.

18 fiction genres are more alike in syntactic structure than any cf them are like s~nt~nces from ficticn.
This may, at first view, be surprising in light of the range o-f nonficticn genres included In the study, but it bears out the findings of at least cna cther investigatic~ cf quantitative characteristics of the language of different genres (Parckworth and 5~11, 1967, on sentence-length distributicns): that the major rneasurabl'e stylistic distlnctlcr is between fictian and no-n-ficticn gmres, 3~veial interesting cbservations may ke made about the syntactic variables that participate in the discrimination (ses Table 4).
The mcst obvious pclnt Is the heavy lnvclvem.~r.t cf syntactic featutes of the verbal u~it ir, differ~ntiatlny fiction frcm non-fiction styles.

B seccnd not able feature diszicguishing the fiction sentence set is the amount of indicaticn of past time action.
This is ccnveyed nct cnly by the fcrmal past -tense variatle, uhich in rhe great majority of cases does indicate e past time acrion, but also by the perfective aspect, which L alwaysindicates a Fast time event whether marlied for past cr resent tense.
This feature is perhaps understandable in view cf the usual function of fiction as a rarrarive of past €vents, and it stlould alsc be noted that this saw functio~ may utilize another role of perfective psp~ct--that of hterrelating s~qusntial Events thrcuqh ti,mc, k questioo may b~ raised about the relatienship of two of the ficticn-distinguishing variables: the presence of intransitiv~ varbs and the absezce of passiw ccnstructions.

Cne possible explanation, which suggests a sirnpl~ characterizatic~ of fiction style, cculd be based on analyzing a large subset (if not the whole class) of verbs usually callfa intransii~zg 2s items which can occur both wlth nc ohjact (traditionally called intransitivs verbs) and with cns cr two objects (traditionalfy called tracsitives).
in such &n analysis it is presuv~d that when the gramm+tlcal object of a verb of thls class is either redun c6nt or riot c~rr~lct~l y speclfi~d it is SUF~~?SSE~ and.
John the result is a one-place,predicate s~ntcnce, e.
g., sang.
When the grammatical object carries new or requirea --informatior, it is ~resent and the result is a multiple-place Greek fclksong.
This sart of predicate, e.g., Jchn sang a -analysis cf the I~intran~itivs~~ verb o.pens the door to a vsry general characterization of genre differences.
I hus viewed, the -----------ictransitivs ---verb variable characteriz~s sentences which are nct heavily in£ crmatlcc crienred--sentences in which a major coinponent, th~ gr=zmn:atFcal cb ject, is elther so predictable cr sc ucim~ortant thirt it is nct iver.
spscified. such s~nt~ncss are signific.zntly more charect~rlst~ic of flction than cf ncn-f icticn wxiting, and this analysis of xh~m suggesrs a rneasurakl~ hasis for the cld rule of thumb t that succzssful (although nct necessarilj good) Action wiixirg is strcngly ection oriented, It alsc suggests the validity cf the ccmmon-sense iatuft3or.
tha~ a primary source of the diff~r~nc~s betwcez ~iction end non-fiction is that the latter is designed fcremost as an information-cox-v~ying instrument; that in the dichctdmy cf litera ry purp~.se it is mere likely tc* teach khan to delight, Since orie of tke major ways in which infcrmation can be packed into a sentence is through heary use of nominal ~lements, we locked at a simple measure of this characterization cf fiction style as actior.-oriented as c~pcssd tc non-fiction style as informaticn-or~en~ed: the verb/pcun ratic fcr each genre, These ratios are Fiction Learned Jcurnalr N€ws~ap€Z ~e~crtage Fopular Journals Governm~nt Documents tearing cut the su~position that sentcncea in the nonficticn genres have ncre ncuns in proporti.cn to verbs than do those frcm fiction.

The f ivp-cjroup discriminant function analysis showed such a ma jcr distinction b'etnleh fiction ard the non-fiction genres that it seemed possible that differences in tho nonficti.cn genres mlght have been obscured, In ccnsequerice, a fourdgrou~ discrinicant function analysis ues dcn~ on data from these gecr es crly, The result indicated a disticcti~~ in syrtactic stiucturf between the forma-1 genres (Learned Journals ar? d Goverr,n;ent Docurn~nts) a~d the ir,f ormal (Neus,y.aFEr 'Ie~ortage and Popular Journals) alcng the first axis, and alcr,g th~ s~cor.d axis a distinction betweex Eopular Jcurnals and News~apzr Reportage, The third dimsnslon distinguished Lsazned Journals from Governmefit Locumfnts (see ~igur~ 2).

lCIIIIIIIII adver tial -clauses, are atypical of informal ocn-f ictioh ic the informal/formal discrl~inaticn; the other three are ipvclvra ic 28 distinguishing Learh~d ~ournals frcm Golfernuent Documents-romina3izaticns f& ncun ph~asg and ~gyioin~d vords and -.I-------yhrar~s ---by their prfs~nc~ in Learned JcGrnals and --noun adjuncts by its absence.
(The activity of noun adiuncts as --discriminatory by its ats~nce in both of thf informal genres and in L~arned Journals indicates its heavy use in Gcverriment Dccumeihts: "1, John Chaffee, Gcvernor of Rhode Island..
. . ") A11 five of these stractures ax€ sigcificantly chracteristic of cne cr both cf the fcrmal.
non-fiction genres, aad all five are frcm the category cf conjoined or embedded syntactic elements--that is, syntactic structures '~h.o$e ~rimary p UrFose *is to com'press and relate informatior! withiri he sentence.
Seemingly, those gEFres in which the author's intent is tc convey max2mum information usah uaximun exrlicitn6ss are just those tha& make m6ximum use of such syntactic tech~iques.
(We may note in psssing thi,tr except for --------adverbial -----clauses and for -conjcined --wotds -and p_hyases, which may invclve either noucs or verbs, the signi-ficart element-s are members of the ccun ph-rase; it appears that cnly at rhis level of genre cis~r~iminaticn is anything kut a verkal or whole-sentence clement a significant stylist~c indicator.
) khat seems tc te evident from the above results is: that, while there are indeed significantly dif £€rent ~atte~ns syntactic cccutrfnc~ batween genres, these patterns (uith the ExceFtlcn of editorially deterrni~cd use od gassive ccn~tr uction~ in ~~arned Journal styleand avoidance of ----.I------cc~ntrectfd p_e_rb_a_l fz_ms in any formal -I------style) result primarily from general s~mantic constraints cperzting within the Genres and based in tke com-municative FurFoses of ths genres.
Tc wit, ficticn, nc matter what its topic, is typically a narraticrl cE Fast but,int~rccr,nected actions, and the syntactic structures that differentiate f:ction from rcn-ticticr are ones uhich ccnvey this semantic ccntcnt; non-fictiar, agiin nc matter what it is sbcut, 1s in gsneral a data-ccnveying ~nstrumsrit, even tkoush tkiere are detectable difffrthces in the manner ic uhlch the data are cc~vc yed, g, dsgrce of specificity cf data (Learned Jcurqals), degree cf Gidacticism (Popular Journals), and degree of .ir.cluded narrbticn (Newspaper Fqcrtage) . Again, tnesz bread semantic simi1arit.ies and diffexnces are refl~ct~d in the sy~tac-cic S~IUC~UI~S that differentiate the gmre s t-y le s.
In summary, quzntitativ~ diffexnces in sy~tact ic S~T-UC~UT~C car, indeed be f cun2 between indep~r,d~qtly-3.~fir.sd sub-populations of lenguage (genres), but they aEI;ear tc ccc?r:sscnd t~c-~and arr presumably the 30 result of--generic con,rnunicative purposes cf the genres, and shoulu ccr ssquently be vieurd as 1nte;r.s.lly-constrainad artefacts cf this sernzntic component rather thac ~xternallydefin-cii elements cf stylo.
