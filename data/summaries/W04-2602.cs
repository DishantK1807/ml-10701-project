Fortunately, using distributional characteristics of term contexts, it is feasible to induce part-of-speech categories directly from a corpus of suf cient size, as several papers have made clear (Brown et al., 1992; Schcurrency1utze, 1993; Clark, 2000).

Clark (2000) reports results on a corpus containing 12 million terms, Schcurrency1utze (1993) on one containing 25 million terms, and Brown, et al, (1992) on one containing 365 million terms.

There are many applications of computational linguistics, particularly those involving shallow processing, such as information extraction, which can bene t from such automatically derived information, especially as research into acquisition of grammar matures (e.g., (Clark, 2001)).

For example, it is possible to augment a xed syntactic or semantic taxonomy with such information to good effect (Hearst and Schcurrency1utze, 1993).

While the literature suggests that Baum-Welch training can degrade performance on the tagging task (Elworthy, 1994; Merialdo, 1994), we have found in early experiments that agreement between a tagger trained in this way and the tagger from the XTag Project consistently increases with each iteration of Baum-Welch, eventually reaching a plateau, but not decreasing.

It has been known for some years that good performance can be realized with partial tagging and a hidden Markov model (Cutting et al., 1992).

Our approach to inducing syntactic clusters is closely related to that described in Brown, et al, (1992) which is one of the earliest papers on the subject.

Clark (2000) presents a framework which in principle should accommodate lexical ambiguity using mixtures, but includes no evidence that it does so.
