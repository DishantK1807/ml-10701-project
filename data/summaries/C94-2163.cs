Finally, this speeilication of OT in te,ms of reguhu' sets Zllld \[inite-state iltltonlata opens the way for more rigorous exploration of the differences between OT and declarative phonological theories, such ;.is One-Level Phonology (Bird and l illison 1994), which is a constraint-based phonology that defines inviolable constraints with automata.

Bird and Eltison ( 1992,1994) have shown that it is possible to capture the semantics of autosegmental rules and representations using FSAs.

It difli~rs from declarative phonology (Bird 1994, Scobbie 199 I, Bird and l'31ison 1994) in that its constraints arc vio-lable and can conllict, with the contlicts resolved by an * This research was funded Ily the U.K.
