A Statistical Approach to the Processing of Metonymy Masao Utiyama, Masaki Murata, and Hitoshi Isahara Communications Research L~boratory, MPT, 588-2, Iwaoka, Nishi-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2492 Japal {mutiyam~,murat~,isahara} ~crl.go.j p Abstract This paper describes a statistical approach to tile interpretation of metonymy.
A metonymy is received as an input, then its possible interp retations are ranked by al)t)lying ~ statistical measure.
The method has been tested experimentally.
It; correctly interpreted 53 out of 75 metonymies in Jat)anese.
1 Introduction
Metonymy is a figure of st)eech in which tile name of one thing is substituted for that of something to which it is related.
The czplicit tc.~m is 'the name of one thing' and the implicit t;c~"m is 'the name of something to which it; is related'.
A typical examt)le of m(;tonymy is He read Shal(esl)eare.
(1) 'Slmkesl)(~are' is substitut(~d for 'the works of Shakespeare'.
'Shakest)eare' is the explicit term and 'works' is the implicit term.
Metonymy is pervasive in natural language.
The correc~ treatment of lnetonylny is vital tbr natural language l)rocessing api)lications, es1)ecially for machine translation (Kamei and Wakao, 19!)2; Fass, 1997).
A metonymy may be aecel)table in a source language but unaccet)table in a target language.
For example, a direct translation of 'he read Mao', which is acceptable in English an(1 Japanese, is comt)letely unacceptal)le in Chinese (Kamei and Wakao, 1992).
In such cases, the machine trmlslation system has to interl)ret metonynfies to generate acceptable translations.
Previous approaches to processing lnetonymy have used hand-constructed ontologies or semantic networks (.\]?ass, 1988; Iverson and Hehnreich, 1992; B(maud et al., 1996; Fass, 1997).
1 1As for metal)her l)rocessing, I,'errari (1996) used t;exSuch al)t)roaches are restricted by the knowledge bases they use, and may only be applicable to domain-specific tasks because the construction of large knowledge bases could be very dif ficult.
The method outlined in this I)apcr, on the other hand, uses cortms statistics to interpret metonymy, so that ~ variety of metonynfies can be handled without using hand-constructed knowledge bases.
The method is quite t)romising as shown by the exl)erimental results given in section 5.
2 Recognition
and Interpretation Two main steps, recognition and i'ntc.'q~vcration, are involved in the processing of metonyn~y (Fass, 1.!)97).
in tile recognition st;el), metonylnic exl)ressions are labeled.
1111 the intel'l)r(:tation st;el), the meanings of those ext)ressions me int, eri)reted.
Sentence (1), for examl)le, is first recognized as a metonymy an(t ~Shakespeare' is identified as the explicit term.
't'he interpretation 'works' is selected as an implicit term and 'Shakespeare' is replaced 1)y 'the works of Shakespeare'.
A conq)rehensive survey by Fass (\]997) shows that the most COllllllOll metho(1 of recognizing metonymies is by selection-restriction violations.
Whether or not statistical approaches can recognize metonymy as well as the selectionrestriction violation method is an interesting question.
Our concern here, however, is the interpretation of metonymy, so we leave that question for a future work.
In interpretation, an implicit term (or terms) that is (are) related to the explicit term is (are) selected.
The method described in this paper uses corpus st~tistics for interpretation.
tual clues obtained through corl)us mmlysis tor detecting metal)lmrs.
885 This method, as applied to Japanese metonymies, receives a metonymy in a phrase of the tbnn 'Noun A Case-Marker R Predicate V' and returns a list of nouns ranked in order of the system's estimate of their suitability as interpretations of the metonylny, aSSulning that noun A is the explicit tenn.
For example, given For'a a wo (accusative-case) kau (buy) (buy a Ford), Vay.sya (ear), V .st .sdl, r'uma (vehicle), etc.
are returned, in that order.
Tile method fbllows tile procedure outlined below to interpret a inetonymy.
1. Given a metonymy in the form 'Noun A Case-Marker R Predicate V', nouns that can 1)e syntactically related to the explicit term A are extracted from a corpus.
2. The extracted nouns are rmlked according to their appropriateness as interpretations of the metonymy by applying a statistical measure.
The first step is discussed in section 3 and the second in section 4.
3 Information
Source \¥e use a large corpus to extract nouns which can be syntactically related to the exl)licit term of a metonylny.
A large corpus is vahmble as a source of such nouns (Church and Hanks, 1990; Brown et al., 1992).
We used Japanese noun phrases of the fornl A no B to extract nouns that were syntactically related to A.
Nouns in such a syntactic relation are usually close semantic relatives of each other (Murata et al., 1999), and occur relatively infrequently.
We thus also used an A near B relation, i.e. identifying tile other nouns within the target sentence, to extract nouns that may be more loosely related to A, trot occur more frequently.
These two types of syntactic relation are treated differently by the statistical nleasure which we will discuss in section 4.
The Japanese noun phrase A no B roughly corresponds to the English noun phrase B of A, lint it has a nmch broader range of usage (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999).
In fact, d no B can express most of the possible types of semmltic relation between two nouns including metonymic 2~Ford' is spelled qtSdo' ill Japanese.
We have used English when we spell Japanese loan-words from English for the sake of readability.
concepts such as that the name of a container can represent its contents and the name of an artist can imply an art~brnl (container for contents and artist for artform below).a Examples of these and similar types of metonymic concepts (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980; Fass, 1997) are given below.
Container for contents • glass no mizu (water) • naV (pot), y6 i (food) Artist for artform • Beethoven no kyoku (music) • Picas.so no e (painting) Object for user • ham .sandwich no kyaku (customer) • sax no .sO.sya (t)erformer) Whole tbr part • kuruma (car) no tirc • door" no knob These exalnt)les suggest that we can extract semantically related nouns by using tile A no B relation.
4 Statistical
Measure A nletonymy 'Noun A Case-Marker R, Predicate V' can be regarded as a contraction of 'Noun A Syntactic-Relation (2 Noun B CaseMarker R Predicate V', where A has relation Q to B (Yamamoto et al., 1998).
For example, Shakc.spcare wo yomu (read) (read Shakespeare) is regarded as a contraction of Shakespeare no .sakuhin (works) 'wo yomu (read the works of Shakespeare), where A=Shake.spcare, Q=no, B=.sakuhin, R=wo, and V=yomu.
Given a metonymy in the fbrln A R 17, the appropriateness of noun B as an interpretation of the metonymy under the syntactic relation Q is defined by LQ(BIA,/~, V) Pr(BIA, (2, 1~, V), (2) ayamamoto et al.(\]998) also used A no /3 relation to interpret metonymy.
886 where Pr(.-).
represents l)robal/ility and Q is either an A no B relation or an A near \]3 relation.
Next;, the appropriateness of noun \]3 is defined by M(BIA, Ie, V) -nlaxLc~(BIA, l~,V ).
(3) O We rank nouns 1)y at)plying the measure 214.
Equation (2) can be decomposed as follows: LQ(!31A, R,, V) = Pr(BIA, Q, R,, V) Pr(A, Q, B, R,, V) Pr( A, Q, R, v) Pr(A, Q, 13)lh'(R, VIA, Q, Ix) Pr(A, Q) Pr(R, VIA, Q) Pr(BIA, Q)Pr(R, VIB) -~ er(R, v) ' (4) where (A, O) and {\]~,, V} are assumed to l)e indel)endent of each other.
Let f(event)1)e the frequen(:y of an cve'nt and Classc.s(\])) be the set of semantic (:lasses to which B belongs.
'l'he expressions in Equation (4) are then detined t)y 4 I'r(~lA, Q) .t'(A, Q, ~x) _ f(A, Q, ~) f(A, Q) ~1~ f(A, Q, 13)' (5) Pr(~., riB) IU~,I~,v) i' ' *: .1 (U, ~, V) > 0, .~~,c~cl ..........

We h~wc adopted this detinition for the sake of simplicity.
This simplification has little effect on the tilml results because ~--;c'cc~ ........
(m Pr(l~lC)f(C,I~', V) << I will usually hohl.
More Sol)histieated methods (M;mning ml(t Schiitze, 1999) of smoothing f)robability distribution m~y I)e I)eneticial.
itowever, al)l)lying such methods and comparing their effects on the interpretation of metonymy is beyond the scope of this l)aper.
This treatment does not alter the order of the nouns ranked by the syst;em because l?r(H., V) is a constant for a given metonymy of the form AR V.
Equations (5) and (6) difl'er in their treatment of zero frequency nouns.
In Equation (5), a noun B such that f(A, Q, B) = 0 will l)e ignored (assigned a zero probal)ility) because it is unlikely that such a noml will have a close relationshii / with noun A.
In Equation (6), on the other hand, a noun B such that f(B, R, V) = 0 is assigned a non-zero probability.
These treatments reflect the asymmetrical proper~y of inetonymy, i.e. ill a nletonylny of the form A 1 1~ an implicit term 13 will have a much tighter relationship with the explicit term A than with the predicate V.
Consequently, a nouil \]3 such that f(A,Q, B) >> 0 A f(B, JR, V) = 0 may be appropri~te as an interpretation of the metonymy.
Therefore, a non-zero t)robat)ility should be assign(;d to Pr(l~., VI1X ) ev~,n it' I(B, 2e, V) ; ().
~ Equation (7) is the probability that noun J3 occurs as a member of (::lass C.
This is reduced to fU~) if13 is not ambiguous, i.e.
IC/a,~,sc.,s,(/3)\[ = f(c) 1.
If it is ambiguous, then f(B) is distributed equally to all classes in Classes(B).
The frequency of class C is ol)tained similarly: .f(B) (8) .f(c) = ~ ICl(-~c..~(13)1' 11C-.(7 where 13 is a noun which belongs to the class C.
Finally we derive f(13, ~, v) BqC (.0) In summary, we use the measure M as defined in Equation (3), and cah:ulated by applying Equation (4) to Equation (9), to rank nouns according to their apl)ropriateness as possible interpretations of a metonymy.
Example Given the statistics below, bottle we akeru (open) (open a bottle) will be interpreted 5The use of Equation (6) takes into account a noun/3 such that J'(l:~, l, V) = 0.
But, Stlch & llOtlll is usually ignored if there is another noun B' such that f(13', H., V) > 0 be~,~,,se.
Eo'~ct .......
U~)P, USIO)J'(C,~e.,V) << a < J'(lY, H,, V) will usually hokl.
This means thai the cooccurrence 1)rol)al)iliW between implicit terms and verbs are also important in eliminating inapl)rol)riate nomls.
887 as described in the fbllowing t)aragraphs, assuming that cap and rcizSko (refl'igerator) are the candidate implicit terms.
Statistics: f(bottlc, no, cap) = 1, f(bottlc, no, reizgko) = O, f(bottlc, no) = 2, f ( bottlc, ncar, cap) = 1, f (bottle, near, rciz6ko) = 2, f(bottlc, ncar) = 503, f(cap) = 478, f(rcizSko) = 1521, f(cap, wo, akcru) = 8, and f(rciz6ko, wo, akcru) = 23.
f(bottlc, no, rciz6ko) = 0 indicates that bottle and rcizSko are not close semantic relatives of each other.
This shows the effectiveness of using A no B relation to filter out loosely related words.
Measure: L,o(cap) Lncar(Cap) = Lno(reizSko) = Lncar ( reizS ko ) -~ f ( bott:le, no, cap) .f ( bottlc, no) \](ca,p, wo, a\]~c'ru) X 1 8 -8.37×10 -3, 2 478 f (bottle, near, cap) f(bottlc, near) f ( caI), "wo, a\]~cru) X .f ( ) 1 8 50--3 47-8 = 3.33 × 10 -5, .f ( bottlc, no, rcizSko ) .f ( bottlc, no) f ( rcizako, wo, ahcru ) × .f ( rcizdko 0 23 2 1521 .f ( bottlc, near, rcizSko) f (bottlc, near) f(rcizSko, wo, akcru) X f ( rciz~ko ) 2 23 503 1521 6.01 x 1() -~, M(c p) = maxLno(cap),Lnea.,.(cap)} = 8.37 x lO-3, and ~r ( reizSko ) = 6.01× 10 -5, where L,,o(Cap) = L,~o(Caplbo~tle, wo, akeru), M(c p) = M(c pl ot tz, and so o51.
Since M > M we conclude that cap is a more appropriate imt)licit term than rcizSho.
This conclusion agrees with our intuition.
5 Experiment
5.1 Material Metonymies Seventy-five lnetonymies were used in an ext)erilnent to test tile prol)osed lnethod.
Sixty-two of them were collected from literature oll cognitive linguistics (Yamanashi, 1988; Yamam~shi, 1995) and psycholinguistics (Kusumi, 1995) in Japanese, paying attention so that the types of metonymy were sufficiently diverse.
The remaining 13 metonymies were direct translations of the English metonymies listed in (Kalnei and Wakao, 1992).
These 13 metonylnies are shown in Table 2, along with the results of the experiment.
Corpus A corpus which consists of seven years of issues of the Mainichi Newspaper (Dora 1991 to 1997) was used in the experiment.
The sentences in tlle cortms were mort)hologically analyzed by ChaSen version 2.0b6 (Matsumoto et al., 1999).
The corpus consists of about 153 million words.
Semantic Class A Japanese thesaurus, Bunrui Goi-tty6 (The N~tional Language Research Institute, 1996), was used in the experiment.
It has a six-layered hierarchy of abstractions and contains more than 55,000 nouns.
A class was defined as a set of nouns which are classified in the same abstractions in the top three layers.
The total nmnber of classes thus obtained was 43.
If a noun was not listed in the thesaurus, it was regarded as being in a class of its own.

However, it is not concerned with the semantic relation between an explicit; term and implicit term, because such semantic relations are not directly expressed ill corpora, i.e. noun phrases of the form A no B can be found in corpora bul; their senmntic relations are not.
If we need such semantic relations, we must semantically analyze the noun phrases (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999).
Applicability to other languages Japanese noun phrases of the form A no B are specitie to Japanese.
The proposed method, however, could easily be extended to other languages.
For exmnple, in English, noun phrases B of d could be used to extract semantically related nouns.
Nouns related by is-a relations or part-of relations could also be extracted from corpora (Hearst, 1992; Berland and Charniak, 1999).
If such semantically related nouns are extracted, then they can be ranked according to the measure M defined in Equation (3).
Lexically based approaches Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1995) proposed the qualia structure which encodes semantic relations among words explicitly.
It is useflfl to infer an implicit term of the explicit term in a metonymy.
The proposed approach, on the other hand, uses corpora to infer implicit terms and thus sidesteps the construction of qualia structure.
8 7 Conclusion This paper discussed a statistical approach to the interpretation of metonymy.
The method tbllows the procedure described below to interpret a metonymy in Japanese: 1.
Given a metonymy of the tbrm 'Noun A SBriscoe et al.(1990) discusses the use o1" machinereadable dictionaries and corpora for acquMng lexical semantic information.
890 Case-Marker 1 Predicate V', nouns that are syntactically related to the explicit terlll A are extracted front a corpus.
'.2. The extracted nouns are ranked according to their degree of appropriateness as interpretations of the metonymy by applying a statistical measure.
The method has been tested experimentally.
Fifty-three out of seventy-five metonymies were correctly interpreted.
This is quite a prolnising first; step towm'd the statistical processing of metonymy.
