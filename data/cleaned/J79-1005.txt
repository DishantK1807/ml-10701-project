PATTERN-HATCHING RULES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE DIACOGUE EXPRESSIONS Kenneth Mark Colby Roger C.
Park i son Bill Faught I NTRODUCT I ON To recognize something is to identify it as an instance of the "same aga i n". This familiarity is possible because of recurrcr~i charactorjstics of the uorld uhich repeat themselves.
Me shall describe an algorithm which recognizes recurrent characteristics of natural language dialogue expressions.
It utilizes a multi-stage sequence of pattern-matching rules for progt-essively transforming an input expression until it eventually matches an abstract stored pattern.
The stored pattern has a pointer to a resmse function in memory uhich decides what t~ do once the input has been recognized.
Here ue discuss only th~: recognizing functions, except for ono restionse function (anaphoric substitution) uhich interactively aids the recognition process.
Details of hau the response functions operate will be described in a future commun i cat i on.
We are constructing and testing a simulation of paranoid though processes; our problem is to reproduce paranoid linguistic behavior in a teletyped diagnostic psychiatric interview.
The diagnosis of paranoid states, reactions or modes is made by clinicians who judge the degree of correspondence betueen uhat they observe in an intervieu and theirconcep tua I mode I of parano i d behav i or.
There exists a high degree of agreement among psychiatrists about this conceptual model which relies mainly on what an intervieuee says and how he says it.
6 Natural
language is a life-expressing code uhich people use for comnli~nication with theniselves and others, In a real-life dialogue such ;Is a psychiatric interview, the participants have interests, intentiohs, and expectations uhich are revealed lAn their linguistic express ions.
An interactive s~rnulatlon ot a paranoid patient must IIC able to demonstrate typical parahoid linguisti~ behavior.
To achieve this effect, our paranoid model must have the ability to deal uith the te lc typed messages of an i.ntorvieuer.
A number of approaches have been taken for dealing with natupal language dialogue expressions.
(Winograd,l972; Woods, 1970).
These approaches rely on parsers which conduct a detailed syntactic and semantic analysis.
They perform well for the purposes for uhich they uern designed.
Their w'eakness, for dUr purposes, 1 ies in their lack of neglectirrrj and ignoring mcchariisms.
Such mechanisms arc necessary in a progrnsl which accepts and responds to unrestricted conversational English characterized by ex~ressions novel to the p~ograrn.
tlou humans process natural language is largely unknoun.
They possess some knouledge of gran~matical rules, but this fact does not entai r that they use a grammar in interpreting and producing language.
It seenis implausible to us that people possess full transformational grammars far process i ng l anguage.
Language i uhat is recognized but the processes' involved may not be linguistic or grammatical.
Originally transformational grammars were not designed to 'understand" a large subset of English; they constituted a formal method for deciding uhether a string is grammatical.
An analysis of uhat one's problem actua1I.y is should guide the selection or invention of methods appropriate to its solution.
Our problt-IN is not to develop a consi stcnt and gencral theory of language nor to asoer t empi r i cc I I y testable hypotheses about hou peop l a process l mguago.
Our proulcm is to design an algorithm which recognizes what is being saicl in a dialogue and uhat is being said about it in order to makc a response such that a sample of 1-0 pairs from the paranoid model is judgcd smilar to a sample of I-0 pairs from paranoid patients.
Tlic design task belongs to artificial intelligence inuhich thacriterion is hgw adequate l l~ the coniputer program per forms hindI i ke funct ions.
Neir methatis had to be devised for an algorithm to participate in a hun~;ln dialogue in a paranoid-patient-11ke uay.
We sought effective n~ethods uhich could operate ef ficierrtly I~I real time.
Since our method provides a genera 1 uay of many-to-qne mapping from surface express; on3 to a sing I c stored pattern, it is mot limited to the simulation of paranoia, bui can be used by any type of "host" system uhich takes natural language as irlput.
Our method is to transform the input until a pattern is obtained which matches compIeteIy or partial Iy a more abstract storc~i pattekn.
This strategy has proved adequate for o9r purposes a satisfactory percentane of the time.
The pouer of this tnefhod for natural language dialogues lies in its ability to ignore as 1rq.eIsyant some of what it recognizes and everything it does not recognize" at all.

Whcn it firids such a contentive along with "you" 9r ".your" in the expreseiori, regardless of uord orclor, it reeponds to toe expression as if it werc! a question about the nature of one's work.
This method correctly claspifics the five sentences above.

Hmce in PARRY2, as ui I I be described..
short Iy, a1 I the patterns require a specified word order.
For hiah-complexity problems it is helpful to have constrainra.
Diagnostic psychiatric intervieus (and especial It_i tho:,t-! concluctecl over teletgpes) have several natural constraints.
First, cli~icians are trained to ask certain questions in certain uays.
Thi !, I i mi tu tho number of pat terns required to rehognize ut teranccs about eacll topic..
Second, on.ly a teu hundred standard topics are brought up 114 interviewers who are, furthermore, rrained to use everyday express ions arlrl especiolld those used by the pa)ien,t himself.
When the interview is conducted by te 1 etypes, expressions tend to be shortened s i nee the intcrvicucr trice to Incrcaoa tho information transqission rote ovc!r the slow chorrnel of a teletype.

AIeo utterances are loaded rti th idioms, cl iches, pat phraaoo, etc.
all being easlJ preu for a pattern-matching approach.
Lt is time-uasting and usually futile to try to decode an idiom by analyzing the meanings, of it8 individual uords.
We now describe the pattern-matching functions of the algorithm in some detail.

It functions independently of the RESPOKD module except in tho case of pronoun references, which tm RESPOND modu I e provides.to the RECOGNIZER on requeet.
The recognitiongmodule has 4 main steps: 19 Identify the uords in the question and convert them to internal synonyms.
2) Break the input into segments at certain bracketing words.
3) Hatch each segment ( independent l y) to' a st'ored pat tern.
4) flatch the resulting list of recognized segments to a stoced complex pattern.

The dictionary, which was built empirically froni ttipusancjc.
of telet~ped jntervieus yith previous versions of the nod el, consists of uo.rds. groups of uordo, and hames of word-classeo they can be trans1 atacl into.
Entries in the dictionary reflect PARRY2's main interests.
If a ward in tho Ynllut is not in the dictionary, it is checked to see if it ends with one of the common suffixes given in Fig.
2. If it does, the suffix is removed and the remaining word is looked up again.
If it is still not in the dictronary, it is dropped from the pattern being formed.
Thus if the input is: WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT OCCUPATION? and the word "current" is not in the dictionary, the pattern at this otagc becomes: ( WHAT IS YOUR OCCUPATION The quest i on-mark i o thrown away as redundanat si nco quost ions ar-c recognized by uord order.
(A statement fol rowad by a question mark (YOU GAMBLE)? is responded to in the same hay as that statement folloued by a period.
Synonymic translations of uords are made so that the aattern becomes, for examp i e: ( WHAT BE YOU JOB I Some groups of uords e.
idioms) are translated as a group SO that, for example, "for a 1 ivirig" becomes "for job".
Certai,.
other iuxtaposed words are contracted into a single yo~d, e.g.
"place ~f birth" becomes "birthplace".
This is done to dea.1 4th groups of uords which.
arc representeu as a single element in the stored pattern, th-ereby pr,evcnting segmentation from occurring at the urong places, such as at a prepositionjinside an idiom or pnrase.
Besides these contractions, certain expansions are made so that for exampl'e, "DON'T" becomes "DO NOT" and "I 'DV -ornos "I WOULD".

2. The suffixes are on the left and the uords uhich replace then1 are on the riEfht.
Host suffixes are simply removed and not replaced.
Misspellings can be the bane of teletyped intcrviebs for an algorithn~.
Here they are handled in tuo uays.
First, common misspellings of imp~rtant uords are simply pot in the dictionaru.
Thus 'yuu" ie knoun to mean "you".
The apostrophe is often uai rrea fro111 contractions so most contractions are recognized uith or without it.
The!,e combon misspellings uere gathered from over 6808 intervieus uith earIic:lversions of the paranoid model.
(The moddl (PhRRYI is available for' intervieuing on the ARPA network).
Second, five common forms of typing error arc checkcndsysten~aticall~~.
These are4 1) nouhlad letter 2) Ex tranegus l e t,ter 3d Forr~ctting to hold the "shift kcy" for an apostrophe 4) Hitting a nearhy key on the keyboard 5) Transposing two letters in a uord The first three errors can be corrected by delct irlg the of fendi ~rg cKaracter from the uord.

Substitutions are also made in certain cases, Some segments contain pronouns uhich could stand for a number of different things of importance to PARRY2.
As we montioncd in the introductioh, the response functioris of memory keep trae~ of the contoxt in order to givo pronouns and other anaphoras a correct interpretat~on.
For example, the segment: ( DO YOU AVOID THEM 1 could refer to the Mafia, Or racetracks, or other patients, depending an the context.
When such a eegmen4 is encountered, the pronoun is replaced by I rs current anaphoric value as determined by the response functions, and a more specific segment wh as: t OD YOU AVdID MAFIA I i a looked u~.
Otheru-t terances.
sucn as 'Why did you do that"? or just "Why"?
(uhich might be regarded as a Inas8ive ellips~s), clearly refer back ta prcv i ous ut torrlnccs.
These ut terances match very genera I pat terns wh i cl~ identify the type of question uilthout indicating the exact topic.
Thc response function which responds to "Why"? conaults the context to produce an appr apr i ate qnsucr . The algorithm next attempts ttq match the segments uith stored simple patterns which currently number abut 1780.
(The single patterns appcar in Appendix 31.
First a complete and perfect match is sought.
When n match is found, the stored pattern name has a pointer to the name of a response function in memory which decides what to do further.
If a match is not fourid, further transformations of tv segment are carried out and "fuzzy" matrch is tried.
For fuzzy matchi'ng at this stage, we adopted the heuristic rule of dropping elements in the segment one at a time and attempting a match each t imo.
This heuristic allows ignoring famIIiar uords in unfamiliar contexts.
For example, 'uelln is important in "Are you well"? but meaninglt+ss in "Well are god?".
Qclcting one elemcnt at a time results in, for example, thc pat tern: ( WHAT BE YOU MAIN PROBLEM 1 (a) I EE YOU MAIN PROBLEM 1 Ib) ( WliAT YOU MAIN PROBLEM 1 (cl ( WHAT BE MAIN PROBLEM 1 (dl ( WHAT BE YOU PROBLEM 1 [el ( WHAT BE YOU RAIN 1 Since the stored pattern in this case matches (dl, (el would not bc con8 truc ted.
We found It unuise to deleto more than one element since our segmentation method usuallu yields segments containing a small numbcr(1-41 of words.
Dropping an element at a time provides a probabi l i tg threshold for fuzzy matching uhich is a function of the length of the segnlerit.
If a segment consists of five elenients, four of the five must IJ~ prascnt in a particular order (uith the fifth element missing in an9 position) for a match to occur.
If a segment contains four elements, three must match and so forth.
COMPLEX-PATTERN MATCH When more than one simple pattern is detected in the input, a scconci matching is attempted against about 508 complex patterns.
Certain patterns, such as4 ( HELLO 1 and ( I THINK 1, are dropped because they are considered meaningless.
If a complete match is not found, then simple patterns are dropped, one at a time, from the complex pattern.
This allows tho input, (( HOW 00 YOU CONE 1 ( TO BE 1 ( IN HOSPITAL 1) to match the stored oattern, (I tIOW DO YOU COME 1 ( IN HOSPITAL 1).
If no match can be found at this point, the algorithm has arrivcd at a default concji tion and the appropriate response functions decide what to do.
For example, in a default condition, the model may assume control of the interview, asking the interviewer a question, continuing wi ththo topic under discussion or introducing a neu topic.
An annotated example of a diagnostic psychiatric intervieu is presented in Appendix 1.
ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS As mcnt ioned, one of the main advantages of a pattern-matching strategy is that it can ignore as irrelevant both some of uhat it recognizes and uhat it does not recognize at all, There are severo l n i I I i on uords in Eng I i sh, each possessing f~om one to oQer a hundred senses.
To construct a machine-usable word dictionary of this.
magnitude is out of the question at this time.
Recognition of natural language input in the manner described above allaus real-time interactOon in a dialogue since it avoids becoming ensnarledin combinatorial 20 disambiguations and long chains of inferencing which uould SIQH a dialogue algorithm down to impracticaIity, if it could even function at all.
The price paid for pattern-matching is that sometimes, but rarely, ambigui ties sl ip through.
Another advantage of this method is its speed.
The algorithm cqnsists of about 28K of programs uritten in flLISP, 16K of data in LISP, and 36K of data in machine language with several overlays.
The cotnpIt:It? l anguoyc rccoyni t Ion Process requires less than ono ~econd of real t i ~ic nn a t'inie-shared DEC POP-10.
A drawback to PARRY1 is that it reacts to the first pattern i1 finds in the input rather than characterizing the input as fully as possiblc and then deciding uhat to do based on a number of tests.
Another practical di'fficulty uith PARRY1 from a programmer's vieupoint, is that, since it is a procedural model, element9 of the patterns ar0 strung out in various procedures throughout the algorithm.
It is often a considerable chore for the programmer to determine whether a given pat tern i s preseht and preci eel y uhere i t i s.
In PARRY2 the pat terns arc a I I col I ec ted in one part of the data-base where they can easi I y I~C examined.
Concentrating all the patterns in the data base giv=s PARRY2 a l imi ted "learning" ability.
When an input fails to match any storccl pat tern or matches an incorrect one, as judged by a human operator, a pattern uhich matches the input can be put into the data-base autamatically.
If the nu pattern has the same meaning as a previousI!j stored pattern, the human operator must'provid~ the name of the appropriate response function.
If he doksn't remember the name, he may try to rephrase the in~ut in a form recognizable to PARRY2 and it ui I I name Lhe raspofiso f unct ion associated ui th the rophraei ng.
These mechan i sms arc! 21 not "Iearnina" in the commonly-used sense but they do aI IOU e person to transfcr hio knouledgo into PARRVZ's data-base uith very little effort.
I nforrnal observa t i on thus far shous PARRY2' s linguistic recognition abilities to be quite superior to PARRYl's.
A mol-e systematic and quantitative ov-ahation of performance is now being carried out.
PAHRY1 uas extensively tested by having judges Make ratings ot its per forrnance a long S~VCI-~ l dimensions, one ot uhich was I i ngui st i c noncomprehenGi on (Col by and Hi l f, 19741.
These judges a l so made rn t i ng6 of teletyped interviews uith psychiatric patients and uith a random versiors of PARRY1.
The mean ratings of PARRYI along the dimension of linguistic noncomprehens i on were better than those receivedby RANDOM-PARRY but uere 'three timesworse than the heah tatings received by patients.
Once the ratings of PARRY2 along this dimension are completed, ue wi I1 be able to compare them uith those of PARRY1 and the patients and obta7n a more objective measure of improvement.
