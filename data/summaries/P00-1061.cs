Johnson and Riezler (2000) achieved a gain of 1% over this result by including a classbased lexicalization.

In all of the cited approaches, the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is used, the availability of whichobviates the standard eort required for treebank traininghandannotating large corpora of specic domains of specic languages with specic parse types.

As is shown in Prescher et al.(2000) in an evaluation on lexical ambiguity resolution, a gain of about 7% can be obtained by using the class-based estimated frequency f c (v;;n) as disambiguation criterion instead of classbased probabilities p(njv).
C00-2094
Class-based estimated frequencies are introduced in Prescher et al.(2000) as the frequency f(v;;n) of a (v;;n)-pair in the training corpus, weighted by the best estimate of the class-membership probability p(cjv;;n) of an EM-based clustering model on (v;;n)-pairs, i.e., f c (v;;n) = max c2C p(cjv;;n)(f(v;;n) + 1).

The most direct points of comparison of our method are the approaches of Johnson et al.(1999) and Johnson and Riezler (2000).

In previous work on log-linear models for LFGby Johnson et al.(1999), pseudolikelihood estimation from annotated corpora has been introduced and experimented with on a small scale.

A comparison of performance is more dicult for the lexicalized PCFG of Beil et al.(1999) which was trained by EM on 450,000 sentences of German newspaper text.

Experimental results conrming this wisdom have been presented, e.g., by Elworthy (1994) and Pereira and Schabes (1992) for EM training of Hidden Markov Models and PCFGs.

However, the gain achieved by Beil et al.(1999) due to grammar lexicalizaton is only 2%, compared to about 10% in our case.

Such word-based lexicalizations of probability models are used successfully in the statistical parsing models of, e.g., Collins (1997), Charniak (1997), or Ratnaparkhi (1997).

Design and Lexicalization 3.1 Basic Congurational Properties The basic 190 properties employed in our models are similar to the properties of Johnson et al.(1999) which incorporate general linguistic principles into a log-linear model.
