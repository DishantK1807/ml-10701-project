When we did measure precision and recall, we used the metric as defined by Collins (1996).

As mentioned earlier, Rayner and Carter (1996) describe a system that is the inspiration for global thresholding.
P96-1030
Beam thresholding is often used in statistical parsers, such as that of Collins (1996).

The best comparison of these functions is due to Caraballo and Charniak (1996; 1997), who tried various prioritization methods.
W96-0212
Collins (personal communication) independently observed the usefulness of this modification, and Caraballo and Charniak (1996) used a related technique in a best-first parser.

One especially interesting possibility is to apply multiple-pass techniques to formalisms that require >> O(n 3) parsing time, such as Stochastic Bracketing Transduction Grammar (SBTG) (Wu, 1996) and Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars (STAG) (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992).

A B C Figure 2: Global Thresholding Motivation The key insight of global thresholding is due to Rayner and Carter (1996).

For instance, Collins (1996) uses a form of beam thresholding that differs from ours only in that it doesn't use the prior probability of nonterminals as a factor, and Caraballo and Charniak (1996) use a version with the prior, but with other factors as well.
P96-1025 W96-0212
Collins (1996) uses two thresholding techniques.
P96-1025
The only technique that Caraballo and Charniak (1996) give that took into account the scores of other nodes in the priority function, the "prefix model," required O(n 5) time to compute, compared to our O(n 3) system.
