It was shown in (Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) that pairs of words that often appear together in such symmetric patterns tend to belong to the same class (that is, they share some notable aspect of their semantics).

A lot of this research is based on the initial insight (Hearst, 1992) that certain lexical patterns (‘X is a country’) can be exploited to automatically generate hyponyms of a specified word.

We do this as follows, essentially implementing a simplified version of the method of Davidov and Rappoport (2006).

In addition to these basic types, several studies deal with the discovery and labeling of more specific relation sub-types, including inter-verb relations (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and nouncompound relationships (Moldovan et al, 2004).

Studying relationships between tagged named entities, (Hasegawa et al, 2004; Hassan et al, 2006) proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given (or semi-automatically extracted) sets of pairs into several clusters, where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type.
P04-1053 W06-1659
Finally, (Turney, 2006) provided a pattern distance measure which allows a fully unsupervised measurement of relational similarity between two pairs of words; however, relationship types were not discovered explicitly.

Note that our method differs from that of Davidov and Rappoport (2006) in that here we provide an initial seed pair, representing our target concept, while there the goal is grouping of as many words as possible into concept classes.

232 2 Problem Definition In several studies (e.g., Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Pantel et al, 2004; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) it has been shown that relatively unsupervised and language-independent methods could be used to generate many thousands of sets of words whose semantics is similar in some sense.
C02-1114 C04-1111 P06-1038
However, each of these assumes that the relations themselves are known in advance (implicitly or explicitly) so that the method can be provided with seed patterns (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Pantel et al, 2004), pattern-based rules (Etzioni et al, 2004), relation keywords (Sekine, 2006), or word pairs exemplifying relation instances (Pasca et al, 2006; Alfonseca et al, 2006; Rosenfeld and Feldman, 2006).

It should be noted that some of these papers utilize language and domain-dependent preprocessing including syntactic parsing (Suchanek et al, 2006) and named entity tagging (Hasegawa et al, 2004), while others take advantage of handcrafted databases such as WordNet (Moldovan et al, 2004; Costello et al, 2006) and Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006).

Most related work deals with discovery of hypernymy (Hearst, 1992; Pantel et al, 2004), synonymy (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999).
