(van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993; Yvon, 1996a)), which, unlike ours, benefit from the knowledge of tile alignment between graphemic and phonemic strings.

(Pirrelli and Federici, 1994), we assume that these constraints surface simultaneously in the orthographical and in the phonological domain in the recurring pattern of paradigmatically alterning pairs of lexical items.

These results compare favorably well with the performances reported for other pronunciation by analogy algorithms ((Damper and Eastmond, 1996) re432 ports very similai" correctness figures), especially if one remembers that our results have been obtained, wilhout resorting to any kind of pre-alignment between the graphemic and phonemic strin9s in the lea'icons.

(Torkolla, 1993; van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1993), as well as various recombination techniques (Yvon, 1996a).
E93-1007
A paradigmatic relationship involves four lexical entries a, b, c, d, and expresses that these forms are involved in an analogical (in the Saussurian (de Saussure, 1916) sense) proportion: a is to b as e is to d (further along abbreviated as a : b = c : d, see also (Lepage and Shin-Ichi, 1996) for another utilization of this kind of proportions).
C96-2121
This conception of analogical processes has an important consequence: it offers, as Damper and Eastmona ((Damper and Eastmond, 1996)) state it, "no principled way of deciding the orthographic neighbouts of a novel word which are deemed to influence its pronunciation (...)".
