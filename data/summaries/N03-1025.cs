We considered a Greek data set used by (Stamatatos et al., 2000) consisting of 20 texts of 10 different styles extracted from various sources (200 documents total).

For example, tasks like authorship attribution or genre classification require attention to linguistic style markers (Stamatatos et al., 2000), whereas topic detection systems rely more heavily on bag of words features.

This result compares favorably to the 72% accuracy reported in (Stamatatos et al., 2000) which is based on linear least square fit (LLSF).

Such techniques are currently being applied in many areas, including language identification, authorship attribution (Stamatatos et al., 2000), text genre classification (Kesseler et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2000), topic identification (Dumais et al., 1998; Lewis, 1992; McCallum, 1998; Yang, 1999), and subjective sentiment classification (Turney, 2002).

We are currently investigating more challenging problems like multiple category classification using the Reuters-21578 data set (Lewis, 1992) and subjective sentiment classification (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
For the sake of consistency with previous research (Aizawa, 2001; He et al., 2000; Stamatatos et al., 2000), we measure categorization performance by the overall accuracy, which is the number of correctly identified texts divided by the total number of texts considered.

The 86% accuracy obtained with bi-gram models compares favorably to the 82% reported in (Stamatatos et al., 2000), which again is based on a much deeper NLP analysis.

We considered a data set used by (Stamatatos et al., 2000) consisting of 20 texts written by 10 different modern Greek authors (totaling 200 documents).
