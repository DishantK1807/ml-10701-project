This example shows how the strategy depends on a rich ontology: S:e H H H H NP:c Chris VP:e H H H H H V:e loves NP:s Sandy ADVP:e madly chris(c)^sandy(s)^love(e;c;s)^mad(e) The example also shows how the strategy lets us quickly implement, say, the constraint-satisfaction approaches to reference resolution or the planrecognition approaches to discourse integration described in (Stone and Webber, 1998).

For modification, TAGLET adopts the the sister-adjunction operation defined in (Rambow et al., 1995); sister-adjunction just adds the modifier subtree as a child of an existing node in the head treeâ€”either on the left of the head (forward sisteradjunction) as in Figure 2, or on the right of the head (backward sister-adjunction).

TAGLET lets students explore meaty issues in semantics and pragmatics, using the unification-based semantics proposed in (Stone and Doran, 1997).

Variants of TAG like TIG (Schabes and Waters, 1995) or D-Tree grammars (Rambow et al., 1995) are motivated by linguistic or formal considerations rather than pedagogical or computational ones.
