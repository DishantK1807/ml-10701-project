Sidner's assumption that the relevant frame is given by an explicitly mentioned NP is also a source of trouble, even in the examples she quotes, such as these two (Sidner 1978b:92): (4-3) I was driving along th__ S freeway the other day.

Charniak (1978) points out that (4-5) is somehow sufficient to invoke the MAGICIAN frame: (4-5) The woman waved as the man on stage sawed her in half.

Focus shifting in PAL is restricted: the only shifts permitted are to and from sub-aspects of the present focus (Sidner 1978a:209).

An alternative approach has been suggested by Bonnie \[Nash-\]Webber (Nash-Webber and Reiter 1977; Webber 1978a, 1978b), wherein a set of rules is applied to a logical-form representation of the text to derive the set of entities that that text makes available for subsequent reference.

10 9 Sidner only speaks of reference to slots (1978a:211), without saying whether she means the slot itself or its contents; it seems reasonable to assume, as I have done here, that she actually means both.

Here is one of Webber's examples (1978a:64): (5-1) Wendy bought a crayon.

While perhaps adequate for PAL, this mechanism is, of course, not sufficient for the general case, where a true shift, as opposed to an expansion upon a previll On page 209 of Sidner (1978a) we are told: "Focus shifts cannot be predicted; they are detectable only after they occur".

As part of the search the implicit focus associated with each explicit focus is checked, as are subset relations, so that if a novel, say, 8 In her later work (Grosz 1978), Grosz emphasizes focusing as an active process carried out by dialogue participants.

This is a short-cut method, which seems to be sufficient for requests to PAL, but which Sidner readily admits is inadequate for the general case (Sidner 1978a:209).

Focus of attention in task-oriented dialogues Barbara Grosz (1977a, 1977b, 1978) studied the maintenance of the focus of attention in task-oriented dialogues and its effect on the resolution of definite reference, as part of SRI's speech understanding system project (Walker 1978).

It can be seen as a generalization albeit a weakening of Grosz's (1977a, 1977b, 1978) findings on focus in task-oriented dialogues (where each sub-task becomes the new discourse topic, opening up a new set of possible referents), which are discussed below in Section 3.

In this next, more complex example (Webber 1978a:73), we see how quantification is handled: (5-6) Each boy gave each girl a peach.

and searching focus In Grosz's representation, which uses a partitioned semantic net formalism (Hendrix 1975, 1978), an explicit focus corresponds to a sub-dialogue, and includes, for each concept in it, type information about that concept and any situation in which that concept participates.

(Some other related problems, including those of focus shifting, are discussed in Grosz 1978).

If in a subsequent sentence an anaphoric reference is a semantically acceptable coreferent for that potential focus, then a shift to that focus is ipso facto indicated (Sidner 1978a:209).
T78-1012
Webber is aware of this problem (1978a:48), and believes that it suffices that such information as is available be used to rule out impossible choices; the use of vague temporary IDs then allows the anaphor to be resolved.
T78-1006
PAL carries out database searches for references like the department lounge apparently by searching a hierarchy of frames, looking at the frames in the slots of the current focus, and then in the slots of these frames, and so on (Sidner 1978a:211), though it is not apparent why this should usefully constrain the search in the above example.

The section of PAL that deals with discourse pragmatics and reference was developed by Candace Sidner \[Bullwinkle\] (Bullwinkle 1977b; Sidner 1978a).

She discusses some of the remaining problems, such as negation, in Webber (1978a:81-88).
T78-1006
Charniak (1978) has shown that the frameselection problem (which is here identical to the initial focus selection problem, since the focus is just the frame representing the theme of the discourse) is in fact extremely difficult, and is not in the most general case amenable to solution by either strictly top-down or bottom-up methods.
