First, verbal valencies are contained in a set rather than in a list.
Second, type-raised NP's are described as two-sided functors.
The new framework does not overgenerate i.e., it accepts all and only the sentences which are grammatical.
This follows partly from the elimination of false lexical ambiguities i.e., ambiguities introduced in order to account for all the possible positions a word can be in within a sentence and partly from a system of features constraining the possible combinations.
INTRODUCTION In the version of categorial grammar (henceforth, CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), categories encode both constituency and linear precedence.
Linear precedence is encoded by (a) ordering valencies in a list and (b) using directional slashes indicating whether the argument is to be found to the left or to the right of the functor.
A similar approach is adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987) as regards word order whereby the directional slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value pre orpost.
Thus, S/NPLNP in normal CG lranslates as S/NP:predNP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that the functor must precede the argument and post that it should follow it.
Our work on French syntax supports the claim that the complicated pattern of French linearity phenomena can be treated in a framework closely related to UCG but which departs from it in two ways.
First, there is no rigid assignment of an order value (pre orpost) to verb valencies.
Second, following (Gunji 1986) verbal valencies are viewed as forming a set rather than a list.
As * The word reported here was tan'led out as part of ESPRIT Project 393 ACORD,'q'he Construction and Interrogation of Knowledge Bases using Natural Language Text and Grapities".
a result, the syntactic behaviour of constituents is dissociated from surface ordering.
Constraints on word order are described by a system of features as advocated in COszkoreit 1987) and (Karttunen 1986).
1. UCG In UCG, the phonological, categorial, semantic and order information associated with a word is contained in a single grammar structure called a sign.
This can be represented as follows.
(1) UCG sign Phonology:Categnry:Semantics:Order or equivalently Phonology :Category :Semantics :Order where colons separate the different fields of the sign.
We need not concern ourselves here with the Semantics and the Phonology fields of the sign.
More interesting for our purpose are the Category and the Order attributes.
Following the categorial tradition, categories can be basic or complex.
Basic categories are of the form HeadAFeatures where Head is one of the atomic symbols n(oun), np or s(entence) and Features is a list of feature values.
Complex categories are of the form C/Sign, where C is either atomic or complex and Sign is a sign, so that departing from traditionalCG's,a functorplaces constraints on the whole sign of the argument rather than on its syntactic category only.
The part of a complex category which omits the Head'Weatures information constitutes the activepart of the sign.
The f'trst accessible sign in the active part is called the active sign, the idea being that e.g. verb valencies are ordered in a list so that each time a valency is consumed, the next sign in the active part becomes the new active sign.
The Order attribute places constraints on the combination rule that may apply to a functor: pre on an argument sign Y indicates that the functor X/Y must precede the argument, while post indicates that the functor must follow the argument.
249Using terms and term unification, the forward version 1 of functional application can then be stated as follows.
(2) Forward Application Functor PhonologyF :CategoryF/PhonologyA : CategoryA : SemanticsA :prc :SemanticsF :OrderF Argument PhonologyA : CategoryA : SemanticsA : pie Result PhonologyF PhonologyA :CategoryF :SemanticsF :OrderF were upper letters indicate Prolog variables.
In effect, the rule requires that the active part of the functor sign term unifies with the argument sign.
The Result is a sign identical to the functor sign, but where the complex category is stripped from its active part and where variables shared by the active part of the functor and the rest of the functor sign may have become ground as a result of the active part unifying with the argument.
The resulting phonology consists of the phonology of the functor followed by the phonology of the argument.
An illustrative combination is given in (3) below for the sentence Jean marche.
(3) Derivation of Jean marche jean Â¸ : C/__ I :(C/(_:np:jean':O) :S =:~ marche \[ : s^\[fin\]/(_.:np:X:pre) : marche'(X) 2_ jean marche :s^\[fm\] :marche'(jean~ ;_ where lines represent the information flow determining ordering : shared variables ensure that pre in a verb valency constrains the fanctor NP that consumes this valency to precede the verb carrying this valency.
2. LINGUISTIC OBSERVATIONS Word order in French is characterised by three main facts.
First, the positioning left or rightof a particular argument with respect to the verb is relatively free.
As t.
Baekward application is just the symmetric of (2) where the argument precedes the funetor endpre becomes post.
illustrated in (4), the subject can appear to the left (4a) or to the right (4b,c) of the verb, or between the auxiliary and the verb (4d), depending on the morphological class of the NP and on the type of the sentence (declarative, subject-auxiliary inversion, wh-question, etc).
(4) (a) Jacques aime Marie.
CO) Alme-t-il Marie ? (c) Quel livre aime Jacques ? (d) A-t-il aim6 Marie ? All other arguments can also appear to the left or to the right of the verb under similar conditions.
For example, a lexical non-nominative NP can never be to the left of the verb, but critics and wh-constituents can.
(5) (a) *Marie aregard~e Jacques ? (with Marie = Obj) Co) QueUe revue a regard~e Jacques ? (with Quelle revue = Obj) (c) Jacques l'a regardte Second, there seems to be no clear regularities governing the relative ordering of a sequence of arguments.
That is, assuming that only adjacent constituents may combine and taking the combinations leftto-right, the combination pattern varies as indicated below of each example in (6).
Here again, the permissible distributions are influenced by factors such as the morphological class of the constituents and the verb mood.
(6) (a) Pierre donne h Marie un livre.
\[Subj,IObj,Obj\] Co) Pierre donne un livre h Marie.
\[Subj,Obj,IObj\] (c) Le lui donne-t-il ? \[Obj,IObj,Subj\] (d) Se le donne-t-il ? \[IObj,Obj,Subj\] Third, coocurrence restrictions hold between constituents.
For example, clitics constrain the positioning and the class of other arguments as illustrated in (7) 2 (7) (a) Pierre le lui donne.
Co) Pierre lui en donne.
(c) Pierre lui donne un livre.
(d) *Pierre lui le donne.
(e) *Pierre lui y donne.
Since the ordering and the positioning of verb arguments in French are very flexible, the rigid ordeIn italics : the word whose coocurrence restriction is violated (starred sentences) or obeyed (non-starred sentences).
For instance, (7d) is starred because lu/may not be followed by le.
250ring forced by the UCG active list and the fixed positioning resulting from the Order attribute are rather inadequate.
On the other hand, word order in French is not free either.
Rather it seems to be governed by conditional ordering statements such as: (8) IF (a) the verb has an object valency, and Co) the object NP is a wh-constituent, and (c) the verbal constituent is the simple inflected verb, and (d) the clitic t-il/elle has not been incorporated THEN the object can be placed to the left or to the right of the verb.
If say, (8d) is not fulfilled, the wh-NP can be placed only to the left, witness: *Jacques a-t-il regard~ quelle revue ?, and mutatis mutandis for the other conditions.
More generally, five elements can be isolated whose interaction determine whether or not a given argument can occupy a given position in the sentence.
(9) (a) Position left or right with regard to the verb, Co) Verbal form and sentence type, (c) Morphological class (lexical, wh-constituent or clitic) of the previous constituent having concatenated to the left or to the right of the verb, (d) Morphological class of the current constituent (lexical, wh-constituent or clitic), (e) Case.
We claim that it is possible to extend UCG in order to express the above conditioning variables.
The resulling grammar can account for the preceding linguistic facts without resorting either to lexical ambiguity or to jump rules 3.
3. EXTENSIONS TO UCG To account for the facts presented in section 2, UCG has been modified in two ways.
Firstly, the active part ofaverb category is represented as a set rather than a list.
Secondly, a feature system is introduced which embodies the interactions of the different elements conditioning word order as described in (9) above.
3.1 SIGN
STRUCTURE AND COMBINATION RULE : FROM AN ACTIVE LIST TO AN ACTIVE SET.
To accomodate our analysis, the sign structure and the combination rule had to be slightly modified.
In the French Grammar (FG), a sign is as follows.
XA jump rule as used in (Baschung et al.1986), is of the form X/Y, Y/'Z => X/'Z.
(10) French Grammar Sign Phonology : Category : Features : Semantics : Optionality : Order Semantics and Phonology are as in UCG.
Optionality indicates whether the argument is optional or obligatory 4.
The Category attribute differs from UCG in that (i) there are no Features associated with the Head and (ii) the active part of a verb is viewed as a set rather than as a list.
The Features attribute is a list of features.
In this paper, only those relevant to order constraints are mentioned.
They are: case, verb mood, morphological class of NP's (i.e., lexical, clitic or wh-constituent) and last concatenation to the left (Lastlefl) or to the right (Lastright).
The latter features indicate the morphological status of the last concatened functorand are updated by the combination rule (cf.
(13)). For instance, the sign associated with Jean lui a donnd un livre will have lex as values for Lastlefl and Lastright whereas lui a donn~ un livre has lui and lex respectively.
The Features attribute can be represented as in (11 ) below, where the same feature may occupy a different position in the feature list of different linguistic units, e.g., feature list of verb valencies and feature list of NP signs.
(11) The Features attribute For valencies (active sign of NP's and verbs) : \[Case, Lastleft, Lastright\] For verb signs : \[Mclass, Lastleft, Lastright, Vmood\] As illustrated in (12), the Order attribute has two parts, one for when the functor combines forward, the other for when it combines backward.
(12) The Order attribute Cdts =~ pre ~ Resfeat, Cdts =~ post =~ Resfeat, where Cdts and Resfeat are lists of feature values whose order and content are independent from those of the Features attribute.
The intuition behind this is that functors (i.e., type-raised NP's) are two-sided i.e., they can combine to the left and to the right but under different conditions and with different results.
The features in Cdts place constraints on the features of the argument while the features in Resfeat are inherited by the resulting sign.
These effects are obtained by unifi4.
In the rest of this paper, the Semantics and the Optionality attributes will be omitted since they have no role to play in our treatment of word order while Phonology will only be represented when relevant.
251 cation of shared variables in the rules of combination.
Omitting Semantics and Optionality attributes, the forward combination rule is as follows.
(13) Forward Combination s (FC) Functor PhonologyF :~ CategoryF / PhonologyA :CategoryA :\[MClassA....
\] : (\[Lastleft,Vmood\] ~pre~ \[Vmood2\], _3 :\[MClassF...\] ".
Argument PhonologyA :\[\] CategoryA' : \[MClassA,Lastleft,Lastright,Vmood\] {combine (\[\]\], \[21, Category')} Result PhonologyF PhonologyA : Category' : \[MClassA, MClassF, Lastright, Vmood2\] The rule requires (i) that the functor category combines with the argument category \[\] to yield the result category Category'.
The notion of combination relies on the idea that the active part of a verb is a set rather than a list.
More precisely, given a type-raised NP NP1 with category C/(C/NP).
where NP i is a valency sign, and a verb V1 with category slActSet where ActSet is a set of valency signs, NP1 combines with V1 to yield V2 iff NPi unifies with some NP-valency sign in the active set ActSet of the verb.
V2 is identical to V1 except that the unifying NP i valency sign has been removed from the active set and that some features in V1 will have been instantiated by the rule.
Forward combination further requires (ii) that the two features in the condition list to pre unify with the Lastlefl and Vmood features of the argument (the features conditioning post are ignored since they are relevant only when the functor combines backwards), and (iii) that the features of the resulting sign be as specified.
Note in particular that the MClass of the resulting sign is the MClass of the argument, that Lastright which indicates the morphological class ofthelast sign to have combined with the verb from theright, is transmitted from the argument, and thatLastlefl is assigned as value the MClass of the functor.
Features of the resuiting sign which are conditional on the combination order ate inherited from the Resfeat field.
This percox In this figure, numbers inside square denote the following attribute.
For instance, \[\] denotes CategoryA'.
lation of features by rule is crucial to our treatment of word order.
It is illustrated by (14) below where the sign S 1 associated with the clitic le combines with the sign for $2 regarde to yield a new sign $3 le regarde.
(14) Derivation of le regarde S1 le :C/(C/(np:\[obj ...\]:-3 :\[obj...\] :-3 :\[vb ....
\] :(tiui or i, ind\] => pre => \[ind\], \[i, imp\] =>post => \[imp\]) :tie ....
\] :_ $2 regarde :s/{ np, np } :\[obj ...\] :\[subj ...\] :\[vb, i, i, ind\] :_ $3 le regarde :s/t nP } : \[subj ...\] :\[vb, le, i, ind\] :_ When le is used as a forward functor, the conditions on pre require that the argument i.e., the verb bears for the feature Lastlefl the value lui or i where i stands for initial state thus requiring that the verb has not combined with anything on the left.
When it combines by BC, the conditions onpost ensure that the argument has not combined with anything on its right and that it has mood imperative.
In this way, all sentences in (15) are parsed appropriately.
(15) (a) I1 le hi donne.
Co) *II lui le donne.
(c) Donne le lui.
(d) *Donne lui le.
The backward combination rule (BC) functions like FC except for two things.
First, the argument must be to the left of the functor and second, the condition field considered is that ofpost rather than ofpre.
There is also a deletion rule to eliminate optional valencies.
No additional rule is needed.
3.2 EXPRESSING
THE VARIABLES UNDERLYING WORD ORDER CONSTRAINTS In our grammar, there are nopost andpre primitive values associated with specific verb valencies.
Instead, features interact with combination rules to enforce the 252 constraints on word order described in (9).
(9a) is captured in the two-sided order field.
(9b verb mood) and (9cmorphological class of preceding concatenating functor) are accounted for in that in a functor, the features conditioning order include the verb mood and the last concatenation attribute.
(9d) is accounted for in that conditions which are invariant for a particular class of constituent (clitic, wh-constituent, lexical NP) are expressed in the Order field of these constituents.
For example, wh-constituents reject through their conditions topre a wh-value for the Lastlefl feature of the argument and an inv16 value in their condition to post.
As a result, the following sentences are parsed appropriately.
(16) (a) *A qui qui a ttltphon6 ? Co) *A-t-il t~ltphon6 a qui ? (c) A qui a-t-il ttltphon6 ? (d) I1 a ttltphone a qui ? Conditions which vary depending on the class of the concatenating constituent are expressed in the Features attribute of the verb valencies.
This allows us to express constraints on the position of a given type of NP (lex, wh or clitic) relative to the valency it consumes.
For instance,a lexical NPcan be subject or object.
If it is subject and it is to the left of the verb, it cannot be immediately followed by a wh-constituent.
If it is subject and it is placed to the right of the verb, it must be immediately adjacent to it.
These constraints can be stated using unification along to the following lines.
A verb valency is of the form (17) (np:\[...
X,Y ...\]:Ord) where X and Y are either the anonymous variable or a constant.
They state constraints, among others, on possible values ofLastlefl andLastright features of the verb.
Recall that a valency is a sign which is a member of a set in the Category attribute of a verbal sign.
The active sign of a type raised NP is of the form: (18) C/(np:\[...
V1, V2...\]:__) :\[vb I_\] :(\[V1 ...\] => pre => Z, \[V2...\] => post => W) By rule, V1 and V2 in the Category attribute of (18) must unify with X and Y, respectively, in the verb valency (17).
Being shared variables, they transmit the information to the Conditions on concatenation by FC (pre) and BC (post), respectively.
Furthermore, V1 and V2 in the Ord attribute of the functor must unify, by rule, with some specified features in the verb Features attribute represented in (19).
The value/nvl for the Lastlefl feature of a verb resulm from a backward combination of the nominative elitic -t-il with this verb.
(19) \[vb, Lasleft, Lastright ....
\] The flow of information between (17), (18) and (19) is represented graphically in (20), where (20a), (20b) and (20c) correspond to (17), (18) and (19) respectively.
(20a) and (20c), which express the Category and theFeatures attibutes of the same verbal sign, have been dissociated for the sake of clarity.
(20) Flow of information between functor and argument (a) (np:\[...:~,~'...\]:Ord) CO) ...\]: _3 C/(np:\[...
V1, V2 :(\[V1 ...\] ~ pre=~ Z, \[V2...\] =~ post =:~W) (c) \[vb,'~tleft, t Lastright ....
\] :fwd; --:bwd For example, suppose the nominative valency (21a), in the verbal sign tdMphone d la fille, whose Features attribute is as in (21c), and the lexical sign Jean (21b).
(21) Flow of information between Jean and tdldphone a laJ#le (a) (np:tnom ..... -:wh, i ....
\]:Ord) I I 1 I Co) C/(np:\[nom or obj .....
V1, V2 ....
\]:_ ) :\[vb I :(\[V1 ...\] ~ pre=~ Z,\[~V2 ...\] =~ post =~ W) (c) :\[vb, i, lex,'~...\] The concatenation by FC is allowed (-wh is compatible with 0, the requirement extracted from the verbal valency being that the Lastleft concatenated contituent with the verb is not a wh-constituent.
But a concatenation by BC will fail(i does not unify with lex).
Thus examples in (22) are correctly recognised (see Appendix).
(22) (a) Jean ttltphone ~t la Idle.
Co) *Ttltphone ~ la fille Jean.
(c) *Jean ~ quelle fille ttltphone ? (d) A queUe fille ttltphone Jean ? 4.
IMPLEMENTATION The UCG formalism and the corresponding computational environment were developped at the Centre for Cognitive Science, University of Edinburgh by (Calderetal.
1986). They include facilities for defining templates and path-equations as in PATR-2 and a shiftreduce parser.
The extensions to the original framework have been implemented at the Universit6 Blaise 253 Pascal, Formation Doctorale Linguistique et Informatique, Clermont-Ferrand (France).
The system runs on a Sun and has been extensively tested.
5. COVERAGE AND DISCUSSION The current grammar accounts for the core local linearity phenomena of French i.e., auxiliary and clitic order, clitic placement in simple and in complex verb phrases, clitic doubling and interrogative inversions.
Unbounded dependencies are catered for without resorting either to threading COCG), functional uncertainty (Karttunen) or functional composition (Combinatory Categorial Grammar, Steedman 1986).
Instead, the issue is dealt with at the lexical level by introducing an embedding valency on matrix verbs.
Finally, non local order constraints such as constraints on the distribution of negative particles and the requirement for a wh-constituent to be placed to the left of the verb when a lexical subject is placed to the right (see example (22d)) can also be handled.
Thus, it appears that insights from phrase structure and categorial grammar can be fruitfully put together in a lexical framework.
Following GPSG, our formalism does not associate verb valencies with any intrinsic order.
An interesting difference however is that LP statements are not used either.
This is important since in French, clitic ordering (B~s 1988) shows that order constraints may hold between items belonging to different local trees.
Another difference with GPSG is that as in UCG, no explicit statement of feature instantiation principles is required: the feature flow of information is ensured by the concatenation rules.
Last but not least, it is worth underlining that our approach (1) keeps the number of combination rules down to 2 (plus a unary deletion rule) and (2) eliminates unjustified lexical ambiguity i.e., ambiguity not related to categorial or semantic information on the other hand.
Though there are or so we argue good linguistic reasons for representing verb valencies as a set rather than as a list, it is only fair to stress that this rapidly leads to computational innefficiency while parsing.
Typically, given 3 adjacent signs NP 1 V NP2 there will be two ways of combining each NP with the verb and thus two parses.
In a more complex sentence, so-called "spurious ambiguities" i.e., analyses which yield exactly the same sign multiply very quickly.
We are currently working on the problem.
