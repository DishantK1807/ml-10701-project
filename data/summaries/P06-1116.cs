While string-based approaches (Paice, 1981; Teufel, 1998) are too restrictive to cover the wide variation within the correct contexts, bag-of-words approaches such as Agichtein and Gravano’s (2000) are too permissive and would miss many of the distinctions between correct and incorrect contexts.

We compared our system against our reimplementation of Ravichandran and Hovy’s (2002) paraphrase learning.

We use verb-object relations in both active and passive voice constructions as did Pereira et al.(1993) and Lee (1999), among others.

Unsupervised methods for similar tasks include Agichtein and Gravano’s (2000) work, which shows that clusters of vector-spacebased patterns can be successfully employed to detect speci c IE relationships (companies and their headquarters), and Ravichandran and Hovy’s (2002) algorithm for nding patterns for a Question Answering (QA) task.

Methods for nding cue phrases automatically include Hovy and Lin (1998) (using the ratio of word frequency counts in summaries and their corresponding texts), Teufel (1998) (using the most frequent n-grams), and Paice (1981) (using a pattern matching grammar and a lexicon of manually collected equivalence classes).

While Lee (1999) argues that α-Skew’s asymmetry can be advantageous for nouns, this probably does not hold for verbs: verb hierarchies have much shallower structure than noun hierarchies with most verbs concentrated on one level (Miller et al., 1990).

As our task is not grounded in real-world relations but in rhetorical ones, constraints found in the context tend to be 2Thus, our task shows some parallels to work in paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2002) and syntactic variant generation (Jacquemin et al., 1997), but the methods are very different.

We use the cosine similarity measure for windowbased contexts and the following commonly used similarity measures for the syntactic vector space: Hindle’s (1990) measure, the weighted Lin measure (Wu and Zhou, 2003), the α-Skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999), the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Lin, 1991), Jaccard’s coef cient (van Rijsbergen, 1979) and the Confusion probability (Essen and Steinbiss, 1992).
