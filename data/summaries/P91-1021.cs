In this paper we describe a translation project whose aim is to build an experimental Bilingual Conversation Interpreter (BCI) which will allow communication through typed text between two monolingual humans using different languages (of Miike et al, 1988).

McCord's (1988, 1989) organizing level appears to be/hat, of surface syntax, with additional deep syntactic and semantic content attached to nodes.

These aspects are addressed by the contextual interpretation phase which has the following subphases: quantifier scoping (Moran 1988), reference resolution (Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement.

Thurmair 1990, Nagao and Tsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules, and the predicate-argument structure which is required for the application of sortal restrictions is not represented.

P89-1004
Input sentences are analysed by the Core Language Engine (CLE 1) as far as the level of Quasi Logical Form (QLF; Alshawi, 1990), and then, instead of further ambiguity resolution, undergo transfer into another QLF having constants and predicates corresponding to word senses in the other language.
J90-3001
The LF language is based on first order predicate logic extended with generalized quantifiers and some other higher order constructs (Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989).

Generation uses the semantic-head driven algorithm (Shieber et al, 1990).

Kaplan et al (1989) allow multiple levels of representation to take part in the transfer relation.
E89-1037
Isabelle and Macklovitch (1986) argue against such asymmetry between analysis and synthesis on the grounds that, although it is tempting as a short-cut to building a structure sufficiently well-specified for synthesis to take place, asymmetry means that the transfer component must contain a lot of knowledge about the target language, with dire consequences for the modularity of the system and the reusability of different parts of it.
