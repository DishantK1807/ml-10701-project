Finally, in the parent annotated model (PA) described in (Johnson, 1998) the states depend 1Note that in our notation a single node tree has depth 0.

The experiments were performed using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus of the University of Pennsylvania (Marcus et al., 1993) modified as described in (Charniak, 1996) and (Johnson, 1998).

According to (Johnson, 1998), weaker independence assumptions --such as decreasing the number of nodes or increasing the number of node labels-improve the efficiency of the parser.

In this spirit, we introduce a generalization of the classic k-gram models, widely used for string processing (Brown et al., 1992; Ney et al., 1995), to the case of trees.

Recent work (Johnson, 1998) has explored the performance of parsers based on a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) extracted from a training corpus.
