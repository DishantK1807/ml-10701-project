In previous work, I did propose an assumption about the data called precision independence, under which the Yarowsky algorithm could be shown effective (Abney 2002).

The YS algorithms resemble the “Yarowsky-Cautious” algorithm of Collins & Singer (1999), though they differ from that algorithm in that they update a single feature in each iteration, rather than a small set of features, as in Yarowsky-Cautious.

The Yarowsky (1995) algorithm was one of the first bootstrapping algorithms to become widely known in computational linguistics.
