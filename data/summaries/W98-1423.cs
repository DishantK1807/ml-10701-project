As Wilcock and Matsumoto (1998) point out, even a simple sentence such as She saw Kim cannot be generated with this approach to head-driven generation with HPSG.

This approach to generation from NewInfo has been developed further by Jokinen et al.(1998). 6 Other Approaches In conclusion we take a brief look at some other approaches.

This question is addressed by Wilcock and Matsum0to (1998), who point Out that semantic head-driven generation with HPSG should be easy to implement because semantic heads are very clearly defined in HPSG (in head-adjunct phrases, the adjunct daughter is the semantic head; in other headed phrases, the syntactic head daughter is the semantic head) and in both cases, the HPSG Semantics Principle requires the semantic content of the semantic head to be identical to the semantic content of the mother.

Figure 2, from (Wilcock and Matsumoto, 1998), shows how BUG1 can easily be used with a ProFIT HPSG grammar of the type illustrated in Figure 1.
P98-2227
Similar work on compiling HPSG for efficient parsing (Torisawa and Tsujii, 1996) should be equally applicable to generation.

mnalgamation in ProFIT A ProFIT implementation of lexical amalgamation is shown in Figure 3, from (Wilcock and Maisumoto, 1998).
P98-2227
The first approach to mention is the radical one of converting HPSG into something else before generation, such as Tree Adjoining Grammar (Kasper et al., 1995)..Though this seems to support the view that HPSG is unsuitable for generation, it is in fact a valuable contribution to work on compiling HPSG grammars for efficient processing, whether for parsing (Torisawa and Tsujii, 1996) or for generation.

Given a suitable grammar with such Systematic sharing, these algorithms are very efficient, especially when implemented with a chart (Haruno et ah, 1996; Wilcock and Matsumoto, 1996) â€¢.
C96-2128
Lager and Black (1994), discussing"the PLUS surface generator, suggest that the algorithm and the QLF are suitable for incremental generation.
W94-0327
Wilcock and Matsumoto (1998) point out two severe difficulties for head-driven generation with HPSG.
P98-2227
For example, discussing the possible adaptation of Phillips' algorithm to incremental generation, Lager and Black (1994) point out that some versions of Categorial Grammar (CG) would make the generator more talkative, by giving rise to "a more generous notion of constituency".
W94-0327
As noted in the introduction, another approach is to convert HPSG into TAG (Kasper et al., 1995) for generation.
P95-1013
For uniformity~ the algorithms are implemented m Prolog and the grammars are implemented in ProFIT (Erbach, 1995).
E95-1025
Head-driven approaches to generation with HPSG are described in detail by Wilcock and Matsumoto (1998).
