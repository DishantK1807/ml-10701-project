Problems of German-English Automatic Translation Paul O.
Samuelsdorff I.
Aims and method The aim of any Automatic Translation project is to give a mechanical procedure for finding an equivalent expression in the target lan6uage for any sentence in the source lan6uage.
The aim of any lin6uistic translation project is to find the corresponding structures of the languages dealt with.
With both of these aims in mind, the empirical method was adopted in the project described in this paper.
2. Structure of the dictionar 7 Two dictionaries are needed: an idiomatic dictio~ and a lexical dictionary.
Both have next to each English entry the Gex~an equivalent (or equivalents) and the syntactic and semantic information needed for producing a correct German sentence (and for choosing the correct equivalent, if necessary).
The lexlcal dictionary may, for technical reasons, be subdivided into a dictionary for words of high frequency and a dictionary for words of low frequency.
3. Syntactic Problems 3.1.
Morphological problems: choosin 6 the correct German suffixes.
3.2. I~xloo18~cal problems: choosing the correct German article, pronoun or relative pronoun.
3.3Word order: finding the correct structure of German word-8~oups and sentences for the corresponding English structure.
~. Semantic Problems ~.I.
Solvable problems: the correct German equivalent of an ambiguous English word may be found by testin 6 the environment.
4.2. Partially solvable problems: the correct German equivalent can only be found by approximation.
Possible solutions will be suggested.
5Examples Examples will be given to all of the above problems. 4
