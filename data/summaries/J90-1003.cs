WITH A PARSER Hindle (Church et al.1989) has found it helpful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser (Hindle 1983a, 1983b) to identify associations between verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes for nouns on this basis.

We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to~in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to~to.

For example, Hindle (Church et al.1989) has used a syntactic parser to select words in certain constructions of interest.
