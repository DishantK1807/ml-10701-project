We used the default polynomial kernel (degree=3) for the linear features and a SubSet Tree (SST) kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for the comparison of ASTm1 structured features.

for Semantic Role Labeling We explicitly represent as attribute-value pairs the following features of each Fp,a pair: • Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, Position and Voice as defined in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002); • Partial Path, No Direction Path, Head Word POS, First and Last Word/POS in Constituent and SubCategorization as proposed in (Pradhan et al., 2005); a) S NP DT The NN charter VP AUX was VP VBN approved PP IN by NP DT the NNP EC NNP Commission PP IN on NP NNP Sept.

This choice is justified by previous studies (Moschitti et al., 2006b) showing that the accuracy of classification is higher for lower nodes; • if only two nodes are involved, i.

(Moschitti et al., 2006a) and (Moschitti et al., 2006b) defined several classes of structured features that were successfully employed with tree kernels for the different stages of an SRL process.

The solution of a monolithic boundary classifier that we previously employed (Moschitti et al., 2006b) is noticeably more accurate though much less efficient, especially for training.

The evaluations were carried out with the SVMLight-TK2 software (Moschitti, 2004) which extends the SVM-Light package (Joachims, 1999) with tree kernel functions.
