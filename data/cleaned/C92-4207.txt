So. at first, we extract such information as the qualitative spatial constraints among the spatial attributes of the entities, and then.

This process is shown in figure 1.
Given ~ text, SPRINT makes a sm'faee ease structure using the lexical information.
Each entity is described ms a noltlt.
Next, SPRINT extracts spatial constraints about the entities by analyzing the related words in the case.
structure.
At this time.
SPRINT also extracts the sequence of the information references fl'om the lexical mtbrmation as dependencies, which are used as cues in the calculation of the paranwters.
At the next stage, the extracted qualitative constraints are intertn'eted as the nmnerical constraints among the e,ltity paranletc.rs.
These nulllerical COllstrailltS :4re repl'esented }kS the COlllbinatiolt of the primitive constraints.
Tit(! tmten tial energy function is one of such primitives, and this is an efficient method to treat the vagllelteSS in the constraints.
Other primitives are the tot mlogical constraints and the regions.
The potential energy flmction is a kind of the cost fllnetiolls which t~tkes all related paranmters and output the ('()st.
The less the wthm of the potential (mergy flmction, the more credit the combinatiml of the gemnetric parameters gains.
Using the gradient descendent method, the solution with nlininnnn cost is calculated.
The t)otcntial (mc.rgy flmction 1)rovides a means for accmnulating fl'om fragnmntal'y infornuttion.

In this case tile observer get across the crossroad and no other information is obt~dned, so tile directiml of tim eye is determined as the same ~m that of the transfm" of the observer.

Anyway if you do not want to see a towm' t)efore the crossroad, one of the solutions to this problem is like this: put some obstacle on the view of tit(: observer 1)efore the crossroad, that means put it between the p()int of the observer and the tower.
