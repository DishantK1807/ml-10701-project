Sato and Nagao (1990) proposed still richer representations where syntactically analyzed phrases and sentences are stored in a database.

Brown et al.(1990) segment the input sentences into words where for each source-target language word pair translation probabilities, fertility probabilities, alignment probabilities etc.

(Brown et al., 1990) have a purely holistic view on languages.

A statistical language 1 Brown et al.(1990) uses the Hansard French-English text containing several million words.

For instance, in Brown et al.(1990) a couple of models are presented starting with simple stochastic translation models getting incrementally more complex and rich by introducing more random variables.

Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT) systems (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Collins, 1998; Gilvenir and Cicekli, 1998; Carl, 1999; Brown, 1997) are richer systems.
