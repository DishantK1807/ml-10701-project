Korhonen (1998), which used a statistical model to identify verb alternations, relying on an existing taxonomy of possible alternations, as well as Lapata (1999), which searched a large corpus to find evidence of two particular verb alternations.

There has also been some work on both clustering and supervised classification of verbs based on their alternation behavior (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Schulte im Walde, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001).

The syntactic relations used in our experiments are computed from the typed dependencies returned by the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).

and Evaluation We train our models with verb instances extracted from three parsed corpora: (1) the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (PTB), which was parsed by human annotators (Marcus et al., 1993), (2) the Brown Laboratory for Linguistic Information Processing corpus of Wall Street Journal text (BLLIP), which was parsed automatically by the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000), and (3) the Gigaword corpus of raw newswire text (GW), which we parsed ourselves with the Stanford parser.

This work bears some similarity to the substantial literature on automatic subcategorization frame acquisition (see, e.g., Manning (1993), Briscoe and Carroll (1997), and Korhonen (2002)).

Finally, Swier and Stevenson (2004) perform unsupervised semantic role labeling by using hand-crafted verb lexicons to replace supervised semantic role training data.

The two main handtagged corpora are PropBank (Palmer et al., 2003) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), the former of which currently has broader coverage.
