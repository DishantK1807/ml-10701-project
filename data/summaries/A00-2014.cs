Systems that utilize a language model that operates as a post-processor to a speech recognizer include (Block, 1997; Seneff, 1992; Zue et al., 1991).

An arity of two suffices to represent a grammar at least as powerful as a context-free grammar (Maruyama, 1990a; Maruyama, 1990b).

Our NLP component is implemented using a CDG parser (Harper and Helzerman, 1995; Maruyama, 1990a; Maruyama, 1990b) because of its power and flexibility, in particular: â€¢ It supports the use of syntactic, semantic, and domain-specific knowledge in a uniform framework.

Building upon this concept of role value partitioning, it is possible to construct another way of representing unary and binary constraints because CDG constraints do not need to reference the exact position of a word or a modifiee in the sentence to parse sentences (Harper and Helzerman, 1995; Maruyama, 1990a; Maruyama, 1990b; Menzel, 1994; Menzel, 1995).

to CDG Constraint Dependency Grammar (CDG), first introduced by Maruyama (Maruyama, 1990a; Maruyama, 1990b), uses constraints to determine the grammatical dependencies for a sentence.
