Of these, TDT, which is a long-term project, proposed many diverse applications, e.g., story segmentation (Greiff et al., 2000), topic tracking (Levow et al., 2000; Leek et al., 2002), topic detection (Chen and Ku, 2002) and link detection (Allan et al., 2000).

Next, we applied another topic segmentation algorithm developed by Utiyama et al.(2001). The results show that this segmentation algorithm is better than TextTiling.

Several attempts were made to extract information from news stories, e.g., multi-lingual multi-document summarization (Chen and Huang, 1999; Chen and Lin, 2000), topic detection and tracking (abbreviated as TDT hereafter, http://www.nist.gov/TDT), and so on.
