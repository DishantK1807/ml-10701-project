The notion of incrementally merging classes of lexical items is intuitively satisfying and is explored in detail in (Brown, et al.1992). The approach taken in the cited work is somewhat different than ours and while our method is no less computationally complex than that of Brown, et al., we believe that it is somewhat more manageable because of the pruning effect provided by context priming.

In the results we describe here, we use mutual information (Fano 1961, 27-28; Church and Hanks 1990) as the metric for neighbourhood pruning, pruning which occurs as the network is being generated.
