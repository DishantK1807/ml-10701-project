Dialogue grammars have previously been used to manage dialogue (Bunt, 1989; Bilange, 1991; Traum and Hinkelman, 1992; JSnsson, 1993; Mast et al., 1994; Novick and Sutton, 1994; Chino and Tsuboi, 1996), but we are not aware of an approach where speech acts are translated into a collection of primitives with propositional content.
