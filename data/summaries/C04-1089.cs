For example, the work of (AlOnaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used only the pronunciation or spelling of w in translation.

For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.

Similarly, Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable.

Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).

On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.

Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters.

On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.

The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (Huang et al., 2004).

So we first segmented Chinese text with a Chinese word segmenter that was based on maximum entropy modeling (Ng and Low, 2004).

Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).

Koehn and Knight (2002) attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling.

2. Our approach The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c, then the contexts of the two words are similar.

Precision and recall for different values of M The past research of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) utilized context information alone and was evaluated on different corpora from ours, so it is difficult to directly compare our current results with theirs.

That is, if an English letter sequence 1 e precedes another English letter sequence 2 e in an English word, then the pinyin syllable mapped to 1 e must precede the pinyin syllable mapped to 2 e . Our method differs from (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) in that our method does not generate candidates but only estimates )|( ceP for candidates e appearing in the English corpus.
