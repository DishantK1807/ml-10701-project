However, it limits the representation capability for semantic processing (Shieber et a1.,1989). The problems of semantic representation are still difficult, so their study is an ongoing task.

Handling pragmatic information clearly depends on assumption of belief: Generating referring expressions requires inferencing the hearer's belief (Appelt, 1985); Producing text requires the usage of a one-sided mutual beliefl(Moore et a1.,1989); the listener's inference about the speaker's belief greatly helps to resolve anaphora or to analyze the speaker's intention.

5. Discussions As mentioned in (Emele and Zajac,1990), the proposed approach inevitably leads to the consequence that the data structure becomes slightly complicated.

Dymetman and Strzalkowski approached the problem by compiling DCG into efficient analysis and synthesis programs (Dymetman et a1.,1988) (Strzalkowski,1990).

2. Existing Architectures For Reversible And Bi-directional Grammar Shieber proposed a uniform architecture for sentence parsing and generation based on the Early type deduction mechanism (Shieber,1988).

It is advantageous that the assumption supports symmetry as discussed in (Noord,1990) and naturally realizes semantic indexing which leads to efficient processing (Calder, 1989).

If desired, however, pragmatics can be used to precisely stipulate some linguistic phenomena (Delin, 1990).

Shieber remedied the inefficiency of the gen eration algorithm in his uniform architecture to introduce the concept of semantic head (Shieber et a1.,1989). Although Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) is reversible, its synthesis mode is inefficient.

Ait-Kaci's typed unification was applied to a reversible architecture (Emele and Zajac,1990).
