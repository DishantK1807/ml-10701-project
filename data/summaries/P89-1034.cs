Pareschi's lazy parsing algorithm (Pareschi, 1987) has been shown (I-Iepple, 1987) to be incomplete.
P87-1012
It derives either from using other rules or combinators for derivation than just functional application (Pareschi and Steedman 1987, Wittenburg 1987, Moortgat 1987, Morrill 1988) or from having anordered set valencies (Karttunen 1986), the latter case being that of FG.
