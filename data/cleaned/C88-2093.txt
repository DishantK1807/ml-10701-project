large nominal 9roups in technical texts), -~ Practical systems need a substantial if :c, ot co~ap\]eyte coverage of the syntax of the nl they aye bui \].

have to augment the forma\].ism~ e,g0 as soon as you have to prec@ss real data and not only text book cases a lot of conventional n\]aterial has to be taken into account as we\].l: format of dates~ measurements~ etc.
.),inguistic theories very often have been eztensively applied to problems 'taken from a specific nat~a\] language ( in most cases .~ F.nglish)~ To transfer those theories to other \].anguages with different problems may be hard (if not impossible).
B) Another difference between theoretical and ongineering problems lies in the fact 'that building a practical nlp system always forces you to take a lot of additional constraints into account that are negligeable from a theorist' s viewpoint : Fo~: the implementation, usage and maintenance of practical nlp systems dedicated software tools are needed e.g. fox editing, debugging and update of grammars and lexica.
Practical nlp systems are often evaluated by users (and ~:efereem) that are nnon-linguists.,According to our experience those people tend to take "mupe~'fi.cial" aspects 'that have little OK no relevance for linguists as a basin for their judgements; eog° if oK if 'not a system fo~: German is able to handle umlauts correct\].y or how you may type in to a system for japanese, Practical nlp ~-}ym terns inevitably need a substantial \].exicon and due to the generativeness of nl with respect to vocabulary additional techniques for handling unknown lexical items.
C) Some ef the abeve helds especially fo~: wo~k in nl gene~oation: Linguistic theories are primarily concerned with aspects of (syntactic) analysis° \[~ome ef the hard problems for analysis (e0g, ~?\[I? attac|ument) are not equally problemat:i,c in generation.
In general nl generation is an interdisciplinary task involving a lot of non,° linguistic decisions ~ D) Theorists tend to ~'est~cict theist app~'oaches to the very techniques available withi~ their theories.
In practical nlp systems it may be fruitful to f:ceely combine elea~ent~ f~om distinct "Zinguistic schools" ~ 'the morphosyntactic front end generator FREGE \[Emele 87\] is a case in point: )?REGE takes functional grammatical structures comparable to those from LFG \[Kaplan~ B:cesnan 82\] ~ as input and working structures but provides means to specify constituent ordering as linear precedence relations similar to GPSG \[Gazdar eta\]., 82\] o E ) What about the following analogy ; ~#he relation between theoretical, linguistics and "language engineering" should parallel that between mathematics and (civil) engineering° F) Linguistic theory might profit from problems attacked in practical systems as well because (as with mathematics and problems in engineering ) these problems may gi~e motivation for future research.
