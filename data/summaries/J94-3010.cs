As shown by Carpenter (1992) and Zajac (1992, in press), we can use constraint resolution to carry out type inference for feature terms.

As an illustration, consider the data from German verb inflections analyzed by Krieger, Pirker, and Nerbonne (1993).

Moreover, some recent thinking on the phonology-phonetics interface supports this view (Pierrehumbert 1990; Coleman 2 (Bach and Wheeler 1981; Wheeler 1981; Bird 1990; Cahill 1990; Coleman 1991; Scobbie 1991; Bird 1992; Walther 1992; Mastroianni 1993; Russell 1993) 456 Steven Bird and Ewan Klein Phonological Analysis in Typed Feature Systems 1992).

Recently, Bird and Ellison (1994) have reinterpreted the constraint-based approach to phonology using finite-state automata.

While it is clearly possible to integrate an essentially generative model into the mold of constraint-based grammar (Krieger, Pirker, and Nerbonne 1993), it is less clear that this is the approach most phonologists would wish to take nowadays.
P93-1019
There have been some notable recent attempts to rescue the FST model from its linearity in order to encompass nonlinear phonology (Kay 1987; Kornai 1991; Wiebe 1992).

similar approach is envisaged by Krieger, Pirker, and Nerbonne (1993).

As we have already explained in Section 1.4, we have linguistic reasons for not wishing to use finite-state transducers and the concomitant two-level model, and instead are interested in exploring the prospects of integrating our work with the automaton model of Bird and Ellison (1994).

The reader is referred to Bird and Ellison (1994) for further details.

Equally, it has been argued that the phenomenon of heavy NP shift is a kind of syntaxphonology interaction that is simply stated in a constraint-based approach, where the linear precedence constraints of syntax are sensitive to the phonological category of weight (Bird 1992).
C92-1015
Work on overcoming this limitation is currently in progress, and builds on the well-known similarity between feature structures and automata, when viewed as directed graphs (Kasper and Rounds 1986).

As Emele and Zajac (1990) point out, this object-oriented approach brings a number of advantages to grammar writing, such as a high level of abstraction, inferential capacity and modularity.

In this section we give an overview of this automaton model and briefly outline the view of automata as types that was originally proposed in Bird (1992).

Rather, we believe a more constrained and linguistically appealing approach is to employ finite-state automata (FSAs) in preference to FSTS, since it has been shown how FSAS can encode autosegmental representations and a variety of constraints on those representations (Bird and Ellison 1994).

Reinhard and Gibbon 1991), the potential of typed feature structures for this area has barely been scratched so far.

We approach these challenges by adopting a formal, nonprocedural, nonlinear model of phonology and showing how it can be integrated into HPSG, following on the heels of recent work by the authors (Bird and Klein 1990; Bird 1992; Klein 1992).
