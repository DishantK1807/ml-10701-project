9The results for a210 a194a33a194a47a215a135a216a123a217 in Table 3 are slightly different from those listed in Table 6 of Choi 's paper (Choi, 2000).

In such a case, our model should be extended to incorporate various features such as the average segment length, clue words, named entities, and so on (Reynar, 1999; Beeferman et al., 1999).

Identifying and isolating topics by dividing documents, which is called text segmentation, is important for many natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Salton et al., 1996) and summarization (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).

An algorithm that can provide a solution for Step 2 will be a simpler version of the algorithm used to find the maximumprobability solution in Japanese morphological analysis (Nagata, 1994).

If a text segmentation system divides a given text into a relatively small number of segments, then a summary of the original text can be composed by combining summaries of the component segments (Kan et al., 1998; Nakao, 2000).

However, a207a32a208a33a208 and a207a32a208a33a208a38a220, which are implemented in C, run as fast as a210 a194a33a194 and a210 a194a33a194 a220, which are implemented in Java (Choi, 2000), due to the difference in programming languages.

Choi (2000) used the rank of the cosine, rather than the cosine itself, to measure the similarity of sentences.

Hearst (1994), for example, used only the similarity of word distributions in a given text to segment the text.

Reynar (1994) used word repetition as a measure of cohesion.

(Choi, 2000) Segmentation accuracy was measured by the probabilistic error metric a195 a92 proposed by Beeferman, et al.(1999).7 Low a195 a92 indicates high accuedges in the minimum-cost path, then the resulting segmentation often contains very small segments consisting of only one or two sentences.

Kozima (1993), for example, used cohesion based on the spreading activation on a semantic network.

A lot of research has been done on text segmentation (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994; Salton et al., 1996; Yaari, 1997; Kan et al., 1998; Choi, 2000; Nakao, 2000).

Hearst (1994) used the similarity of word distributions as measured by the cosine to gauge cohesion.

This data was used by Choi (2000) to compare various domain-independent text segmentation systems.6 He evaluated a133a26a186a62a186 (Choi, 2000), TextTiling (Hearst, 1994), DotPlot (Reynar, 1998), and Segmenter (Kan et al., 1998) by using the data and reported that a133a26a186a180a186 achieved the best performance among these systems.

Therefore, a solution can be obtained by applying a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm.4 DP algorithms have also been used for text segmentation by other researchers (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998).
