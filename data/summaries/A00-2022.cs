Subsumption and Equivalence Algorithms Our feature structure subsumption algorithm 2 assumes totally well-typed structures (Carpenter, 1992) and employs similar machinery to the quasi-destructive unification algorithm described by Tomabechi (1991).

Although the approach may have potential, the shifting of complex accounting into the unification algorithm is at variance with the findings of Kiefer et al.(1999), who report large speed-ups from the elimination of disjunction processing during unification.

recorded in the chart); this is achieved in a standard way by feature structure restriction (Shieber, 1985) applied to all passive edges.
P85-1018
The question is becoming increasingly important, though, as wide-coverage HPSG grammars are starting to be deployed in practical applications-for example for 'deep' analysis in the VerbMobil speech-to-speech translation system (Wahlster, 1997; Kiefer, Krieger, Carroll, & Malouf, 1999).

We used the LKB system (Copestake, 1992, 1999) as an experimentation platform since it provides a parameterisable bottom-up chart parser and precise, fine-grained profiling facilities (Oepen & Flickinger, 1998).

In related work, Miyao (1999) describes an approach to packing in which alternative feature structures are represented as packed, distributed disjunctions of feature structure fragments.
