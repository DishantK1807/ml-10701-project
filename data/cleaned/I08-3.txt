1:181	IJCNLP-08Workshop On NLPforLessPrivileged Languages ProceedingsoftheWorkshop 11January2008 IIIT, Hyderabad,India c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing ii Introduction Welcome to the IJCNLP Workshop on NLP for Less Privileged Languages, a meeting held in conjunction with the Third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing at Hyderabad, India.
2:181	The goal of this workshop is to ascertain the progress made in providing computational support for less computerized or less privileged languages and in building language resources and Natural Language Processing tools etc. for such languages.
3:181	An introductory article explains the background of and motivation for this workshop.
4:181	It also presents an overview of the papers selected for the workshop.
5:181	The workshop attracted a lot of interest from around the world.
6:181	There were a relatively large number of submissions and each paper was reviewed by three reviewers, which ensured that the quality of papers selected was comparable to other successful workshops held previously on similar themes.
7:181	The selected papers include a variety of topics and covers a wide range of languages.
8:181	Another major feature of the workshop is that it includes three invited talks by speakers from different regions of the world and on very different topics.
9:181	We would like to thank the program committee members for all the hard work that they did during the reviewing process.
10:181	We would also like to thank all the people involved in organizing the IJCNLP conference.
11:181	We hope that this workshop will be able to achieve its goal and will stimulate and encourage even more interest in the theme of the workshop so that the gap between languages like English and the less computerized less privileged or languages can be reduced at a rapid pace.

17:181	c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Building Language Resources: Ways to move forward Anne David and Michael Maxwell Center for Advanced Study of Language University of Maryland, USA aeadavid@gmail.com, maxwell@umiacs.umd.edu Abstract There are perhaps seven thousand languages in the world, ranging from the largest with hundreds of millions of speakers, to the smallest, with one speaker.
18:181	On a different axis, languages can be ranked according to the quantity and quality of computational resources.
19:181	Not surprisingly, there are correlations between these two axes: languages like English and Mandarin have substantial resources, while many of the smallest languages are completely undocumented.
20:181	Nevertheless, the correlation is not perfect; there are languages with a million speakers which are more or less unwritten, and there are very large languages  some of the languages of India, for example  which are relatively resource-poor.
21:181	Unfortunately, what counts as resource-rich (or even resource-adequate) in computational linguistics is a moving target.
22:181	For languages to move in the direction of resource richness, considerable effort (people and money) have to be provided over a prolonged period of time.
23:181	One can sit back and wait for this to happen, or give up; alternatively, one can map out a realistic way forward, building on the strengths of each languages situation.
24:181	Among the strengths which may prove useful to building computational resources for languages are the following:  Long traditions of grammatical and lexical description  Traditions of literacy and literature  Local expertise in linguistics and computing  The world-wide community of linguists and computer experts  Resource availability in related languages At the same time, there are weaknesses and other problems  some language specific, some more general  which need to be considered:  Lack of consensus on ways of representing the language (scripts, character encoding)  Complexities inherent in particular languages (complex scripts, complex morphologies, variant orthographies, diglossia, dialectal variation)  Economic and educational realities in the countries where the language is spoken  Political attitudes towards some languages, particularly minority languages  The 'not invented here' syndrome  Software obsolescence, and the potential obsolescence of language data This talk will look at ways in which the strengths enumerated above might be leveraged, while avoiding the potential weaknesses.

26:181	c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Cross Language Resource Sharing Virach Sornlertlamvanich Thai Computational Linguistics Lab., NICT Asia Research Center, Pathumthani, Thailand virach@tcllab.org  Abstract Language resource development is crucial for language study in current approaches.
27:181	Many efforts have been made to model a language on very large scaled corpora.
28:181	Statistical and probabilistic approaches are playing a major role in taking the advantage of incorporating the context to improve their performance to a promising result in many areas of natural language processing such as machine translation, parsing, POS tagging, morphological analysis, etc. It is believed that if there are sufficient corpora for a language, we can develop many efficient language processing applications within an expectable period.
29:181	However, corpus development is a labor intensive task and requires a continuous effort in maintaining the result to such a qualified level.
30:181	The problem is magnified when we need to deal with the less computerized languages.
31:181	The availability of the computerized language data can be varied by the availability of the standard of language encoding, number of speakers, economic scale of the speakers, and the language supporting tools.
32:181	As a result, the technology gap between languages are widened as we can see in the evidence of online language populations and web contents which are mainly occupied by English, and others major languages distributed in Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, German and French.
33:181	The major concern in the less computerized languages is how to leverage the technology for those languages which will result in scaling up the number of online language populations.
34:181	Cross language resource sharing is one of the efforts to increase the opportunity for the access to those languages.
35:181	We are expecting that a language may utilize the resource from other similar languages in terms of computational approaches and corpora.
36:181	To relate the language resources among the less computerized languages has brought us to the following open questions:  1.
37:181	Is there any intermediate representation that can efficiently relate among the languages?
38:181	Will it be an approach of meaning representation such as conceptual unit, WordNet, or etymological word form representation such as Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese character?
39:181	2.
40:181	Can a shallow language processing approach be used to increase the resources, namely orthographic conversion, transliteration?
41:181	3.
42:181	Will English be a good intermediate language?
43:181	This is because of the availability of the language pairing resources with the English language.
44:181	As a platform for cross language resource development, we have developed KUI (Knowledge Unifying Initiator: http://www.tcllab.org/kui) equipped with a voting function to measure for the most reliable translation.
45:181	The English language is not only a possible intermediate representation for languages.
46:181	Other appropriate approaches could be considered to maximize the resource sharing among the less computerized languages if we can determine a better common feature among those languages.

48:181	c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Breaking the Zipfian Barrier of NLP Monojit Choudhury Microsoft Research India, Bangalore monojit.choudhury@gmail.com        Abstract We know that the distribution of most of the linguistic entities (e.g. phones, words, grammar rules) follow a power law or the Zipf's law.
49:181	This makes NLP hard.
50:181	Interestingly, the distribution of speakers over the world, content over the web and linguistic resources available across languages also follow power law.
51:181	However, the correlation between the distribution of number of speakers to that of web content and linguistic resources is rather poor, and the latter distributions are much more skewed than the former.
52:181	In other words, there is a large volume of resources only for a very few languages and a large number of widely spoken languages, including all the Indian languages, have little or no linguistic resource at all.
53:181	This is a serious challenge for NLP in these languages, primarily because state-of-the-art techniques and tools in NLP are all data-driven.
54:181	I refer to this situation as the "Zipfian Barrier of NLP" and offer a mathematical analysis of the growth dynamics of the linguistic resources and NLP research worldwide, which, afterall, is very much a socio-economic process.
55:181	Based on the analysis and otherwise, I propose certain technical ( e.g. unsupervised learning, wiki based approaches to gather data) and community-wide (e.g. acceptance of language specific works and resource building projects in top NLP conferences/journals, Special Interest Groups) initiatives that could possibly break this Zipfian Barrier.

57:181	c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Natural Language Processing for Less Privileged Languages: Where do we come from?
58:181	Where are we going?
59:181	Anil Kumar Singh Language Technologies Research Centre IIIT, Hyderabad, India anil@research.iiit.ac.in Abstract In the context of the IJCNLP workshop on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Less Privileged Languages, we discuss the obstacles to research on such languages.
60:181	We also briefly discuss the ways to make progress in removing these obstacles.
61:181	We mention some previous work and comment on the papers selected for the workshop.
62:181	1 Introduction While computing has become ubiquitous in the developed regions, its spread in other areas such as Asia is more recent.
63:181	However, despite the fact that Asia is a dense area in terms of linguistic diversity (or perhaps because of it), many Asian languages are inadequately supported on computers.
64:181	Even basic NLP tools are not available for these languages.
65:181	This also has a social cost.
66:181	NLP or Computational Linguistics (CL) based technologies are now becoming important and future intelligent systems will use more of these techniques.
67:181	Most of NLP/CL tools and technologies are tailored for English or European languages.
68:181	Recently, there has been a rapid growth of IT industry in many Asian countries.
69:181	This is now the perfect time to reduce the linguistic, computational and computational linguistics gap between the more privileged and less privileged languages.
70:181	The IJCNLP workshop on NLP for Less Privileged Language is aimed at bridging this gap.
71:181	Only when a basic infrastructure for supporting regional languages becomes available can we hope for a more equitable availability of opportunities made possible by the language technology.
72:181	There have already been attempts in this direction and this workshop will hopefully take them further.
73:181	Figure-1 shows one possible view of the computational infrastructure needed for language processing for a particular language, or more preferably, for a set of related languages.
74:181	In this paper, we will first discuss various aspects of the problem.
75:181	We will then look back at the work already done.
76:181	After that, we will present some suggestion for future work.
77:181	But we will begin by addressing a minor issue: the terminology.
78:181	2 Terminology There can be a debate about the correct term for the languages on which this workshop focuses.
79:181	There are at least four candidates: less studied (LS) languages, resource scarce (RS) languages, less computerized (LC) languages, and less privileged (LP) languages.
80:181	Out of these, two (LS and RS) are too narrow for our purposes.
81:181	LC is admittedly more objective, but it also is somewhat narrow in the sense that it does not cover the lack of resources for creating resources (finance) and the lack of linguistic study.
82:181	We have used LP because it is more general and covers all the aspects of the problem.
83:181	However, it might be preferable to use LC in many contexts.
84:181	As the common element among all these terms is the adjective less (resoure scarce can be paraphrased as with less resources), perhaps we can avoid the terminological debate by calling the languages covered by any such terms as the Llanguages.

86:181	Components like encoding converters are needed for language with less standardization, such as the South Asian languages.
87:181	Language resources like lexicon, corpora etc. have not been shown in this figure.
88:181	3 Problems Not surprisingly, the terms mentioned in the previous section cover different aspects of the problems that restrict work on and for these languages.
89:181	There is a lack of something and each of those terms covers some part of what is lacking.
90:181	3.1 Linguistic Study The term LS languages indicates that these are not well studied linguistically.
91:181	The sheer amount of linguistic analysis available for English is so huge that the linguistic work on even a language like Hindi, which is spoken or understood by a billion people, is simply not comparable.
92:181	For languages (or dialects) like Santali or Manipuri, the situation is much worse.
93:181	And there are a large number of languages which have been studied even less than Santali or Manipuri.
94:181	There are dozens (more accurately, hundreds) of such languages in South Asia alone1.
95:181	It can be said that very little is known about the majority of languages of the world, many of which are facing extinction.
96:181	3.2 Language Resources Even those languages which have been studied to a good extent, e.g. Telugu, lack language resources, e.g. a large dictionary in machine readable form, let alone resources like WordNet or FrameNet, although efforts are being made to develop resources for some of these languages.
97:181	The term RS covers this aspect of the problem.
98:181	3.3 Computerization Computerization, in general, might include machine readable language resources and NLP tools etc., but here we will restrict the meaning of this term to the support for languages that is provided on computers, either as part of operating systems, or in the commonly used applications such as word processors.
99:181	In the narrowest sense, computerization means language-encoding support.
100:181	Even this level of support is currently not available (or is inadequate) for a large number of languages.
101:181	3.4 Language Processing Proper computerization (in the restricted sense) is a prerequisite to effective language processing.
102:181	But even without adequate computerization, attempts are being made towards making language processing possible for the L-languages.
103:181	However, language processing for the L-languages is still far behind that for English.
104:181	For a large number of language it is, in fact, non-existent.
105:181	This is true even for a language like Gujarati, which is the official language of the state of Gujarat in India and is recognized as a scheduled language by the government of India.
106:181	And it is actually used as the first language by the people of Gujarat, which is one of the larger states in India.
107:181	While adequate computerization may be easy to achieve in the near future, at least theoretically, language processing (and building language resources) is going to be much more difficult task.
108:181	1Ethnologue: http://www.ethnologue.com/web.asp 8 NLP /CL LinguisticStudy Computerization LessPrivileged (Finance,HumanResources, Equipment,Socio-PoliticalSupport,etc.) NLP /CL LinguisticStudy Computerization OtherPrivileges MorePrivileged Source Destination Figure 2: The four dimensions of the problem: The Source is where we come from and Destination is where we are going.
109:181	The problem is to go from the Source to the Destination and the solution is non-trivial.
110:181	3.5 Other Privileges One of the major reasons why building language resources and providing language processing capabilities for the L-languages is going to be a very difficult task is the fact that these languages lack the privileges which make it possible to build language resources and NLP/CL tools.
111:181	By privileges we mean the availability of finance, equipment, human resources, and even political and social support for reducing the lack of computing and language processing support for the L-languages.
112:181	The lack of such privileges may be the single biggest reason which is holding back the progress towards providing computing and language processing support for these languages.
113:181	4 Some (Partially) Successful Efforts The problem seems to be insurmountable, but there has been some progress.
114:181	More importantly, the urgency of solving this problem (even if partially) is being realized by more and more people.
115:181	Some recent events or efforts which tried to address the problem and which have had some impact in improving the situation are:  The LREC conferences and workshops2.
116:181	 Workshop on Shallow Parsing in South Asian Languages, IJCAI-07, India.
117:181	2www.lrec-conf.org  EMELD and the Digital Tools Summit in Linguistics, 2006, USA.
118:181	 Workshop on Language Resources for European Minority Languages, 1998, Spain.
119:181	 Projects supported by ELRA on the Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) that targets the specifications of a minimal kits for each language to support NLP tools development3.
120:181	 There is also a corresponding project at LDC (the Less Commonly Taught Languages4).
121:181	 The IJCNLP Workshop on Named Entity Recognition for South and South Asian Languages5.
122:181	This list is, of course, not exhaustive.
123:181	There are many papers relevant to the theme of this workshop at the IJCNLP 2008 main conference6, as at some previous major conferences.
124:181	There is also a very relevant tutorial (Mihalcea, 2008) at the IJCNLP 2008 conference about building resources and tools for languages with scarce resources.
125:181	Even the industry is realizing the importance of providing computing support for some of the Llanguages.
126:181	In the last few years there have been many announcements about the addition of some 3http://www.elda.org/blark 4http://projects.ldc.upenn.edu/LCTL 5http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/ 6http://ijcnlp2008.org 9 such language to a product or a service and also of the addition of better facilities (input methods, transliteration, search) in an existing product or service for some L-language.
127:181	5 Towards a Solution Since the problem is very much like the conservation of the Earths environment, there is no easy solution.
128:181	It is not even evident that a complete solution is possible.
129:181	However, we can still try for the best possible solution.
130:181	Such a solution should have some prerequisites.
131:181	As Figure-2 shows, the other privileges dimension of the problem has to be a major element of the solution, but it is not something over which researchers and developers have much control.
132:181	This means that we will have to find ways to work even with very little of these other privileges.
133:181	This is the key point that we want to make in this paper because it implies that the methods that have been used for English (a language with almost unlimited privileges) may not be applicable for the L-languages.
134:181	Many of these methods assume the availability of certain things which simply cannot be assumed for the L-languages.
135:181	For example, there is no reasonable ground to assume that there will be (in the near future) corpus even with shallow levels of annotation for Avadhi or Dogri or Konkani, let alone a treebank like resource.
136:181	Therefore, we have to look for methods which can work with unannotated corpus.
137:181	Moreover, these methods should also not require a lot of work from trained linguists because such linguists may not be available to work on these languages.
138:181	There is one approach, however, that can still allow us to build resources and tools for these languages.
139:181	This is the approach of adapting the resources of a linguistically close but more privileged language.
140:181	It is this area which needs to be studied and explored more thoroughly because it seems to be the only practical way to make the kind of progress that is required urgently.
141:181	The process of resource adaptation will have to studied from linguistic, computational, and other practical points of view.
142:181	Since other privileges are a major factor as discussed earlier, some ways of calculating the cost of adaptation have also to be found.
143:181	Another very general but important point is that we will have to build multilingual systems as far as possible so that the cost per language is reduced.
144:181	This will require innovation in terms of modeling as well as engineering.
145:181	6 Some Comments about the Workshop The scope of the workshop included topics such as the following:  Archiving and creation of interoperable data and metadata for less privileged languages  Support for less privileged language on computers.
146:181	This includes input methods, display, fonts, encoding converters, spell checkers, more linguistically aware text editors etc.  Basic NLP tools such as sentence marker, tokenizer, morphological analyzer, transliteration tools, language and encoding identifiers etc.  Advanced NLP tools such as POS taggers, local word grouper, approximate string search, tools for developing language resources.
147:181	There were a relatively large number of submissions to the workshop and the overall quality was at least above average.
148:181	The most noteworthy fact is that the variety of papers submitted (and selected) was pleasantly surprising.
149:181	The workshop includes paper on topics as diverse as Machine Translation (MT) from text to sign language (an L-language on which very few people have worked) to MT from speech to speech.
150:181	And from segmentation and stemming to parser adaptation.
151:181	Also, from input methods, text editor and interfaces to part of speech (POS) tagger.
152:181	The variety is also remarkable in terms of the languages covered and research locations.
153:181	In addition, the workshop includes three invited talks: the first on building language resources by resource adaptation (David and Maxwell, 2008); the second on cross-language resource sharing (Sornlertlamvanich, 2008b); and the third on breaking the Zipfian barrier in NLP (Choudhury, 2008).
154:181	It can be said that the workshop has been a moderate success.
155:181	We hope it will stimulate further work in this direction.
156:181	10 7 An Overview of the Papers We noted above that resource adaptation needs a lot more study.
157:181	In one of the papers at the workshop, Zeman and Resnik presented their work on cross-language parser adaptation between related languages, which can be highly relevant for the L-languages in linguistic areas (Emeneau, 1956; Emeneau, 1980).
158:181	Maxwell and David suggest a better way to weave together a descriptive grammar with a formal grammar through collaboration between linguists and computer scientists.
159:181	Alegria et al. discuss the strategies for sustainable MT for Basque.
160:181	They suggest that the main elements of such a strategy should be incremental design, reusability, standardization and open source development.
161:181	Among the papers which focus more on computerization and building of tools, Sornlertlamvanich et al. present a ubiquitous system called KUI for collective intelligence development.
162:181	Goonetilleke et al. describe a predictive text input system called SriShell Primo for Sinhala language.
163:181	Veeraraghavan and Roy describe a text editor and a framework for working with Indic scripts.
164:181	Aggarwal and Dave present an implementation of a speech recognition system interface for Indian languages.
165:181	Riza presents brief overview of the literature on language endangerment, with focus on the Indonesian languages.
166:181	Some other papers focused more on linguistic study as applied for computational purposes.
167:181	Among them, Ali et al. investigate the optimal order of factors for the computational treatment of personal anaphoric devices in Urdu discourse.

176:181	8 Conclusion We discussed the problem of the lack of linguistic study, language resources, NLP tools for some languages, which we called the L-languages since they less of something.
177:181	We argued that the other privileges form another dimension of the problem and are a crucial factor in deciding what methods we should use to solve this problem.
178:181	The technical has to take into account this non-technical factor.
179:181	We suggested that resource adaptation may be one to move forward.
180:181	Finally we made some comments about the NLPLPL-08 workshop.
