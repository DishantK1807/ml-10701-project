Finally the valence of WordNet synsets, taken from SentiWordNet scores (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006), was added to the corresponding lemmata. SentiWordNet is a lexical resource in which each WordNet synset is associated to three numerical scores: Obj(s), Pos(s) and Neg(s). These scores represent th</context>

Different emotion intensity realizations of the same message are obtained only via facial expression, see for example (Guerini et al., 2007). With Valentino the pre-compiled text can be automatically valenced according to emotion intensity, augmenting the output effect. 6.

This choice is performed by using lists of persuasive words that we collected from a CORpus of tagged Political Speeches (CORPS), see (Guerini et al., 2008). If the valence coefficient for the final expression is negative then the “negativefocus” words list is accessed, if it is positive then the “negative-focus” words list is accessed. Next, the candid</context>
