The MDA system developed at XRCE (Dymetman et al., 2000; Brun et al., 2000) uses a formalism inspired from Definite Clause Grammars (Pereira and Warren, 1980) that encodes both the abstract semantic syntax of well-formed documents and the concrete syntax for the documents in several languages.5 MDA grammars contain the definition of semantic objects of a given semantic type, which are used to build typed abstract semantic trees.

Details on the implementation using MDA grammars have been described elsewhere (Max, 2003a; Max, 2003b).

We have identified a domain of application, document normalization, where text interpretation can be limited in many cases to the interpretation of a text in terms of the communicative goals it conveys (Max, 2003a).

The system presented in (Brun and Hag`ege, 2003) derives normalized predicates encoding the meaning of documents from semantic dependencies found by a robust parser.

(Blanchon, 2002)), thus not giving too much importance to syntactic structure.
C02-1170
We have advocated an interactive approach to text understanding (Dymetman et al., 2003) where the input text is used as a source of information to assist the user in re-authoring its content.
