On each relevant rule we need a feature on the mother and the distinguished daughter, here called store, following the terminology of Engelkamp, Erbach, and Uskoreit (1992), and threading features, in and out or their equivalent, on the relevant sister constituents.
P92-1026
In the case that the members of the set in question are categories, then some new atomic feature values have to be invented to represent these, as is often necessary in other contexts also (Engelkamp, Erbach, and Uskoreit 1992).

A unification-based formalism has many well-known virtues: it is declarative, monotonic, reversible (in principle at least); it has a well-understood formal interpretation (Shieber 1986, Smolka 1992, Johnson 1988); and there exist well-understood and relatively efficient parsing and generation algorithms for grammars using such a formalism (Shieber 1988; Haas 1989; Alshawi 1992; Shieber et al.1990, inter alia).

Ramsay (1990) shows how some instances of disjunction can be avoided, but there are nevertheless many occasions on which the natural analysis of some phenomenon is in terms of Boolean combinations of values.
J90-3004
It originates with Pereira (1981) and has been used to implement wh-movement and other unbounded dependencies in several large grammars of English (Bobrow, Ingria, and Stallard 1991; Pulman 1992).
H91-1033 J81-4003
There are several techniques for compiling certain kinds of hierarchy into terms checkable by unification: Mellish (1988) describes them.

1. Introduction Formalisms equivalent to, or based on, unification grammars of the type exemplified by PATR (Shieber 1984) are very widely used in computational linguistics (Alshawi 1992; van Noord et al.1990; Briscoe et al.1987; Bobrow, Ingria, and Stallard 1991, etc).
H91-1033 J90-1004 P84-1075
Briscoe et al.1987; Arnold et al.1986) Kleene operators have been included.
C86-1071
Some implementations (e.g., Karttunen 1986) build threading into the grammar compiler directly, but this can lead to inefficiency if features are threaded where they are never used.
C86-1016
In a formalism like that in Arnold et al.(1986), grammarians write rules like the following, with the intent of capturing the fact that an Nbar can be preceded by an indefinite number of Adjective Phrases provided that (in French, for example) they agree in gender, etc., with the Nbar: iap:{agr=A} ==> \[ .... adjp : {agr=A}*, nbar : {agr=A}\] This is presumably intended to mean that if an AdjP is present, with agr instantiated to some value, then succeeding instances of AdjP must have agr bound to the same value, as must the Nbar.
C86-1071
This has been most recently illustrated within the HPSG formalism by Engelkamp, Erbach, and Uskoreit (1992).
P92-1026
One extremely useful technique, although restricted to Boolean combinations of atomic values, is described by Mellish (1988).
