6. Semantic Parallelism (Lappin and Leass, 1994): This heuristic gives preference to those noun phrases which have the same semantic role as the anaphor in question.
J94-4002
Definiteness (Lappin and Leass, 1994): According to this heuristic, nouns that are preceded by a demonstrative pronoun or a definite article are more likely to be antecedents and are awarded higher credibilities.
J94-4002
4. Syntactic Parallelism (Lappin and Leass, 1994): As per this heuristic, preference is given to noun phrases with the same syntactic function as the anaphor.

ROSANA, an algorithm for anaphora resolution that focuses on robustness against information deficiency in the parsed output, is described in (Stuckardt, 2001).
J01-4002
3. Pleonastic (Lappin and Leass, 1994): This heuristic is based on the observation that there exist some syntactic patterns such that every it anaphor occurring in any of those patterns must be pleonastic.
J94-4002
2. Non-prepositional NP (Lappin and Leass, 1994): This heuristic states that a noun phrase which occurs within a prepositional phrase is less probable to be an antecedent to an anaphor and consequently, it is awarded less credibility.

(Hirst, 1981) discusses several early approaches to anaphora resolution in discourses.

J94-4002 P98-2143
(Denber, 1998) and (Lappin and Leass, 1994) describe several syntactic heuristics for reflexive, reciprocal and pleonastic anaphora, among others.
J94-4002
(Ng and Cardie, 2002) proposes a machine learning approach to Anaphora Resolution but generally statistical learning approaches suffer from the problems of small corpuses and corpus dependent learning.
W02-1008
Often domain-specific heuristics are used for anaphora resolution and fine tuned to perform well on a limited corpus, such as in (Mitkov, 1998).
P98-2143
A more general and comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art in anaphora resolution is given in (Mitkov, 1999) and also in (Mitkov et al., 2001).
