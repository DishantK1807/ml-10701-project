Cheng et al.(2006) also reported that the use of neighboring dependency attachment tagger enhance the unlabeled attachment scores from 84.38 to 84.6 for 13 languages.

Description Over the past decades, many state-of-the-art parsing algorithm were proposed, such as head-word lexicalized PCFG (Collins, 1998), Maximum Entropy (Charniak, 2000), Maximum/Minimum spanning tree (MST) (McDonald et al., 2005), shift-reduce-based deterministic parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Chang et al., 2006; Nivre, 2003).

A simple solution is to adopt an exhaustive post-processing step for the unparsed words in the stack (details in (Wu et al., 2006a, 2006b)).

As conventional sequential tagging problems, such part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking, we employ the conditional random fields (CRF) as learners (Kudo et al., 2004).

In our pilot study, the use of approximate-polynomial kernel (Wu et al., 2007) outperforms the linear kernel SVM in Chinese and Arabic.

In this year, CoNLL-2007 shared task (Nivre et al., 2007) focuses on multilingual dependency parsing based on ten different languages (Hajic et al., 2004; Aduriz et al., 2003; Martí et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2003; Böhmova et al., 2003; Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Prokopidis et al., 2005; Czendes et al., 2005; Montemagni et al., 2003; Oflazer et al., 2003) and domain adaptation for English (Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Kulick et al., 2004; MacWhinney, 2000; Brown, 1973) without taking the languagespecific knowledge into consideration.

Result 3.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metrics The testing data is provided by the (Nivre et al., 2007) which consists of 10 language treebanks.

Now we compare the adopted parsing algorithm in this year to the one we employed last year (Wu et al., 2006a).

Usually, it is the case that the select features are fixed and could not be tuned to capture the second order features (McDonald et al., 2006).
W06-2932
As observed by (Isozaki et al., 2004), incorporating both top-down (root find) and bottomup (base-NP) can yield better improvement over the Yamada’s parsing algorithm.
C04-1040
In addition, we also apply the Maltparser 0.4, which is implemented with the Nivre’s algorithm (Nivre et al., 2006) to be compared.
