1:149	LexPageRank: Prestige in Multi-Document Text Summarization Gunes Erkana0, Dragomir R. Radeva0a2a1 a3 a0 Department of EECS, a3 School of Information University of Michigan a4 gerkan,radev a5 @umich.edu Abstract Multidocument extractive summarization relies on the concept of sentence centrality to identify the most important sentences in a document.
2:149	Centrality is typically defined in terms of the presence of particular important words or in terms of similarity to a centroid pseudo-sentence.
3:149	We are now considering an approach for computing sentence importance based on the concept of eigenvector centrality (prestige) that we call LexPageRank.
4:149	In this model, a sentence connectivity matrix is constructed based on cosine similarity.
5:149	If the cosine similarity between two sentences exceeds a particular predefined threshold, a corresponding edge is added to the connectivity matrix.
6:149	We provide an evaluation of our method on DUC 2004 data.
7:149	The results show that our approach outperforms centroid-based summarization and is quite successful compared to other summarization systems.
8:149	1 Introduction Text summarization is the process of automatically creating a compressed version of a given text that provides useful information for the user.
9:149	In this paper, we focus on multi-document generic text summarization, where the goal is to produce a summary of multiple documents about the same, but unspecified topic.
10:149	Our summarization approach is to assess the centrality of each sentence in a cluster and include the most important ones in the summary.
11:149	In Section 2, we present centroid-based summarization, a wellknown method for judging sentence centrality.
12:149	Then we introduce two new measures for centrality, Degree and LexPageRank, inspired from the prestige concept in social networks and based on our new approach.
13:149	We compare our new methods and centroidbased summarization using a feature-based generic summarization toolkit, MEAD, and show that new features outperform Centroid in most of the cases.
14:149	Test data for our experiments is taken from Document Understanding Conferences (DUC) 2004 summarization evaluation to compare our system also with other state-of-the-art summarization systems.
15:149	2 Sentence centrality and centroid-based summarization Extractive summarization produces summaries by choosing a subset of the sentences in the original documents.
16:149	This process can be viewed as choosing the most central sentences in a (multi-document) cluster that give the necessary and enough amount of information related to the main theme of the cluster.
17:149	Centrality of a sentence is often defined in terms of the centrality of the words that it contains.
18:149	A common way of assessing word centrality is to look at the centroid.
19:149	The centroid of a cluster is a pseudodocument which consists of words that have frequency*IDF scores above a predefined threshold.
20:149	In centroid-based summarization (Radev et al. , 2000), the sentences that contain more words from the centroid of the cluster are considered as central.
21:149	Formally, the centroid score of a sentence is the cosine of the angle between the centroid vector of the whole cluster and the individual centroid of the sentence.
22:149	This is a measure of how close the sentence is to the centroid of the cluster.
23:149	Centroid-based summarization has given promising results in the past (Radev et al. , 2001).
24:149	3 Prestige-based sentence centrality In this section, we propose a new method to measure sentence centrality based on prestige in social networks, which has also inspired many ideas in the computer networks and information retrieval.
25:149	A cluster of documents can be viewed as a network of sentences that are related to each other.
26:149	Some sentences are more similar to each other while some others may share only a little information with the rest of the sentences.
27:149	We hypothesize that the sentences that are similar to many of the other sentences in a cluster are more central (or prestigious) to the topic.
28:149	There are two points to clarify in this definition of centrality.
29:149	First is how to define similarity between two sentences.
30:149	Second is how to compute the overall prestige of a sentence given its similarity to other sentences.
31:149	For the similarity metric, we use cosine.
32:149	A cluster may be represented by a cosine similarity matrix where each entry in the matrix is the similarity between the corresponding sentence pair.
33:149	Figure 1 shows a subset of a cluster used in DUC 2004, and the corresponding cosine similarity matrix.
34:149	Sentence ID da0 sa1 indicates the a1 th sentence in the a0 th document.
35:149	In the following sections, we discuss two methods to compute sentence prestige using this matrix.
36:149	3.1 Degree centrality In a cluster of related documents, many of the sentences are expected to be somewhat similar to each other since they are all about the same topic.
37:149	This can be seen in Figure 1 where the majority of the values in the similarity matrix are nonzero.
38:149	Since we are interested in significant similarities, we can eliminate some low values in this matrix by defining a threshold so that the cluster can be viewed as an (undirected) graph, where each sentence of the cluster is a node, and significantly similar sentences are connected to each other.
39:149	Figure 2 shows the graphs that correspond to the adjacency matrix derived by assuming the pair of sentences that have a similarity above a2a4a3a6a5a8a7a9a2a4a3a11a10a12a7 and a2a4a3a11a13, respectively, in Figure 1 are similar to each other.
40:149	We define degree centrality as the degree of each node in the similarity graph.
41:149	As seen in Table 1, the choice of cosine threshold dramatically influences the interpretation of centrality.
42:149	Too low thresholds may mistakenly take weak similarities into consideration while too high thresholds may lose much of the similarity relations in a cluster.
43:149	ID Degree (0.1) Degree (0.2) Degree (0.3) d1s1 4 3 1 d2s1 6 2 1 d2s2 1 0 0 d2s3 5 2 0 d3s1 4 1 0 d3s2 6 3 0 d3s3 1 1 0 d4s1 8 4 0 d5s1 4 3 1 d5s2 5 3 0 d5s3 4 1 1 Table 1: Degree centrality scores for the graphs in Figure 2.
44:149	Sentence d4s1 is the most central sentence for thresholds 0.1 and 0.2.
45:149	3.2 Eigenvector centrality and LexPageRank When computing degree centrality, we have treated each edge as a vote to determine the overall prestige value of each node.
46:149	This is a totally democratic method where each vote counts the same.
47:149	However, this may have a negative effect in the quality of the summaries in some cases where several unwanted sentences vote for each and raise their prestiges.
48:149	As an extreme example, consider a noisy cluster where all the documents are related to each other, but only one of them is about a somewhat different topic.
49:149	Obviously, we wouldnt want any of the sentences in the unrelated document to be included in a generic summary of the cluster.
50:149	However, assume that the unrelated document contains some sentences that are very prestigious considering only the votes in that document.
51:149	These sentences will get artificially high centrality scores by the local votes from a specific set of sentences.
52:149	This situation can be avoided by considering where the votes come from and taking the prestige of the voting node into account in weighting each vote.
53:149	Our approach is inspired by a similar idea used in computing web page prestiges.
54:149	One of the most successful applications of prestige is PageRank (Page et al. , 1998), the underlying technology behind the Google search engine.
55:149	PageRank is a method proposed for assigning a prestige score to each page in the Web independent of a specific query.
56:149	In PageRank, the score of a page is determined depending on the number of pages that link to that page as well as the individual scores of the linking pages.
57:149	More formally, the PageRank of a page a14 is given as follows: PRa15a16a14a18a17a20a19a21a15a22a5a24a23a26a25a27a17a29a28a30a25a31a15 PRa15a33a32 a0 a17 Ca15a33a32 a0 a17 a28a34a3a35a3a35a3a36a28 PRa15a33a32a24a37a31a17 Ca15a33a32 a37 a17 a17 (1) where a32 a0 a3a35a3a35a3a32 a37 are pages that link to a14, Ca15a33a32a39a38a40a17 is the number of outgoing links from page a32a41a38, and a25 is the damping factor which can be set between a2 and a5.
58:149	This recursively defined value can be computed by forming the binary adjacency matrix, a42, of the Web, where a42a43a15a16a44a41a7a9a45a27a17a46a19a47a5 if there is a link from page a44 to page a45, normalizing this matrix so that row sums equal to a5, and finding the principal eigenvector of the normalized matrix.
59:149	PageRank for a48 th page equals to the a48 th entry in the eigenvector.
60:149	Principal eigenvector of a matrix can be computed with a simple iterative power method.
61:149	This method can be directly applied to the cosine similarity graph to find the most prestigious sentences in a document.
62:149	We use PageRank to weight each vote so that a vote that comes from a more prestigious sentence has a greater value in the centrality of a sentence.
63:149	Note that unlike the original PageRank method, the graph is undirected since cosine similarity is a symmetric relation.
64:149	However, SNo ID Text 1 d1s1 Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan announced today, Sunday, that Iraq refuses to back down from its decision to stop cooperating with disarmament inspectors before its demands are met.
65:149	2 d2s1 Iraqi Vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan announced today, Thursday, that Iraq rejects cooperating with the United Nations except on the issue of lifting the blockade imposed upon it since the year 1990.
66:149	3 d2s2 Ramadan told reporters in Baghdad that Iraq cannot deal positively with whoever represents the Security Council unless there was a clear stance on the issue of lifting the blockade off of it.
67:149	4 d2s3 Baghdad had decided late last October to completely cease cooperating with the inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), in charge of disarming Iraqs weapons, and whose work became very limited since the fifth of August, and announced it will not resume its cooperation with the Commission even if it were subjected to a military operation.
68:149	5 d3s1 The Russian Foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, warned today, Wednesday against using force against Iraq, which will destroy, according to him, seven years of difficult diplomatic work and will complicate the regional situation in the area.
69:149	6 d3s2 Ivanov contended that carrying out air strikes against Iraq, who refuses to cooperate with the United Nations inspectors, will end the tremendous work achieved by the international group during the past seven years and will complicate the situation in the region. 7 d3s3 Nevertheless, Ivanov stressed that Baghdad must resume working with the Special Commission in charge of disarming the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (UNSCOM).
70:149	8 d4s1 The Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Baghdad, Prakash Shah, announced today, Wednesday, after meeting with the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, that Iraq refuses to back down from its decision to cut off cooperation with the disarmament inspectors.
71:149	9 d5s1 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said today, Sunday, that the crisis between the international community and Iraq did not end and that Britain is still ready, prepared, and able to strike Iraq. 10 d5s2 In a gathering with the press held at the Prime Ministers office, Blair contended that the crisis with Iraq will not end until Iraq has absolutely and unconditionally respected its commitments towards the United Nations.
72:149	11 d5s3 A spokesman for Tony Blair had indicated that the British Prime Minister gave permission to British Air Force Tornado planes stationed in Kuwait to join the aerial bombardment against Iraq.

74:149	this does not make any difference in the computation of the principal eigenvector.
75:149	We call this new measure of sentence similarity lexical PageRank, or LexPageRank.
76:149	Table 3 shows the LexPageRank scores for the graphs in Figure 2 setting the damping factor to a5 . For comparison, Centroid score for each sentence is also shown in the table.
77:149	All the numbers are normalized so that the highest ranked sentence gets the score a5 . It is obvious from the figures that threshold choice affects the LexPageRank rankings of some sentences.

79:149	3.3 Comparison with Centroid The graph-based centrality approach we have introduced has several advantages over Centroid.

81:149	all, it accounts for information subsumption among sentences.
82:149	If the information content of a sentence subsumes another sentence in a cluster, it is naturally preferred to include the one that contains more information in the summary.
83:149	The degree of a node in the cosine similarity graph is an indication of how much common information the sentence has with other sentences.
84:149	Sentence d4s1 in Figure 1 gets the highest score since it almost subsumes the information in the first two sentences of the cluster and has some common information with others.
85:149	Another advantage is that it prevents unnaturally high IDF scores from boosting up the score of a sentence that is unrelated to the topic.
86:149	Although the frequency of the words are taken into account while computing the Centroid score, a sentence that contains many rare words with high IDF values may get a high Centroid score even if the words do not occur elsewhere in the cluster.
87:149	4 Experiments on DUC 2004 data 4.1 DUC 2004 data and ROUGE We used DUC 2004 data in our experiments.
88:149	There are 2 generic summarization tasks (Tasks 2, 4a, and 4b) in DUC 2004 which are appropriate for the purpose of testing our new feature, LexPageRank.
89:149	Task 2 involves summarization of 50 TDT English clusters.
90:149	The goal of Task 4 is to produce summaries of machine translation output (in English) of 24 Arabic TDT documents.
91:149	For evaluation, we used the new automatic summary evaluation metric, ROUGE1, which was used for the first time in DUC 2004.
92:149	ROUGE is a recallbased metric for fixed-length summaries which is based on n-gram co-occurence.
93:149	It reports separate scores for 1, 2, 3, and 4-gram, and also for longest common subsequence co-occurences.
94:149	Among these different scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) has been shown to agree with human 1http://www.isi.edu/cyl/ROUGE judgements most (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
95:149	We show three of the ROUGE metrics in our experiment results: ROUGE-1 (unigram-based), ROUGE-2 (bigram-based), and ROUGE-W (based on longest common subsequence weighted by the length).
96:149	There are 8 different human judges for DUC 2004 Task 2, and 4 for DUC 2004 Task 4.
97:149	However, a subset of exactly 4 different human judges produced model summaries for any given cluster.
98:149	ROUGE requires a limit on the length of the summaries to be able to make a fair evaluation.
99:149	To stick with the DUC 2004 specifications and to be able to compare our system with human summaries and as well as with other DUC participants, we produced 665-byte summaries for each cluster and computed ROUGE scores against human summaries.
100:149	4.2 MEAD summarization toolkit MEAD2 is a publicly available toolkit for extractive multi-document summarization.
101:149	Although it comes as a centroid-based summarization system by default, its feature set can be extended to implement other methods.
102:149	The MEAD summarizer consists of three components.
103:149	During the first step, the feature extractor, each sentence in the input document (or cluster of documents) is converted into a feature vector using the user-defined features.
104:149	Second, the feature vector is converted to a scalar value using the combiner.
105:149	At the last stage known as the reranker, the scores for sentences included in related pairs are adjusted upwards or downwards based on the type of relation between the sentences in the pair.
106:149	Reranker penalizes the sentences that are similar to the sentences already included in the summary so that a better information coverage is achieved.
107:149	Three default features that comes with the MEAD distribution are Centroid, Position and Length.
108:149	Position is the normalized value of the position of a sentence in the document such that the first sentence of a document gets the maximum Position value of 1, and the last sentence gets the value 0.
109:149	Length is not a real feature score, but a cutoff value that ignores the sentences shorter than the given threshold.
110:149	Several rerankers are implemented in MEAD.
111:149	We observed the best results with Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) reranker and the default reranker of the system based on Cross-Sentence Informational Subsumption (CSIS) (Radev, 2000).
112:149	All of our experiments shown in Section 4.3 use CSIS reranker.
113:149	A MEAD policy is a combination of three components: (a) the command lines for all features, (b) 2http://www.summarization.com feature LexPageRank LexPageRank.pl 0.2 Centroid 1 Position 1 LengthCutoff 9 LexPageRank 1 mmr-reranker-word.pl 0.5 MEAD-cosine enidf Figure 4: Sample MEAD policy.
114:149	the formula for converting the feature vector to a scalar, and (c) the command line for the reranker.
115:149	A sample policy might be the one shown in Figure 4.
116:149	This example indicates the three default MEAD features (Centroid, Position, LengthCutoff), and our new LexPageRank feature used in our experiments.
117:149	Our LexPageRank implementation requires the cosine similarity threshold, a2a4a3a11a10 in the example, as an argument.
118:149	Each number next to a feature name shows the relative weight of that feature (except for LengthCutoff where the number 9 indicates the threshold for selecting a sentence based on the number of the words in the sentence).
119:149	The reranker in the example is a word-based MMR reranker with a cosine similarity threshold, 0.5.
120:149	4.3 Results and discussion We implemented the Degree and LexPageRank methods, and integrated into the MEAD system as new features.
121:149	We normalize each feature so that the sentence with the maximum score gets the value 1.

123:149	We fixed Length cutoff at 9, and the weight of the Position feature at 1 in all of the policies.
124:149	We did not try a weight higher than 2.0 for any of the features since our earlier observations on MEAD showed that too high feature weights results in poor summaries.
125:149	Table 2 and Table 3 show the ROUGE scores we have got in the experiments with using LexPageRank, Degree, and Centroid in Tasks 2 and 4, respectively, sorted by ROUGE-1 scores.
126:149	lprXTY indicates a policy in which the weight for LexPageRank is a0 and a1 is used as threshold.
127:149	degreeXTY is similar except that degree of a node in the similarity graph is used instead of its LexPageRank score.
128:149	Finally, CX shows a policy with Centroid weight a0 . We also include two baselines for each data set.
129:149	random indicates a method where we have picked random sentences from the cluster to produce a summary.
130:149	We have performed five random runs for each data set.
131:149	The results in the tables are for the median runs.
132:149	Second baseline, shown as lead-based in the tables, is using only the Position feature without any centrality method.
133:149	This is tantamount to producing lead-based summaries, which is a widely used and very challenging baseline in the text summarization community (Brandow et al. , 1995).
134:149	The top scores we have got in all data sets come from our new methods.
135:149	The results provide strong evidence that Degree and LexPageRank are better than Centroid in multi-document generic text summarization.
136:149	However, it is hard to say that Degree and LexPageRank are significantly different from each other.
137:149	This is an indication that Degree may already be a good enough measure to assess the centrality of a node in the similarity graph.
138:149	Considering the relatively low complexity of degree centrality, it still serves as a plausible alternative when one needs a simple implementation.
139:149	Computation of Degree can be done on the fly as a side product of LexPageRank just before the power method is applied on the similarity graph.
140:149	Another interesting observation in the results is the effect of threshold.
141:149	Most of the top ROUGE scores belong to the runs with the threshold a2a4a3a6a5, and the runs with threshold a2a4a3a11a13 are worse than the others most of the time.
142:149	This is due to the information loss in the similarity graphs as we move to higher thresholds as discussed in Section 3.
143:149	As a comparison with the other summarization systems, we present the official scores for the top five DUC 2004 participants and the human summaries in Table 4 and Table 5 for Tasks 2 and 4, respectively.
144:149	Our top few results for each task are either better than or statistically indifferent from the best system in the official runs considering the 95% confidence interval.
145:149	5 Conclusion We have presented a novel approach to define sentence centrality based on graph-based prestige scoring of sentences.
146:149	Constructing the similarity graph of sentences provides us with a better view of important sentences compared to the centroid approach, which is prone to overgeneralization of the information in a document cluster.
147:149	We have introduced two different methods, Degree and LexPageRank, for computing prestige in similarity graphs.
148:149	The results of applying these methods on extractive summarization is quite promising.
149:149	Even the simplest approach we have taken, degree centrality, is a good enough heuristic to perform better than lead-based and centroid-based summaries.
