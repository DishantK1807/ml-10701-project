There is also a considerable amount of research on classification of text as “subjective” or “objective” (Wiebe et al 2001, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003), a task that is not relevant for the processing of very brief pieces of direct customer feedback.

See Pang et al.(2002) for a similar argument.

While results like this have been reported in the area of style classification (Baayen et al.1996, Gamon 2004), they are noteworthy in a domain where stylistic markers have not been considered in the past, indicating the need for more research into the stylistic correlations of affect in text.

The literature on sentiment classification can be divided into approaches that rely on semantic resources, such as a sentiment or affect lexicon (Nasukawa and Yi 2003, Subasic and Huettner 2001), or a large scale knowledge base (Liu et al 2003) on the one hand, and approaches that try to learn patterns directly from tagged data, without additional resources (Dave et al 2003, Pang et al.2003). Much research is also being directed at acquiring affect lexica automatically (Turney 2002, Turney and Littman 2002).

Pang et al.(2002), for example, report a maximum accuracy of 82.9% on movie reviews.

Pang et al.(2002) have demonstrated, however, that this is not as straightforward as one may think, given that sentiment is often expressed in more subtle and indirect ways.

The measure of “predictiveness” we employed is log likelihood ratio with respect to the target variable (Dunning 1993).
