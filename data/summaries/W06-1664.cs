Also, PMI-IR is useful for calculating semantic orientation and rating reviews (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
We chose these methods for comparison because PMI performs best in (Terra and Clarke, 2003).
N03-1032
Kageura et al.(2000) propose automatic thesaurus generation based on a graphic representation.
C00-1058
Another reason is in (Terra and Clarke, 2003) document-wide co-occurrences perform comparable to other Windows-based cooccurrences.
N03-1032
Widdows and Dorow (2002) use a graph model for unsupervised lexical acquisition.
C02-1114
Therefore, automatic thesaurus construction (Curran, 2002) offers great potential for various useful NLP applications.
W02-1029
Therefore, it can be used easily as a baseline, as suggested by (Lapata and Keller, 2004).

Works A number of studies have explained the use of the web for NLP tasks e.g., creating multilingual translation lexicons (Cheng et al., 2004), text classification (Huang et al., 2004), and word sense disambiguation (Turney, 2004).
P04-1068 W04-0858
Terra and Clarke (Terra and Clarke, 2003) provide a comparative investigation of co-occurrence frequency estimation on the performance of synonym tests.
N03-1032
Distributional clustering of words was first proposed by Pereira Tishby & Lee in (Pereira et al., 1993): They cluster nouns according to their conditional verb distributions.
P93-1024
Keller et al.(2002) use the web to obtain frequencies for unseen bigrams in a given corpus.
W02-1030
It also contributes to word sense disambiguation (Li and Abe, 1998) and text classification (Dhillon et al., 2002) because the dimensionality is reduced efficiently.
P98-2124
Aside from counting bigrams, various tasks are attainable using webbased models: spelling correction, adjective ordering, compound noun bracketing, countability detection, and so on (Lapata and Keller, 2004).
