The second task is back-transliteration (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001; Jeong et al., 1999; Knight and Graehl, 1998; Qu et al., 2003), which identifies the source word corresponding to an existing transliterated word.

The first task is transliteration in the strict sense, which creates new words in a target language (Haizhou et al., 2004; Wan and Verspoor, 1998).
P98-2220
Existing transliteration methods for Chinese (Haizhou et al., 2004; Wan and Verspoor, 1998) aim to spell out foreign names of people and places, and do not model impression.
P98-2220
If there are many tuples, and the process of manual correspondence is expensive, we can automate the process as performed in existing transliteration methods, such as the EM algorithm (Knight and Graehl, 1998) or DP matching (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2001).
