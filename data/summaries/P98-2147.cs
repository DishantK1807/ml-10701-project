However, preprocessing can improve dramatically the time and space needed for the main compilation step, since the preprocessor uses determinization and minimization algorithms for weighted transducers (Mohri, 1997) to increase the sharing -factoringamong grammar rules that start or end the same way.

Therefore, CFGs used in spoken-dialogue applications often represent regular languages (Church, 1983; Brown and Buntschuh, 1994), either by construction or as a result of a finite-state approximation of Â£ more general CFG (Pereira and Wright, 1997).

A key feature of our grammar compilation method is the representation of the grammar by a weighted transducer that can then be preoptimized using weighted transducer determinization and minimization (Mohri, 1997; Mohri, 1998a).

The GRM Library also includes an efficient compilation too\] for weighted context-dependent rewrite rules (Mohri and Sproat, 1996) that is used in textto-speech projects at Lucent Bell Laboratories.
