In our experiments, we use a corpus of web pages containing about 10105 × English words (Terra and Clarke, 2003).

314 Lapata (2002) examines the task of expressing the implicit relations in nominalizations, which are noun compounds whose head noun is derived from a verb and whose modifier can be interpreted as an argument of the verb.

Berland and Charniak (1999) use Hearst’s manual procedure.
P99-1008
We use the Waterloo MultiText System (Clarke et al., 1998) to search in a corpus of about 10105 × English words (Terra and Clarke, 2003).

Miller et al.(2000) propose an approach to relation extraction that was evaluated in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC7).

Hearst (1992) processed her text with a partof-speech tagger and a unification-based constituent analyzer.
C92-2082
For example, instead of the literal string pattern “Y such as the X”, where X and Y are words, Hearst (1992) used the more abstract pattern “ 0NP such as 1NP ”, where iNP represents a noun phrase.

Yangarber et al.(2000) and Yangarber (2003) present an algorithm that can find patterns automatically, but it requires an initial seed of manually designed patterns for each semantic relation.

Berland and Charniak (1999) suggest their work may be useful for building a lexicon or ontology, like WordNet.
P99-1008
Work Hearst (1992) describes a method for finding patterns like “Y such as the X”, but her method requires human judgement.
C92-2082
Hearst (1992) suggests that her work may be useful for building a thesaurus.
C92-2082
In a widely cited paper, Hearst (1992) showed that the lexico-syntactic pattern “Y such as the X” can be used to mine large text corpora for word pairs YX : in which X is a hyponym (type) of Y.
C92-2082
Berland and Charniak (1999) demonstrated that the patterns “Y’s X” and “X of the Y” can be used to mine corpora for pairs YX : in which X is a meronym (part) of Y (e.g., “wheel of the car”).
