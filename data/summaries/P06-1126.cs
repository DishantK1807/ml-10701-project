Chinese word segmentation is the initial stage of many Chinese language processing tasks, and has received a lot of attention in the literature (Sproat et al., 1996; Sun and Tsou, 2001; Zhang et al., 2003; Peng et al., 2004).

Gao et al.(2005) further developed it to a linear mixture model.
J05-4005
Gao and Zhang (2002) also presented a method of combining two criteria, and showed the combination of rank and entropy achieved the smallest models.

A few criteria have been presented for language model pruning, including count cut-off (Jelinek, 1990), weighted difference factor (Seymore and Rosenfeld, 1996), KullbackLeibler distance (Stolcke, 1998), rank and entropy (Gao and Zhang, 2002).
P02-1023
Gao and Lee (2000) proposed a distributionbased pruning.
P00-1073
In recent years, discriminative training has been introduced to natural language processing applications such as parsing (Collins, 2000), machine translation (Och and Ney, 2002) and language model building (Kuo et al., 2002; Roark et al., 2004).
P02-1038 P04-1007
The word segmentation system is developed based on a source-channel model similar to that described in (Gao et al., 2003).
P03-1035
In Gao and Zhang (2002), three measures are studied for the purpose of language model pruning.
P02-1023
In Gao et al.(2003), an approach based on source-channel model for Chinese word segmentation was proposed.
