The centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) focuses on the resolution of inter-sentential anaphora.

4We abstract here from the syntactic criteria for filtering out some elements of the current sentence by applying bindhag criteria (Strube & Hahn, 1995).

1Cf. the sketchy statements by Brennan et al.(1987, p.155): "\[...\] U is an utterance (not necessarily a full clause) \[...\]", and by Grosz et al.(1995, p.209): "U need not to be a full clause".

processing sentences linearly one clause at a time (as suggested by Grosz et al.(1995)), 2.

However, the centering framework is not fully specified to handie complex sentences (Suri & McCoy, 1994).

to Related Work Crucial for the evaluation of the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) and its applicability to naturally occurring discourse is the lack of a specification conceming how to handle complex sentences and intrasentential anaphora.

Some issues remain open: the evaluation of the functional approach for languages with fixed word order, a fine-grained analysis of subordinate clauses as Suri & McCoy (1994) presented for SX because SY clauses, and, in general, the solution for the cases which cause errors in our evaluation.

Other approaches which integrate the resolution of sentenceand text-level anaphora are based on salience metrics (Haji~ov~i et al., 1992; Lappin & Leass, 1994).
J94-4002
To summarize the results of our empirical evaluation, we claim that our proposal based on functional criteria leads to substantively better results for languages with free word order than the linear approach suggested by Grosz et al.(1995) and the two approaches which prefer inter-sentential or intrasentential antecedents.
J95-2003
Suri & McCoy (1994) argue in the same manner, but we consider the functional approach for languages with free word order superior to their grammatical criteria, while, for languages with fixed word order, both approaches should give the same results.
