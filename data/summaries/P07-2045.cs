Moses is also able to integrate factored language models, such as those described in (Bilmes and Kirchhoff 2003) and (Axelrod 2006).

179 For the Chinese-English NIST task, the memory requirement of the phrase table is reduced from 1.7 gigabytes to less than 20 mega bytes, with no loss in translation quality and speed (Zens and Ney 2007).

Phrase-based statistical machine translation (Koehn et al.2003) has emerged as the dominant paradigm in machine translation research.

It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.

Initial results show the potential benefit of factors for statistical machine translation, (Koehn et al.2006) and (Koehn and Hoang 2007).
