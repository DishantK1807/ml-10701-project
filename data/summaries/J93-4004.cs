Mann (1984) suggested that goal pursuit methods used in artificial intelligence could be applied to RST for text generation.

A segment must have an identifiable discourse segment purpose (DSP), and embedding relationships between segments are a surface reflection of relationships among their associated DSPs (Grosz and Sidner 1986, pp.

It has also been employed in Reithinger's (1991) system for incremental language generation, and serves as the basis of the presentational planner for WIP, a multimedia system that plans text and graphics to achieve communicative goals (Wahlster et al.1991). Finally, it is the basis for a text planner capable of generating explanatory texts that integrate examples with their surrounding context (Mittal and Paris 1993).

To make clear what is missing, we have represented in Figure 5 the intentional structure of this text using Grosz and Sidner's (1986) notions of dominance and satisfaction-precedence.

In this approach, the intentional structure describing the speaker's purposes and the relationships between them (Grosz and Sidner 1986) is explicitly represented.

Rambow (1990) argues that domain-specific communication knowledge must be used (whether implicitly or explicitly) in all planned communica676 Johanna D.

Previous research in natural language generation has shown that schemata of rhetorical predicates (McKeown 1985; McCoy 1989; Paris 1988) or rhetorical relations (Hovy 1991) can be used to capture the structure of coherent multisentential texts.

That is, we must address issues of how to build a representation of the intentional structure of the dialogue that is emerging across conversational turns (Grosz and Sidner 1986) and to track global focus (Grosz 1977).

They may be used to mark shifts in attentional structure, discourse segment boundaries, or aspects of the exchange structure in interactive discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Redeker 1990; Schiffrin 1987).

9 Moreover, as Moore and Pollack (1992) argue, a straightforward approach to revising such an operationalization of RST by modifying subject matter operators to indicate associated intentions cannot succeed.

In Grosz and Sidner's theory (1986, p.

Grosz and Sidner (1986) argue that such relations between intentions are a crucial part of intentional structure.

In many cases, these researchers found that schemata provided only a partial solution, and they have identified additional factors that control the generation process: Paris (1988) uses information about the user's knowledge of domain concepts to tailor descriptions of complex physical objects to a particular user; McCoy (1989) uses object perspectives and a user model to provide corrective responses to users' misconceptions about ob1 The "{}" indicate optionality, "/" indicates alternative, "+" indicates that the item may appear one or more times, and "*" indicates that the item may appear zero or more times.
