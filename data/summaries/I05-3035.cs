So an additive new words recognizer is adopted (Chen, 2003).

Different from (Peng et al., 2004), we represent the positions of a hanzi (Chinese character) with four different tags: B for a hanzi 196 that starts a word, I for a hanzi that continues the word, F for a hanzi that ends the word, S for a hanzi that occurs as a single-character word.
C04-1081
Same as (Chen, 2003), we divided the training data as training data and developing data to find an exactly value of the threshold.

The character features are instantiations of the following templates, similar to those described in (Ng and Jin, 2004), C refers to a Chinese hanzi.

For this reson, error-driven learning method (Brill, 1995) is adopted to refine the segmentation result in this bakeoff in three steps: 1) Based on CRFs model, we segment the training data which has been removed all the space between words.
