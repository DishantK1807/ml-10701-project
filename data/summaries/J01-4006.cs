Some provide complete details of the experimental design and results, while others (e.g., Byron and Stent 1998) fail to answer even basic questions: What pronouns did this study address?
P98-2241
'' A categorical description, such as "\[results are shown for\] personal and possessive pronouns" (Strube 1998, page 1256) is insufficient because the author might assume that his exclusion of certain pronouns (e.g., first person pronouns) need not be mentioned since they are excluded by most other studies.

Neither Hobbs algorithm nor BFP attempt to cover these examples" (Walker 1989, page 257).
P89-1031
Some past reports give no coverage details at all, while others (e.g., Popescu-Belis and Robba 1997, page 97) precisely state their coverage: "/il/,/elle/,/le/,/la/,/1'/,/lui/,/ils/,~/elles/.

Obviously, 1111 applies to techniques that claim general utility but not to those designed for specific circumstances, such as the one reported in Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999) or a technique to handle a particular phenomenon such as cataphora.
J99-2001
Other techniques are not designed to identify cataphors, and for some of those the authors exclude cataphors from their test data (e.g., Ge, Hale, and Charniak 1998) while others include them but count the cataphors as errors (e.g., Strube and Hahn 1999).

non-anaphoric it) have not been included in these results" (Peral, Palomar, and Ferr~ndez 1999, page 71).
W99-0210
Pronoun resolution studies differ in many respects, such as the method of calculating C and the underlying semantic assumptions, and this proposal does not address ways to make the studies themselves more consistent (for discussion of these issues, see Walker 1989, van Deemter and Kibble 1999, Mitkov 2000).
P89-1031 W99-0213
Some pronoun resolution techniques address cataphora (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994), so the cataphors are included when calculating the performance for these techniques.
J94-4002
reports provide no exclusion details at all, and even when authors do provide them, the descriptions they use are often incomplete or confusing, as in these examples: â€¢ "7 of the pronouns were non-anaphoric and 16 exophoric" (Mitkov 1998, page 872).
