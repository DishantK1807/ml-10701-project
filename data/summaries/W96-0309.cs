77 1 Introduction The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguistic semantics (Bergsten 1911, Jespersen 1942, Marchand 1970, Lees 1970, Downing 1977, Levi 1978, Warren 1987), and their analysis has presented a serious challenge for natural language processing systems (Finin 1980, McDonald 1982, Isabelle 1984, Alshawi 1987, Hobbs et al 1993, Bouillon et al 1992, Jones 1995, Johnston, Boguraev, and Pustejovsky 1995).

Our analysis of compounds in English and complex nominals in Italian utilizes the representational framework of the Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky 1991,1995).

This brings compound interpretation under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).

In addition, we adopt a decompositional view of event structure, as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991), in which the event structure representation of a lexical item makes reference to the configurational properties of subevents and arguments.

The predicates in the qualia are not there just to account for compounds but also to account for a wide variety of forms of composition and interpretation including argument selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion (Pustejovsky (1991,1995), Bouillon 1995).
