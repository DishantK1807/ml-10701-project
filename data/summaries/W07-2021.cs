Traditionally, SRL systems have been trained on either the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005) ??for two years, the CoNLL workshop (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) has made this their shared task, or the FrameNet corpus ??Senseval-3 used this for their shared task (Litkowski, 2004).

This work attempts to expand on semantic role labeling experiments in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004a, and Litkowski, 2004b).

Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.

This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras & Marquez (2004) and Carreras & Marquez (2005)).
