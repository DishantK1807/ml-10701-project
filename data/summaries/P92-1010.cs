The use of domination has found a number of applications, such as in deterministic parsers based on Description theory (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983), in a compact organization of the basic structures of TreeAdjoining Grammars (Vijay-Shanker & Schabes, 1992), and in a new characterization of the adjoining operation that allows a clean integration of TAGs into the unification-based framework (VijayShanker, 1992) Our logic serves to formalize the reasoning on which these applications are based.

This is not acceptable for D-theory, where both the analyses of "pseudo-passives" and coordinate structures require single structures describing sets including both trees in which some a is left-of b and others in which the same a is either equal to or properly dominates that same b (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983).

Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck (1983) have introduced Description Theory (D-theory) which considers the structure of trees in terms of the domination relation rather than the parent relation.

The proof is in (Rogers & Vijay-Shanker, 1992).

Their proofs are in (Rogers & Vijay-Shanker, 1992).

Thus the tree we extract is both the circumscriptive reading of (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) and the standard referent of (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983).

The connection between partial descriptions of trees and the sets of trees they describe is made explicit in (Vijay-Shanker & Schabes, 1992).

As noted in (Marcus, Hindle & Fleck, 1983; Marcus, 1987), this approach is capable of maintaining Marcus' deterministic hypothesis (Marcus, 1980) in a number of cases where the original deterministic parsers fail.

*Tlfis work is supported by NSF grant IRI-9016591 72 In other examples given in (Marcus, Hindle &; Fleck, 1983) the left-of (linear precedence) relation is partially specified during parsing, with individuals related by "left-of or equals" or "left-of or dominates".
P83-1020
We discuss these considerations more fully in (Rogers &5 Vijay-Shanker, 1992).
