Pustejovsky (1989a) extends this proposal, and argues that each expression c~ may have available to it, a set of shifting operators, which we call Ga, which operate over an expression, changing its type and denotation.
E89-1000
Additional evidence for this distinction is given in Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) and Briscoe et al.(1990). 22 Partee and Rooth (1983) suggest that all expressions in the language can be assigned a base type, while also being associated with a type ladder.

In what follows, however, I will show that such distinctions 25 Anick and Pustejovsky (1990) explore how metrics such as association ratios can be used to statistically measure the notions of prototypicality mentioned here.

In Pustejovsky (1989b) and Pustejovsky and Anick (1988), I suggest that there is a system of relations that characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb.

of these roles are reminiscent of descriptors used by various computational researchers, such as Wilks (1975b), Hayes (1979), and Hobbs et al.(1987). Within the theory outlined here, these roles determine a minimal semantic description of a word that has both semantic and grammatical consequences.

Hobbs (1987) and Wilensky (1990), for example, argue that there should be no distinction between commonsense knowledge and lexical knowledge.

Some of the best work addressing the issue of how the lexical semantics of a word ties into its deeper conceptual structure includes that of Hobbs et al.(1987) and Wilks (1975), while interesting work on shared information structures in NLP domains is that of Flickinger et al.(1985) and Evans and Gazdar (1989, 1990).

In conclusion, it should be pointed out that the entire lexicon is organized around such logical ambiguities, which Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) call Lexical Conceptual Paradigms.

Pustejovsky and Anick (1988) characterize the meaning of such "Double Figure-Ground" nominals as inherently relational, where both parameters are logically part of the meaning of the noun.
