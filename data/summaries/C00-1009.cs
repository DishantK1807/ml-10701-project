In relation to the integration problem, we l)resent two algorithms that compute the word transition 1)robability: the first algorithm is based on the l~efl;-to-ll,ight Inside algorithln 55 (LRI) (Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991), and the second is based on an application of a Viterbi scheme to the LRI algorithm (the VLRI algorithm) (S~nehez and Benedf, 1997).

The part of the 1Release 2 of this data set can be obtained t'rmn the Linguistic Data Consortium with Catalogue number LDC94T4B (http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc/nofranm.html) 2There are 48 labels defined in (Marcus et al., 1993), however, three of ttmm do not appear in the corpus.

In order to select this subset of derivations, two alternatives have been considered: froln structural information content in a bracketed corpus (Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Amaya et al., 1999), and from statistical information content in the kbest derivations (Sgmchez and Benedl, 1998).

with the Penn Treebank Corpus The corpus used in the experiments was the part of the Wall Street Journal which had been processed in the Petal %'eebank project 1 (Marcus el: al., 1993).

This corpus was automatically labelled, analyzed and manually checked as described in (Marcus et 31., 1993).

With regard to the learning problem, several algorithms that learn SCFGs by means of estimation algorithms have been 1)reposed (Lari and Young, 1990; Pereira and Schal)es, 1992; Sfinehez and Benedi, 1998), and pronfising resuits have been achieved with category-based SCFGs on real tasks (Sfi.nchez and Benedi, \]999).
P92-1017
In the first alternative, the IOb and VSb algorithms which learn SCFGs from partially bracketed corpora were defined (Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Amaya et al., 1999).
