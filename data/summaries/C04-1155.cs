The construction of bilingual knowledge base, in the development of example-based machine translation systems (Sato and Nagao, 1990), is vitally critical.

Therefore, such schema can serve as a mean to represent translation examples, and find structural correspondences for the purpose of transfer grammar learning (Watanabe et al., 2000; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Meyers et al., 1998).

This annotation schema is quite suitable for representing translation example, where it preserves the strength in describing non-standard and nonprojective linguistic phenomena for a language (Boitet and Zaharin, 1988; Al-Adhaileh et al., 2002), on the other hand, it allows the annotator to flexibly define the corresponding translation substring from the target sentence to the representation tree of source sentence when it is necessary.

In many phrasal matching approaches, such as constituency-oriented (Kaji et al., 1992; Grishman, 1994) and dependencyoriented (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Watanabe et al., 2000; Aramaki et al., 2001), crossing constraints are deployed implicitly in finding the structural correspondences between pair of representation trees of a source sentence and its translation in target.

of Example Base In the construction of bilingual knowledge base (example base) in example-based machine translation system (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Watanabe et al., 2000), translation examples are usually annotated by mean of a pair analyzed structures, where the corresponding relations between the source and target sentences are established at the structural level through the explicit links.

In structural example-based machine translation systems (Grishman, 1994; Meyers et al., 1998; Watanabe et al., 2000), examples in the knowledge base are normally annotated with their constituency (Kaji et al., 1992) or dependency structures (Matsumoto et al., 1993; Aramaki et al., 2001; AlAdhaileh et al., 2002), which allows the corresponding relations between source and target sentences to be established at the structural level.

Corresponding Tree (TCT) Representation TCT structure, as an extension of structure stringtree correspondence representation (Boitet and Zaharin, 1988), is a general structure that can flexibly associate not only the string of a sentence to its syntactic structure in source language, but also allow the language annotator to explicitly associate the string from its translation in target language for the purpose to describe the correspondences between different languages.
