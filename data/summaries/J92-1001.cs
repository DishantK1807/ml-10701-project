Thus, collocations and word associations are strong sources of information that an understander must weigh against other cues, and not just treat as rules for sense-filtering (as in Hirst 1987 or Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler 1989).

At present all this information is collected and coded by hand, although recent work by Ravin (1990) and Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) suggests that the collection of role-related information may be automatable.

Most proposed solutions to this problem specify a fixed set of ordered rules that a system applies until a unique, satisfactory attachment is found (Fodor and Frazier 1980; Wilks, Huang, and Fass 1985; Shieber 1983; Hirst 1987; Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler 1989).

Fox et al.1988). In a sense tagging system, these associations can help determine the semantic context.

Our use of the term is thus similar to that of Smadja and McKeown, who partition collocations into open compounds, predicative relations, and idiomatic expressions (Smadja and McKeown 1990).

Work on lexical cohesion suggests that people use words that repeat a conceptual category or that have a semantic association to each other to create unity in text (Morris 1988; Morris and Hirst 1991; Halliday and Hasan 1976).
J91-1002
similar approach has been taken by Gibson (1990) and is supported by the psychological experiments of Kurtzman (1984).

It is unrealistic to assume that word sense discrimination can be left until parsing is complete, as suggested, for example, by Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) and Janssen (1990).

For example, Dahlgren, McDowell, and Stabler (1989) propose the rule "If the object of the preposition is an expression of time, then S-attach the PP" to explain the preference for assuming that "in the afternoon" modifies adjourn in Example 2: Example 2 The judge adjourned the hearing in the afternoon.

McRoy Using Multiple Knowledge Sources focus can also be a strong cue for disambiguating prepositions, but this cue appears fairly infrequently \[Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990\]).

These entries differ from similar representations of collocations or idioms in Smadja and McKeown (1990) and Stock (1989), in that they are sense-based rather than wordbased.
