choice): The particular form of coreference (including anaphora, deixis, and ellipis) and reference must be chosen in order to maintain discourse cohesion \[McDonald, 1978; Tutin and Kittredge, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995\].

• Exophoric lexical choice: As argued in \[Nirenburg et al., 1989; Meteer, 1991; Wanner, 1994\], lexical choice other than linguistic reference should also be considered a sentence planning task, since lexical units predetermihe the syntactic structure of a clause, and since salience may be realized by lexical means.

• Clause-internal structuring: The order of clause constituents, taxis, and projectivity of propositions within the clause \[Hovy, 1992; DiMarco and Hirst, 1993; Panaget, 1994\] must be determined; within each sentence, the thematized and focused elements must be identified \[Iordanskaja, 1992\]; redundancy must be removed \[Dalianis and Hovy, 1996a; Dalianis and Hovy, 1996b\].

In practice, it is usually found that the sentence generator requires more detailed linguistic information than text planners or schema appliers can provide \[Meteer, 1991; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Hovy, 1992; Panaget, 1994; Wanner, 1994\].

If a related entity has been introduced, the new lexical unit depends on the relation between the two entities; compare \[Tutin and Kittredge, 1992\].

See, for example, \[Scott and de Souza, 1990\] for treatment of ELABORATION, \[Vander Linden and Martin, 1995\] of PURPOSE, and \[Grote et al., 1995\] of CONCESSION.

Following \[Rambow and Korelsky, 1992\], we call this additional planning task sentence planning (even though some operations may cross sentence boundaries).

• Sentence grouping and sentence content determination: Individual sentences must be delimited; temporal, spatial, and causal nuances of predicates must be determined, and so on \[Meteer, 1991; Pustejovsky, 1995; Stede, 1996\].

\[Rambow and Korelsky, 1992; Panaget, 1994\] have a separate sentence planning component, but they do not separate the specific subtasks of sentence planning into distinct submodules.

With the choice of a head lexical unit, the salience of the arguments is also predetermined (see, e.g., \[Wanner and Bateman, 1990\]).

Knowledge sources: the lexicon (essentially KPML's lexicon extended by collocational \[Wanner and Bateman, 1990\] and qualia \[Pustejovsky, 1995\] information), the semantic and lexicogrammatical resources as discussed in \[Wanner, 1994\], the Penman Upper Model \[Bateman, 1990\], the HealthDoc Domain Model, and the Reader Model of the patient.
