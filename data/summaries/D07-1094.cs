For example in the domain of syntactic parsing with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), a surprising recent result is that automatically induced grammar refinements can outperform sophisticated methods which exploit substantial manually articulated structure (Petrov et al., 2006).

We approximate the loss in data likelihood for a merge s1s2 → swiththefollowinglikelihoodratio(Petrov et al., 2006): ∆(s1 s2 → s) = productdisplay sequences productdisplay t Pt(x,y) P(x,y) . Here P(x,y) is the joint likelihood of an emission sequence x and associated state sequence y.

3Following previous work with PCFGs (Petrov et al., 2006), we experimented with smoothing the substates towards each other to prevent overfitting, but we were unable to achieve any performance gains.
