Table 1 below), and the noise introduced by the remaining ambiguity is assumed to be sufficiently lower than the signal, following the idea used in (Yarowsky, 1992).

The number of multiple analyses could probably be made even smaller by specifying the grammatical representation (usage principles of the syn85 tactic tags) in more detail, in particular incorporating some analysis conventions for certain apparent borderline cases (for a discussion of specifying a parser's linguistic task, see (Voutilainen and J~rvinen, 1995)).

In the data-driven approach, the model is automatically generated from annotated text corpora, and the model can be represented e.g. as n-grams (Garside et al., 1987), local rules (Hindle, 1989) or neural nets (Schmid, 1994).

Notable about the system is that minimal human effort was needed for creating its language models (the linguistic consisting of syntactic disambiguation rules based on the Constraint Grammar framework (Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et al., 1995); the corpus-based consisting of bigrams and trigrams): Only one day was spent on writing the 107 syntactic disambiguation rules used by the linguistic parser.

The input is English text morphologically tagged with a rule-based tagger called EngCG (Voutilainen et al., 1992; Karlsson et al., 1995).

Most hybrid approaches combine statistical information with automatically extracted rule-based information (Brill, 1995; Daelemans et al., 1996).

As suggested e.g. by Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) and Chanod and Tapanainen (1995), hand-coded heuristics may be a worthwhile addition to 'strictly' grammar-based rules.
