LFG recognition and FUG generation have both been proved to be NP-hard in Barton et ai, (1987) and Ritchie (1986) respectively.

This grammar attuning strategy is extensively described in Appelo et al.(1987), Landsbergen (1982) and Landsbergen (1987) for ordinary M-grammars.

Hence, an amg is not necessarily off-line parsable ( Pereira and Warren (1983), Haas (1989)).

Grammars, attuned in the way described in Landsbergen (1982), are called isomorphic.

From the definitions of MPars and MGen the reversibility property of the grammar follows immediately: d E MPars(t) 4, t E MGen(d) The reversibility property which has always been one of the tenets of the Rosetta system (Landsbergen (1982)) has recently received the appreciation of other researchers in the field of M.T. as well (Isabelle (1989), Rohrer (1989), van Noord (1990)).

Appelo et al.(1987) introduces some extensions of the formalism, which make it possible to assign more structure to an M-grammar.

In the context of the ordin~y M-grammar formalism this condition is formulated as: for each basic expression in one M-grammar there has to be at least one basic expression in the other M-grammar with the same meaning (which comes aThis condition is equivalent to the attuning measures described in Appelo et al.(1987), Landsbergen (1982)and Landsbergen(1987).

We will show that the attribute evaluation order is such that instead of the special-purpose parsing and generation algorithms introduced for M-grammars in Appelo et al.(1987), also Earley-like context-free parsing and ordinary generation strategies can be used.

In Landsbergen (1982) it was shown that the formalism is very well fit to be :used in an interlingual machine translation system in which semantic derivation trees make up the interlingua.

Suggestions for grammar constraints in the form of termination conditions for parsing and generation are given in Appelo et al.(1987).
