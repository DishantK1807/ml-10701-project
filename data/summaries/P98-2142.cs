The second parser uses generalised top-down strategies (Mellish, 1989) and a restricted bidirectional algorithm (Satta and Stock, 1994) for error detection and correction.

Introduction Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) described two types of ill-formedness: relative (i.e.

Mellish, 1989) using an augmented contextfree grammar.

Those systems identified and repaired errors in various ways, including using grammar-specific rules (metarules) (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983), least-cost error recovery based on chart parsing (Lyon, 1974; Anderson and Backhouse, 1981), semantic preferences (Fass and Wilks, 1983), and heuristic approaches based on a shift-reduce parser (Vosse, 1992).

Surface case processing is used to help extract meaning (Grishman and Peng, 1988) by mapping surface cases to their corresponding conceptual cases.
A88-1009
Unlike other systems that 862 have focused on error recovery at a particular level (Damerau, 1964; Mellish, 1989; Fass and Wilks, 1983), CHAPTER uses an integrated agenda system, which integrates lexical, syntactic, surface case, and semantic processing.

So many were produced because CHAPTER generated a semantic concept whether it was semantically ill-formed or not, to assist with the repair of illformed sentences (Fass and Wilks, 1983).
J83-3004
The semantic processing uses a conceptual hierarchy and act templates (Fass and Wilks, 1983), that express semantic restrictions.
J83-3004
Various systems have focused on the recovery of ill-formed text at the morphosyntactic level (Vosse, 1992), the syntactic level (Irons, 1963; Lyon, 1974), and the semantic level (Fass and Wilks, 1983; Carbonell and Hayes, 1983).
