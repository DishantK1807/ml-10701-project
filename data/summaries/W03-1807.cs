In his Xtract system, Smadja (1993) first extracted significant pairs of words that consistently co-occur within a single syntactic structure using statistical scores called distance, strength and spread, and then examined concordances of the bi-grams to find longer frequent multiword units.

For example, Smadja (1993) suggests a basic characteristic of collocations and multiword units is recurrent, domain-dependent and cohesive lexical clusters.

For example, Wu (1997) used an English-Chinese bilingual parser based on stochastic transduction grammars to identify terms, including multiword expressions.

Wehrli (1998) employed a generative grammar framework to identify compounds and idioms in their ITS-2 MT English-French system.

Related Works Generally speaking, approaches to MWE extraction proposed so far can be divided into three categories: a) statistical approaches based on frequency and co-occurrence affinity, b) knowledge–based or symbolic approaches using parsers, lexicons and language filters, and c) hybrid approaches combining different methods (Smadja 1993; Dagan and Church 1994; Daille 1995; McEnery et al.1997; Wu 1997; Wermter et al.1997; Michiels and Dufour 1998; Merkel and Andersson 2000; Piao and McEnery 2001; Sag et al.2001a, 2001b; Biber et al.2003). In practice, most statistical approaches use linguistic filters to collect candidate MWEs.

Such approaches include Dagan and Church’s (1994) Termight Tool.

It has been claimed (by Gale et al, 1992) on the basis of corpus analysis that to a very large extent a word keeps the same meaning throughout a text.
