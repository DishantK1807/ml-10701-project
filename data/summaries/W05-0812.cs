We hypothesize that NULL alignment is unnecessary for asymmetric alignment models when we symmetrize using intersection-based methods (Och and Ney, 2000b).
C00-2163 P00-1056
Implementations are also freely available (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
The intuitive appeal of capturing richer information has inspired numerous alignment models (Wu, 1995; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Cherry and Lin, 2003).
P01-1067 P03-1012
Och and Ney (2000a) introduce a NULL-alignment capability to the HMM alignment model.
C00-2163 P00-1056
The most widely used alignment model is IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003
It is similar to (Och and Ney, 2000a).
C00-2163 P00-1056
In empirical evaluations it has outperformed the other IBM Models and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
This sequence performed well in an evaluation of the IBM Models (Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
Although the resulting set of links may still be relatively accurate, we can symmetrize by combining it with the set produced by applying the complementary model P(ejf) to the same data (Och and Ney, 2000b).

This parser has been used in a much different alignment model (Cherry and Lin, 2003).

This is similar to Moore (2004); as in that work, jVj = 100,000, and φ1, φ2, and n are estimated on development data.
P04-1066
It was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems (Dejean et al., 2003; Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

The word class C(eai−1) is assigned using an unsupervised approach (Och, 1999).

IBM Model 4 parameters are then estimated over this partial search space as an approximation to EM (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002 J93-2003
This approach yields good results, but it has been observed that the IBM Model 4 performance is only slightly better than that of the underlying HMM Model used in this bootstrapping process (Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
This approach was proposed in Vogel et al.(1996) and subsequently improved (Och and Ney, 2000a; Toutanova et al., 2002).
