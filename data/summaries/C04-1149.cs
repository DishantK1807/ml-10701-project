This technique is less eﬀective than the one we describe here (Utsuro et al., 2003).

Here, a standard technique of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee (1998) and Rapp (1999)) is employed.

Here, the diﬀerence of dates of English and Japanese articles is within two days, with which it is guaranteed that, if exist, closely related articles in the other language can be discovered (see Utsuro et al.(2003) for details).

Cao and Li (2002) restricted candidate bilingual compound term pairs by consulting a seed bilingual lexicon and requiring their constituent words to be translation of each other across languages.

In order to solve this problem, we proposed an approach of taking bilingual news articles on Web news sites as a source for translation knowledge acquisition (Utsuro et al., 2003).

According to our previous study (Utsuro et al., 2003), cross-lingually relevant news articles are available in the direction of Englishto-Japanese retrieval for more than half of the retrieval query English articles.

also applied another technique based on contextual vector similarities (Utsuro et al., 2003), which First, we concatenate constituent Japanese articles of D i J into one article D primei J, and regard the article pair d i E and D primei J as a pseudo-parallel sentence pair.

Furthermore, unlike Cao and Li (2002), bilingual term correspondences for compound terms are not restricted to compositional translation.

2.2 Cross-Language Retrieval of Relevant News Articles This section gives the overview of our framework of cross-language retrieval of relevant news articles from Web news sites (Utsuro et al., 2003).

For example, Rapp (1999) filtered out bilingual term pairs with low monolingual frequencies (those below 100 times), while Fung and Yee (1998) restricted candidate bilingual term pairs to be pairs of the most frequent 118 unknown words.

Utsuro et al.(2003) showed that it is possible to acquire translation knowledge of domain specific named entities, event expressions, and collocational expressions from the collection of bilingual news articles on Web news sites.
