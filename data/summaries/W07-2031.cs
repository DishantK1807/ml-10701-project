The identification of metonymy becomes important for NLP tasks such as question answering (Stallard, 1993) or geographic information retrieval (Leveling and Hartrumpf, 2006).

Description 2.1 Tools and Resources The following tools and resources are used for the metonymy classification: ??TiMBL 5.1 (Daelemans et al., 2004), a memory-based learner for classification is em153 ployed for training the classifiers (supervised learning).1 ??Mascara 2.0 ??Metonymy Annotation Scheme And Robust Analysis (Markert and Nissim, 2003; Nissim and Markert, 2003; Markert and Nissim, 2002) contains annotated data for metonymic names from a subset of the the BNC.
P03-1008
Annotating a subset of the BNC (British National Corpus), they extracted a set of metonymic proper nouns from two categories: country names (Markert and Nissim, 2002) and organization names (Nissim and Markert, 2003).

Therefore, the full Mascara data was converted to form training data consisting of feature values for context C1, C2, and 1Peirsman (2006) also employs TiMBL for metonymy resolution, but trains a single classifier.

The English tagger was trained on the PENN treebank and uses the English morphological database from the XTAG project (Karp et al., 1992).

The task is described in more detail by Markert and Nissim (2007).
