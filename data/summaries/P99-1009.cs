Much previous work has been done on this problem and many different methods have been used: Church's PARTS (1988) program uses a Markov model; Bourigault (1992) uses heuristics along with a grammar; Voutilainen's NPTool (1993) uses a lexicon combined with a constraint grammar; Juteson and Katz (1995) use repeated phrases; Veenstra (1998), Argamon, Dagan & Krymolowski(1998) and Daelemaus, van den Bosch & Zavrel (1999) use memory-based systems; Ramshaw & Marcus (In Press) and Cardie & Pierce (1998) use rule-based systems.

The third line defines the sequence which we want bracketed, and the last 2The rule types we have chosen are similar to those used by Vilain and Day (1996) in transformation-based parsing, but are more powerful.

train their system, R&M used a 200k-word chunk of the Penn Treebank Parsed Wall Street Journal (Marcus et al., 1993) tagged using a transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1995) and extracted base noun phrases from its parses by selecting noun phrases that contained no nested noun phrases and further processing the data with some heuristics (like treating the possessive marker as the first word of a new base noun phrase) to flatten the recursive structure of the parse.

Among the machine learning algorithms studied, rule based systems have proven effective on many natural language processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1994), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), word-sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992), message understanding (Day et al., 1997), discourse tagging (Samuel et al., 1998), accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), prepositional-phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994) and base noun phrase identification (Ramshaw and Marcus, In Press; Cardie and Pierce, 1998; Veenstra, 1998; Argamon et al., 1998).
