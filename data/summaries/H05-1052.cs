Comparison with Related Work For a given sequence of ambiguous words, the original definition of the Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986), and more recent improvements based on simulated annealing (Cowie et al., 1992), seek to identify the combination of senses that maximizes the overlap among their dictionary definitions.

In the absence of an annotated corpus, dependencies can be derived by other means, e.g. part413 of-speech probabilities can be approximated from a raw corpus as in (Cutting et al., 1992), word-sense dependencies can be derived as definition-based similarities, etc.
A92-1018
Another related line of work consists of the disambiguation algorithms based on lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991), and the more recent improvements reported in (Galley and McKeown, 2003) â€“ where threads of meaning are identified throughout a text.

The algorithm was also evaluated on two other data sets, SENSEVAL-3 English all-words data (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) and a subset of SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), although only fine-grained sense evaluations could be conducted on these test sets.

417 structure of semantic networks was proposed in (Mihalcea et al., 2004), with a disambiguation accuracy of 50.9% measured on all the words in the SENSEVAL-2 data set.
C04-1162
The algorithm was later improved through a method for simulated annealing (Cowie et al., 1992), which solved the combinatorial explosion of word senses, while still finding an optimal solution.
C92-1056
More recently, (McCarthy et al., 2004) reports one of the best results on the SENSEVAL-2 data set, using an algorithm that automatically derives the most frequent sense for a word using distributional similarities learned from a large raw corpus, for a disambiguation precision of 53.0% and a recall of 49.0%.
