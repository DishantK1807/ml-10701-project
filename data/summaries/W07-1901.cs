Researchers that have used rule-based techniques to create embodied-agent systems include: Poggi andPelachaud(2000),whoconcentratedongenerating appropriate affective facial displays based on descriptions of typical facial expressions of emotion; Cassell et al.(2001a), who selected gestures and facial expressions to accompany text using heuristics derived from studies of typical North American non-verbal-displays; and Marsi and van Rooden (2007), who generated typical certain and uncertain facial displays for a talking head in an informationretrieval system.

The data-driven schedules were generated through 10-fold cross-validation as part of a previous study (Foster and Oberlander, 2007): that is, the display counts from 90% of the corpus were used to select the displays to use for the sentences in the held-out 10%.

Researchers that used data-driven techniques include: Stone et al.(2004), who captured the motions of an actor performing scripted output and then used that data to create performance 1 specifications on the fly; Cassell et al.(2001b), who selected posture shifts for an embodied agent based on recorded human behaviour; and Kipp (2004), who annotated the gesturing behaviour of skilled public speakers and derived “gesture profiles” to use in the generation process.

The surface form of each sentence was created by the OpenCCG surface realiser (White, 2006), using a grammar that spec1Foster (2007) gives more details of the face-display corpus.

The user models and dialogues were identical to those used by Foster and White (2005).

collection and annotation1 The recording scripts for the corpus were created by the output planner of the COMIC multimodal dialogue system (Foster et al., 2005) and consisted of a total of 444 sentences describing and comparing various tile-design options.

However, there is a significant difference between the responses of the speech-only judges and those of the judges using the weighted schedules (χ2 =4.72, p < 0.05). 5.5 Discussion The materials for this study were identical to those used by Foster and White (2005); in fact, the waveforms for the synthesised speech were identical.

In another study (Foster and Oberlander, 2007), the weighted data-driven strategy used here was compared to a majority strategy that always chose the highest-probability option in every context.
