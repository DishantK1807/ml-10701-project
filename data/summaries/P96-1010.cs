We consider an alternative method, Bayes, a Bayesian hybrid method (Golding, 1995), for the case where the words have the same part of speech.

Feature-based approaches, such as Bayesian classifters (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), have had varying degrees of success for the problem of context-sensitive spelling correction.
P94-1013 W95-0104
A number of feature-based methods have been proposed, including Bayesian classifiers (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1993), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), Bayesian hybrids (Golding, 1995), and, more recently, a method based on the Winnow multiplicative weight-updating algorithm (Golding and Roth, 1996).

The above probabilities are estimated as is traditionally done in trigram-based part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988): P(W,T) = P(WIT)P(T ) (1) = HP(wi\[ti) HP(t, lt,_2t,_l)(2) i i where T = tl...tn, and P(ti\]tl-2ti-1) is the prob ability of seeing a part-of-speech tag tl given the two preceding part-of-speech tags ti-2 and ti-1.

This method has been described elsewhere (Golding, 1995) and so will only be briefly reviewed here; however, the version used here uses an improved smoothing technique, which is mentioned briefly below.
