and conclusion We have raised and partially answered the question of how a dictionary should be indexed in order to support word access, a question initially addressed in (Zock, 2002) and (Zock and Bilac, 2004).

Synonymy, hypernymy or meronymy fall clearly in this latter category, and well known resources like WordNet (Miller, 1995), EuroWordNet (Vossen, 1998) or MindNet (Richardson et al., 1998) contain them.

However, as various researchers have pointed out (Harabagiu et al., 1999), these networks lack information, in particular with regard to syntagmatic associations, which are generally unsystematic.

Like (Church and Hanks, 1990), we used mutual information to measure the cohesion between two words.

These latter, called TIORA (Zock and Bilac, 2004) or topical relations (Ferret, 2002) account for the fact that two words refer to the same topic, or take part in the same situation or scenario.

To this end we follow the method introduced by (Church and Hanks, 1990), i.e. by sliding a window of a given size over some texts.

Other researchers used external sources: Mandala et al.(1999) integrated co-occurrences and a thesaurus to WordNet for query expansion; Agirre et al.(2001) built topic signatures from texts in relation to synsets; Magnini and Cavagli√° (2000) annotated the synsets with Subject Field Codes.

This network is used by TOPICOLL (Ferret, 2002), a topic analyzer, which performs simultaneously three tasks, relevant for this goal: it segments texts into topically homogeneous segments; it selects in each segment the most representative words of its topic; 7 Such a network is only another view of a set of cooccurrences: its nodes are the co-occurrent words and its edges are the co-occurrence relations.
