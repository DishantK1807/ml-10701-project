However, few machine translation systems have so far had a comprehensive component for wide-range restructuring (Slocum 1985), mainly because many systems are presently designed to produce output that is at best "fair," and little effort has been devoted to obtaining "good" output or natural sentences.

The Mu system (Nagao et al.1985) has two specific restructuring functions, before and after the transfer phase, mainly to handle exceptional cases.

If a machine translation system uses analysis-tree structures as intermediate structures (Lehmann et al.1981; Nitta et al.1982), wide-range restructuring can be introduced appropriately at the surface level.

COMPOSlTIONALITY PRINCIPLE IN MACHINE TRANSLATION Most machine translation systems (Slocum 1985) aiming at practical use employ the transfer method, which divides Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 2, June 1990 73 Taijiro Tsutsumi Intermediate Representations in Machine Translation the whole process into three phases: analysis of the source language, transfer between intermediate representations, and generation of the target language.

Much effort has been devoted to research into, and development of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum 1985).

Some papers have mentioned limited restructuring of intermediate representations (Bennett and Slocum 1985; Vauquois and Boitet 1985; Isabelle and Bourbeau 1985; Nagao et al.1985; McCord 1985; Nomura et al.1986). For example, LMT (McCord 1985) has a restructuring function after the transfer phase, to form a bridge between the basic styles of English and German.

OF THE WIDE-RANGE RESTRUCTURING FUNCTION A prototype English-to-Japanese machine translation system, SHALT (Tsutsumi 1986), is based on the two-step transfer method described in Section 3.2.

This contrast corresponds to the differences in the ways people recognize things and express their ideas about them (Nitta 1986), and hence is considered as a difference of viewpoint.

Montague grammar is one of the theoretical bases of the principle, and some work applying Montague grammar to machine translation has been reported (Landsbergen 1982; Nishida and Doshita 1983).
