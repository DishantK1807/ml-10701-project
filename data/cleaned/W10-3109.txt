Abstract
In NaturalLanguageProcessing,negation and modalityhave mostlybeen handled
using the older, pre-statisticalmethodologiesof formal representationssubject to
rule-basedprocessing. This fits the traditionaltreatmentof negation and modality
in logic-basedknowledgerepresentationand linguistics. However, in modern-day
statistics-basedNLP, how exactly negation and modalityshould be taken into ac-
count,and what role these phenomenaplay overall, is much less clear. The closest
statistics-basedNLP gets to semanticsat this time is lexical-basedword distribu-
tions (such as used in word sense disambiguation)and topic models (such as pro-
ducedby LatentDirichletAllocation).Whatexactlyin suchrepresentationsshould
a negation or a modalityactually apply to? What would, or should, the resulting
effects be? The traditionalapproachesare of little or no help.
In this talk I argue that neithermodel is adequate,and that one needsa different
model of semanticsto be able to accommodatenegation and modality. The tradi-
tional formalismsare impoverished in their absence of an explicit representation
of the denotationsof each symbol, and the statistics-basedword distributions do
not support the compositionalityrequired of semanticssince it is unclear how to
link togethertwo separateword distributions in a semanticallymeaningfulway. A
kind of hybrid, which one could call Distributional Semantics,should be formu-
lated to include the necessary aspects of both: the ability to carry explicit word
associationsthat are still partitionedso as to allow negation and modalityto affect
the representationsin intuitively plausibleways is what is required.
I presenta specificmodel of DistributionalSemantics that, althoughstill rudi-
mentary, exhibits some of the desired features. I explore the possibilitiesfor ac-
commodatingthe phenomenaof negationand modality. The talk posesmany more
questionsthan it answersand is an invitationto considerDistributionalSemantics
as a modelfor richer and more semantics-orientedstatistics-basedNLP.
