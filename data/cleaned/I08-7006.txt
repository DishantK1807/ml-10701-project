Abstract
In Myanmar language, sentences are
clearly delimited by a unique sentence
boundary marker but are written without
necessarily pausing between words with
spaces. It is therefore non-trivial to seg-
ment sentences into words. Word tokeniz-
ing plays a vital role in most Natural Lan-
guage Processing applications. We observe
that word boundaries generally align with
syllable boundaries. Working directly with
characters does not help. It is therefore
useful to syllabify texts first. Syllabification
is also a non-trivial task in Myanmar. We
have collected 4550 syllables from avail-
able sources . We have evaluated our syl-
lable inventory on 2,728 sentences spread
over 258 pages and observed a coverage of
99.96%. In the second part, we build word
lists from available sources such as dic-
tionaries, through the application of mor-
phological rules, and by generating syllable
n-grams as possible words and manually
checking. We have thus built list of 800,000
words including inflected forms. We have
tested our algorithm on a 5000 sentence
test data set containing a total of (35049
words) and manually checked for evaluat-
ing the performance. The program recog-
nized 34943 words of which 34633 words
were correct, thus giving us a Recall of
98.81%, a Precision of 99.11% and a F-
Measure is 98.95%.

1 Introduction
Myanmar (Burmese) is a member of the Burmese-
Lolo group of the Sino-Tibetan language spoken by
about 21 Million people in Myanmar (Burma). It
is a tonal language, that is to say, the meaning of a
syllable or word changes with the tone. It has been
classified by linguists as a mono-syllabic or isolating
language with agglutinative features. According to
history, Myanmar script has originated from Brahmi
script which flourished in India from about 500 B.C.
to over 300 A.D (MLC, 2002). The script is syllabic
in nature, and written from left to right.
Myanmar script is composed of 33 consonants,
11 basic vowels, 11 consonant combination sym-
bols and extension vowels, vowel symbols, devow-
elizing consonants, diacritic marks, specified sym-
bols and punctuation marks(MLC, 2002),(Thu and
Urano, 2006). Myanmar script represents sequences
of syllables where each syllable is constructed from
consonants, consonant combination symbols (i.e.
Medials), vowel symbols related to relevant conso-
nants and diacritic marks indicating tone level.
Myanmar has mainly 9 parts of speech: noun,
pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, particle , conjunc-
tion, post-positional marker and interjection (MLC,
2005), (Judson, 1842).
In Myanmar script, sentences are clearly delim-
ited by a sentence boundary marker but words are
not always delimited by spaces. Although there is
a general tendency to insert spaces between phrases,
inserting spaces is more of a convenience rather than
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
41
a rule. Spaces may sometimes be inserted between
words and even between a root word and the associ-
ated post-position. In fact in the past spaces were
rarely used. Segmenting sentences into words is
therefore a challenging task.
Word boundaries generally align with syllable
boundaries and syllabification is therefore a useful
strategy. In this paper we describe our attempts on
syllabification and segmenting Myanmar sentences
into words. After a brief discussion of the corpus
collection and pre-processing phases, we describe
our approaches to syllabification and tokenization
into words.
Computational and quantitative studies in Myan-
mar are relatively new. Lexical resources available
are scanty. Development of electronic dictionaries
and other lexical resources will facilitate Natural
Language Processing tasks such as Spell Checking,
Machine Translation, Automatic Text summariza-
tion, Information Extraction, Automatic Text Cate-
gorization, Information Retrieval and so on (Murthy,
2006).
Over the last few years, we have developed mono-
lingual text corpora totalling to about 2,141,496
sentences and English-Myanmar parallel corpora
amounting to about 80,000 sentences and sentence
fragments, aligned at sentence and word levels. We
have also collected word lists from these corpora
and also from available dictionaries. Currently our
word list includes about 800,000 words including in-
flected forms.
2 Myanmar
Words
Myanmar words are sequences of syllables. The syl-
lable structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which
is to say the onset consists of a consonant option-
ally followed by a glide, and the rhyme consists of
a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a con-
sonant, or a diphthong with a consonant

. Some
representative words are:
• CV [mei] girl
• CVC [me

• CGV [mjei] earth
• CGVC [mje
prime
]eye

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese language
• CVVC [maun] (term of address for young men)
• CGVVC [mjaun] ditch
Words in the Myanmar language can be divided
into simple words, compound words and complex
words (Tint, 2004),(MLC, 2005),(Judson, 1842).
Some examples of compound words and loan words
are given below.

3 Corpus
Collection and Preprocessing
Development of lexical resources is a very tedious
and time consuming task and purely manual ap-
proaches are too slow. We have downloaded Myan-
mar texts from various web sites including news
sites including official newspapers, on-line maga-
zines, trial e-books (over 300 full books) as well as
free and trial texts from on-line book stores includ-
ing a variety of genres, types and styles modern and
ancient, prose and poetry, and example sentences
from dictionaries. As of now, our corpus includes
2,141,496 sentences.
The downloaded corpora need to be cleaned up to
remove hypertext markup and we need to extract text
if in pdf format. We have developed the necessary
scripts in Perl for this. Also, different sites use dif-
ferent font formats and character encoding standards
are not yet widely followed. We have mapped these
various formats into the standard WinInnwa font for-
mat. We have stored the cleaned up texts in ASCII
format and these pre-processed corpora are seen to
be reasonably clean.

4 Collecting
Word Lists
Electronic dictionaries can be updated much more
easily than published printed dictionaries, which
need more time, cost and man power to bring out
a fresh edition. Word lists and dictionaries in elec-
tronic form are of great value in computational lin-
guistics and NLP. Here we describe our efforts in
developing a large word list for Myanmar.
4.1 Independent
Words
As we keep analyzing texts, we can identify some
words that can appear independently without com-
bining with other words or suffixes. We build a list
of such valid words and we keep adding new valid
words as we progress through our segmentation pro-
cess, gradually developing larger and larger lists of
valid words. We have also collected from sources
such as Myanmar Orthography(MLC, 2003), CD
versions of English-English-Myanmar (Student’s
Dictionary)(stu, 2000) and English-Myanmar Dic-
tionary (EMd, ) and Myanmar-French Dictionary
(damma sami, 2004). Currently our word list in-
cludes 800,000 words.
4.2 Stop
Word Removal
Stop words include prepositions/post-positions, con-
junctions, particles, inflections etc. which ap-
pear as suffixes added to other words. They
form closed classes and hence can be listed. Pre-
liminary studies therefore suggested that Myan-
mar words can be recognized by eliminating these
stop words. Hopple (Hopple, 2003) also notices
that particles ending phrases can be removed to
recognize words in a sentence. We have col-
lected stop words by analyzing official newspa-
pers, Myanmar grammar text books and CD ver-
sions of English-English-Myanmar (Student’s Dic-
tionary)(stu, 2000), English-Myanmar Dictionary
(EMd, ) and The Khit Thit English-Myanmar dictio-
nary (Saya, 2000). We have also looked at stop word
lists in English (www.syger.com, ) and mapped them
to equivalent stop words in Myanmar. See Table 1.
As of now, our stop words list contains 1216 en-
tries. Stop words can be prefixes of other stop words
leading to ambiguities. However, usually the longest
matching stop word is the right choice.
Identifying and removing stop words does not

Table 1: Stop-words of English Vs Myanmar
always necessarily lead to correct segmentation of
sentences into words. Both under and over segmen-
tation are possible. When stop-words are too short,
over segmentation can occur. Under segmentation
can occur when no stop-words occur between words.
Examples of segmentation can be seen in Table 2.
We have observed that over segmentation is more
frequent than under segmentation.

4.3 Syllable
N-grams
Myanmar language uses a syllabic writing system
unlike English and many other western languages
which use an alphabetic writing system. Interest-
ingly, almost every syllable has a meaning in Myan-
mar language. This can also be seen from the work
of Hopple (Hopple, 2003).
Myanmar Natural Language Processing Group
has listed 1894 syllables that can appear in Myan-
mar texts (Htut, 2001). We have observed that there
are more syllables in use, especially in foreign words
including Pali and Sanskrit words which are widely
used in Myanmar. We have collected other pos-

sible syllables from the Myanmar-English dictio-
nary(MLC, 2002). Texts collected from the Internet
show lack of standard typing sequences. There are
several possible typing sequences and correspond-
ing internal representations for a given syllable. We
include all of these possible variants in our list. Now
we have over 4550 syllables.

Table 4: Syllable Structure of Words
We have developed scripts in Perl to syllabify
words using our list of syllables as a base and then
generate n-gram statistics using Text::Ngrams which
is developed by Vlado Keselj (Keselj, 2006). This
program is quite fast and it took only a few min-
utes on a desktop PC in order to process 3.5M bytes
of Myanmar texts. We have used “-type=word” op-
tion treating syllables as words. We had to mod-
ify this program a bit since Myanmar uses zero (as
“(0) wa ” letter) and the other special characters (
“,”, “<”, “>”, “.”, “&”, “[”,“]” etc.) which were be-
ing ignored in the original Text::Ngrams software.
We collect all possible words which is composed
of n-grams of syllables up to 5-grams. Table 1
shows some words which are collected through n-
gram analysis. Almost all monograms are meaning-
ful words. Many bi-grams are also valid words and
as we move towards longer n-grams, we generally
get less and less number of valid words. See Table
3. Further, frequency of occurrence of these n-grams
is a useful clue. See Table 4.
By analyzing the morphological structure of
words we will be able to analyze inflected and de-
rived word forms. A set of morphemes and mor-
phological forms have been collected from (MLC,
2005) and (Judson, 1842) . See Table 5. For exam-
ple, the four-syllable word in Table 3 is an adverb
“DCD0BNDCD0BND9C2D9C2” [htu: htu: ke: ke:] outstanding derived
from the verb “DCD0BND9C2”. See Table 3.
Statistical construction of machine readable dic-
tionaries has many advantages. New words which
appear from time to time such as Internet, names
of medicines, can also be detected. Compounds
words also can be seen. Common names such
as names of persons, cities, committees etc. can
be also mined. Once sufficient data is available,
statistical analysis can be carried and techniques
such as mutual information and maximum entropy
can be used to hypothesize possible words.
4.4 Words
from Dictionaries
Collecting words using the above three mentioned
methods has still not covered all the valid words
in our corpus. We have got only 150,000 words.
Words collected from n-grams needs exhaustive hu-
man effort to pick the valid words. We have
therefore collected words from two on-line dictio-
naries the English-English-Myanmar (Student’s
Dictionary) (stu, 2000), English-Myanmar Dictio-
nary (EMd, ) and from two e-books French-
Myanmar(damma sami, 2004), and Myanmar Or-
thography (MLC, 2003). Fortunately, these texts
can be transformed into winninnwa font. We have

Myanmar Spelling Bible lists only lemma (root
words). We have suffixed some frequently used mor-
phological forms to these root words.
There are lots of valid words which are not de-
scribed in published dictionaries. The entries of
words in the Myanmar-English dictionary which is
produced by the Department of the Myanmar Lan-
guage Commission are mainly words of the com-
mon Myanmar vocabulary. Most of the compound
words have been omitted in the dictionary (MLC,
2002). This can be seen in the preface and guide
to the dictionary of the Myanmar-English dictio-
nary produced by Department of the Myanmar Lan-
guage Commission, Ministry of Education. 4-
syllables words like “ DCD0BNDCD0BND5CTCUBND5CTCUBN ”[htu: htu:
zan: zan:] (strange), “ DCD0BNDCD0BND9C2D9C2 ” [htu: htu: ke:

gja:](different)(see Table 3) are not listed in dictio-
nary although we usually use those words in every
day life.
With all this, we have been able to collect a total
of about 800,000 words. As we have collected words
from various sources and techniques, we believe we
have fairly good data for further work.

5 Syllabification
and Word Segmentation
Since dictionaries and other lexical resources are not
yet widely available in electronic form for Myanmar
language, we have collected 4550 possible syllables
including those used in Pali and foreign words such
as BWD1DCBRDBD9GYBRDBBWBNDACU ), considering different typing se-
quences and corresponding internal representations,
and from the 800,000 strong Myanmar word-list we
have built. With the help of these stored syllables
and word lists, we have carried out syllabification
and word segmentation as described below. Many
researchers have used longest string matching (An-
gell et al., 1983),(Ari et al., 2001) and we follow the
same approach.
The first step in building a word hypothesizer is
syllabification of the input text by looking up sylla-
ble lists. In the second step, we exploit lists of words
(viewed as n-grams at syllable level) for word seg-
mentation from left to right.
5.1 Syllabification
As an initial attempt we use longest string matching
alone for Myanmar text syllabification. Examples
are shown in Table 7.
Pseudo code Here we go from left-to-right in a
greedy manner:

End while

}
We have evaluated our syllables list on a collec-
tion of 11 short novels entitled “Orchestra” D3C0B9
D4C0CZDBBWBNBCCZCSCXCUBN[than zoun ti: wain:], written by “Nikoye”
(Ye, 1997) which includes 2,728 sentences spread
over 259 pages including a total of 70,384 sylla-
bles. These texts were syllabified using the longest
matching algorithm over our syllable list and we
observed that only 0.04% of the actual syllables
were not detected. The Table 6 shows that differ-
ent typing sequences of syllables were also detected.
Here are some examples of failure: D6CZCSBVCUBN[rkdCf;]and
D6CZCSDACUBN[rkdvf;] which are seldom used in text. The typ-
ing sequence is also wrong. Failures are generally
traced to
• differing combinations of writing sequences
• loan words borrowed from foreign languages
• rarely used syllables not listed in our list
5.2 Word
Segmentation
We have carried out tokenization with longest sylla-
ble word matching using our 800,000 strong stored
word list. This word list has been built from avail-
able sources such as dictionaries, through the ap-
plication of morphological rules, and by generating
syllables n-grams and manually checking. An exam-
ple sentence and its segmentation is given in Table
8.
Load the set of words from word-file
for-each word do
i← syllabification(word);
Store all words of syllable length i in N
i
where i =10..1
End for
Load the sentences to be processed from sentence-file

6 Evaluation
and Observations
We have segmented 5000 sentences including a to-
tal of (35049 words) with our programs and manu-
ally checked for evaluating the performance. These
sentences are from part of the English-Myanmar
parallel corpus being developed by us (Htay et al.,
2006). The program recognized 34943 words of
which 34633 words were correct, thus giving us a
Recall of 98.81% and a Precision of 99.11%. The
F-Measure is 98.95%. The algorithm suffers in ac-
curacy in two ways:
Out-of-vocabulary Words: Segmentation error
can occur when the words are not listed in
dictionary. No lexicon contains every possible
word of a language. There always exist
out-of-vocabulary words such as new derived
words, new compounds words, morphological
variations of existing words and technical
words (Park, 2002). In order to check the effect
of out-of-vocabulary words, we took a new
set of 1000 sentences (7343 words). We have
checked manually and noticed 329 new words,
that is about 4% of the words are not found in
our list, giving us a coverage of about 96%.
Limitations of left-to-right processing:
Segmentation errors can also occur due to
the limitations of the left-to-right processing.
See the example 1 in Table 9. The algorithm
suffers most in recognizing the sentences
which have the word He D3D0 [thu] followed by a
negative verb starting with the particle D6[ma.].
The program wrongly segments she as he. Our
text collection obtains from various sources
and the word “she” is used as D3D0D6 [thu ma.] in
modern novels and Internet text. Therefore, our

Table 8: A sentence being segmented into words
word list contains sheD3D0D6. This problem can be
solved by standardization. Myanmar Language
Commission (MLC, 1993) has advised that the
words “she” and “he” should be written only
as D3D0 and the word D3D0D6 representing a feminine
pronoun should not be used. For example 2 in
Table 9, the text D8D1BNCPDDBND3D2CU can be segmented
into two ways. 1) D8D1BNCPDDBND3D2CU [a: pei: thi] which
means “encourage” and 2) D8D1BN [particle for
indicating dative case] and CPDDBND3D2CU give [pei:
thi]. Because of greedy search from left to
right, our algorithm will always segment as
D8D1BNCPDDBND3D2CUno matter what the context is.
In order to solve these problems, we are plan to
use machine learning techniques which 1) can also
detect real words dynamically (Park, 2002) while we
are segmenting the words and 2) correct the greedy
cut from left to right using frequencies of the words
from the training samples.
Although our work presented here is for Myan-
mar, we believe that the basic ideas can be applied
to any script which is primarily syllabic in nature.
7 Conclusions
Since words are not uniformly delimited by spaces
in Myanmar script, segmenting sentences into words
is an important task for Myanmar NLP. In this pa-
per we have described the need and possible tech-
niques for segmentation in Myanmar script. In par-
ticular, we have used a combination of stored lists,
suffix removal, morphological analysis and syllable
level n-grams to hypothesize valid words with about
99% accuracy. Necessary scripts have been writ-
ten in Perl. Over the last few years, we have col-
lected monolingual text corpora totalling to about
2,141,496 sentences and English-Myanmar parallel
corpora amounting to about 80,000 sentences and
sentence fragments, aligned at sentence and word
levels. We have also built a list of 1216 stop words,
4550 syllables and 800,000 words from a variety
of sources including our own corpora. We have
used fairly simple and intuitive methods not requir-
ing deep linguistic insights or sophisticated statisti-
cal inference. With this initial work, we now plan
to apply a variety of machine learning techniques.
We hope this work will help to accelerate work in
Myanmar language and larger lexical resources will
be developed soon.
