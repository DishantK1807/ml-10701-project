Slocum, Jonathan (1981).

Â°This formulation is again equivalent to the one in Thompson (1981:4).

Thompson (1981) is another fundamental source, though he discusses the effects of various ruleinvocation strategies mainly from the perspective of GPSG parsing which is not the main point here.

Instead, it takes care of fillers and gaps through a ~threading" technique (Karttunen 1986:77).
C86-1016
For example, a measure of the amount of work done at each vertex by the procedure which implements ~the fundamental rule" (Thompson 1981:2) can be expressed as the product of the number of incoming active edges and the number of outgoing inactive edges.
P81-1036
As for empirical studies, Slocum (1981) is a rich source.
P81-1001
Descriptions of top-down filtering are given for example in Kay (1982) (~directed bottom-up parsing") and in Slocum (1981:2).

6This formulation is equivalent to the one in Thompson (1981:4).

This tendency has manifested itself with respect to linguistic tools, perhaps seen most clearly in the evolution from ATNs with their strongly procedural grammars to PATR-II in its various incarnations (Shieber et al.1983, Karttunen 1986), and to logic-based formalisms such as DCG (Pereira and Warren 1980).

Previously a number of comparisons of ruleinvocation strategies in this or in similar settings have been reported: ZThis term seems to have been coined by Thompson (1981).
