upenn, edu Abstract Most existing anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to account only for anaphors with NP-antecedents.
This paper describes an algorithm for the resolution of discourse deictic anaphors, which constitute a large percentage of anaphors in spoken dialogues.
The success of the resolution is dependent on the classification of all pronouns and demonstratives into individual, discourse deictic and vague anaphora.
Finally, the empirical results of the application of the algorithm to a corpus of spoken dialogues are presented.
1 Introduction
Most anaphora resolution algorithms are designed to deal with the co-indexing relation between anaphors and NP-antecedents.
In the spoken language corpus we examined the Switchboard corpus of telephone conversations (LDC, 1993) this type of link only accounts for 45.1% of all anaphoric references.
Another 22.6% are anaphors whose referents are not individual, concrete entities but events, facts and propositions, e.g., (1) B.7: A.8: \[We never know what they're thinking\]/.
Thati's right.
\[I don't trust them\]j, maybe I guess itj's because of what happened over there with their own people, how they threw them out of power.
(sw3241) Whilst there have been attempts to classify abstract objects and the rules governing anaphoric reference to them (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 1995), there have been no exhaustive, empirical studies using actual resolution algorithms.
These have so far only been applied to written corpora.
However, the high frequency of abstract object anaphora in dialogues means that any attempt to resolve anaphors in spoken language cannot succeed without taking this into account.
Summarised below are some issues specific to anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these problems in their account of the Centering model (Grosz et al., 1995)).
Center of attention in multi-party discourse.
In spontaneous speech it is possible that the participants of a dialogue may not be focussing on the same entity at a given point in the discourse.
Utterances with no discourse entities.
E.g., Uhhuh; yeah; right.
Byron and Stent (1998) and Walker (1998) assign no importance to such utterances in their models.
We assume that these also can be used to acknowledge a preceding utterance.
Abandoned or partial utterances.
Speakers may interrupt each other or make speech repairs, e.g., (2) Uh, our son/has this kind of, you know, he/'s, well hei started out going Stephen F Austin (sw3117) Self-corrected speech cannot be ignored as can be seen by the fact that the entity referred to by the NP our son is subsequently referred to by a pronoun and must therefore have entered the discourse model.
Determination of utterance boundaries.
Most anaphor resolution algorithms rely on a syntactic definition of utterance which cannot be provided by spoken dialogue as there is no punctuation to mark complete sentences.
These issues are dealt with by our method of segmenting dialogues into dialogue acts with specified discourse functions.
In addition, our approach presents a simple classification of individual and abstract object anaphors and uses separate algorithms for each class.
We build on the recall rate of state-of-the-art pronoun resolution algorithms but we achieve a far higher precision than would be achieved by applying these to spoken language because the classification of 37 Proceedings of EACL '99 anaphors prevents the algorithm from co-indexing discourse deictic anaphora with individual antecedents.
Section 2 gives definitions and frequency of occurrence of the different anaphor types.
Section 3 describes the segmentation of the dialogues into dialogue acts and the influence of these on the entities in the discourse model.
Section 4 presents the method we use for resolving anaphors and the corresponding algorithm.
In Section 5, we report on the corpus annotation and the evaluation of the algorithm.
2 Anaphor
Types in Dialogues In the dialogues examined, only 45.1% of the anaphors are individual anaphors, i.e., anaphors with NPantecedents (IPro, IDem), e.g., (3) Boeing ought to hire himi and give him/ a junkyardj.... and see if hei could build a Seven Forty-Seven out of itj.
(sw2102) 22.6% of the anaphors are discourse deictic, i.e. co-specify with non-NP constituents such as VPs, sentences, strings of sentences (DDPro, DDDem; cf.
Webber (1991)).
The phenomenon of discourse deictic anaphora in written texts has been shown to be strongly dependent on discourse structure.
As can also be seen in the examples below, anaphoric reference is restricted to elements adjacent to the utterance containing the anaphor, i.e., those on the right frontier of the discourse structure tree (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993): (4) A.46: \[The government don't tell you everything.\]i B.47: I knowit/ (sw3241) (5) Now why didn't she \[take him over there with her\]i?
No, she didn't do thati.
(sw4877) The existence of abstract object anaphora shows that aside from individual entities, the discourse model may also contain complex, higher-order entities.
One of the differences between individual and discourse deictic anaphora is that whereas a concrete NP antecedent usually only refers to the individual it describes, a sentence may simultaneously denote an eventuality, a concept, a proposition and a fact.
Instead of assuming that all levels of abstract objects are introduced to the discourse model by the sentence that makes them available, it has been suggested that anaphoric discourse deictic reference involves referent coercion (Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Dahl and Hellman, 1995).
This assumption is further justified by the fact that discourse deictic reference, as opposed to individual anaphoric reference, is often established 38 by demonstratives rather than pronouns.
In theories relating cognitive status and choice of NP-form (cf.
Gundel et al.(1993)), pronouns are only available for the most salient entities, whereas demonstratives can be used to shift the focus of attention to a different entity.
A further 19.1% of anaphors are InferrableEvoked Pronouns (IEPro) and constitute a particular type of plural pronoun which indirectly co-specifies with a singular antecedent.
This group includes existential, generic and corporate 3rd person plural pronouns (Jaeggli, 1986; Belletti and Rizzi, 1988).
(6) I think the Soviet Union knows what we have and knows that we're pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything, we would, we would be on the offensive.
(sw3241) In (6), the NP Soviet Union can be associated with inferrables such as the population or the government.
These can subsequently be referred to by pronouns without having been explicitly mentioned themselves.
In some cases of IEPro's there is no associated NP, as in the following example, where the speaker is referring to the organisers of the Switchboard calls: (7) this is the first call I've done \[...\] and, I didn't realize that they ha-, were going to reach out to people from \[...\] all over the country.
(sw2041) 13.2% of the anaphors are vague (VagPro, VagDem), in the sense that they refer to the general topic of conversation and, as opposed to discourse deictic anaphors, do not have a specific clause as an antecedent, e.g., (8) B.29: I mean, the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams.
A.30: Uh-huh.
B.31 : Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there.
They're not even there yet A.32: Uh-huh.
B.33: -you know.
A.34: Yeah.
It's hard.
Non-referring pronouns, or expletives, were not marked.
These include subjects of weather verbs, those in raising verb constructions or those occurring in sentences with extraposed sentential subjects or objects, e.g., (9) It's hard to realize, that there are places that are just so, uh, bare on the shelves as there.
(sw2403) This group also contains the various subcategorised expletives (Postal and Pullum, 1988), defined as being non-referring pronouns in argument positions, e.g., Proceedings of EACL '99 (10) Uh, they don't need somebody else coming in and saying, you know, okay we're going to be with them and we're going to zap it to you.
(sw2403) (11) When it comes to trucks, though, I would probably think to go American.
(sw2326) They differ from referring anaphors in that they cannot be questioned (e.g., *When what comes to trucks ?).
3 Synchronising
Units The domain which contains potential antecedents is not given in syntactic terms in spoken dialogue.
Hence we define this domain in pragmatic terms.
We assume that discourse entities enter the joint discourse model and are available for subsequent reference when common ground between the discourse participants is established.
Our model builds on the observation that certain dialogue acts in particular acknowledgments signal that common ground is achieved.
Our assumptions are based on Clark's (1989) theory of contributions (cf.
also Traum (1994)).
Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts Initiations I and Acknowledgments A based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al.(1997). Each sentence and each conjoined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are part of the same turn.
A's do not convey semantic content but have a pragmatic function (e.g., backchannel).
In addition there are utterances which function as an A but also have semantic content these are labelled as A/I.
A single I is paired with an A and they jointly form a Synchronising Unit (SU).
In longer turns, each main clause functions as a separate unit along with its subordinate clauses.
Single I's constitute SU's by themselves and do not require explicit acknowledgment.
The assumption is that by letting the speaker continue, the hearer implicitly acknowledges the utterance.
It is only in the context of turn-taking that I's and A's are paired up.
Our model is based on the observation that common ground has an influence on attentional state.
We assume that only entities in a complete SU are entered into the common ground and remain in the Slist for the duration of a further SU.
If one speaker's I is not acknowledged by the other participant it cannot be included in an SU.
In this case the discourse entities mentioned in the unacknowledged I are added to the S-List but are immediately deleted again when the subsequent I clearly shows that they are not part of the common ground.
Figure 1 below, taken from the Trains-corpus (speakers s and u) illustrates that a missing acknowl39 edgment prevents the discourse model from containing discourse entities from the unacknowledged turn.
SUi I s: so therethe five boxcars of oranges <sil> + that are at+ S-List: \[5 boxcars of oranges\] SUj A/I u: +at <sil> +atComing S-List: \[5 boxcars of oranges, Coming\] A s: urn I u: okay the orange warehouse <sil> urn I + have to + S-List: \[Coming, orange warehouse\] SUk I S: yOU need + you need to get five <sil> five boxcars of oranges there S-List: \[Coming, 5 boxcars of oranges\] A u: uh SOt I no they're are already waiting for me there (d92a-4.3) Figure 1: Unacknowledged Turns Speaker u's second turn is an I which is not followed by an A.
This means that the entity referred to in that utterance (orange warehouse) is immediately removed from the joint discourse model.
Thus there in the final two turns co-specifies with Coming and not the most recent orange warehouse.
4 How
to Resolve Discourse Deictic Anaphora We now turn to our method of anaphora resolution, which extends the algorithm presented in Strube (1998), in order to be able to account for discourse deictic anaphora as well as individual anaphora.
4.1 Anaphor-anteeedent Compatibility As indicated in Section 2, information provided by the subcategorisation frame of the anaphor's predicate can be used to determine the type of the referent.
In the algorithm, we make use of the notion of anaphorantecedent Compatibility to distinguish between discourse deictic and individual reference.
Certain predicates (notably verbs of propositional attitude) require one of their arguments to have a referent whose meaning is correlated with sentences, e.g., is true, assume (referred to as SC-bias verbs in Garnsey et al.(1997) and elsewhere).
Pronouns in these positions rarely have concrete individual NP-antecedents and are generally only compatible with discourse deictic referents.
Other argument positions are preferentially associated with concrete individuals (e.g., objects of eat, smell) (DO-bias verbs).
A summary of these predicate types is provided in Figure 2, where l-incompatible Proceedings of EACL '99 I-Incompatible (*I) Equating constructions where a pronominal referent is equated with an abstract object, e.g., x is making it easy, x is a suggestion.
Copula constructions whose adjectives can only be applied to abstract entities, e.g., x is true, x is false, x is correct, x is right, x isn't right.
• Arguments of verbs describing propositional attitude which only take S'-complements, e.g., assume.
• Object of do.
• Predicate or anaphoric referent is a "reason", e.g., x is because I like her, x is why he ' s late.
A-Incompatible (*A) Equating constructions where a pronominal referent is equated with a concrete individual referent, e.g., x is a car.
Copula constructions whose adjectives can only be applied to concrete entities, e.g., x is expensive, x is tasty, x is loud.
Arguments of verbs describing physical contact/stimulation, which cannot be used metaphorically, e.g., break x, smash x, eat x, drink x, smell x but NOT *see x Figure 2: I-Incompatibility and A-Incompatibility means preferentially associated with abstract objects and A-incompatible means preferentially associated with individual objects 1.
Anaphors which are argument positions of the first type are classified as discourse deictic (DDPro; DDDem), those in argument positions of the second type are classified as individual anaphora (IPro; IDem).
It is clear that predicate information alone is not sufficient for this purpose as there is a large group of verbs which allow both individual and discourse deictic referents (e.g., objects of see, know) (EQ-bias verbs).
In these cases the preference is determined by NP-form of the anaphor (pronoun vs.
demonstrative). 4.2 Types of Abstract Antecedents We follow Asher (1993) in assuming that the predicate of a discourse deictic anaphor determines the type of abstract object.
An anaphor in the object position of the verb do, for example, can only have a VP (eventconcept) antecedent (eg John \[sang\].
Bill did that too.), whereas an anaphor in the subject position of the predicate is true requires a full S (proposition) (eg \[John sang\].
That's true.).
This verbal subcategorisation information is used to determine which part of the preceding I is required to form the correct referent.
Following Webber and others, we assume that an abstract object is only introduced to the discourse model by the anaphor itself.
In addition to the S-List (Strube, 1998), which contains the referents of NPs available for anaphoric reference, our model includes ~These are preferences and not strict rules because some l-Incompatible contexts are compatible with NPs denoting abstract objects, e.g., The story/It is true.
and NPs which are used to stand elliptically for an event or state, e.g., His car/It is the reason why he's late.
This shows that predicate compatibility must ultimately be defined in semantic terms and not just rely on syntactic strings (NP vs.
S). 40 an A-List for abstract objects.
This is only filled if discourse deictic pronouns or demonstratives occur and its contents remain only for one I, which is necessary for multiple discourse deictic reference to the same entity.
The following context ranking describes the order in which the parts of the linguistic context are accessed: 1.
A-List (containing abstract objects previously referred to anaphorically).
2. Within same I: Clause to the left of the clause containing the anaphor.
3. Within previous I: Rightmost main clause (and subordinated clauses to its right).
4. Within previous rs: Rightmost complete sentence (if previous I is incomplete sentence).
Figure 3: Context Ranking 4.3 The Algorithm The algorithm consists of two branches, one for the resolution of pronouns, the other for the resolution of demonstratives.
Both of them call the functions resolveDD and resolvelnd, which resolve discourse deictic anaphora and individual anaphora, respectively.
If a pronoun is encountered (Figure 4, below), the functions resolveDD or resolvelnd (described below) are evaluated, depending on whether the pronoun is Iincompatible (1) or A-incompatible (2).
In the case of success the pronouns are classified as DDPro or lPro, respectively.
In the case of failure, the pronouns are classified as VagPro.
If the pronoun is neither Inor A-incompatible (i.e., the pronoun is ambiguous in this respect), the classification is only dependent on the Proceedings of EACL '99 1.
if (PRO is I-incompatible) then if resolveDD(PRO) then classify as DDPro else classify as VagPro 2.
else if (PRO is A-incompatible) then if resolvelnd(PRO) then classify as IPro else classify as VagPro 3.
else if resolvelnd(PRO) then classify as IPro 4.
else if resolveDD(PRO) then classify as DDPro else classify as VagPro Figure 4: Pronoun Resolution Algorithm 1.
if (DEM is I-incompatible) then if resolveDD(DEM) then classify as DDDem else classify as VagDem 2.
else if (DEM is A-incompatible) then if resolveInd(DEM) then classify as IDem else classify as VagDem 3.
else if resolveDD(DEM) then classify as DDDem 4.
else if resolvelnd(DEM) then classify as IDem else classify as VagDem Figure 5: Demonstrative Resolution Algorithm success of the resolution.
The function resolvelnd is evaluated first (3) because of the observed preference for individual antecedents for pronouns,.
If successful, the pronoun is classified as IPro, if unsuccessful, the function resolveDD attempts to resolve the pronoun (4).
If this, in turn, is successful, the pronoun is classified as DDPro, if it is unsuccessful it is classified as VagPro, indicating that the pronoun cannot be resolved using the linguistic context.
The procedure is similar in the case of demonstrafives (Figure 5, below).
The only difference being that the antecedent of a demonstrative is preferentially an abstract object.
The order of (3) and (4) is therefore reversed.
We now turn to the function resolveDD (Figure 6, below) (assuming that resolvelnd resolves individual anaphora and returns true or false depending on its success).
In step (1) the function resolveDD examines all elements of the context ranking (Figure 3) until the function co-index succeeds, which evaluates whether the element is of the right type.
Then the function resolveDD returns true.
If the pronoun is an argument of "do", the function co-index is tried on the VP of the current element of the context ranking (2).
If successful, the VP-referent is added to the A-List and the function returns true.
In (3), co-index evaluates whether the pronoun and the current element of the context ranking are compatible.
In the case of a positive result, the element is added to the A-List and true is returned.
If all elements of the context ranking are resolveDD(PRO) := 1.
foreach element of context ranking do 2.
if (PRO is argument of do) then if (co-index PRO with VP of element) then add VP to A-List; return true 3.
else if (co-index PRO with element) then add element to A-List; return true 4.
return false.
Figure 6: resolveDD 41 checked without success, resolveDD returns false (4).
Example 12 illustrates the algorithm: (12) B.8: I mean, if went and policed, just like you say, every country when they had squabbles, A.9: Well, but we've done it before, B.10: Oh, I know we have.
A. 11 : and it has not been successful.
(sw2403) When the pronoun "it" in A.9 is encountered, the algorithm determines the pronoun to be Iincompatible (Step 1 in Figure 4), as it is the object argument of the verb do.
The function resolveDD is evaluated.
The A-List is empty, so the highest ranked element in the context ranking is the last complete sentence in B.8.
The pronoun is an argument of "do", therefore gets co-indexed with the VP-referent of the sentence in B.8.
The VP is added to the A-List, the function returns true and the pronoun is classified as DDPro by the algorithm.
When the next pronoun is encountered, the AList is empty again because of the intervening sentence (I) in B.10.
The pronoun is neither Inor A-incompatible, therefore the algorithm evaluates resolvelnd (step 3).
This fails, since there are no individual antecedents available in B.
10 and the algorithm evaluates resolveDD in the step (4).
The first element in the context ranking is the main clause in A.
11 which is co-indexed with the pronoun.
The clause-referent is added to the A-List, the function returns true and the algorithm classifies the pronoun as DDPro.
In this case, the classification is correct but not the resolution, since the pronoun should co-specify with the pronoun in A.9. 5 Empirical Evaluation In order to test the hypotheses made in the previous sections we performed an empirical evaluation on natProceedings of EACL '99 urally occurring dialogues.
First, the corpus was annotated for all relevant features, i.e., division of turns into dialogue act units, classification of dialogue acts (I, A), marking of noun phrases, classification of the various types of anaphors introduced in Section 2, and annotating coreference between anaphors and individual/abstract discourse entities.
The last step provided the key for the test of the algorithm described in Section 4.3. 5.1 Annotation Our data consisted of five randomly selected dialogues from the Switchboard corpus of spoken telephone conversations (LDC, 1993).
Two dialogues (SW2041, SW4877) were used to train the two annotators (the authors), and three further dialogues for testing (SW2403, SW3117, SW3241).
The training dialogues were used for improving the annotation manual and for clarifying the annotation in borderline cases.
After each step the annotations were compared using the ~ statistic as reliability measure for all classification tasks (Carletta, 1996).
A t~ of 0.68 < ~ < 0.80 allows tentative conclusions while ~ > 0.80 indicates reliability between the annotators.
In the following tables, the rows on above the horizontal line show how often a particular class was actually marked as such by both annotators.
In the rows below the line, N shows the total number of markables, while Z gives the number of agreements between the annotations.
PA is percent agreement between the annotators, PE expected agreement by chance.
Finally, ~ is computed by the formula PA PE/1 PE.
Dialogue Acts.
First, turns were segmented into dialogue act units.
We turned the segmentation task into a classification task by using boundaries between dialogue acts as one class and non-boundaries as the other (see Passonneau and Litman (1997) for a similar practice).

For this test we used only these dialogue act units which the annotators agreed about.

For this task we cannot provide reliability scores using n because it is not a classification task.
It is much more difficult than the previous ones, as the problem consists of identifying the correct beginning and end of the string which cospecifies with the anaphor.
We used only the abstract anaphors whose classification both annotators agreed upon.
The annotators then marked the antecedents and co-indexed them with the anaphors.
The results were compared and the annotators agreed upon a reconciled version of the data.
Annotator accuracy was then measured against the reconciled version.
Accuracy ranged from 85,7% (Annotator A) to 94,3% (Annotator B).

Of the 28 anaphors resolved incorrectly, only 11 were classified correctly.
One of the most common errors in classification was, that an anaphor annotated as vague (VagPro, VagDem) was classified by the algorithm as discourse deictic (DDPro, DDDem).
Classification is dependent on resolution, so since the context almost always provides an antecedent for a discourse deictic anaphor, it is possible to classify and resolve a vague anaphor incorrectly, as in Example 13: (13) A: \[I don't know\]/, I think it/ really depends a lot on the child.
(sw3117) 6 Comparison to Related Work Both Webber(1991) and Asher (1993) describe the phenomenon of abstract object anaphora and present restrictions on the set of potential antecedents.
They do not, however, concern themselves with the problem of how to classify a certain pronoun or demonstrative as individual or abstract.
Also, as they do not give preferences on the set of potential candidates, their approaches are not intended as attempts to resolve abstract object anaphora.
Concerning anaphora resolution in dialogues, only little research has been carried out in this area to our knowledge.
LuperFoy (1992) does not present a corpus study, meaning that statistics about the distribution of individual and abstract object anaphora or about the success rate of her approach are not available.
Byron and Stent (1998) present extensions of the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) for spoken dialogue and identify several problems with the model.
We have chosen Strube's (1998) model for the resolution of individual anaphora as basis because it avoids the problems encountered by Byron & Stent, who also do not present data on the resolution of pronouns in dialogues and do not mention abstract object anaphora.
Dagan and Itai (1991) describe a corpus-based approach to the resolution of pronouns, which is evaluated for the neuter pronoun "it".
Again, abstract object anaphora are not mentioned.
7 Conclusions
and Future Work In this paper we presented a method for resolving abstract object anaphora in spoken language.
We consider our approach to be a first step towards the unconstrained resolution of anaphora in dialogue.
The results of our method show that the recall is fairly high while the precision is relatively low.
This indicates that the anaphor classification requires improvement, in particular the notion of Compatibility.
Lists of verb biases for sentential and NP complements, as described in psycholinguistic studies (e.g.
Garnsey et al.(1997)), could be used to classify verbs.
Currently exisiting lists only account for a small number of verbs but there may be the possibility of adding statistical information from large corpora of spoken dialogue.
Furthermore, the algorithm currently ignores abstract NPs (e.g., story, exercising) when looking for antecedents for anaphors with 1-incompatible predicates.
We are considering determining the feature abstract for all NPs in order to identify those which can act as antecedents in such contexts.
Information such as this could be used by the algorithm to prevent the anaphor classification from being dependent on anaphor resolution.
