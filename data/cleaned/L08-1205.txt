All regional archives are added to the MPI’s “Language-Sites” overlay [7] for Google Earth, by means of which users can reach the catalog of the regional archive by clicking on a link in the Google Earth interface (see van Uytvanck et al. 2008).

The concept of synchronized regional archives is based on the LAMUS (Broeder et al. 2006, [8]) archive management system and the aforementioned IMDI metadata infrastructure, both components turn out to be increasingly stable and robust in the differing circumstances.
