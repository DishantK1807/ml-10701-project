CUE PHRASES (also known as DISCOURSE MARKERS) are linguistic expressions that can be used to convey explicit information about the structure of a discourse or to convey a semantic contribution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen, 1984).

For example, (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) found that cue phrases in general could be disambiguated between their ‘semantic’ and their ‘discourse marker’ uses in terms of the type of pitch accent borne by the cue phrase, the position of the phrase in the intonational phrase, and the amount of additional information in the phrase.
