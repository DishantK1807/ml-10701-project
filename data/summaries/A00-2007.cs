Their results can be converted to baseNPs by making pairs of open and close brackets with large probability scores (Mufioz et al., 1999) or by regarding only the shortest phrases between open and close brackets as baseNPs (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999).
E99-1023
(Cardie and Pierce, 1998) store POS tag sequences that make up complete chunks and use these sequences as rules for classifying unseen data.
P98-1034
An alternative representation for baseNPs has been put forward by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) have build a chunker by applying transformation-based learning to sections of the Penn Treebank.
W95-0107
Like the data used by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), this data was retagged by the Brill tagger in order to obtain realistic part-of-speech (POS) tags 3.
W95-0107
(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) have presented three variants of this tagging representation.
E99-1023
(Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) compare different data representations for this task.

We have applied it to the two data sets mentioned in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
(Argamon et al., 1998) use Memory-Based Sequence Learning for recognizing both NP chunks and VP chunks.
P98-1010
Both (Mufioz et al., 1999) and (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) have shown how classifiers can process bracket structures.
E99-1023
(Van Halteren et al., 1998) and (Brill and Wu, 1998) describe a series of successful experiments for improving the performance of part-of-speech taggers.
P98-1029
And third, 1This (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) baseNP data set is available via ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/chunker/ 2Software for generating the data is available from http://lcg-www.uia.ac.be/conl199/npb/ 50 with the FZ=I rate which is equal to (2*precision*recall)/(precision+recall).
W95-0107
They have used the (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) representation as well (IOB1).
W95-0107
They compare two data representations and report that a representation with bracket structures outperforms the IOB tagging representation introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
Two baseNP data sets have been put forward by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
(Osborne, 1999) extended a definite clause grammar with rules induced by a learner that was based upon the maximum description length principle.
W99-0708
The noun phrases in this data set are the same as in the Treebank and therefore the baseNPs in this data set are slightly different from the ones in the (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) data sets.
W95-0107
The main data set consist of four sections (15-18) of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) as training material and one section (20) as test material 1.
J93-2004
The data was segmented into baseNP parts and nonbaseNP parts in a similar fashion as the data used by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
