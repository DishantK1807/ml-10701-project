Assmnption 1 All lea'teal signs must be indexed, including fltnetional and nonprcdicative elements (Calder cl aal., 1989).
E89-1032
Using ideas from data flow analysis (Kennedy, 1981), predictive parser constructions (Aho et aal., 1986) and feature grammar compilation (Trujillo, 1994) it is possible to construct such a set of triples.
C94-2141
Brew (19921 proposed a constraint propagation technique which eliminates branches during I)ag generation by considering the necessary lh,~ctor-argument relationships that exist between the component basic signs of categorial signs.
C92-2092
This involves the calculation of the fixed point of set equations, analogous to those used in the construction of First sets for predictive parsers (Aho et aal., 1986; Trujillo, 1994).
