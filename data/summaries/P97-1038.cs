Fung and McKeown (1994) propose using a similar measure based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between occurrence recency sequences to improve on the Kvec method.

Introduction Aligned corpora have proved very useful in many tasks, including statistical machine translation, bilingual lexicography (Daille, Gaussier and Lange 1993), and word sense disambiguation (Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992; Chen, Ker, Sheng, and Chang 1997).

Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bitext obtained from an OCR device is quite difficult.
P93-1001
However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English.

Brown et al.(1993) also recommend using a bilingual corpus to train the parameters of Pr(S I 73, translation probability (TP) in the translation model.

Several methods have recently been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993), and for other language pairs such as English-German, English-Chinese, and English-Japanese (Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, Helfman and Satish 1993; Kay and Rtischeisen 1993; Wu 1994).

Thus, dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors (Brown et al.1991) or lexical information, such as cognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a high accuracy rate.

As Chen (1993) points out, dynamic programming is particularly susceptible to deletions occurring in one of the two languages.

Dagan, Church and Gale (1993) recommend aligning words directly without the preprocessing phase of sentence alignment.

These signal and noise can be viewed as a gray-level dotplot (Church and Gale 1991), as Figure 1 shows.

Char_align (Church 1993) is based on the observation that there are many instances of.

In the context of SMT, Brown et al.(1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I 73 for word alignment.
