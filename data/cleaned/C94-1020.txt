1. Introduction An \],;nglish-to-Korean mactdne translation system MATES/EK has been developed through a co-research done by KAIST and SF, RI (Systmns Engineering l.esearch Institute) from 1988 to 1992, and is still under ewflution in KA1ST.
It has several tools snpporting system dew~.lopment, such as the grammar writing language and its de veloping environment, a set of augmented context free grammar for English syntactic analysis, ;rod dictionary editor.
This system has been developed for UNIX workstation.
MATES/EK was originally developed using Common Lisp in order to test the possibility of English-to Korean machine translation, and then it has been totally reconstructed using C language.
Its main target dmmfin is electric/electronic papers and so the dictionary ~tnd the grammars are specitically adjusted to the do*This research is partly supported by Center for ArtiIicial Intelligence Research (CAIR) (1992).

2. Overview of The System MNI'ES/EK is a typical transfi'x-based system, which does English sentence analysis, tnmsforms the result (parse tree) into an intermediate repre-.
sentation, and then transRn'ms it into ~L Korean syntactic structure to construct ~t Korean sentmlce.

• Grammar Writing Language and Its Environment : MATES/EK runs a series of tree transformations on LSS structures from the English syntactic structure, in order to get a structure specific to Korean syntactic structure.
To do this, a grammar writing language and the supporting system were developed for the tree transformations (Kweon, 1992).
The whole tree transformations are done in a single grammar processing system in which a grammar writing language is defined and a set of tools, such as the parser, the interpreter and some debugging facilities for the language, are supported.
In the grammar writing language, a rule describes a tree transformation by specifying the p~ttern of an input tree, test conditions, the transformation operations, and the resultant tree structures.
Figure 2 is an example of a tree transformation rule written in grammar writing language and two trees before and after its apphcation.
MATES/EK consists of a set of dictionaries, a set of grammar rules, and the processing modules.
Translation is done through a series of processes; English morphological analysis, English syntactic analysis, English semantic analysis, EnglishKorean lexical transfer, English-to-Korean structural transformation, Korean syntactic structure generation, and Korean morphologicM generation.
Brief introductions to each processing follows.
3. English Analysis 3.1.
Morphological Analysis It incorporates the method of categorial ambiguity resolution using N-gram with rule combinations, as well as the basic English word identification, such as word separation, processing of Mtixes and recognition of idiomatic phrases (Kim, et M., 1092).
3.2. English Syntactic Analysis It uses the gener~flized Tomita Lit parsing algorithm on augmented context free grammar.
Tile grammar is inductively constructed from 3,000 e~trefully selected sentences that include various linguistic phenomena of English.
Those sentences are mainly selected from the IEEE computer magazine September 1991.
Other sources of the test sentences are HP issue test sentences, ~nd I,ongman English Grammar Textbook.
The constructed grammar for syntax analysis consists of about 500 rules.
As described above, LSg(the Lexical Semantic Structure) is description for the intermediate representation.
The result of syntactic analysis is transformed into an LSS which is relatively more specific to English, and then is transformed into 130 A-samplc-trans tl)ml-!xde { iil(id12 : 2: (A!
(1~! .-tmpl) (C! --trap2)) with { feature conditions, I _var ._lre¢ 1), I';; <~\'\\ actions StlC~l as _acti()n { / <2;'> 0!Z, >, _ _ feature operations A ¢\[1 ..... tml)l tmp2a' a h (I) (ll Impl) |;; (C Imp2)) ..::~!:~:i:~:!::,-..,.. <,,) /'~ ///*'\]\'\~\\ c,i i; i)C b ) ll/\]h ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: ========================== l' \]~.

'.lThe action part describes the necessary transformation operation.
an LSS speeitic to Korean.
3.3. English Semantic Analysis We developed more titan 300 tree transforming rules that are written in grammar writing law guage.
These grammar rules lead the English syntactic structure into a dependency structure of English.
This dependency structure is relatively similar to meaning structure but it is still specitic to English, so we need more tree transformations to get a structure for Korean language.
head in an \];',uglish dependency structure is a \]:;nglish verb word, the hexd in corresponding Korean dependency structure is Korean verb or a,djeclive word, those two words are often not mapped directly, l"igure 3 is an example of transformation from an English syntactic structure into its English specilic dependency structures LSS for a sentence "Pipelining increases \])erformance by exI)loiting instruction-level parallelism".
5. Korean Generation 4.
English to Korean Transfer In this step the system looks up the EnglishKorean bilingual dictionary.
We manage the analysis dictionary separately from the transfer dictionary so that we may use the san, e analysis dictionary to the other language pair such as Fmglish to Japanese with the other transfer dictionary.
There are more than 300 lexicat specitic selection rules developed to make the lexieal selection better.
4.1. English-Korean Structural 'lYansformation Using another tree transformation grammar, the English specific dependency structure is transformed into a Korean language specific dependency structure after looking up the bilingual dictionary.
The dependency structures are represented as head and dependents.
Although the 5.1.
Korean Syntactic Generation In this step the system transforms further the resultant structure into a list of Korean morphemes.
Since the dei)endency structure sl)eeilies no word order, we have to lind the word order of a sen tence and necessary postpositions by help of rules and lexical information (Jang, eta\]., 1991).
Note that Korean has, like Japane.se, several alternative postl)ositions lbr conveying the same meaning.
5.2 Korean
Morphological Generation After the whoh: tree transformation, tile resultant structure is a list of pairs of a morpheme and its category.
The morphologicM generator is an automaton that does the synthesis and separatim, of morphemes according to the context and Korean morpheme combination rule.
Since the Korean language has some complex morphological structure, the synthesis is a very complex process.

6. Problems for Evolution of the System Since after the first completion of this project, we have been trying to find and solve the problems of this system.
Following list is a brief list of those problems, and they are not seem to be easy to solve in the near future.
Robust processing for ill-formed sentences : Current MATFS/EK assumes that the input sentence be a well formed English sentence.
After practical test, we found the robustness for ill-formed sentences is highly required, because the papers fi'oln the IEEE computer magazine contains the non-sentential, nontext text such as braces, numeric expressions, formulas and so on.
Processing of non-continuous idiomatic expressions : In the dictionary entry specification we have a simple rule to represent the non-continuous idiomatic expressions, but it is not easy to detect those expressions from a sentence and represent the found expression in the internal structure for processing.
Selecting correct word correspondency between several alternatives : MATES/EK uses the semantic marker and a scoring of frequencies to select the word correspondeney.
The system still lacks a strong strategy for the word selection.
Processing Korean Sentence Style : Koreau language has various styles of sentences(difference between normal ones from the honorific or polite expressions), which are quite difficult to catch from the English sentences.
Too many ambiguities in English syntactic anMysis : Currently MATES/EK uses a set of ad hoc heuristics and lexieal semantic markers coded in the dictionary in order to solve the ambiguity resolution, such as the PP attachment.
This problcm is related to the problem of selecting the right postposition of Korean.
7. Test and Evaluation EvMuation of an MT systeln enmrges as a critic'M issue these days, but we have not yet found a strong and objective way of evaluation.
After the first completion of the project we tried though, to make an evaluation of the system.
In order to inake the evaluation as objective as possible we prepared three factors.
First, the referees of the evaluation should be those who are not the developers of the system, and they should take a training to make objective decisions.
We selected randomly five master degree students as the referees.
Second, the referees are given a decision criteria of four levels: best, good, poor, and 732 fail.
A sentence is 'best' translated if the resultant Korean sentence is very natural and requires no additional postediting.
A sentence is 'good' translated if the result sentence is structurally correct but it has some minor lexicM selection errors.
A sentence is translated 'poor' if there is structural error as well as lexical errors.
By 'fail', we mean when the system produces very ill-formed translation or fails to prodnce any result at all.
We took the first three levels to be 'success,' because even a sentence is translated in 'poor' degree, it is still understandable.
(Even if a translation is scored to be 'fail', it could sometimes be understandable from the view point of 'mechanical translation').
Third, the test sentences should be those sentences which were never used during the development time.
This system was tested on 1,708 sentences, whose length were less than 26 words selected from 2500 sentences in the IEEE comtmter magazine September 1991 issue.
It showed about 95 percent of success rate for sentences shorter than 15 words, about 90 percent for 18 words, 80 percent for 21 words, and 75 percent for 26 words.
This is a quite encouraging result since the IEEE computer magazine contains wide range of texts of wrions styles.
8. Conclusion and Further Study Development of MATES/EK gaw; a strong motivation of attacking practically important problems, such as dictionary management, scaling up the grammar rules to the real texts, controlling the consistency of a large system.
The system MATES/EK is still under growing, trying to overcmne the problems listed above, scaling up the dictionaries and the grammar rules, and doing downsizing to the PC environment.
