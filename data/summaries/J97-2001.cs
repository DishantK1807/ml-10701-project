He makes use of inheritance within a knowledge base (McDonald 1981) to associate generic concepts such as 0BJECT directly with a phrase category such as NP, but allows for individuations of the concept to have exceptions.

Such information must be part of the input to the Lexical Chooser and can typically be provided by a content planner (McKeown Reiter's \[Reiter 1994\]) shows that the influences of syntax on lexical choice can be accounted for before syntactic realization.

the following sentences taken from stock market reports (Kukich 1983b; Smadja 1991), the semantic unit expressing the time appears as a floating unit at different syntactic levels: • Stock prices got off to a strong start.

• A lexicalist reversible grammar (Strzalkowski 1994), such as a synchronous TAG (Shieber and Shabes 1991), especially in conjunction with the semantic-head-driven algorithm to generation (Shieber et al.1990). In a phrasal lexicon entry, all the syntactic constraints between the elements of the template are already preselected, so there is no need for much syntactic realization: constituents are already ordered, their syntactic category is fixed in the phrasal template, closed-class words are already selected.

This is the approach used in the systems TEXT (McKeown 1985), GENARO-MUMBLE (Conklin 1983; Meteer et al.1987), PENMAN (The Penman NLG 1989), SPOKESMAN (Meteer 1990), EPICURE (Dale 1992), KALIPSOS (Nogier 1990) and in the generators based on the Meaning-Text Theory (MTT) (Mel'Suk and Pertsov 1987) such as: FOC (Bourbeau et al.1990), GossIP (Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1993) and LFS (Iordanskaja et al.1994). 231 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 2 1.

While some researchers have directly associated words with each concept in the domain-knowledge base (e.g., Reiter 1991; Swartout 1983), this approach does not allow for consideration of syntactic and lexical constraints unless a phrasal lexicon is used (e.g., Kukich 1983b; Danlos 1986; Jacobs 1985; Hovy 1988).

While many systems allow for interaction across these components, there is general consensus that these two components can be separated (Reiter 1994).

STREAK relies on revision rules drawn from a corpus analysis of such reports (Robin and McKeown 1993) to incrementally generate such complex sentences.

This approach is generally associated with the use of either: • A phrasal lexicon such as in the generation systems ANA (Kukich 1983a), PI-IRF.D (Jacobs 1985) and PAULINE (Hovy 1988).

Two other applications developed at Columbia also use FUF for lexical choice, but within a different system architecture: COOK (Smadja and McKeown 1991) and STREAK (Robin 1994b).

Our corpus analysis (Robin and McKeown 1993), however, has shown that sentences in the basketball report domain tend to be more syntactically complex than sentences (1) to (3).

Instead, COMET must replan the entire sentence when an alternative word is not available, reinvoking its content planner (McKeown, Robin, and Tanenblatt 1993).

Such constraints pose problems (see discussion in Elhadad and Robin \[1992\]) for the top-down recursive building of the linguistic structure used by most generation algorithms (Meteer et al.1987; Shieber et al.1990); these algorithms typically only handle structural constraints, constraints that are consistently expressed at a given linguistic rank (e.g., the sentence, clause, group, or word rank) (Halliday 1985) in the application domain sublanguage.

It has been progressively developed over the last seven years and extensively tested for the generation of texts as varied as multimedia explanations (McKeown et al.1990), stock market reports (Smadja and McKeown 1991), student advisory sessions (Elhadad 1993c), telephone planning engineer activity reports (Kukich et al.1994; McKeown, Kukich, and Shaw 1994), taxation correspondence, visual scene descriptions (Abella 1994), didactic biology term deftnitions (Lester 1994), basketball game summaries (Robin 1994a), workflow diagram descriptions (Passoneau et al.1996), news article summaries (McKeown and Radev 1995), intensive care patient summaries (Dalai et al.1996), and web-page access demographics.
