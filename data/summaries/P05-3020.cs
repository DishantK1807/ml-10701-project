The pioneering work on class based n-gram models by Brown et al.(1992) was motivated by such considerations.

More recent work includes Clark (2003) who combines distributional and morphological information, and Freitag (2004) who uses a hidden Marcov model in combination with co-clustering.

Whereas in a previous paper (Rapp, 2004) we found that for word sense induction the local clustering of local vectors is more appropriate than the global clustering of global vectors, for part-ofspeech induction our conclusion is that the situation is exactly the other way round, i.e. the global clustering of global vectors is more adequate (see footnote 1).

alternative to relying on this fortunate but somewhat unsatisfactory effect would be not to use global co-occurrence vectors but local ones, as successfully proposed in word sense induction (Rapp, 2004).
