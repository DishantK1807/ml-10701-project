Parsing Using Cascaded Chunking (CaboCha) Our method is based on the cascaded chunking method (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) proposed as the CaboCha parser 1. CaboCha is a sort of shiftreduce parser and determines whether or not a segment depends on the next segment by using an 1 http://www.chasen.org/?taku/software/cabocha/ 225 SVM-based classifier.

Also, we will install the domain dictionary on JUMAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994) to make the domain information fully and easily available.

of the Proposed Method We applied the method to JFWs installed on JUMAN (Kurohashi et al., 1994), which are 26,658 words consisting of commonly used nouns and verbs.

Generally, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented as a tree, and parsing is carried out by maximizing the likelihood of the tree (Charniak, 2000; Uchimoto et al., 1999).

In recent years, many accurate phrase-structure parsers have been developed (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000)).

These are parts of a feature set that many papers have referenced (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

Popular parsers are CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), which were developed to analyze formal written language expressions such as that in newspaper articles.
