(owenOcogentex.com) 1 Introduction Dependency grammar has a long tradition in syntactic theory, dating back to at least Tesni~re's work from the thirties3 Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing are discovering the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly do, but context-free phrasestructure grammars do not.

This idea can also be compared to the notion of word order domain (Reape, 1990; BrSker and Neuhaus, 1997), to the Slash feature of GPSG and HPSG, to the functional uncertainty of LFG, and to the Move-a of GB theory.
