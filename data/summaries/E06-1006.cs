Normalization of English/German inflectional morphology to base forms for the purpose of word alignment is performed in (Corston-Oliver and Gamon, 2004) and (Koehn, 2005), demonstrating that the vocabulary size can be reduced significantly without affecting performance.

(Lioma and Ounis, 2005) do not report any improvement from integrating part-ofspeech information at the phrase level.
W05-0830
In (Niessen and Ney, 2001b), a hierarchical lexicon model is used that represents words as combinations of full forms, base forms, and part-of-speech tags, and that allows the word alignment training procedure to interpolate counts based on the different levels of representation.
W01-1407
(Niessen and Ney, 2001a) use morpho-syntactic knowledge for reordering certain syntactic constructions that differ in word order in the source vs.

The score combination weights are trained by a minimum error rate training procedure similar to (Och and Ney, 2003).

In (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) this method was generalized to a backoff model with multiple paths, allowing the combination of different backed-off probability estimates.

More recently, (Xi and Hwa, 2005) have used backoff models for combining in-domain and 42 out-of-domain data for the purpose of bootstrapping a part-of-speech tagger for Chinese, outperforming standard methods such as EM.
H05-1107
Similar morphological simplifications have been applied to other languages such as Romanian (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) in order to decrease word alignment error rate.
W05-0814
(Resnik et al., 2001) used backoff translation lexicons for cross-language information retrieval.

Phrases are then extracted from the word alignments using the method described in (Och and Ney, 2003).
