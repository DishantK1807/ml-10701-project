Estimation 3.1 Data Extraction Subordinate clauses (and their main clause counterparts) were extracted from the BLLIP corpus (30 M words), a Treebank-style, machine-parsed version of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ, years 1987–89) which was produced using Charniak’s (2000) parser.

Verbs in our data were mapped into their corresponding Levin classes (feature VL); polysemous verbs were disambiguated by the method proposed in Lapata and Brew (1999).

Absolute temporal information has received some attention (Wilson et al., 2001; Schilder and Habel, 2001; Wiebe et al., 1998) and systems have been developed for identifying and assigning referents to time expressions.

Previous work on temporal inference has focused on the automatic tagging of temporal expressions (e.g., Wilson et al.2001) or on learning the ordering of events from manually annotated data (e.g., Mani et al.2003). Our experiments further revealed that not only lexical but also syntactic information is important for both tasks.

Consider the examples in (1) taken from Katz and Arosio (2001).

Apart from the fact that we present an alternative model, our work differs from Marcu and Echihabi (2002) in two important ways.

Our model can be easily extended to include contextual features and also richer temporal information such as tagged time expressions (see Mani et al.2003). Apart from taking more features into account, in the future we plan to experiment with models where main and subordinate clauses are not assumed to be conditionally independent and investigate the influence of larger data sets on prediction accuracy.

This result is in agreement with Soricut and Marcu (2003) who find that syntax trees encode sufficient information to enable accurate derivation of discourse relations.

A similar approach has been advocated for the interpretation of discourse relations by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).

This is partly due to the absence of readily available corpora annotated with temporal information, although efforts are underway to develop treebanks marked with temporal relations (Katz and Arosio, 2001) and devise annotation schemes that are suitable for coding temporal relations (Ferro et al., 2000; Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2001).
