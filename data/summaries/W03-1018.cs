The maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996; Pietra et al., 1997) has attained great popularity in the NLP field due to its power, robustness, and successful performance in various NLP tasks (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Nigam et al., 1999; Borthwick, 1999).

Malouf (2002) compares several algorithms for the ME estimation including GIS, IIS, and the limitedmemory variable metric (LMVM) method, which is a gradient-based method, and shows that the LMVM method requires much less time to converge for real NLP datasets.
