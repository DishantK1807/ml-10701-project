Since our motivation for unification parsing is to reveal semantics as well as syntax, we next evaluated Aug-TRIPSâ€™s production of correct interpretations at the sentence level, which require complete correctness not only of the bracketing structure but of the sense chosen for each word and the thematic 198 roles of each argument (Tetreault et al., 2004).

They have been used in three ways: as a postprocess for parse selection (Toutanova et al., 2005; Riezler et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2002), a preprocess to find more probable bracketing structures (Swift et al., 2004), and online to rank each constituent produced, as in Tsuruoka et al.(2004) and this experiment.

The TRIPS parser (Allen et al., 1996) is a unification parser using an HPSG-inspired grammar and hand-tuned weights for each rule.

Similar but more complex models were used in the PCFG-sem model of Toutanova et al.(2005) and using WordNet senses in Bikel (2000).
