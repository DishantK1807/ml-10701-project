The proposed method, in contrast, employs a model in which different words within a same class can have different conditional generation probabilities, and thus can classify words in a way that is not affected by words' absolute frequencies and resolve the problem faced by the method of (Li and Abe, 1996).

By combining thesauruses automatically constructed by our method and an existing hand-made thesaurus (WordNet), we were able to achieve the overall accuracy of 85.2% for ppattachment disambiguation, which compares favorably against the accuracy (82.4%) obtained using the state-of-the-art method of (Brill and Resnik, 1994).

The overall disambiguation accuracy achieved by our method is 85.2%, which compares favorably against the accuracy (82.4%) obtained by the state-of-the-art disambiguation method of (Brill and Resnik, 1994).

The model employed in (Li and Abe, 1996) is based on the assumption that the word distribution within a class is a uniform distribution, i.e. every word in a same class is generated with an equal probability.

Our method is a natural extension of those proposed in (Brown et al., 1992) and (Li and Abe, 1996), and overcomes their drawbacks while retaining their advantages.

Our clustering method improves upon the previous methods proposed by Brown et al and (Li and Abe, 1996), and furthermore it can be used to derive a disambiguation method with overall disambiguation accuracy of 85.2%, which improves the performance of a state-of-the-art disambiguation method.

There have been a number of methods proposed in the literature to address the word clustering problem (e.g., (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Li and Abe, 1996)).

3). Finally, for comparison, we tested the 'transformation-based error-driven learning' proposed in (Brill and Resnik, 1994), which is a state-of-the-art method for pp-attachment disambiguation.

We also tried the analogous method using thesauruses constructed by the method of (Li and Abe, 1996) 3The method of (Li and Abe, 1995) outputs a 'tree cut model' in a given thesaurus with conditional probabilities attached to all the nodes in the tree cut.

Work 6.1 Models We can restrict the hard clustering model (1) by assuming that words within a same class are generated with an equal probability, obtaining 1 1 P(n,v) = P(C.,C~). lC.i ICol' which is equivalent to the model proposed by (Li and Abe, 1996).
