What we do assume is that the user is able to determine word boundaries, which is in reality a non-trivial task due to Japanese being nonsegmenting (see Kurohashi et al.(1994) and Nagata (1994), among others, for details of automatic segmentation methods).

Our generative method is analogous to that successfully applied by Knight and Graehl (1998) to the related problem of Japanese (back) transliteration.
J98-4003
In a sense this problem is analogous to kanaâ€“kanji conversion (see, e.g., Ichimura et al.(2000) and Takahashi et al.(1996)), in that we seek to determine a ranked listing of kanji strings that could correspond to the input kana string.
