In the literature, this task has been proposed quite recently (Bel et al., 2003; Gliozzo and Strapparava, 2005).

There exist many interesting works about using parallel corpora for multilingual applications (Melamed, 2001), such as Machine Translation (Callison-Burch et al., 2004), Cross Lingual 553 Information Retrieval (Littman et al., 1998), and so on.

In the literature, Domain Models have been introduced to represent ambiguity and variability (Gliozzo et al., 2004) and successfully exploited in many NLP applications, such as Word Sense Disambiguation (Strapparava et al., 2004), Text Categorization and Term Categorization.

As a consequence the same entities will be denoted with the same words in different languages, allowing us to automatically detect couples of translation pairs just by looking at the word shape (Koehn and Knight, 2002).

This is the main reason why the weaker notion of comparable corpora is a matter of recent interest in the eld of Computational Linguistics (Gaussier et al., 2004).
