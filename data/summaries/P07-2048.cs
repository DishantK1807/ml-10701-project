MWU processing in Turkic languages involves more than the usual lexicalized collocations and involves detection of mostly unlexicalized intraword morphological patterns (Oflazer et al., 2004).

It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.
