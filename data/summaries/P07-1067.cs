Garera and Yarowsky (2006) propose an unsupervised model which extracts hypernym relation for resloving definite NPs.

In (Harabagiu et al., 2001), the path patterns in WordNet are utilized to compute the semantic consistency between NPs.

In our study, we use pointwise mutual information (Cover and Thomas, 1991) to measure association strength, which has been proved effective in the task of semantic relation identification (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Bean and Riloff (2004) present a system called BABAR that uses contextual role knowledge to do coreference resolution.

However, the drawback of WordNet is that many expressions (especially for proper names), word senses and semantic relations are not available from the database (Vieira and Poesio, 2000).

We can find the pattern features occur in the top of the decision tree, among the features for name alias, apposition and string-matching that are crucial for coreference resolution as reported in previous work (Soon et al., 2001).

The first line of the table shows the baseline system that uses only the common features proposed in (Ng and Cardie, 2002).

The same feature set is described in (Ng and Cardie, 2002) for reference.

Recently, Ponzetto and Strube (2006) suggest to mine semantic relatedness from Wikipedia, which can deal with the data sparseness problem suffered by using WordNet.

To obtain this semantic information, previous work on reference resolution usually leverages a semantic lexicon like WordNet (Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2001; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).

Instantiated with two given noun phrases, the pattern is searched in a large corpus and the occurrence number is used as a measure of their semantic relatedness (Markert et al., 2003; Modjeska et al., 2003; Poesio et al., 2004).

The results are comparable to those reported in (Ng, 2005) which uses similar features and gets an F-measure of about 62% for the same data set.

Based on Hearst’s work, Pantel and Pennacchiotti (2006) further give a method 529 which measures the reliability of the patterns based on the strength of association between patterns and instances, employing the pointwise mutual information (PMI).

For evaluation, Vilain et al.(1995)’s scoring algorithm was adopted to compute the recall and precision of the whole coreference resolution.

Markert et al.(2003) and Poesio et al.(2004) adopt a similar strategy for the bridging anaphora resolution.

of Coreference Resolution Our coreference resolution system adopts the common learning-based framework as employed by Soon et al.(2001) and Ng and Cardie (2002).

Modjeska et al.(2003) explore the use of the Web to do the other-anaphora resolution.

In the system by Vieira and Poesio (2000), for example, WordNet is consulted to obtain the synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy relations for resolving the definite anaphora.
