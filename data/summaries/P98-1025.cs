For arguments requiring a non-canonical order, we need type shifting and composition (hence the third clause in (7)): 3As suggested in (Bozsahin and Gocmen, 1995), morphological and syntactic composition can be distinguished by associating several attachment calculi with functors and arguments (e.g., affixation, concatenation, clitics, etc,) NP3:x T=~ (SINP1)/(SINPIlNP3):Tx ~ (SINP, INP2)/(SINP, INP31NP2): B(Tx) = BBTx Once syntactic category of the argument is fixed, its semantics is uniquely determined by (7).

This problem is resolved by grammar rewriting in the sense proposed by Eisner 4 (1996).

Agreement features enforce the possessorpossessed agreement on person and number via unification (as in UCG (Calder et al., 1988)): kalem -in uc -u pencil -GEN.3s tip -POSS.3s N.'--ff C(5)\N: T N:t ---~ (Ne=g~\NPs>\N:p.oss A NPag~/(NP~g~\NPs):~p 5 NP~,~\NPs:posst' A> NPo:: :rp' Cposst' )>_(posst' )p' 'The tip of the pencil' 3 Word Order and Scrambling Due to space limitations, the following abbreviated categories are employed in derivations: IV = SINPz TV = SINPIINP 2 DV = SINPIINP3INP2 The categories licensed by (5) can then be written as IV/TV and IV~TV for NP2, TV/DV and TV~DV for NP3, etc.

4Eisner (1996, p.81) in fact suggested that the labeling system can be implemented in the grammar by templates, or in the processor by labeling the chart entries.
P96-1011
The labels are as in (Eisner, 1996).

Other normal form parsers, e.g. that of Hepple and Morrill (1989), have the same problem.

But, as pointed out by Eisner (1996, p.85), this is not spurious ambiguity in the technical sense, just multiple derivations due to alternative lexical category assignments.

It is known to be computationally tractable but less efficient than the polynomial time CCG algorithm of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993).
