1:118	APPENDIX A : EVALUATION TASK DESCRIPTION 1.0 WHAT CONSTITUTES A "RELEVANT" INCIDENT ? Relevant incidents are, in general, violent acts perpetrated with political aim s and a motive of intimidation.
2:118	These are acts of terrorism . Here is an official, "schoolbook" definition of terrorism : "a sudden, unexpected act of shocking, calculated, and unlawful violence, or the plausible threat of such violence, by an illegal, subnational, clandestine group usually carried out in a peaceful, civilian environment, be it urban, rural, in the ai r or on a body of water -against certain noncombatants or targets that represent o r symbolize a certain country, but sometimes indiscrimately against bystanders o r passersby at a particular location, with the intention of garnering publicity, propagandizing a cause, and intimidating as many people as possible in order to attain social, political, or strategic objectives."
3:118	-Rex A. Hudson, "Dealing with International Hostage-Taking : Alternatives to Reactiv e Counterterrorist Assaults," Internationa l Terrorism, Vol . 12, 1990 . This has been turned into more of an operational definition by widening th e schoolbook definition somewhat and making some rather arbitrary distinctions . Your advice on how to improve on this operational definition is welcome.
4:118	1) Terrorist acts may be perpetrated by an "illegal, subnational, clandestin e group," which includes known guerrilla and drug-trafficking organizations . Their targets may be just about anything/anybody except (a) another such group o r member of such a group or (b) a military/police installation or force (with the sam e nationality as the perpetrator), or a member of such a ' force, in which case the incident is presumed to be a purely guerrilla act and is not relevant to the MU C terrorist incident database . Thus, killings of drug traffickers will not be included i n the database (by exception a, above), nor will "clashes" between guerrilla groups and the military (by exception b, above).
5:118	However, if a guerrilla warfare incident happens to affect civilian personnel o r property, whether intentionally or accidentally, the incident becomes relevant and should be included in the database . In these cases, the database should contai n information on both the military and the nonmilitary targets . Similarly, the database will include incidents of sabotage on a nation' s infrastructure.
6:118	It will also include incidents perpetrated against individuals who ar e former members of the military, e .g ., a murder perpetrated against a retired general . Sometimes an article gives mixed reports, e .g. , a "terrorist attack" on a bridge guarded by the national (military) police . In a case such as this, which could b e interpreted as a case of terrorism (sabotage of the nation's infrastructure) or o f A-1 guerrilla warfare (attack on a physical target of military importance), we wil l consider the physical target to be nonmilitary and will include the incident in th e database . 2) Under certain circumstances, the perpetrator may be a member of th e government, including the military . This is the case when the target is civilian . 3) Sometimes the perpetrator is not identified and no language is used to indicat e that the act is *not* being attributed to "terrorists," "extremists," "subversives, " "guerrillas," etc . In these cases, as long as the act itself is of one of the expected types and the target(s) is/are not exclusively military, the incident will be presumed to b e a possible terrorist act and is to be included in the database . 4) The articles in the MUC corpus originate in many different parts of the world, but they all emphasize something.
7:118	about one of the nine Latin American countries o f interest (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) . However, only incidents whose perpetrator(s), target(s), or location "belong to" one of the nine countries of interest belong in the MUC database . Thus, an incident perpetrated against a human target who is a citizen of one of thos e countries may belong in the database even if that person is attacked while he's in a different country . Or an incident perpetrated against the embassy of one of thos e nine countries may belong in the database, no matter where that embassy is located . 5) Only terrorist acts (and attempted or threatened acts) that are reported as factual are to be included in the database . An incident is *not* to be recorded in th e database if the article discredits the story or cites a source that discredits the story .
8:118	(However, if the article also cites a source that *supports* the story, that version o f the story should go in the database ).
9:118	Rumors are to be excluded . 6) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if it is "recent ".
10:118	The intent is to include only information that is new or updated . We define "recent" to mean tha t either (a) it occurred within two months of the date of the article or (b) ne w information is being provided in the article on an incident that occured more tha n two months prior, such as new suspects being brought forth as the perpetrators of a n old crime . However, there are a number of articles that fail to mention the date o f the incidents, some of which are, in fact, recent . Therefore, if there is no indication that the information is not recent or if there is no indication that the information i s being given only to provide historical context (as indicated by phrases such as "Le t us recall that.
11:118	"), the incident should go in the database . 7) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if the article's description of it is "specific ".
12:118	Generic descriptions of incidents like "terrorist attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline" and summary descriptions like "the total person s kidnapped in Colombia over the last 6 weeks was 85" are to be excluded . The articles sometimes give useful information about a specific incident bu t provide very few details.
13:118	Therefore, as long as all the other criteria are met, we will include any incident that at least indicates the nature of the target or the nature of the attack.
14:118	Thus, an article whose only reference to an incident is "an attac k perpetrated by a subversive group" or "the tragic incident at Uchiza" would b e excluded, but an article that says "Last night there were fewer attacks on stores an d electric towers in the capital " or "a UCR district headquarters in Buenos Aire s province was completely destroyed by a bomb explosion" would be included . A-2 Here are two further examples of texts that do *not* warrant generation o f templates : "As of 0500 GMT today, the police had received reports of two othe r explosions in two La Paz neighborhoods" (the nature of the explosion isn' t mentioned, and the target isn't mentioned either) ; "the bombing on San Salvador' s neighborhoods" (the prepositional phrase may be interpreted as conveying the target as well as the location, but as a target, it's too general -any location name tha t is on the set list cannot serve as a target ID, with the exception of farm names) . 2.0 DEFINITIONS OF SLOT TYPES 0 .

48:118	A-3 3.0 DEFINITIONS OF FILL TYPE S Set fill : An item from a finite list of possibilities enumerated in th e documentation provided to participants . Numeric : A number, a range of numbers, or a number with a prefix meanin g "approximately".
49:118	Text conversion : A canonical form extracted or derived from the text . The documentation provided to participants specifies the expected format . Text string : A string extracted from the text and placed inside double quotes in the slot.
50:118	Note that this string may contain misspellings, if found in the original text . Null : A hyphen (-) indicating that the system has no response . Inapplicable : An asterisk (*) indicating that a particular slot is never to be filled in the case o f certain incident types . 4.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FILL S 4.1 Format for System Responses System responses should look like plain text, e .g. , they cannot be enclosed i n parentheses, multi-word fillers cannot be connected by underscore characters, etc . Systems are not permitted to use the slash notation that is used in the key t o separate alternative forms of a single filler . When multiple fillers for a single slot are generated, each should appear on a separate line, arranged in a column, with space padding in front (no tabs) . Some slots require that their fillers be cross-referenced to the referent (i .e. , the filler of some other slot).
51:118	To match the answer sheet, this should be done by appending the referent, separating the two data items with a colon . Example fill for the PHYS TARGET : EFFECT OF INCIDENT slot, whose fillers must be cross-referenced to the corresponding fillers in the PHYS TGT : ID slot.
52:118	PHYS TGT: ID "OFFICES OF CITICORP BANK" "RESIDENCE OF US AMBASSADOR" PHYS TOT: EFFECT OF INCIDENT SOME DAMAGE: "OFFICES OF CITICORP BANK " DESTROYED: "RESIDENCE OF US AMBASSADOR" One template form serves for all incident types . However, depending on th e incident type, one or more slots do not apply . These slots should appear with a n asterisk as the fill, and they will not figure in the scoring . For irrelevant articles, al l slots except the MESSAGE : ID slot should have an asterisk.
53:118	4.2 Special Formats for Answer Keys All fills in the answer key will be in upper case . If there is more than one "correct" answer for any given slot filler, the option s will all appear on one line in the answer key, separated by a slash . The word OPTIONAL may appear in parentheses after the filler for the MESSAGE : TEMPLATE slot, indicating that generation of this template is optional . A question mark preceding a filler indicates that generation of this filler i s optional, i.e ., that null (hyphen) is also a correct system response . 7 5.0 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR GENERATING MORE THAN ON E TEMPLATE PER ARTICL E If an article discusses more than one relevant type of terrorist incident, eac h such incident should be captured in a separate template . If an article discusses more than one instance of the same relevant type o f terrorist incident, each such incident should be captured in a separate template . A "separate instance" is one which has a different filler for the location, date, category, or perpetrator slot . If no distinctions of these kinds are made in the text, th e instances should be incorporated into a single template, e .g. , if the article describe s "attacks" by "rebels" on "ten power stations" and does not give varying information on the location of those targets, etc. Note that the level of granularity is defined by what can go in a slot; thus, an article that describes two bombings on targets on different streets in the same neighborhood should be captured in one templat e rather than two, since the location slot cannot have a filler that is at the level o f granularity of a street.
54:118	6.0 DATA TYPES FOR FILLERS The type of data that is to be generated for each of the slots is shown here . Section 7 contains information on which slots can be null, which slots ar e inapplicable for particular incident types, and which slots can contain multipl e values . 0.

79:118	Slot 0--MESSAGE : ID Number of fillers: Always one filler per templat e General method for filling : To be copied by the system from first line of th e article . Set list: This list is the set of all message IDs in the corpus.
80:118	Note : If an article is irrelevant, this is the only slot that should be filled in . 7.2 Slot 1--MESSAGE : TEMPLATE Number of fillers: Always one filler per template General method for filling: A number (in digits) generated by the system, starting with 1 and incremented for each new template.
81:118	Notes : 1) Ordering need not match answer sheet -the scoring program will attempt t o make best match . 2) On the answer sheet, the word OPTIONAL in parentheses after the templat e number indicates that there is significant doubt whether the incident belongs in th e database . 7.3 Slot 2--INCIDENT: DATE Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers: Always one filler per template, unless NO DATE appears i n the message header and a date cannot be determined from the body of the article, in which case NULL (hyphen) is appropriate.
82:118	General method for filling : A form generated by the system from the text, expressed in one of the following forms (whichever is appropriate for the article) : 1.
83:118	DD MMM YY (e .g. 21 JAN 89, meaning "on 21 JAN 89 ") 2.
84:118	DD MMM YY DD MMM YY (e .g. 15 JAN 89 21 JAN 89, meaning "on or between 15 JAN 89 and 21 JAN 89" ) 3.
85:118	DD MMM YY (e .g. 21 JAN 89, meaning "on or before 21 JAN 89") Notes : 1) If the article contains the name of a day of the week, e .g. "last Wednesday", rather than a reference to the date, use form 3, above, with the best known absolute date as the anchor, e.g., the date of the article . 2) If the article uses an easily calculable expression such as "yesterday," us e form 1, above, with the date calculated from the best known absolute date as th e anchor, e.g., the date of the article . An "easily calculable" expression is one tha t indicates how many days to add or subtract from the anchor . 3) Whenever the date for an event is derived by default from the date in th e message header, the answer key will use form 3, above, with the header date as th e anchor . 7.4 Slot 3--INCIDENT: LOCATIO N Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : Always one (possibly complex) filler per templat e General method for filling : The country where the incident occurred ma y be explicit in the text or may have to be inferred . When further information is A-6 available about the location, give the names in order of increasing specificity, separated by a colon, and put the location type in parentheses after each name . Examples : COLOMBIA : MEDELLIN (CITY) PERU: LIMA (CITY) : MIRAFLORES (NEIGHBORHOOD ) Set list : See separate files called set-list-foreign-nation and set-list-location . Notes : 1) The incident may have occurred in the vicinity of the named place rathe r than specifically in that place . 2) The incident may have occurred between two named places, in which cas e use a dash to separate them . Example : COLOMBIA: CUCUTA (CITY) CAMPANARIO (REGION ) 3) If the article says the specific location is unknown, just put the more general location(s) . 4) Do not provide specific place name information if the message is unclear as to whether that place is the location of the incident or the location of the reporting of the incident (or some other location).
86:118	5) This slot should never be left blank.
87:118	Always put at least the country name, even if it must be inferred . The country where the article originated is not always a good default . 7.5 Slot 4--INCIDENT: TYPE Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : Always one filler per template Set list : ARSON BOMBING KIDNAPPING HIJACKING ROBBERY FORCED WORK STOPPAGE ATTACK Note : The ATTACK incident type should be used only when a terrorist inciden t clearly does not fall into one of the other categories . 7.6 Slot 5--INCIDENT: STAGE OF EXECUTIO N Applicability : Applicable to all types of incident s Number of fillers: Always one filler per templat e Set list: ACCOMPLISHED ATTEMPTED THREATENED Note: If a bomb is planted (by possible terrorists) but is detonated intentionall y by authorities, an ATTEMPTED BOMBING template should be generated . 7.7 Slot 6--INCIDENT : INSTRUMENT I D Applicability : Applicable to all incident types except ARSON and KIDNAPPIN G Number of fillers: Null, or one or more fillers Notes : 1) Fill this slot only if the text provides a noun phrase that refers to th e instrument ; do not fill it with expressions that refer only to the act of using an A-7 instrument (such as "shooting" or "machingegunned") or the effect of using a n instrument (such as "explosion") . 2) If the text provides information on the material (such as "dynamite") used i n a bomb or other explosive device, and it provides expressions referring to th e container of the material (such as "bomb" or "rocket"), make separate fillers for the material and the container.
88:118	7.8 Slot 7--INCIDENT : INSTRUMENT TYP E Applicability : Applicable to all incident types except ARSON and KIDNAPPIN G Number of fillers: Number of fillers : Null, or one or more fillers Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to INCIDENT : INSTRUMENT I D Set list (choices are hierarchical) : GUN MACHINE GU N MORTAR HANDGUN RIFLE EXPLOSIVE BOMB VEHICLE BOMB DYNAMITE MINE AERIAL BOM B GRENADE MOLOTOV COCKTAIL PROJECTILE MISSIL E ROCKET CUTTING DEVICE FIRE STONE TORTURE Notes : 1) The FIRE option is included because it appeared as the cause of death in a n attack.
89:118	It is not clear from the article whether the fire was set as an act of arson or whether it resulted from an explosion . 2) Various kinds of rifles, including assault rifles, fit in the category of RIFLE . 3) The supercategory of EXPLOSIVE includes a mixture of explosive devices an d explosive materials . 4) DYNAMITE includes dynamite in any of its various forms, including sticks, gel, etc. 5) AERIAL BOMB is for bombs dropped from airplanes.
90:118	Note that reportabl e incidents with AERIAL BOMB as instrument are to be labeled ATTACK rather tha n BOMBING . 6) Use hyphen (null) if the reported instrument does not fit any of th e categories on the set list.
91:118	7) This slot may be filled even if the INSTRUMENT ID slot is null, as would be th e case when the only evidence of a GUN type is found by inference from a verb such as "shoot" . A-8 7 .9 Slot 8--PERP: INCIDENT CATEGORY Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : One filler per template, or NULL (hyphen) if nature o f perpetrator cannot be determined . Set list: TERRORIST ACT STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE Notes : 1) TERRORIST ACT should be used when the perpetrator is *not* a member o f the government/military/police . 2) The subcategory of STATE-SPONSORED VIOLENCE should be used when th e perpetrator is a member of the government/military/police . 3) This slot may be filled even if the perpetrators are not identified, if the tex t gives strong evidence for the category without providing any strings to fill the perpetrator slots ; however, it will generally be the case that this slot is null if th e perpetrator slots are null . 7.10 Slot 9--PERP: INDIVIDUAL ID Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : Null, or one or more fillers 7.11 Slot 10--PERP : ORGANIZATION ID Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : Null, or one or more filler s Note : Include only if mentioned in the text, i .e. , do not use information from the system's general lexicon to fill this in (such as information linking known terrorist s to organizations) . 7.12 Slot 11--PERP: ORGANIZATION CONFIDENC E Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents Number of fillers : Null if PERP : ORGANIZATION ID slot is null, else one fille r per filler in the PERP: ORGANIZATION ID slot.
92:118	Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to PERP : ORGANIZATION ID . Set list: REPORTED AS FACT ACQUITTED CLAIMED OR ADMITTED SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES POSSIBLE Notes : 1) Use REPORTED AS FACT as a default if the identity of the perpetrator org an d its responsibility for the incident appear not to be in question . 2) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED if the article explicitly expresses some degree o f uncertainty about the identity of the perpetrator org, e.g., by use of qualifying words.
93:118	This fill should also be used if the article's reporting rests on suspicions o r accusations expressed by some source cited by the article's originator or by th e article's originator himself.
94:118	A-9 3) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES instead of SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED for cases where the article is conveying the information that the government, military, police, or other authority figure is expressing the suspicion/accusation o r is accepting/admitting guilt on behalf of another authority that has been identifie d as the perpetrator org .
95:118	(In the latter case, where the perpetrator is himself a n authority figure, use CLAIMED OR ADMITTED if he admits/claims his own org 's guilt.)
96:118	4) Use POSSIBLE if an article mentions an organization in the context of th e incident without actually accusing that organization of being responsible for it . 7 .13 Slot 12--PHYS TGT : ID Applicability : Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incidents Number of fillers: Null, or one or more fillers . Note : Use this slot for the entities that are the targets of incidents (facilities, buildings, vehicles, etc.), not for whatever parts happened to have been damaged as a result of the incident (e .g. , "windows") unless the text doesn't mention the entity (target) that they are part of.
97:118	7.14 Slot 13--PHYS TGT : TYPE Applicability : Not applicable KIDNAPPING incidents Number of fillers : Null if ID slot null, or one filler per filler in ID slot . Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to PHYS TGT : ID Set list: CIVILIAN RESIDENCE COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS DIPLOMAT OFFICE OR RESIDENCE ENERGY FINANCIAL GOVERNMENT OFFICE OR RESIDENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT FACILITY POLITICAL FIGURE OFFICE OR RESIDENCE ORGANIZATION OFFICE TRANSPORT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION FACILITY TRANSPORTATION ROUTE WATER OTHER Note : Use OTHER only if the target doesn't fit any of the specific categories . 7.15 Slot 14--PHYS TGT : NUMBER Applicability : Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incident s Number of fillers : Null if ID slot null, else one filler per filler in ID slo t Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to PHYS TGT : ID Set list: PLURAL Note : Use PLURAL if the only information available is that there was more tha n one physical target . Otherwise, fill this slot with a digit generated by the syste m from the info available in the text . If the text indicates a range of values like "between 6 and 8" or "at least 6," use a hyphen as an operator, making the fills "6-8 " A-10 and "6-", respectively . If the text conveys an approximate number, as in "about 100", use a tilde (-) as a prefix to the number . 7.16 Slot 15--PHYS TGT: FOREIGN NATIO N Applicability : Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incident s Number of fillers: Null if ID slot null, and null if country of location o f incident is same as nationality of target, else one filler if nationality is explicitl y mentioned in the text . Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to PHYS TGT: ID. Set list : See separate file called set-list-foreign-nation . Example : The fill (disregarding cross-reference) should be HONDURAS if th e incident occurred in a country other than Honduras and if the physical target is the Honduran embassy . Note : The list, in principle, could be extended to contain all the countries of the world.
98:118	However, it should be the case that it already includes at least all the possibilities covered by the MUC corpus . 7.17 Slot 16--PHYS TGT : EFFECT OF INCIDEN T Applicability : Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incidents Number of fillers : Null, or one or more fillers . The EFFECT slot may be filled in even if the ID/NUMBER/TYPE slots are all null (in the case where the articl e makes no direction mention of the target but rather refers to it indirectly by sayin g something in summary about damage) . Conversely, the EFFECT slot may be null even if the ID/NUMBER/TYPE slots are filled . Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to PHYS TGT : ID ; if that slot is null, generate a dummy cross-reference, e .g. , NO DAMAGE : "-".
99:118	Set list: DESTROYED SOME DAMAGE NO DAMAGE Additional set list items for ROBBERY incidents : MONEY TAKEN FROM TARGET PROPERTY TAKEN FROM TARGET TARGET TAKEN Notes : 1) Use DESTROYED when the article indicates total destruction, as when it say s that the target was "blown up" by a bomb . 2) ARSON of a target implies at least SOME DAMAGE.
100:118	Other incident types, suc h as BOMBING, do not imply damage . 7.18 Slot 17--PHYS TGT : TOTAL NUMBER Applicability : Not applicable to KIDNAPPING incidents . Number of fillers : One filler per template if a total number is explicit in the text and is not redundant (see notes) ; else NUL L Notes : 1) This slot is to be filled only in those cases where there is more than one PHY S TGT: ID (in order to prevent the filler for this slot from being redundant with th e information contained in PHYS TGT : NUMBER) and only if an actual total numbe r value is given in the text.
101:118	A-11 2) To fill this slot, use a digit generated by the system from the info available i n the text.
102:118	If the text gives a range of values like "between 6 and 8" or "at least 6," use a hyphen as an operator, making the fills "6-8" and "6-", respectively . If the text conveys an approximate number, as in " about 10 pylons and power lines ", use a tilde (--) as a prefix to the number.
103:118	7.19 Slot 18--HUM TGT : NAME Applicability : Applicable to all types of incident s Number of fillers: Null, or one or more filler s Note : The fillers for this slot should always be proper names . 7.20 Slot 19--HUM TGT : DESCRIPTIO N Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents . Number of fillers : Null, or one or more filler s Cross-referencing : Include cross-reference to HUM TGT : NAME unless HUM TGT: NAME is null.
104:118	Note : If the filler for this slot refers to a named person in the HUM TGT : NAME slot, this slot should be filled with a "title" (e .g. , "Monsignor", "Mr").
105:118	or "role" (e.g. , "engineer", "priest").
106:118	It should be null if no title or role is given in the text (e .g. , if only a general descriptor such as "woman" or "peasant" is present in the text) . 7.21 Slot 20--HUM TGT : TYPE Applicability : Applicable to all types of incidents.
107:118	Number of fillers : Null if both NAME and DESCRIPTION slots are null ; else one filler per filler in NAME or DESCRIPTION slot (see cross-referencing instructions) .
