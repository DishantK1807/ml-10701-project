segments Discourse segments can be defined as nonoverlapping spans of prosodic units (Hirschberg & Nakatani, 1996), intentional units (Grosz & Sidner, 1986), phrasal units (Lascarides & Asher, 1993), or sentences (Hobbs, 1985).

structures for representing coherence relations Most accounts of discourse coherence assume tree structures to represent coherence relations between discourse segments in a text (Carlson et al., 2002; Corston-Oliver, 1998; Lascarides & Asher, 1993; Longacre, 1983; Grosz & Sidner, 1986; Mann & Thompson, 1988; Marcu, 2000; Polanyi, 1988; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983; Walker, 1998; Webber et al., 1999).

In order to determine inter-annotator agreement for the database of annotated texts, we computed kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996).

Accounts of discourse structure vary greatly with respect to how many discourse relations they assume, ranging from two (Grosz & Sidner, 1986) to over 400 different coherence relations, reported in Hovy and Maier (1995).
