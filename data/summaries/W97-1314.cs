Local semantic constraints can be added to this algorithm, as in (Huls et al., 1995).

They suggest also (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996b) that anaphora resolution is part of the discourse referents resolution.

But (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996a) show that the lappin and Leass algorithm still provides good results (75%) even without complete parse.

The method proposed in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) uses context modelling and salience values, besides syntactic constraints, and proves 4% more accurate than Hobbs' algorithm on the same corpus.

A solution is then to use statistical methods to induce semantic constraints of frequently used verbs, as in (Dagan and Ito, 1990).

A blackboard-like architecture is proposed by (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) in order to integrate various knowledge sources, but no evaluation is given.

The most important one is an LFG parser developed in the Language and Cognition Group at the LIMSI (Vapillon et al., 1997); however, as the rules cannot yet cover a significant proportion of complex sentences, our system uses only local analysis, which parses NPs even when the sentence analysis fails.

(Lappin and Leass, 1994) and (Huis, 1995)), intertwined with morpho-syntaxic constraints (and later semantic ones), in order to choose a character from the set as referent of the RE.
