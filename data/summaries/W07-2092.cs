Overall, FScore results are in accordance with the idea of microsenses mentioned in (Agirre et al., 2006).

The majority of both supervised and unsupervised approaches to WSD is based on the “fixed-list” of senses paradigm where the senses of a target word is a closed list of definitions coming from a standarddictionary(Agirreetal., 2006).

At the end of this stage, the constructed hypergraph isreduced, sothatourhypergraphmodelagreeswith the one described in subsection 2.1.1. 2.1.3 Extracting Senses Preliminary experiments on 10 nouns of SensEval-3 English lexical-sample task (Mihalcea et al., 2004) (S3LS), suggested that our hypergraphs 415 are small-world networks, since they exhibited a high clustering coefficient and a small average path length.

Most of the work in WSI is based on the vector space model, where the context of each instance of a target word is represented as a vector of features (e.g second-order word cooccurrences) (Schutze, 1998; Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).

Following the example in (Agirre et al., 2006), only nouns are kept and lemmatised.

Our system participates in 414 SemEval-2007 word sense induction and discrimination task (SWSID) (Agirre and Soroa, 2007).
W07-2002
HyperLex (Veronis, 2004) and the adaptation of PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998) in (Agirre et al., 2006) have been shown to outperform the most frequent sense (MFS) baseline in terms of supervised recall, but they still fall short of supervised WSD systems.
