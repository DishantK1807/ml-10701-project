Ranking algorithms, such as Kleinberg’s HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in Web-link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks, and more recently in text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Mihalcea et al., 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004).

For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit1, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (Lin and Hovy, 2003a).

Previous approaches include supervised learning (Hirao et al., 2002), (Teufel and Moens, 1997), vectorial similarity computed between an initial abstract and sentences in the given document, intradocument similarities (Salton et al., 1997), or graph algorithms (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004), (Wolf and Gibson, 2004).

Earlier experiments with graph-based ranking algorithms for text summarization, as previously reported in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and (Erkan and Radev, 2004), were either limited to singledocument English summarization, or they were applied to English multi-document summarization, but in conjunction with other extractive summarization techniques that did not allow for a clear evaluation of the impact of the graph algorithms alone.

It is also notable the study reported in (Lin and Hovy, 2003b) discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for text summarization, 23 Single document “Meta” summarization algorithm summarization algo.

In this paper, we show that a method for extractive summarization relying on iterative graph-based algorithms, as previously proposed in (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) can be applied to the summarization of documents in different languages without any requirements for additional data.
