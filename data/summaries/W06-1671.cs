Work McDonald et al.(2005) present clustering techniques to extract complex relations, i.e. relations with more than two arguments.

Most other work on relation extraction focuses only on binary relations (Zelenko et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2000; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).
A00-2030 P04-1054
Common approaches to relation extraction include pattern matching (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000) and classification (Zelenko et al., 2003; Kambhatla, 2004).

This is analogous to the method used in McDonald et al.(2005) for relation extraction.

We build upon this work in three ways: (1) Our system learns the compatibility between sets of fields, rather than just pairs of field; (2) our system is not restricted to relations between entities in the same sentence; and (3) our problem domain has a varying number of fields per record, as opposed to the fixed schema in McDonald et al.(2005). Bansal et al.(2004) present algorithms for the related task of correlational clustering: finding an optimal clustering from a matrix of pairwise compatibility scores.

These higher-order features have also recently been investigated in other models of coreference, both discriminative (Culotta and McCallum, 2006) and generative (Milch et al., 2005).

Also, Culotta et al.(2004) automatically extract contact records from web pages, but use heuristics to cluster fields into records.
