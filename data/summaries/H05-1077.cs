Chklovski and Pantel (2004) address the automatic acquisition of verb-verb pairs and their relations from the web.

Morris and Hirst (2004) perform a study on lexical semantic relations which ensure text cohesion.

As mentioned before, most previous work on distributional similarity has focused either on a specific word-word relation (such as Pereira et al.(1993) referring to a direct object noun for describing verbs), or used any syntactic relationship detected by the chunker or parser (such as Lin (1999; 1998) and McCarthy et al.(2003)). Naturally, the contribution of distributional features depends on the distributional objects and the application, but our results suggest that it is worth determining a task-specific set of prominent features.

We are specifically interested in those cases, because we expect that human associations cover the range of possible semantic verb relations to a large extent, and we believe that they represent an excellent basis for defining an exhaustive set, as alternative to e.g. text-based relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004).

First, the notion of semantic verb relations is crucial for many NLP tasks and applications such as verb clustering (Pereira et al., 1993; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Lin, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 2003), thesaurus extraction (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al., 2003), word sense discrimination (Sch¨utze, 1998), text indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990), and summarisation (Barzilay et al., 2002).

1We follow Morris and Hirst (2004) and refer to the paradigmatic WordNet relations as the ”classical” relations.

Most previous work on distributional similarity has either focused on a specific word-word relation (such as Pereira et al.(1993) referring to a direct object noun for describing verbs), or used any dependency relation detected by the chunker or parser (such as Lin (1999; 1998), and McCarthy et al.(2003)). Little effort has been spent on varying the (mostly nominal) types of verb features.
