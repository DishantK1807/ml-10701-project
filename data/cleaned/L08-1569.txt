<context> a confidence of 66.87%, but ”ˆIn deal, pe Militari” was also attributed to Mateiu with a confidence of 58.94%. The role of punctuation in authorship identification problem was anticipated by Chaski (Chaski, 1996). The punctuation (especially , and ; ) is the one who betrayed on Albala in his challenge to continue the novel of Mateiu, and we can say that the Albala’s stylom is different on the Mateiu’s stylom</context>

<context>ction words are generally considered good indicators of style because their use is very unlikely to be under the conscious control of the author and because of their psychological and cognitive role (Chung and Pennebaker, 2007). Also function words prove to be very effective in many author attribution studies. The novelty of the distance measure resides in the way it use the information given by the function word frequenci</context>

To calculate the distance between two rankings we used Rank distance (Dinu, 2003), an ordinal distance tightly related to the so-called Spearman’s footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977). Usage of the ranking of function words in the calculation of the distance instead of the actual values of the frequencies may seem as a loss of information, but we consider that the process of rank</context>
