Nastase and Szpakowicz (2003) present a two-level hierarchy for classifying noun-modifier relations in base noun phrases from general text, with 5 classes at the top and 30 classes at the bottom; other researchers (Turney and Littman, 2005; Turney, 2005; Nastase et al., 2006) have used their class scheme and data set.

Approximately a half of all wordforms in the Lithuanian annotated corpus are morphologically ambiguous (Rimkut, 2006), which is comparable to other inflected languages, e.g. for the Czech language it is 46% (Haji, 2004:173).

However, at the short term, the incorporation of these type of features will force us to either build a new decoder or extend an existing one, or to move to a new MT architecture, for instance, in the fashion of the architectures suggested by Tillmann and Zhang (2006) or Liang et al.(2006).

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

This makes it suitable for discriminative SMT training, which is still a challenge for large parameter sets (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006).

Approaches evaluated so far make use of dictionaries with semantic annotation (Piao et al., 2006), WordNet (Pearce, 2001), automatically generated thesauri (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al., 2003; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), vector-based methods that measure semantic distance (Baldwin et al., 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006), translations extracted from parallel corpora (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006) or hybrid methods that use machine learning techniques informed by features coded using some of the above methods (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).

Following the growing awareness of the deciency of n-gram based automatic MT evaluation, many studies attempted to improve upon n-gram based metrics (Zhou et al., 2006; Liu, et al., 2005,2006) as well as propose ways to evaluate MT evaluation metrics (Lin, et al.2004).
