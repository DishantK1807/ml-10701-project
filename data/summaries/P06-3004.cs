The Wall-Street-Journal part (WSJ) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) plays a central role in research on statistical treebank-based parsing.

Therefore, we take advantage of the availability of two similar treebanks of German, T¨uBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2003) and NeGra (Skut et al., 1997).

Dubey and Keller (2003) analyze the difficulties that German imposes on parsing.
P03-1013
For the English WSJ, high accuracy parsing models have been created, some of them using extensions to classical PCFG parsing such as lexicalization and markovization (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003).
A00-2018 P03-1054
Gildea (2001) investigates the effects that certain treebank characteristics have on parsing results, such as the distribution of verb subcategorization frames.

We will conduct further experiments with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) which considers broader contexts in its probability.
P03-1054
Corazza et al.(2004) conduct experiments with model 2 of Collins’ parser (Collins, 1999) and the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) on two Italian treebanks.
P03-1054
Various treebanks are available, among them are two similar ones: NeGra (Skut et al., 1997), from Saarland University at Saarbr¨ucken and T¨uBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2003), from the University of T¨ubingen.
