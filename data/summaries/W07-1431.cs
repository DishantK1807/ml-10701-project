Up to now, the most successful approaches have used fairly impoverished semantic representations, relying on measures of lexical or semantic overlap (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), pattern-based relation extraction (Romano et al., 2006), or approximate matching of predicate-argument structure (Hickl et al., 2006).

We rely on the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), a Treebank-trained statistical parser, for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and phrase-structure parsing.

(Thus, wine haspositive polarity in no meal without wine because it falls under two downward-monotone operators.) 3 The NatLog System Our natural logic system, dubbed the NatLog system, has a three-stage architecture similar to those in (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005; MacCartney et al., 2006), comprising (1) linguistic pre-preprocessing, (2) alignment, and (3) entailment classification.

Doing inference with representations close to natural language has also been advocated by Jerry Hobbs, as in (Hobbs, 1985).
