A recent study (Kan et al., 2001) uses topic composition from text headers, but other studies in the extraction paradigm (Goldstein et al., 1999), extraction coupled with rhetorical structural identification (Teufel and Moens, 2002), and syntactic abstraction paradigms use different methodologies (Barzilay et al., 1999; McKeown et al., 1999).

These include systems for machine translation (Viegas et al., 1998), question answering, (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2003), and information retrieval (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2000).

Sub-events (Daniel et al., 2003) and sub-topics (Saggion and Lapalme, 2002) also contribute to the framework used for comparing documents in multidocument summarization.

Some of the consequences of research in lexical semantics, with particular attention to natural language processing, are discussed by Pustejovsky et al.(1993) and Nirenburg and Raskin (1996).

This analysis depends on the SPECIALIST Lexicon and the Xerox part-of-speech tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and provides simple noun phrases that are mapped to concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus using MetaMap (Aronson, 2001).

Radev (2000) defines twenty-four relationships (such as equivalence, subsumption, and contradiction) that might apply at various structural levels across documents.
W00-1009
Abstraction, on the other hand, relies either on linguistic processing followed by structural compaction (Mani et al., 1999) or on interpretation of the source text into a semantic representation, which is then condensed to retain only the most important information asserted in the source.
