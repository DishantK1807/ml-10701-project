We found this algorithm to converge faster than the current state-ofthe-art in Maxent training, which is L2-regularized L-BFGS (Malouf, 2002)1.

Most of the previous work on statistical machine translation, as exemplified in (Brown et al., 1993), employs word-alignment algorithm (such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)) that provides local associations between source and target words.

This logistic regression is also called Maxent as it finds the distribution with maximum entropy that properly estimates the average of each feature over the training data (Berger et al., 1996).

∀i∃j(f(si) = tj ∨f(si) = epsilon1) (1) For the work reported in this paper, we have used the GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2003) which implements a string-alignment algorithm.

here: all state hypotheses of a whole sentence are kept in memory), it is necessary to either use heuristic forward pruning or constrain permutations to be within a local window of adjustable size (also see (Kanthak et al., 2005)).

The SFST approach described here is similar to the one described in (Bangalore and Riccardi, 2000) which has subsequently been adopted by (Banchs et al., 2005).

The BOW approach is different from the parsing based approaches (Melamed, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006) where the translation model tightly couples the syntactic and lexical items of the two languages.

Discriminative training has been used mainly for translation model combination (Och and Ney, 2002) and with the exception of (Wellington et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), has not been used to directly train parameters of a translation model.

For the Hansard corpus we used the same training and test split as in (Zens and Ney, 2004): 1.4 million training sentence pairs and 5432 test sentences.

A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntax-based) transduction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al., 2005).
