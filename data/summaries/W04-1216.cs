Since most dependency relationships involve words that are situated close to one another, the dependency relationships can often be approximated by cooccurrence relationships within a small window (Turney 2001); (Terra and Clarke 2003).

The following formula is introduced in (Lee 1999) for word similarity-based smoothing: )4( ),( )|(),( )|( )( )( 1 ∑ ∑ ∈′ ∈′ + ′ ′′ = tt tt wSw tt wSw tttt tt wwsim wtagPwwsim wtagP where S(w) is a set of candidate similar words and sim(w,w’) is the similarity between word w and w’.

Many methods have been proposed to compute distributional similarity between words, e.g., (Hindle, 1990), (Pereira et al.1993), (Grefenstette 1994) and (Lin 1998).

Many researchers adapt their systems from MUC to the biomedical domain, such as (Fukuda et al 1998), (Proux et al 1998), (Nobata et al 2000), (Collier et al 2000), (Gaizauskas et al 2000), (Kazama et al 2002), (Takeuchi et al 2002), (Lee et al 2003) and (Zhou et al 2004).
