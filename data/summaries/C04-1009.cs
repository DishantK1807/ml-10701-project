Use of unification (a core operation in HPSG) in CG dates at least as far back as Karttunen (1986, 1989), Uszkoreit (1986), and Zeevat (1988).

has focused on spurious ambiguity and its effects on efficiency (see Karttunen 1986; see Vijay-Shankar and Weir 1990 for proof of a polynominal-time parsing algorithm and Clark and Curran 2004b for statistical models of CCG parsing), however most of these solutions are parser based.

Thus the type hierarchy provides an explicit means for encoding broad typological parameters not directly statable in CCG (see Bender et al.2002 for further discussion and Villavicencio 2001 on acquisition of word order parameters).
W02-1502
Rather than making proprietary modifications to the LKB’s parser, I instead adopt Eisner’s (1996) CCG normal form to eliminate spurious ambiguity.
P96-1011
For more discussion of the efficiency of this approach see Eisner (1996) and Clark and Curran (2004a).
