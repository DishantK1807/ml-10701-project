In logic grammars (Definite Clause Granmars (Pereira & Warren, 1980), Extraposition Grammars (Pereira, 1981), M~difier Structure Grammars (Dahl & ~L-~Drd, 1983)) this book-keeping need not be completely explicit, but the interpreter of the language (usually a dialect of PROLOG) has to keep track of the binding of the variables, of the clauses that have not been used (but could be used in case of failure of the current path), and so on.

The separation between the rules of the two sets is the feature that makes the system robust from a syntactic point of view (see (Lesmo & Torasso, 1984) for further details).

In some cases (see (Lesm~ & Torasso, 1983) for a more detailed discussion) the backtracking mechanism is still needed, but, although we are not unable to provide experimental evidence, we believe that it cou/d be substituted by diagnostic procedures of the type discussed, with different purposes and within a different fomTalism, in (Weischedel & Black, 1980).
J80-2003
%~e fragment of grammar reported in (Huang, 1984) gives the i~pression of a set of rules "flatter" than the ones that normally appear in standard grammars (this is not a negative aspect; it is a feature of the ATNs too).
P84-1053
It is based on Modifier Structure Grammars (MSG), a logic formalism introduced in (Dahl & McCord, 1983), which constit%Ites an extension of the Extraposition Grammar by F.

A~LYSIS OF CDNJUNL~IONS Before starting the description of the n~chanisms adop~=d to analyze conjunctions, it is worth noting that the analysis of conjunctions was already mentioned in a previous paper (Lesmo & Torasso, 1984).
P84-1114
The presentation of the solution we adopted is based on the classification of sentences containing conjunctions reported in (Huang, 1984) : we will start from the simpler cases and introduce the more ccmplex examples later.
