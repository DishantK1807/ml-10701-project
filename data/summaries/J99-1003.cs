Other bitext mapping algorithms mitigate this source of noise either by assigning lower weights to correspondence points associated with frequent word types (Church 1993) or by deleting frequent word types from the bitext altogether (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993).

The input to word_align is the output of char_align and Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993) have reported that word_align cannot escape from char_align's worst errors.
P93-1001
In 1991, two teams of researchers independently discovered that sentences from bitexts involving clean translations can be aligned with high accuracy just by matching sentence sequences with similar lengths (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a).

Then they adapted Brown et al.'s (1993) statistical translation Model 2 to work with this model of cooccurrence.

Although the above statement was made about translation problems faced by human translators, recent research (Brown et al.1993; Melamed 1996b) suggests that it also applies to problems in machine translation.

This distribution can be compared to the error distributions reported for the same test set by Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993), who reported parts of their error distribution in words, rather than in characters: "In 55% of the cases, there is no error in word_align's output (distance of 0), in 73% the distance from the correct alignment is at most 1, and in 84% the distance is at most 3" (Dagan, Church, and Gale 1993, 7).

These points of correspondence could then be further refined using the methods previously developed by Church (1993) and Dagan, Church, and Gale (1993).

However bitext mapping at the sentence level is not an option for many bitexts (Church 1993).
P93-1001
Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) took advantage of various lexical "anchors" in the bitext that they were experimenting with.
P91-1022
Like char_align (Church 1993), SIMR infers bitext maps from likely points of correspondence between the two texts, points that are plotted in a two-dimensional space of possibilities.
P93-1001
A limitation of Church's method, and therefore also of Dagan, Church, and Gale's method, is that orthographic cognates exist only among languages with similar alphabets (Church et al.1993). Fung investigated ways to make these methods useful when cognates cannot be found.
P93-1001
Like the algorithms of Gale and Church (1991a) and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991), SIMR exploits the cor2 See Melamed (1998a) for a general discussion of models of co-occurrence.
P91-1022
Church's rough bitext maps were intended for input into Dagan, Church, and Gale's (1993) slower algorithm for refinement.
P93-1001
Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) formulated the problem as a hidden Markov model (HMM), based on a two-stage generative process.
P91-1022
Inversions occur surprisingly often in real bitexts, even for sentence-size segments (Church 1993).
