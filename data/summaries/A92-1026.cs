â€¢ The scores derived from the preference heuristics that have been encoded in DIALOGIC over the years, described and systematized in Hobbs and Bear (1990).

Such strategies involve deemphasizing the role of syntactic analysis (Jacobs et al., 1991), producing partial parses with stochastic or heuristic parsers (de Marcken, 1990; Weischedel et al 1991) or resorting to weaker syntactic processing methods such as conceptual or case-frame based parsing (e.g., Schank and Riesbeck, 1981) or template matching techniques (Jackson et M., 1991).

Moore and Dowding (1991) observed a ninefold increase ill time required to parse sentences with a straightforward C, KY parser as opposed to a shift-reduce parser.

In addition, it is assuined that the set of events, abstract entities, and physical objects mentioned in the text is to be consistently minimized The best set of assumptions necessary to find such a proof can be regarded as an explanation of its truth, and constitutes the implicit information required to produce the interpretation (Hobbs, Stickel, et al., 1990).

Grishman and Sterling, 1989), solnetimes, the best fraglnentary analysis of a sentence can only be found by parsing an intermediate or terminal substring that excludes the leftmost words.
H89-2011
This problem of recombining parts is in general a difficulty that is faced by parsers thai, produce phrasal rather than sentential parses (e.g., Weischedel et al., 1991).
