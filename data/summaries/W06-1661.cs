Let us here analogously define CG D2 BP CUDC BD BNBMBMBMBNDC C9 CV to be the negative counterpart, so that for a given pair DC BP B4D7 CX BND6 CY B5 BE CG D2, we have that D6 CY BE CHB4D7 CX B5 but D6 CY is not annotated as a preferred realization of D7 CX . Fol1We use the TADM open-source package (Malouf, 2002) for training the models, using its limited-memory variable metric as the optimization method and experimentally determine the optimal convergence threshold and variance of the prior.

The present results extend our earlier work (Velldal, Oepen, & Flickinger, 2004)—and the related work of Nakanishi, Miyao, & Tsujii (2005)—to an enlarged data set, more feature types, and additional learners.

When it 518 comes to estimating1 the parameters DB, the procedure seeks to maximize the (log of) a penalized likelihood function as in (6) CMDB BP CPD6CVD1CPDC DB D0D3CVC4B4DBB5 A0 C8 CS CXBPBD DB BE CX BEAR BE where C4B4DBB5 is the ‘conditionalized’ likelihood of the training data CG D4 (Johnson et al., 1999), computed as C4B4DBB5 BP C9C6 CXBPBD D4 DB B4D6 CX CYD7 CX B5.

The second term of the likelihood function in Equation (6) is a penalty term that is commonly used for reducing the tendency of log-linear models to over-fit, especially when training on sparse data using many features (Chen & Rosenfeld, 1999; Johnson et al., 1999; Malouf & Noord, 2004).

Templates For the purpose of parse selection, Toutanova, Manning, Shieber, Flickinger, & Oepen (2002) and Toutanova & Manning (2002) train a discriminative log-linear model on the Redwoods parse treebank, using features defined over derivation trees with non-terminals representing the construction types and lexical types of the HPSG grammar (see Figure 1).

The basic feature set of our MaxEnt realization ranker is defined in the same way (corresponding to the PCFG-S model of Toutanova & Manning, 2002), each feature capturing a sub-tree from the derivation limited to depth one.
