5 Lexico-syntactic constructions Lexico-syntactic constructions are extracted from the corpus, in the fashion suggested by Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
work One of the first studies on acquisition of hyponymy relations was made by Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
The work most similar to ours is that of Morin & Jacquemin (1999).
P99-1050
Caraballo (1999) let three judges evaluate ten internal nodes in the hyponymy hierarchy, that had at least twenty descendants.
P99-1016
Charniak & Roark (1998), evaluating the semantic lexicon against gold standard resources (the MUC-4 and the WSJ corpus), reports that the ratio of valid to total entries for their system lies between 20% and 40%.
P98-2182
Caraballo. 1999.
P99-1016
The internal nodes are labeled by the syntactic constructions from Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
The kappa value (Carletta, 1996) was used to evaluate the agreement among the judges and to estimate how difficult the evaluation task was.
J96-2004
It is difficult to compare these results with results from other studies such as that of Caraballo (1999), as the data used is not the same.
P99-1016
Morin and Jaquemin (1999)), it would have been possible to assume only one sense per word or phrase.
P99-1050
As discussed by Hearst (1992), more information is needed to solve the underspecification, and the missing information is probably found in previous sentences.
C92-2082
Caraballo (1999) uses a hierarchical clustering technique to build a hyponymy hierarchy of nouns.
P99-1016
The tagger we used, implemented by Megyesi (2001) for Swedish, is the TnT-tagger (Brants, 2000), trained on the SUC Corpus (Ejerhed et al., 1992).
A00-1031 W01-0519
Work by Riloff & Shepherd (1997) and Charniak & Roark (1998) aims to build semantic lexicons where the words included in each category or entry are related to, or are a member of the category.
P98-2182 W97-0313
In order to capture some of the data, we propose a similar but simpler algorithm to that of Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
The built-in ambiguity in the hyponymy hierarchy presented in (Caraballo, 1999) is primarily an effect of the fact that all information is composed into one tree.
P99-1016
As was also reported by Caraballo (1999), the judges sometimes found proper nouns (as hyponyms) hard to evaluate.
