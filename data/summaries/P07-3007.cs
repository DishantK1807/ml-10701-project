It is worth noting that we observed the same relation between subjectivity detection and polarity classification accuracy as described by Pang and Lee (2004) and Eriksson (2006).

Most of the authors traditionally use a classification-based approach for sentiment extraction and sentiment polarity detection (for example, Pang et al.(2002), Turney (2002), Kim and Hovy (2004) and others), however, the research described in this paper uses the information retrieval (IR) paradigm which has also been used by some researchers.
