As for computational applications of time theories, most work was done on temporal expressions that appear in scheduling dialogues (Busemann et al., 1997; Alexandresson et al., 1997).

Mani and Wilson (2000) point out “over half of the errors [made by his time-stamper] were due to propagation of spreading of an incorrect event time to neighboring events”.

The most relevant prior work is (Mani and Wilson, 2000), who implemented their system on news stories, introduced rules spreading time-stamps obtained with the help of explicit temporal expressions throughout the whole article, and invented machine learning rules for disambiguating between specific and generic use of temporal expressions (for example, whether Christmas is used to denote the 25 th of December or to denote some period of time around the 25 th of December).
