7:12	In total, we received twenty-nine workshop papers, and thirteen sites from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and United States participated in the bakeoff.
8:12	Richard Sproat has put tremendous effort in organizing the bakeoff.
9:12	We would also like to thank the four sites (Academia Sinica, the City University of Hong Kong, PekingUniversity, and the University of Pennsylvania)for providingthe trainingand testing data, and Tom Emerson for maintaining the workshop and bakeoff websites.
