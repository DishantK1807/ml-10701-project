Our general estimation method also has practical applications in cases one uses a probabilistic context-free grammar to approximate strictly more powerful rewriting systems, 335 as for instance probabilistic tree adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992).

This result has been firstly shown in (Chaudhuri et al., 1983) and later, with a different proof technique, in (Chi and Geman, 1998).

The result also holds for the relative weighted frequency estimator introduced in (Chi, 1999) as a generalization of the maximum likelihood estimator, and for the estimator introduced in (Nederhof, 2005) already discussedintheintroduction.

In (Chi, 1999) an estimator that maximizes the likelihood of a probability distribution defined over a finite set of trees is introduced, as a generalization of the maximum likelihood estimator.

Probabilistic context-free grammars are able to describe hierarchical, tree-shaped structures underlying sentences, and are widely used in statistical natural language processing; see for instance (Collins, 2003) and references therein.

This line of research was started in (Nederhof, 2005), investigating the problem of training an input probabilistic finite automaton from an infinite tree distribution specified by means of an input probabilistic context-free grammar.

In (Nederhof and Satta, 2004) relations are derived for the exact computation ofHd(pG).

The line of our argument below follows a proof provided in (Chi and Geman, 1998) for the maximum likelihood estimator based on finite tree distributions.

Such maximization provides the estimator (see for instance (Chi and Geman, 1998)) pG(A → α) = f(A → α,T )f(A,T ) . (28) Letusconsidertheestimatorin(10).

Under this condition, quantities outG(A) can be exactly computed by solving the following system of linear equations (see also (Nederhof, 2005)) outG(S) = 1; (14) for each A negationslash= S outG(A) = = summationdisplay B→β outG(B)·f(A,β)·pG(B → β).(15) 338 We can now prove the equality Hd(pG) = H(pT ||pG), (16) where G is the PCFG estimated by minimizing the cross-entropy in (5), as described in Section 3.

Probabilistic contextfree grammars seem also more suitable than finitestate devices for language modeling, and several language models based on these grammars have been recently proposed in the literature; see for instance (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), (Charniak, 2001) and (Roark, 2001).
