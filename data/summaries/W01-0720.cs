Here, we present experiments performed using two complex corpora, C1 and C2, extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).
H94-1020 J93-2004
The best crossing bracket rate of 4.70 compares favourably with Osborne and Briscoe (Osborne and Briscoe, 1997) who give crossing bracket rates of around 3 for a variety of systems.
W97-1010
CLL has then been applied to a corpus of declarative sentences from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994) on which it has been shown to perform comparatively well with respect to much less psychologically plausible systems, which are significantly more supervised and are applied to somewhat simpler problems.
H94-1020 J93-2004
Joshi and Srinivas (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) achieve a best of 77.26% accuracy.
C94-1024
Early results on small simple corpora with a simpler version of the learner were presented in (Watkinson and Manandhar, 1999; Watkinson and Manandhar, 2000).
W99-0909
Two measures are used to evaluate the parses: lexical accuracy, which is the percentage of correctly tagged words compared to the extracted gold standard corpus (Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001) and average crossing bracket rate (CBR) (Goodman, 1996).
P96-1024 W01-0904
Osborne and Briscoe (Osborne and Briscoe, 1997) present a fairly supervised system for learning unusual stochastic CGs (the atomic categories a far more varied than standard CG) again using part-of-speech strings rather than words.
W97-1010
Neither Joshi and Srinivas (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) nor Osborne and Briscoe (Osborne and Briscoe, 1997) can be considered psychologically plausible, but they are computationally effective and they do provide results for comparison.
C94-1024 W97-1010
Joshi and Srinivas (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) have developed a method called supertagging that similarly attaches complex syntactic tags (supertags) to words.
C94-1024
There is also a possibility of performing experiments on sequences of parts-of-speech, as Joshi and Srinivas (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) and Osborne and Briscoe (Osborne and Briscoe, 1997) did.
C94-1024 W97-1010
These can be compared with a gold standard CG annotated corpus which has been built (Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001), which has a size of 15,136 lexical entries and an average ambiguity of 1.25 categories per word.
