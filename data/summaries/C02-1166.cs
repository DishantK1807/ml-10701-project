(Rapp, 1999) reaches 89% on the German-English language pair, when considering the top 10 candidates.
P99-1067
Our implementation of this strategy relies on the following steps, and follows the one given in (Rapp, 1999): for each word w, build a context vector by considering all the words occurring in a window encompassing several sentences that is run through the corpus.
P99-1067
vectors: a basic building block Bilingual lexicon extraction from non-parallel but comparable corpora has been studied by a number of researchers, (Peters, 1995; Tanaka, 1996; Shahzad 1999; Rapp, 1999; Fung, 2000) among others.
P99-1067
We chose the loglikelihood ratio test, (Dunning, 1993), to measure this association the context vectors of the target words are then translated with our general bilingual dictionary, leaving the weights unchanged (when several translations are proposed by the dictionary, we consider all of them with the same weight) the similarity of each source word s, for each target word t, is computed on the basis of the cosine measure the similarities are then normalized to yield a probabilistic translation lexicon, P(t|s).
