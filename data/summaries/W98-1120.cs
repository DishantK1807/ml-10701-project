Because the system of (Bennett et al, 1997) makes multiple decisions at each token, they could assign multiple, possibly inconsistent tags.

In this regard, we are similar to (Bikel et al, 1997), which also uses a probabilistic method in their HMM based system.

Work There have been several efforts to apply machine learning techniques to the same task (Cowie, 1995) (Bikel et al, 1997) (Gallippi, 1996) (Bennett et al, 1997) (Borthwick et al, 1997).

In this section, we will discuss a system which is one of the most advanced and which closely resembles our own (Bennett et al, 1997).

We can think of several strategies to solve this problem (for example, the method adopted by (Bennett et al.1997) will be described in a later section), but we used a probabilistic method.
