Generating a Coherent Text Describing a Traffic Scene Hans-Joachim NovalP Fachbereich Informatik, Universitgt Hamburg D-2000 Hamburg 13, West-Germany Abstract If a system that embodies a reference semanl;ic for motion verbs and prepositions is to generate a coherent text describing the recognized motions it needs it decision procedure ~,o select Ihe events.
In NAOS event, selection is done by use of a specialization hierarchy of mellon verbs.
The st.rategy of anticipated visualization is used tbr the selection of optional deep cases, qJhe system exhibits low-level strategies which are based on verbinherent, properties that allow the generation of a coherent descriptive I;ext.
t I~troductlon This contribution focuses on the verbalization component of t;he NAOS system (the acronym stands for NAtural language description of Object movements in a traffic Scene).
NAOS is designed to explore the border area between computer vision and natural language processing, especially the realm of recognizing and ver-balizing motion concepts in image sequences.
NAOS goes all the way h'om a representation of a real~world traffic scene to a natural language text describing the scene.
The representation of the scene basically consists of its geometry (theretbre called geometric scene description (GSD))+ ~lk) giw~ an impression of the representation a GSD contains for each frame of the image sequence: o instance of time o visible objects o viewpoint o illumination o 31) shape o surface characteristics (color) o class o identity 31) position and orientation in each flame (fl)r a detailed description,,f the GSD see \[t6\]).
For event recognition we use event models (\[18\], \[191) which define a reference semantic for motion verbs.
In t, he current implementation of the NAOS system about 35 motion verbs and (,he prepositions beside, 1)y, in~fronl;oof, near, and on may />e recognized by matching the event models against the representation of the scene.
In this paper we are neither concerned with the representation of t.he underlying scene data nor with the question of event recognition as tt...... issues haw, bee,, put,list,ed elsewhere (see \[10\] \[171 \[20\]).
Instead, we fi)cns on the generation of a coherent t;exl, describing the irnage sequel'lee.
In the nexl, section we brielly describe the represent, ation of the recognized events which fi)rm the initial data for the verbalizatiou eotllpo+lerlt, tl)hen I,}+e overall strategy fnr (:on+p(ming a coher(!llt description is discussed.
The fblk)wing section i,ltrodnces a part, ial solution to the selection problem which is based on the strategy of anticipated visualization.
Fourth, we show how some linguistic choiees like passlve~ restrictive relative elanses, and negation I thank B.
Neumamt who contributed several ideas to this article.
are natural consequences of the task of generating unambiguous referring expressions.
In the last section we relate our research with current work on language generation.
\]\[nitiaJ~ \]Data Verbalization starts when event reeognil, ion has been aclfiew~d.
Besides complex event, s like overtalm and turn off, other predi-cares like in-front-of, I)esi(les, move, etc.
are also inst, antiated.
Pleh)w is a section of the database after event recognition has taken place (the original entries are ill German).
1: (MOVE PERSONI 0 40) 2: (WAI,K PERSONI 0 40) 3: (RECE1)E PERSON I FBI 20 40) 4: (OWmTAKE BMW~ VWI 00:12) (~,~ 3~,)) 5: (MOVE BMW1 l0 40) 6: (IN-FRONT-OF VWl TRAFFIC-LKHITI 27 32) "\]'he above entries are instantiations of event models containing symbolic identifiers for scene objects (e.g.
BMWI). Tile last two elements of an instantiation denote the start and end time of the event.
We use the following notations to denote the event time: ~.
(....rb Te) ~.
(....(r<,,, Tb ....
) ('r~,,,,, r, ......
)) a.
(....(rb,,.,+ Tb ......
) "r).
4. (....rb re ......
)) Tb, Te denote start and end t, ime of an event.
The first notation is used for (htratlve events (e.g.
move). A duratlve event, is also valid for each subinterval of (Tb Te).
The secolld t+oi, ation is tlsed for ilO\]l-dllrative evelltl; (e.g.
overtake). Start and end time of such an event are Imth restrk:ted by lower and upper bounds.
Note, that nmt.-dnratlve events are not wdid for each subinterval of the event boundarie~L The third notation b; used for re.(mltafive events (e.g.
stop). The start time ofa resnltatlve event lies within an interwd whereas the end time is a time--point.
Finally, the last notation is used for inchoatlve events (e.g.
start moving, corresponding to the German verb loafah-.
ten). )!nchoative events have a well defined start time whereas the end time lies within an interval.
For the task of generating a coherent description of a tra\[fic scene NAOS first instantiates all event models and predicates which may be instantiated using the scene data.
This leads to the well known selection problem of natural language generation.
For one object, timre may be many instantiations with different time intervals, hence the task of the verbalization component, to choose what to say.
In the next section we discuss the theoretical background on which our verbalization component is based.
3 'Iheoretmal Background In general, language is not generated per se but is Mways in.tended for a hearer.
Furthermore, language is used to fulfil certain 570 goals of the speaker which may sometimes simply be to inform the hearer about certain facts.
In NAOS the generatioo of a deseriptiou of the underlying image sequence aims at diminishing the discrepancy between tim :~ystem's knowledge of the scene and the heater's knowledge (the same motivation is nsed in Davcy's program \[61).
Concernig the hearer we make the following assumptions: 1.
S/he knows tide static baekgrmmd of the scene, i.e. the streets, houses, traffic lights, etc.
2. S/he did not utter specific interests except: Describe ~he scel\]e!
A description may be the result of snch diverse speech acts aa !NI?ORM, PROMISE+ PERSUADE, or CONVINCE.
NAOS only generates the speech act INFORM.
qb inform a hearer abotlL something means to tell her/his1 something s/he has not known before, somethint, that is tr,le and new.
In NAOS the definition of true utt, erances buiht~+ on the situational semantics of Barwise and Perry \[31.
'rhcy mtderstand t, he Iueanillg Of an utterance as a relatiou t)etwcetl the tit\[clause alld the described sitmation.
The interpretatiou of an utLerance by a hearer usually consists of a set, of possible situations with a meaning relation I;o the ut, terance.
We now define an uta:rance to be true if the set of possible situations cooJ~ains the actually occnrred situation.
The requirement to generate true utterances has two consequellces for our verbalization component, l,'irst, the verbalization process nnlst take the bearer's lneanillg relations into account.
This coincides with the eommtmication rule to tune one's utterances to the heater's comprehension ability.
Second, assumiug that the speaker has tide same meatnng relations as the hearer, the speaker can itltticipate the hearer's interpretation of an IILteraaee, ie.
the possible situations implied solely by the utterance can be generated without knowledge of the actual situation.
In the case of scene descriptions these situations are equivalenl; to the heater's visualization of an unknown scene.
An utteraace must be new to tile hearer in order I,o inform him.
In the context of situational semantics we define an utterance to be new if its interpretation restricts the set of possible situations implied by previous utterances.
Thus new information additionally specifies described situations.
The task of a verbalization component is to choose utterances such that they inform in the above sense.
Therefore it is necessary to anticipate the hearer's understanding for judging whether a planned utterance carries new information, The general principle tbr hearer simulation is depicted in figure 1.

A lirst seleclfion process chooses amoug the instantiatiotis those which are to be verbalized.
As event models are associated with verbs the appropriat, c case frame of the verb is available.
A second selection process now chooses among the optional deep cases of the verb.
This is where the deep case semantics comes into play.
If, for instance, it it+ decided that a locative expression should be generated it is necessary to know how the location of an object may be expressed in natural language as in the geometric scene descriptiou the location of an object is given by its x, y, and z coordinates.
'l+}le deep ease setnanties also eoilt~Lius information about the prepositions which may be used for expressing a specific deep ease.
Assuming that the hearer has the same meaning relations as the speaker he basically can use the speaker's processes in reverse order and reconstruct the underlying case fi'ame froro I.he utterance and thns build a visualized scene description.
Note, however, that we agree with Olsou \[21\] that the verbalization of a visual ewmt always leads to a loss of infkwmation.
In our cam~, for instance, we ca\[lllOt }lSSlli'Ile /~llat the hearer knows the x, y, aud z coordinates of,an object when he hears tim phrase i~l \[font o' the del;arf, lne,qt o# comptJter science.

As shown in figure I the case frame of a verb plays a cetttral role in our verbalization compoaent.
We adopt the view of Fillmore expressed in his scelles-+and-fralnes selnallLic \[71 I;ll+tt case frames relate sceues to natural language expressions.
4 The
~3election Problem Usually this ln'oblem is divided intc~ the subtasks of deeiding what to mxy and how t,.
say it,.
As mentioned above NAOS uses two selection processes.
First, it selects amoug the instantiated events and second, it selects among the optional deep cases of the verb associated with the choseu evellt.
The first selection process corresponds to deciding what to say and the second one determines largely how to say it as will be shown later.
The selection processes are based on the representation of the ease semantics of an event model and on a specialization hierarchy of the verbs.
Below is the representation of the case semantics for tile event model iiberholen (overtake).
Agent-RestL : VEIti(0LE Deep--canen : (VERB UEBERHflL) (UEBERI10LEN *SBJ1 *0B J2 *T1 *T2) Obligatory : (AGENT AGT-..EXP) (ItEF AgT-EXP *OBJI) (TENSE TNS.,I~XP) (TIME-REF 'fNS-EXP *T1 *T2) (OBJECTIVE SBJ F, XP) (REF OBJ-EXP *ON J2) Optional : (LOCA'rIVE LOO--EXP) (LOC-'N.EF LUC-EXP *SBJ1 *Ti *'1'2) Combilm~ionlJ : NIL Loc-prep~3: (All AUI,' BEI IIINTER I~l NEITEN UEI\]ER UNTF, R VOR Z~,'llSCttl;;tO The first slot specifies the agent restriction.
The deep<asus slot 571 contains first the verb stem of iiberholen as needed by the generation component and second the formal notation for an instantiation.
The obligatory cases must be generated but may be omitted in the surface string in case of elliptic utterances whereas optional deep cases need not be generated at all.
In the combinations slot it is represented which deep cases may be generated together (e.g.
for the verb fahren (drive) it is not allowed to generate a single SOURCE but instead SOURCE and GOAL must be generated).
The Lot-preps slot specifies the prepositions which may be used with the verb iiberholen to generate locative expressions.
The case descriptions in the obligatory and optional slots consist of two parts: a declaration of an identifier for the case expression on the language side, and a predicate (in general a list of predicates) relating the case expression to the scene data.
The most important predicates are REF, TIME-REF, and LOC-REF.
REF generates referring phrases for internal object descriptors like BMW1.
TIME-REF generates the tense of the verb.
As descriptions are usually given in present tense, presently TIME-REF only generates this tensc.
LOC-REF relates the abstract location of the object as given by its coordinates to a natural language expression for a reference object.
Note, that REF has to be used to generate a referring phrase for the reference object.
Consider the sixth entry of the database in section 2.
The instantiation only contains internal identifiers for objects, like traflic-lightl, for which referring phrases have to be generated (see section 4 for further details on REF).
In NAOS we use a specialization hierarchy for motion verbs.
This hierarchy is pragmatically motivated and is rooted in situational semantics.
It is no hierarchy of motion concepts as the one proposed in \[23\].
It connects general verbs witb more special ones.
A situation which may be described using a special verb implies the application of all more general verbs Take for instance the verb iiberholen (overtake).
\[t implies the use of the more general verbs vorueberfahren~ vorl)nifahren (drive past), passieren (pass), naehern-r (approach), entfernen-r (recede), fahren (drive, move), and bewegen-r (move).
It shonld be intuitively plausible that such a hierarchy is also used for event recognition.
If, for instance, no naehern-r (approach) can be instantiated the more special events need not be tested.
4.1 Event
Selection In NAOS the overall strategy for generating a descriptive text is as follows: * Group all moving objects according to their classmembership; • For each object in each group describe the motions of the object for the time interval during which it was visible in the scene, Event selection for an object is done according to the following algorithm: 1.
Collect all events in the interval where the object was visible and where the object was the agent; 2.
determine for each timepoint during the object's visibility the most special event of the above collected ones; 3.
if two events have the same specificity then either take the one which started earlier and has the same or longer duration as the other one or take the one with longer duration; 4.
put the selected events on the verbalization list of the object in temporally consecutive order.
Consider the following example.
All events which were found for PERSON1 are: 572 (RECEDE PERSON1 FBI 20 40)(ENTFERNEN-R PERSDI\]I FDI 20 40) (}/ALK PERSONI 0 40) (OEHEI~ PERSONI 0 40) (MOVE PERSONI O 40) (BE~//EGEN-R PERSOIll 0 40) The above algorithm leads by use of the specialization hierarchy to the following verbalization list for PERSON1: (((~IALK PERSOI~I 0 40) (0 20)) ((RECEDE PERSON1 FBI 20 40) (20 40))) (The last entry in parenthesis of each selected event denotes the interval in which the event was the most special one).
4.2 Selection
of Optional Deep Cases This selection process is our first implementation of the strategy of anticipated visualization.
The underlying question is: Which optional deep cases should be selected to restrict the hearer's possibilities of placing the trajectory of an object in his internal model of the static background of the scene?
In NAOS the selection algorithm answering the above question is rather straightforward.
It is based on the manner of action of the verb, the verbtype, and the heater's knowledge.
The algorithm is graphically represented in figure 2.
EVENTTYPE NON-DURATIVE, INCHOATIVE DURATIVE Tl,,o = EB A T,,,a = SE Tb,~ = SB ^ T,,,d ¢~ SE T~,~ ~S B A T,,d = S E VERBTYPE DIR LOC RED DIR,LOC RED RED DIR, STAT LOC STAT DIR, REO LOC STAT DIR LOC RED DEEP CASES LOCATIVE?

SOURCE?, DIRECTION?
NIL RED NIL T~,~ ~ 8B ^ T,,a ~ SE DIR, STAT LOCATIVE?
LOC SOURCE?, GOAL7 Figure 2: Selection of Deep Cases The abbreviations denote: Tb~, Ten,t: start, end time of the event; SB, SE: scene begin and scene end; I)IR, LOC, STAT, RED: directional (turn off, return), locomotion (walk, overtake), and static (stand, wait) verbs, finally verbs whose recognition implies reference objects (reach s.
th., arrive at).
The figure has to be read as follows.
If an inchoative event like losfahren (start moving) has to be verbalized which has the verbtype locomotion, then choose direction? and locative? as deep cases.
The question mark generally means, look into the partnermodel Lo see whether this deep case has already been generated fi)r another event.
If so, determine by use of the object's actual location (represnnted in the scene representation) whether it is still valid.
If this is the case don't generate a uatural language expression for this deep case, otherwise do.
Presently the partnermodel contains information about the static background of the scene and about what has been said so far in the same relational notation as was shown for instantiations in section 2.
It is being updated when an event is verbalized.
Note, that for durative events the decision is based on whether the start and end time of the event coincide with the beginning or ending of the image sequence.
Consider the first case for durative events as given in figure 2.
Right from the beginning of the sequence there is a car moving along a street until the sequence ends.
In such a case it is not possible to verbalize a source as the object may have started its motion anywhere.
To restrict the hearer's visualization, direction and locative cases are verbalized, leading to a sentence like: The car moves on Schliiterstreet in direction of HaHerplace.
Verbalizing a direction when the static background is known restricts the trajectory to being on one side of the road.
Basically, our direction case is a goal or source ease where only two prepositional phrases are allowed, the German phrases in Richtung and aus Richtung (in direction~ from direction).
These phrases do not imply that the motion ends at the goal location as do most prepositional phrases in German which have to be in accusative surface case to denote a goal.
The English language is in this respect inherently ambiguous.
In the sentence The car moves behind the truck, the phrase behind the truck may denote a locative or goal deep case.
In German these eases arc distinguished at the surface.
\["or locative the above sentence translates to Des Aitto f~hrt hinter dem LKW, for the goal case, it translates to Des Auto f~hrt hinter den LKW.
We have to distinguish different verbtypes as e.g. the meaning of a directional phrase changes with the verl)type.
Consider the sentences The car moves in direction of Hallerplace versus The car stands in direction of l\[allerplace (in German both sentences arc well formed).
The first sentence denotes the direction of the motion whereas the second one denotes the orientation of I, hc car.
We thns distinguish between static (STAT) and h)eomotion (LOC) verbs.
The third verbtype, directional (I)IR), is used for verbs with a strong directional component like umkehren (return), abbiegen (turn off), etc.
As they already imply a certain direction the additional verbalization of a direction using a prepositional phrase does usually not lead to acceptable sentences.
The fourth type (REO) is used tbr verbs like erreichen (reach s.
th). having an obligatory locative case.
The main result to note here is that the selection processes are low-level and verboriented.
The only higher level goal is to inform the hearer and to convey as ranch information about an event as possible.
In the next section we show by differem; verbalizations of the same scene how rather complex syntactic structures arise.
5 Generation
The general scheme for the generation process is as follows: 1.
Sort the objects according to their classmembership, vehicles first, then persons; 2.
in the above partial order sort the objects according to their time of occurrence in the scene, earliest first; 3.
do for all elements in each verbalization list of each object (a) if the current event has a precedent and its event time is included in the precedent's, begin the sentence with dabei (in the meantime); go to (c); (b) if the current event has a precedent and its event time overlaps the precedent's, begin the sentence with unterdessen (approx, in the meantime); go to (c); (c) determine the optional deep cases and build a simple declarative sentence by using all chosen deep cases and applying the deep case semantics.
Two temporally consecutive events are not verbalized using a temporal adverb as in the cases of inclusion and overlapping.
This is due to the fact that from the linear order of the sentences the hearer usually infers consecutivity.
The result of the above algorithm is a formal representation of the surface sentence which, rougidy, contains the w~rb's stem, gemls verbi, modality, and person, all deep cases in random order, and all stems of the \[exical entries which appear in the surface sentence.
This representation is taken as input by the system SUTRA (for further details on the formal represeutation and the SUTRA system see \[41) which then generates a correctly inflected German sentence.
Below is an example of the output of NAOS.

The tall pedestrian walks hJ the direction of Dammtnr on the southern sidewalk west of Sehlseterstreet.
h~ the meantime he recedes from the department of compnter science.
19.,logout The first sentence above is a standard one having the same structure for all different scenes.
The remaining four paragraphs are motion descriptions for the tbur moving objects.
We now discuss step (c) of the above algorithm in more detail as it covers some interesting phenomena.
Consider the third paragraph describing the motions of the yellow VW.
The verbalization list for this object is: (((DRIVE VW1 10 20) (10 25)) ((RECEDE VW1 ~2 25 32) (25 32))) The beginning (SB) and ending of the sequence (SE) lie at points 0 and 40, respectively.
According to the selection algorithm (figure 3) a SOURCE should be verbalized for a durative event with the above event time if the verbtype is LOC.
The generation algorithm checks whether the chosen optional cases are allowed for the verb, if so, it is further checked whether the combinations are allowed.
As a SOURCE may not be generated alone for a fahren (drive, move) event, SOURCE and GOAL are generated.
The fourth paragraph shows the outcome of a deep case selection in which the chosen case is not allowed for the verb.
The verbalization llst for the black BMW contains only ilberholen (overtake) and entfernen-r (recede).
(((OVERTAKE BMWI VWI (10 12)(12 32) (10 32)) ((RECEDE Bl~qt ~/2 20 40) (32 40))) According to eventand verhtype DIRECTION is chosen as the appropriate deep case.
As this case may not be used with the verb overtake two sentences are generated, one describing the direction 573 of the motion and the other one describing tbe specific event.
The second sentence begins with a temporal advert) specifying that both motions occur at the same time.
In order to generate the two sentences first the classmembership of the agent of the verb which may not take the chosen deep case is determined.
Then the speeializationhierarehy is used to go up to either fahren (driv% move) or gnhen (walk) as those verbs may take any deep case.
Then the sentences are generated.
Consider the following verbalization list: (((OVERTAKE BI~WI VW1 (0 8) (12 18) ( 0 18)) ((DRIVE BI'~I 0 40) (18 40))) Assuming the direction and location of the motion to be the same as before the algorithm presented so fat" would generate A black BMW drives in the direction of Hallerplace.
During this time it overtakes the yellow VW in front of the department of computer science.
The black BMW drives.
According to the deep ease selection algorithm a DIRECTION and LOCATIVE should be generated for the second event above.
As both cases have already been generated with the first event and are still valid the sentence The black BMW drives is not generated because before generating a sentence it is checked whether the intbrmation is already known to the partner.
5.1 Referring
Phrases In this section some aspects of the referring phrase generator are discussed.
As can be seen from the example text objects are characterized by their properties, introdueed with indefinite noun phrases when they are not single representatives of a class and they may also be pronominalized to add to the coherence of the text.
Therefore we use standard techniques as e.g. described in \[8\], \[9\].
We want to stress one aspect of our referring phrase generator, namely its capability to generate restrictive relative clauses with motion verbs.
As it may be easily the ease that a scene contains two objects with similar properties the task arises to distinguish them and generate unequivocal referring expressions.
It is an interesting fact, that, we have several options to cope with this problem which each have their consequences.
One option is to adopt McDonald's scheme of generation without precisely knowing what to say next \[13\].
According to this scheme two similar objects are characterized in the following way in NAOS.
When the first one is introduced it is characterized by it's properties e.g. a yellow VW.
When the second one has to be introduced, REF notices that a yellow VW is already known to the partner and generates the phrase another yellow VW.
It starts getting interesting in subsequent reference.
The objects are then characterized by the events in which they were involved earlier whether as agent or in another role.
This leads to referring phrases like the yellow VW, which receded from the pedestrian or the yellow VW, which has been overtaken.
Note, how passive relative clauses arise naturally from the task of generating referring phrases in this paradigm.
The same is also true for negation.
Consider the case where the first yellow VW, say VWI, has passed an object and the second yellow VW, say VW2, has overtaken an object and both event,s are already known to the partner.
If REF has to generate again a referring phrase for VWI it notices that pass is a more general verb than overtake and may thus also be applied for the overtake event.
It therefore generates the phrase the yellow VW, which has not overtaken the other object to distinguish it unequivocally from VW2, Below is an example of this strategy in a texL for the same scene as above.
The difference to the th'st scene is that we replaced the green VW by a yellow one.

11.,logout The consequences of this first option are rather complex syntactic structures whieh are not inotivated by higher level stylisl.ic choices.
1,el us now look at a second opt, ion which has also been implemented.
Experience with the above algorithm for dill%rent scenes showed, that if more than two similar objects are in a scene the restrictive relative clauses become hardly mlderstandable.
We ~,hus determine how many similar objects there are in the scene before we start the generation process.
If there are more than two, REF generates names for them and introduces them as e.g. the first yellow VW, the second yellow VW and so on and uses these phrases in subsequent references.
An example of this strategy would look like the first example text where the different vehicles are nanmd l, he first ..., the second ....
Tbe rest of the text would remain the same.
Taking this option implies leaving McDonald's scheme and approaching to a planning paradigm.
It should be noted here that there is a third optimt which has hardly been investigated, namely to switch frmn contextual to cotextual reference as in phrases like the VW I mentioned last.
We need filrther research hefore we can use such techniques effectively.
6 Conclusion
and Related Research We have proposed the scheme of anticipated visualization to generate coherent texts describing reaL-wnrld events (visual data).
The selection algorithms are based on low-level, verbinherent pro.perties, and on a pragmatically motivated verb hierarchy.
'lk~gether with t, he verbalization component the NAOS system is now fully operational from event, recognition to text generation in the domain of trafl'ie scenes.
As this domain is rich enough to still pose a 1ol; of problems I, his opens up l, he ol)portunity t,o inl;egral;e higher level sl, rabelJies for e.g. combining sentences, selecting evengs, generating deie~ie expressions, el;e.
The main difference between NAOS and other systems for language generation is that, we approach the verbalization problem from the visual side.
and thus are led to use basic selection algoril;hms.
Other systems like TAI,ESI'iN \[151, KI)S \[12J, TEXT \[1,t, KAMI' \[l\], and I1AM-ANS \[1()} start their proeessi,g wibh language whereas NAOS starts with images.
