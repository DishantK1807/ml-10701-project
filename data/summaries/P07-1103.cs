This also confirms some of the findings of Kehler et al.(2004), who found features similar to 12Significance of improvement in F-measure is tested using a paired one-tailed t-test and p <= 0.05 (∗), p <= 0.01 (∗∗), and p <= 0.005 (∗∗∗).

The common coreference evaluation measure described in Vilain et al.(1995) is inappropriate in this setting.
M95-1005
We use a feature which is similar to that used by Strube & M¨uller (2003) in that it approximates the right frontier on the basis of syntactic (rather than discourse structural) relations.

E.g., if the anaphor is object, the following query6 is used: # (V|Vs|Ved|Ving) (∅|a|an|the|this|that) ANTE+ # (V|Vs|Ved|Ving) (∅|the|these|those) ANTES # (ANTE|ANTES) If the anaphor is the subject in an adjective copula construction, we use the following corpus count to quantify the compatibility between the predicated adjective and the NP antecedent (Lapata et al., 1999): # ADJ (ANTE|ANTES) + # ANTE (is|was) ADJ+ # ANTES (are|were) ADJ # ADJ A third class of more general properties of the potential anaphor-antecedent pair includes the type of anaphor (personal vs.

Ambiguous pronouns are common in spoken dialog (Poesio & Artstein, 2005), a fact that has to be taken into account when building a spoken dialog pronoun resolution system.

Each of these variants was then submitted to a parser trained on written text (Charniak, 2000).

The transcription contains capitalization and punctuation, and it also explicitly records interruption points and word fragments (Heeman & Allen, 1999), but not the extent of the related disfluencies.
J99-4003
(Bed017) If the utterance contains a speech repair (Heeman & Allen, 1999), a pronoun in the reparandum part is also treated as discarded because it is not part of the final utterance.
J99-4003
To our knowledge, there is only one implemented system so far that resolves normal and discourse deictic pronouns in unrestricted spoken dialog (Strube & M¨uller, 2003).

It was inspired by the annotation experiments of Poesio & Artstein (2005) and Artstein & Poesio (2006).

Another feature, based on Yang et al.(2005), encodes the semantic compatibility of anaphor and NP antecedent.

Note that our definition of precision is stricter (and yields lower figures) than that applied in the ACE context, as the latter ignores incorrect links between two expressions in the response 8It is a common observation that demonstratives (in particular that) are preferred over it for discourse deictic reference (Schiffman, 1985; Webber, 1991; Asher, 1993; Eckert & Strube, 2000; Byron, 2004; Poesio & Artstein, 2005).
