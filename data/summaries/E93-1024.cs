Sadler et al.(1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) consider several ways in which the translation constraints might be modified to circumvent these difficulties yet remain faithful to the spirit of the correspondence-based approach.
E91-1051
1. Introduction Kaplan et al.(1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982).
E89-1037
Sadler et al.(1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) focus on another case of structural misalignment in translation, as illustrated in (3): (3) (a) The baby just fell.
E91-1051
(1989) and Sadler and Thompson (1991) point out a significant inadequacy of both these arrangements.

Sadler et al., 1989, Sadler et al., 1990, Sadler and Thompson, 1991), and several difficulties have been pointed out.
E91-1051
This contrasts with descriptionby-analysis, another technique mentioned by Kaplan and Halvorsen (1988) and Kaplan et aL (1989) for deriving descriptions of abstract structures.

12 D-7000 Stuttgart 1, FRG Juergen@ims.uni-stuttgart.de Abstract Kaplan et al.(1989) present a framework for translation based on the description and correspondence concepts of LexicalFunctional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982).

\[Kaplan, et al., 1989\] Ronald Kaplan, Klaus Netter, Jiirgen Wedekind, and Annie Zaenen.
E89-1037
Kaplan et al.(1989) offer several examples to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach to translation.
E89-1037
Kaplan et al.(1989) suggest that this architecture can provide a formal basis for specifying complex source-target translation relationships in a declarative fashion that builds on monolingual grammars and lexicons that are independently motivated and theoretically justified.
E89-1037
Sadler and Thompson (1991, footnote I) mention the arrangement we are proposing, and observe that the translation codescription problems may then merely be displaced to equivalent difficulties in characterizing the monolingual o instead of z: the problems may be moved around and renamed, but not solved.
E91-1051
\[Sadler and Thompson, 1991\] Louisa Sadler and Henry Thompson.
E91-1051
Kaplan et al.(1989) discussed such differences in embedding and offered two alternative analyses that rely only on codescriptive specifications.
