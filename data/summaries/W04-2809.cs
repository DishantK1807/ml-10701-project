We distinguish between three types here: NLG with XSLT (Wilcock, 2003), which is basically template-based generation from XML input; stochastic approaches like (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000), where the deep generation grammar is replaced by a stochastic language model, and hybrid generation approaches like D2S (Theune et al., 2000), which bridges the gap between NLG and speech synthesis by a prosody module.

In (Neumann, 1997) a training phase with an appropriate corpus is needed, while we perform generation at runtime without such a corpus.

(Scott, 1998) can be seen as offline interface generation using a GUI and therefore as a manual version of the bootstrapping approach described here, but her system is used for content determination, not for realization.

(Corston-Oliver. 2002) has a machine learning approach for realization similar to (Neumann, 1997): Transformation rules are learned offline from examples in a corpus.
