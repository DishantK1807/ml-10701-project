NATURAL I.~IGUAGE INTERACTION WITH MACHINES : A PA~SING FAD? 0R THE WAY OF THE FU~"JRE?
A. Michael Noll American Telephone and Telegraph Company Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920 People communicate primarily by two medea: acoustic -the spoken word; and visual N the written word.
It is therefore natural chac people would expect their com--,nications with machines Co likewise use Chess two modes.
To a considerable extent, speech is probably the most natural of the natural-language modes.
~ence, a fascination exists with machines thac respond to spoken commands with synthetic speech responses to create a natural-language interactive discourse.
However, although vast amounts of research and development effort have been expended in the search for systems that understand human speech and respond with synthetic speech, the goal of the perfect system remains a~ elusive as ever.
Syste ms for producing natural-sounding speech for large vocabularies with unrestricted gr--w.-tical structures and for recognizing spoken speech for large vocabularies with unlimited gr-~-Cical structures and any humber of talkers are still beyond the scats of linguistics and computer science and technology.
Given the problems in the speech domain, ic is not surprising Chat most interactions between people and machines are in the visual mode frequently using alphanumeric keyboards as input and textual display as output.
Such visual terminals are already in fairly widespread use in industry and are used for a variety of applications including computer progr-n~ing, text editing, and data-base access.
The telephone allows speech celecoa~nications over distance between people.
Future visual terminals for the home and businesses will allow textual celecom--,nicacions between people.
These visual terminals could also be used co telecommunicate with machines in a way Chat is presently difficult using the telephone and speech.
ViewdaCa, or videocex, systems are promised soon for the home and will allow data-base access and transactions with machines and textual messages between people.
Some viewdata systems use elaborate tree searches Co reach the desired frame of information.
Some people believe that tree searches will be "unnatural" for many users and some other mere-natural language will be ueeded to search and access these data-base sysCeme.
One conclusion is Chac the future will see mere choices in mode for teleco~manicacions between people and with machines.
The choice of which alternate made will probably be dependent upon the specific application.
For example, textual messages might be both easier to enter by keyboard and Co read on a CRT screen than speaking to a recording machine and listening Co a recorded message.
However, social chatting might be best over the telephone.
However, arranging a dace with a stranger might be less revealing if done in the textual mode.
Considerable opportunities exist for basic research to explore the suitability of these alternate modes for different co~nicacions applications.
The fascination of technologists with speech-syuchesis chips is about to result in a variety of stand-alone appliances Chat speak.
Ovens chat scare when the roast is done, washing machines thac call for the addition of fabric softeners, automobiles chat inform the driver thaC the door is open, and many ocher applications will soon abound in the marketplace.
In most of chess applications, synthetic speech will substitute for a lamp or ocher form of visual display.
The environment will be polluted with the noise of buzzy synthetic speech.
Many of these applications will undoubtedly be little mere than passing fads.
BuC in some circumstances synthetic speech will become the way of the future.
One example would be synthetic-speech announcements of floors in an elevator thereby eliminatin S crooked necks~ Most of the preceding examples are very restricted in terms of the language used for the interaction with machines.
The problem with unrestricted natural language for cor-unicacion with machines is chaC no automatic way has yec beeu discovered Co extract meaning in either the speech or textual mode.
The textual mode does eliminate the ueed for acoustic analysis and hence has been more extensively used in most systems for restricted, specialized applications.
However, even if either mode were equally near perfect, questions would still arise about user preference for one mode over the other.
Thus, in the end the future will be decided by the votes of consumers in the marketplace as they choose from the many options presented by technology.
The shrewd enCerpreneur will use consumer preference and needs Co help illuminate in advance the desires and needs of the marketplace.
Basic research in linguistics, human behaviour, natural language, and ocher ancillary fields will have an important role in developing solutions and in understanding people's needs and behaviour. 137
