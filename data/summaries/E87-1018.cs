The Grenoble group has used a graph grammar based on this approach within a system that is multilingual, though centred arotmd French (see Vauquois, 1975; Boitet and Nedobejkine, 1981; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985,28f); although in this system the dependency relations are used along with a kind of phrase structure, the importance of complex node labels and of the syntactic relations (valency) has always been fully recognized.

The substitution of a single interlingua by a set of closely related interface structures <see VauquoM and Boitet, 1985,32; as for its application in the EUROTRA project, Johnson etal., 1985,164) perhaps is also important with regard to handling the semantic relationships between the lexical units of the languages concerned.

As for the known difficulties concerning e.g. the formulation of fail-soft rules or the presence of surface clues (see Slocum, 1985,5; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), it appears that for a multilingual system of MT these disadvantages have to be compared with those present in the large number of binary systems which are otherwise necessary.

Certain features of their frameworks, as well as of Vauquois" (1975; Vauquois and Boitet, 1985~ are more closely connected to classical structural linguistics than is the case with other MT systems.
