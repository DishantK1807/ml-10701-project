This table comes from Moens and Steedman (Moens and Steedman, 1988).

Further details regarding these indicators and their linguistic motivation is given by Siegel (1998b).

Most approaches to automatically categorizing words measure co-occurrences between open-class lexical items (Schfitze, 1992; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et al., 1993).
P93-1023 P93-1024
The linguistic test was selected for this task by Passonneau (1988): If a clause in the past progressive necessarily entails the past tense reading, the clause describes a non-culminated event.

Several researchers have developed models that incorporate aspectual class to assess temporal constraints between clauses (Passonneau, 1988; Dorr, 1992).

Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectuai classification by ranking verbs according to the frequencies with which they occur with certain aspectual markers.

For example, in a separate study, optimizing for F-measure resulted in a more dramatic tradeoff in recall values as compared to those attained when optimizing for accuracy (Siegel, 1998b).
W98-0702
Although an aspectual lexicon of verbs would suffice to classify many clauses by their main verb only, a verb's primary class is often domaindependent (Siegel, 1998b).

For example: â€¢ Aspectual coercion such as iteration compromises indicator measurements (Moens and Steedman, 1988).

This incompleteness has been illustrated empirically by showing that some indicators help for only a subset of verbs (Siegel, 1998b).
W98-0702
Furthermore, indicators measured over multiple clausal constituents, e.g., main verb-object pairs, alleviate verb ambiguity and sparsity and improve classification performance (Siegel, 1998b).
W98-0702
Clauses with have as their main verb, composing 8.0% of the corpus, are highly ambiguous, and have been addressed separately by considering the direct object of such clauses (Siegel, 1998a).
W98-0702
Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, natural language generation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.
