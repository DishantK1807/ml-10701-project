THE PROCESS OF COMMUNICATION IN FACE TO FACE VS.
COMPUTERIZED CONFERENCES; A CONTROTT.~n EXPERIMENT USING BALES INTERACTION PROCESS ANALYSIS Start Roxanne Kiltz, Kenneth Johnson, and Ann Marie Rabke Upsala College INTRODUCTION A computerized conference (CC) is a form of co~znunication in which participants type into and read frc~ a computer terminal.
The participants may be on line at the same time--termed a "synchrononous" conference, or may interact anynchronous~.
The conversation is stored and mediated by the computer.
How does this form of communication change the process and outcome of group discussions, as compared to the "normal" face to face (FtF) medium of group discussion, where participants communicate by talking, listening and observing non-verbal behavior, and where there is no lag between the sending and receipt of communication signals?
This paper briefly ~*mmarizes the resUltS of a controlled laboratory experiment designed to quantif~ the manner in which conversation and group decision making varies between FtF and CC.
Those who wish more detail are referred to the literature review which served as the basis for the design of the experiment (Hiltz, 1975) and to the full technical report on the results (Hiltz, Johnson, Aronovitch, and Turoff, 1980).
This paper is excerpted from a longer paper on the analysis of communications process in the two media and their correlates (Hiltz, Johnson and Rabke, 198Q).
0v~vIEw OF mm z~na~T The chief independent variable of interest is the impact of computerized conferencing an a c~unications mode upon the process and outcome of group decision making, as compared to face-to-face discussions.
Two different types of tasks were chosen, and group size was set at five persons.
The subjects were Upsala College undergraduate, graduate and continuing education students.
The communications process or profile was quantified using Bales Interaction process Analysis (see Bales, 1950).
In computerized conferenclng, each participant is physically alone with a c~mputer terminal attached to a telephone.
In order to communicate, he or she types entries into the terminal and reads entries sent by the other participants, rather than speaking and listening.
Entering input and res~ttug output may be done totally at the pace end time chosen b~ each individual.
Conceivably, for instance, all group members could be entering comments simultaneously.
Receipt of messages from others is at the terminal print speed of 30 characters per second.
Even when all five participants are on-line at the s~me time, there is considerable lag in a computer conference between the time a discussant types in a co~ent, and when a response to that comment is received.
First, each of the other participants must finish what they are typing at the time; then they read the waiting item; then they may type in a response; then the author of the original cou~ent must finish his or her typing of a subsequent item and print and read the response.
There is thus a definite "asynchronous" quality even to "synchronous" computer conferences.
As a result, computer conferences often develop several simultaneous threads of discussion that are being discussed concurrently, whereas face to face discussions tend to focus oD one single topic at a time and then move on to subsequent topics.
(See Hiltz and Turoff, 1978, for a complete description of CC as a mode of cummunicatlon).
A variable of secondary Interest is problem type.
Much experimental literature indicates that the nature Of the problem has a great deal to do with grou~ performance.
One type of problem that we used is the human relations case as developed by Bales.
These are medium complex, unsettled problems that have no specific "correct" answer.
The second type was a "scientific" ~-anklng problem ( requiring no specific expertise ), which has a single correct solution plus measurable degrees of bow nearly correct a groupts answer may be.
The ranking problem, "Lost in the Arctic", was adapted for ~-~etration over a conferencing system by permission of its originators (See Eady and Lafferty).
The experiments thus had a 2 x 2 factorial design (see figure one).
The factors were mode of communication (face-to-face vs.
camputerlzed conference) and problem type (human relations vs.
a more "scientific" ranking problem with a correct answer).
These factors constituted the "independent variables".
Each problemmode condition included a total of eight groups.
Figure 1 Design of the Experiment Two by Two Factorial with Repeated Measures: Blocks of Four Task Task Type A Type B Groups Face-to-Face 4 h Ccmguterized Conference ~ BACKGROUND: THE BALES EXPERIMENTS AND INTerACTION PROCESS ANALYSIS Working at the Laboratory of Social Relations at Harvard, Bales and his colleagues developed a set of categories and procedures for coding the interaction in small face-to-face decision-making groups which became very widely utilized and generated a great deal of data about the nature of co~unicmtion and social processes within such groups.
Coding of the co~nunications interaction by Interaction Process Analysis involves noting who makes a statement or non-verbal participation (such as nodding agreement); to whom the action was addressed; and into which of twelve categories the action best fits.
These categorles are listed in subsequent tables and explained below.
The distribution of co~z~unications units among the twelve categories constituted one of the main dependent variables for this experiment.
We expected significant differences associated with mode of communication.
We also expected some differences associated with task type.
We did not feel that we had enough information to predict the directions of these differences.
For almost every category, we could think of some arguments that would lead to a prediction that the category would be "higher" in CC, and some reasons why it might be lower.
75 METHOD The number of Bales units per face to face group was much greater than the number for acc group.
Therefore, each individual and group was transformed to a percentage distribution among the ~velve categories.
Then statistical zests were performed to determine if there were any significant differences in IPA distributions associated with mode of communication, probblem, order of problem, and the interaction among these variables in relation to the percentage distribution for each of the Bales categories.
There are many different ways in which the percentages could be computed.
To take full advantage of the design, we cumputed the percentage distribution for each individtu~l, in each condition.
Thus, we actu~S-ly have the Bales distributions for each of 80 individuals in a face to face conference, and in a computerized conference.
The mode of analysis was a two by two factorial nested design.
If there was no significant group effect, then the error terms could be "pooled", meaning we could use the 80 observations as independent observations for statistical test purposes.
We also performed a non-parametric test on the dat~ for each Bales category, which gave us similar results.
DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH COmmUNICATION MODE Two of the detailed analysis of variance tables on which the st~mary here is based are included as an Appendix.
Note that the analyses were first performed separately for the two problems, using c~unication mode as ~he independent variable.
For each problem, we tested the significance of mode of c~unication, order (whether it was the first or second problem solved by the group), and the interaction between mode and orderâ€¢ Listed in figures two and three is a su~nary of the statistical results of the 24 analyses of variance which examined observed differences between communication modes for each of the two rases.
The first two colu~us show the mean percentage of co~nunications in each category.
For example, in the first table, results for Forest Ranger, the first column shows that on the average less than 1% of an individual's communications were verbally "showing solidarity", but in CC, 3.22% fell into this category.
The third column shows that the results for the 16 groups in the nested factorial design were significant at ~he.005 level, meaning that the probability of tae observed differences occuring by chance in a sample this size is one in 200.
The fourth column shows the level of significance if the group was not a significant variable and the observations could be pooled, with the 80 individuals treated as independent observations.
In this case, group was significant, so the pooled analysis could not be done.
In looking at these data, there is an apparent coding problem.
Even for the Forest Ranger problem, face to face, we obtained a somewhat different distribution of coding than did persons coding problem discussions such as this who were directly trained by Bales.
(See Bales and Borgatta, 1955, p.
400 for the complete ~ qtributions).
Our coding has 20% more of the statements clsssified as "giving opinions" than Bales and Borgatta code, and correspondingly lower percentages in all of the other categories.
This means that our results cannot be directly compared to those of other investigators, since apparently ~he training for coding interpreted many more statements as representing some sort of analysis or opinion than "should" be there, according to the distributions obtained for similar studies by Bales and his colleagues.
(Other possible explanations are that Upsala College has produced an ~nusually opinionated and analytic set of students or that the effect of pre-experimental training in cc raises opinion giving even in subsequent FtF discussions).
It does not affect the comparisons among problems and modes for this stu~, since all of the coders were coding the data with the same guidelines and interpretations.
In ~he majority of cases, the same pair of coders coded both the CC and FtF condition for the same group.
In any case, the seven individuals who did the coding had been trained to an acceptable level of reliability.

Categories 1-3 and 10-12 are the "social-emotlonal" functions, oriented towards internal group process.
The first three are called "social-emotional positive", while 10-12 are "negative".
Categories 7-9 are "Task oriented", giving answers or contributions to solving the problem faced by the group, and categories h-6 are varieties of "asking questions" in the task oriented area.
It will be noted, by wa~of further introduction, that there are some very strong differences in the profiles, even In the same medium, depending upon the type of task faced by the group, and that there is some interaction between task type and medium.
For example, more tension was shown in the arctic problem in the CC condition; more in the Forest Ranger problem in the FTF condition.
We will take each of the categories, describing more fully what is included in them, and then discuss the extent to which there appear to be significant differences between the media in the relative prevalence of communications of that type.
We will also try to explain the possible reasons for or implications of significant d/fferences that are discovered.
1. "Shows solidarity, raises other's status, gives help, reward" Included in this category are initial and responsive acts of active solidarity sad affection, such as saying "hello" and making friendly or congenial remarks to "break the ice"; praising or encouraging the other(s); giving support or sympathy or offers of assistance; urging harmony and cooperation.
These are all overt attempts to improve the solidarity of the group.
Note that there is a significantly greater amount of "showing solidarity" in computerized conferencing.
This is probably because much of the behavior of this type in a face to face situation is non-verbal, such as smiling in a friendly manner while nodding encouragement.
Non verbal acts in this category are not eodable from the tapes of the discussions.
In the CC condition, however, the participants realize that they must put such things into words.
Another possible explanation is that the greater tendency towards overt, explicit showing of solidarity is an attempt to compensate for the perceived coldness and impersonality of the medium.
2. "Shows Tension Release, Jokes, laughs, shows satisfaction" This includes expressions of pleasure or happiness, making friendly Jokes or kidding remarks, laughing.
There was significantly more tension release overtly expressed in the face to face groups.
Much of this was waves of laughter, particularly in the arctic problem.
The participants did not put this into words in the conference when typing.
Observing them, however, there was much private laughter and verbal expressions showing "tension release", but these do not appear in the transcript.
It is part of the private "letting down of face" that occurs but is not communicated through the computer.
3. "Agrees, shows passive acceptance, understands, concurs, complies" This occurs as concurrence in a proposed course of action or carrying out of any activity which has been requested by others.
There is significantly more agreement overtly expressed in face to face conferences than in computerized conferences.
We suspect that this is related to the pressure to conform created by non-verbal behavior and the physical presence of the other group members.
In any case, it is undoubtedly related to the greater difficulty of CC groups in reaching total consensus.
h. "Gives SUggestion, direction, implying autonom~ for other" Includes giving suggestions about the task or sUggesting concrete actions in the near term to attain a group goal.
There is a tendency for more suggestions to be given by more people In computerized conferencing.
This is part of the equalitarian tendency for more members to actively participate in the task behavior of a group in CC.
In one of the problems, the d/fference was statistically significant at the .05 level; whereas in the other, it was sizable but did not reach statistical significance.
5. "Gives opinion, evaluation, analysis, expresses feeling, wish" Includes all reasoning or expressions of evaluation or interpretation.
This is the most frequent type of co-,~unication for both problems and Both modes.
For the Bales problem, there was no difference in its prevalence associated with mode of co~nuaication.
For the Arctic problem, however, there ~&s a large and statisticaJ_ly significant difference, with more opinion giving in the CC condition.
6. "Gives Orientation, information, repeats, clarifies, confirms t, This includes statements that are meant to secure the attention of the other, (such as "There are two points I'd like to make..."), restating or reporting the essential content of what the group has read or said; noninferential, descriptive generalizations or summaries of the sit%latlon facing the group.
There are no clear differences here.
Whereas there is a statistically significant difference in the direction of giving more orientation in CC for Forest Ranger, for the other problem, the difference is reversed, 7.
"Asks for orientation, information, repetition and C On i~I rmat i on '' There is a significant tendency for this to occur more often in face to face discussions.
This is probably because of the frequency with which a group member does not hear or understand the pronunciation of a sentence or partial utterance.
In CC, people are usually more careful to state their thoughts clearly, and the recipient can read it several times rather than asking for repetition if it is not understood the first time or is later forgotten.
We have noticedmany CC participants going back and looking at co~nents a second or third tim~ in a face to face discussion, they would probably ask something like: "What was it you said before about x?".
8. "Asks for opinion, evaluation, analysis, expression of feeling" ?7 This occurs more frequently in ccmpuZerized conferencin~.
For one of the problems, the difference reached statistical significance, whereas it did not for the other.
~his tendency to more frequently and explicitly ask for the opinions of all the other group members, as well as to more spontaneously offer ones own opinions and analyses in C0, does seem to qualitatively be characteristic of the me~i~.
9. "Asks for s~estion, direction, possible ways of action" This includes all over~, explicit requests, such as "What shall we do now?".
It is not very prevalent in either medi,~, and there are no significant differences.
i0. "Disagrees, shows passive rejection, formality, witholds resources" This includes all the milder forms of disagreement or refusal to ccaply or reciprocate.
This is also an infrequent form of communicntion, but it occurs more in face to face discussions than in CC.
ii. "Shows tension, asks for help, withdraws out of field" Includes indications that the subject feels -nYious or frustrated, with no particular other group member as the focus of these negative feelings.
The results on this are rather puzzling.
We end up with a statistically significant tendency for there to be more tensions when in CC for the Forest Ranger problem, hut in FTF for the Arctic problem.
Substantively, the proportion of these communications is very ~m~ll in nny c~e, and therefore, the small differences are not importasz.
12. "Shows antagonism, deflates other's s~atus, defends or asserts self" This includes autocratic attempts to control or direct others, rejection or refusal of a request, deriding or criticizing others.
This is infrequent in both media and there are no significant differences.
EFFECTS OF ORDER For the most par~, it did not matter whether the CO or the FtF discussion was held first.
However, more saggestions were offered on the arctic problem if it was discussed in CC as ~e first problem, but more in FTF discussion if the FTF was preceeded by a CC condition.
This is consistent with the tendency for CC to promote more giving of sugEestions; apparently, the tendency carries over to a subsequent f~ce ~o face conversation.
This raises the interesting possibi'It"/ that the group process and structure can be permanently changed by the experience of interacting through CC, a change that will carry over even to communications in other modes.
Other pieces of evidence from other s~udies, including self reports of participants in long term field trials, indicate the same poasibillty.
CONCLUSION Our investigation confirms the hypothesia that there are some signiflcan~ differences in the group communication process between face to face and computer mediated discussions.
Such differences seem ~o be associated with other characteristics of the medium, such as the greater tendency for minorltÂ¥ opinions to be maintained, rather than a total group consensus emerginK, in a fuller analysis (Hiltz, Johnson, Arono~Â¢ch and Turoff, 1980) we show that the observed differences in interaction profiles are highly correlated w~h the abillty of a group to reach consensus and wirer the quali~y of group decision reached.
