Recent research have shown that improvements in supervised taggers are possible by including features derived from unlabeled data (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Ando and Zhang, 2005).

Also, it will be interesting to see whether the features generated in this paper complement some of the other methods (Miller et al., 2004; Liang, 2005; Ando and Zhang, 2005) that also generate features from unlabeled data.
