D. Lin (1997; 1998a) takes an axiomatic approach to determining the characteristics of a good similarity measure.

That is, the data consisted of the verb-object cooccurrence pairs in the 1988 Associated Press newswire involving the 1000 most frequent nouns, extracted via Church's (1988) and Yarowsky's processing tools.

Arguably the most widely used is the mutual information (Hindle, 1990; Church and Hanks, 1990; Dagan et al., 1995; Luk, 1995; D.

Smadja et al.(1996) observe that for two potential mutual translations X and Y, the fact that X occurs with translation Y indicates association; X's occurring with a translation other than Y decreases one's belief in their association; but the absence of both X and Y yields no information.

Finally, Kendall's % which appears in work on clustering similar adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Hatzivassiloglou, 1996), is a nonparametric measure of the association between random variables (Gibbons, 1993).

Hamming-type metrics (Cardie, 1993; Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997) are intended for data with symbolic features, since they count feature label mismatches, whereas we are dealing feature Values that are probabilities.

Lee, 1996; Ng, 1997); but it is not reasonable in language modeling to expect training data tagged with correct probabilities.

Lin, 1998a, 1998b) is monotonic in Jaccard's coefficient (van Rijsbergen, 1979), so its inclusion in our experiments would be redundant.
