For researchers in linguistics to exploit the full potential of the DCR, tools need to be available that can interact with this infrastructure.

Implementation of DCR connectivity in ELAN 5.1 DCR Connector Building on a DCR Connector that already had been developed at the MPI for Psycholinguistics for other tools, like Lexus [1], ELAN has been extended with a module to contact the DCR service and retrieve information by calling one of the methods defined by the API. Three methods of the API are currently used by ELAN: â€¢ getP</context>

About ELAN Figure 1: an ELAN window ELAN is a tool for the manual creation of annotations to audio and/or video files [3]. In its most elementary form an annotation is a piece of text referring to a segment of the media. In the case of audio or video a segment is usually identified by a begin time and an end time, both </context>

About ISO Data Category Registry The ISO Data Category Registry (ISO 12620) is being developed as part of the ISO TC 37/SC 4 [4] efforts, which are aimed at the establishment of standards for Language Resource management, creation and coding. The DCR specifies the names and definitions for data categories relevant to the langu</context>
