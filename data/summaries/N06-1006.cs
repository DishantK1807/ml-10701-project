Finally, a few efforts (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005) have tried to 42 translate sentences into formulas of first-order logic, in order to test logical entailment with a theorem prover.

A more structured approach is to formulate the entailment prediction as a graph matching problem (Haghighi et al., 2005; de Salvo Braz et al., 2005).

Haghighi et al.(2005) divide the search into two steps: in the first step they consider node scores only, which relaxes the problem to a weighted bipartite graph matching that can be solved in polynomial time, and in the second step they add the edges scores and hillclimb the alignment via an approximate local search.

Although developed independently, the same division between alignment and classification has also been proposed by Marsi and Krahmer (2005), whose textual system is developed and evaluated on parallel translations into Dutch.

In ID 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of the text, to 1This is the same problem labeled and addressed as context in Tatu and Moldovan (2005).

The two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axiomsâ€”as in Moldovan et al.(2003) but not Raina et al.(2005). Then the theorem prover may generate intermediate forms in the proof, but, nevertheless, individual terms are resolved locally without reference to global context.

A third approach, exemplified by Moldovan et al.(2003) and Raina et al.(2005), is to translate dependency parses into neo-Davidsonian-style quasilogical forms, and to perform weighted abductive theorem proving in the tradition of (Hobbs et al., 1988).

Named entities are identified by a CRF-based NER system, similar to that described in (McCallum and Li, 2003).

We show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), graph alignment (Haghighi et al., 2005), weighted abduction (Raina et al., 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (Bos and Markert, 2005).

The best-known such work has occurred within the field of question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2003); more recently, such work has continued with greater focus in addressing the PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenge (Dagan et al., 2005) and within the U.S.

We parse input sentences to phrase structure trees using the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003), a statistical syntactic parser trained on the Penn TreeBank.
