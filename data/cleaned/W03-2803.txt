1:123	Some statistical methods for evaluating information extraction systems Will Lowe Computer Science Department Bath University wlowe@latte.harvard.edu Gary King Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences Harvard University king@harvard.edu Abstract We present new statistical methods for evaluating information extraction systems.
2:123	The methods were developed to evaluate a system used by political scientists to extract event information from news leads about international politics.
3:123	The nature of this data presents two problems for evaluators: 1) the frequency distribution of event types in international event data is strongly skewed, so a random sample of newsleads will typically fail to contain any low frequency events.
4:123	2) Manual information extraction necessary to create evaluation sets is costly, and most effort is wasted coding high frequency categories . We present an evaluation scheme that overcomes these problems with considerably less manual effort than traditional methods, and also allows us to interpret an information extraction system as an estimator (in the statistical sense) and to estimate its bias.
5:123	1 Introduction This paper introduces a statistical approach we developed to evaluate information extraction systems used to study international relations.
6:123	Event extraction is a form of categorization, but the highly skewed frequency pro le of international event categories in real data generates severe problems for evaluators.
7:123	We discuss these problems in section 3, show how to circumvent using a novel sampling scheme in section 4, and brie y describe our application.
8:123	Finally we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods, and their relations to standard evaluation procedure.
9:123	We start with a brief review of information extraction in international relations.
10:123	2 Event Analysis in International Relations Researchers in quantitative international relations have been performing manual information extraction since the mid-1970s (McClelland, 1978; Azar, 1982).
11:123	The information extracted has remained fairly simple; a researcher  lls a who did what to whom template, usually from historical documents, a list of countries and international organizations to describe the actors, and a more or less articulated ontology of international events to describe what occurred (McClelland, 1978).
12:123	In the early 1990s automated information extraction tools mostly replaced manual coding efforts (Schrodt et al., 1994).
13:123	Information extraction systems in international relations perform a similar task to those competing in early Message Understanding Competitions (Sundheim, 1991, 1992).
14:123	With machine extracted events data it is now possible to do near real-time con ict forecasting with data based on newswire leads, and detailed political analysis afterwards.
15:123	3 Event Category Distributions We wanted to evaluate an information extraction system from Virtual Research Associates1.
16:123	This system bundles extraction and visualization software with a custom event ontology containing, at last count, about 200 categories of international event.
17:123	We found two problems with the nature of international events data.
18:123	First, the frequency distribution over the systems ontology, or indeed several other ontologies we considered, is heavily skewed.
19:123	A handful of mostly diplomatic event types predominate, and the frequency of other event types falls of very sharply: we ran the system over all the newsleads in Reuters coverage of the Bosnia con ict, and of the approximately 45,000 events it extracted, 10,605 were in the category of neutral comment, 4 of apology and 35 of threat of force.
20:123	Thus the relative frequencies of event categories in this data can be 2,500 to 1.
21:123	Also, as these  gures suggest, the more interesting and politically relevant events tend to be of low frequency.
22:123	This problem is quite general in categorization systems with reasonably articulated category systems, and not speci c to international relations.
23:123	But any dataset with these properties causes an immediate problem for evaluation.
24:123	Ideally we would choose a random subset of leads whose events are known with certainty (because we have coded them manually beforehand), run the system over them, and then compute various sample statistics such as precision and recall2.
25:123	However, a small randomly chosen subset is very unlikely contain instances of most interesting events, and so the systems performance will not be evaluated on them.
26:123	Given the possible frequency ratios above, the size of subset necessary to ensure reasonable coverage of lower frequency event categories is enormous.
27:123	Put more concretely, to construct a test set of news leads the evaluator will on average have to code around 2,500 comments to reach a single apology and about 300 comments to  nd a single threat of force.
28:123	1http://www.vranet.com 2This paper only evaluates extraction performance on event types, though there would seem to be no reason why a similar approach would not work for actors etc. 3.1 Standard Evalution Methods The standard evaluation methods developed over the course of the Message Understanding Competitions consist mainly in sample statistics to compute over the evaluation materials e.g. precision and recall, but do not give any guidance for choosing the materials themselves (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996; Grishman, 1997).
29:123	This is just done by hand by the judges.
30:123	Perhaps because the selection question is neglected, it is seldom clear what larger population the test materials are from (save that it is the same one as the training examples), and as a consequence it is unclear what the implications for generalization are when a system obtains a particular set of scores for precision and recall (Lehnert and Sundheim, 1991).
31:123	Since this literature did not help us generate a suitable evaluation sample, we approached the problem from scratch, and developed a statistical framework speci c to our needs.
32:123	4 Method One reasonable-sounding but wrong way to address the problem of creating a test set without having to code tens of thousands of irrelevant stories is the following: 1.
33:123	Use the extraction system itself to perform an initial coding, 2.
34:123	Take a sample of the output that covers all the event types in reasonable quantities, 3.
35:123	Examine each coding to see whether the system assigned the correct event code.
36:123	This looks like it can guarantee a good sample of low frequency events at much lower cost to the manual coder; we can just pick a  xed number of events from each category and evaluate them.
37:123	However, this method exhibits selection bias.
38:123	To see this, let M and T be variables indicating which event category the Machine (that is, the information extraction system) codes an event into, and the True category to which the event actually belongs.
39:123	Statistically, the quantity of interest to us is the probability that the machine is correct: P(M = i j T = i) (1) This is the probability that the machine classi es an event into category i given that the true event coding is indeed i. A full characterization of the success of the machine requires knowing P(M = i j T = i) for i = 0; : : : ;J, which includes all J event categories and where i = 0 denotes the situation where the machine is unable to classify an event into any category.
40:123	In short, the quantity of interest is the full probability density P(M j T).
41:123	In statistical terms, this distribution is a likelihood function for the information extraction system.
42:123	This observation allows us to treat the system like any other statistical estimator and offers the interesting possibility of analyzing generalization via its sampling properties, e.g. its bias, variance, mean squared error, or risk.
43:123	Unfortunately, the problem with the reasonablesounding approach described above is that it does not in fact allow us to estimate P(M j T) because it is implicitly conditioning on M, not T. In particular, the proportion of events that are actually in category i among those the machine put in category i gives us instead an estimate of P(T j M) (2) which is not the quantity of interest.
44:123	(2) is the probability of the truth being in some event category rather than the machines response whereas in fact the true event category is  xed and it is the machines response that is uncertain3.
45:123	Worse, P(T j M) is a systematically biased estimate of P(M j T) because these two quantities are related by Bayes theorem: P(M j T) = P(M;T)P(T) = P(T j M)P(M)P(T) ; (3) and the only circumstances under which they would be equal is when P(M) is uniform.
46:123	But the  gures in section 3 suggest that P(M) is highly skewed.
47:123	However this last observation suggests a better method for unbiased estimation of (1).
48:123	1.
49:123	Estimate P(T j M) as described above 3This is due to changes in the journalists choice of vocabulary and syntactic construction that are uncorrelated with the identity of the event being described.
50:123	2.
51:123	Compute P(M) by running the system over the entire data set and normalizing the frequency histogram of event categories 3.
52:123	Estimate P(M j T) by correcting P(T j M) with P(M) using Bayes theorem Our implementation of this scheme was to  rst run the system over 45,000 leads about the Bosnia con ict, and normalize the frequency histogram of events extracted to create P(M).
53:123	Then, randomly choose 5 leads assigned to each event category, and manually determine which event type the instantiate.
54:123	Then normalize to estimate P(T j M).
55:123	And  nally, use (3) to create P(M j T).
56:123	We chose four times as many uncategorized leads as from each true category in addition.
57:123	A larger sample here is advisable to see what sort of categories the system misses.
58:123	These sample sizes are  xed, but it may also be possible to use active learning techniques to tune them (as in e.g. Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999) for even more ef cient sampling.
59:123	The advantage of this roundabout route to (1) is that it requires many fewer events to be manually coded.
60:123	We ran the system over 45,000 leads but only manually coded a handful of events for each category.
61:123	This guaranteed us even coverage of the lowest frequency event categories whilst not biasing the end result  for an ontology with about 200 categories this is a substantial decrease in evaluator effort.
62:123	This method works by making use of the extraction system itself to produce one important marginal: P(M).
63:123	If we assume that the aim is to evaluate the system on the Bosnia con ict, P(M) is not estimated, but is rather an exact population marginal4.
64:123	Then we can guarantee that our estimate of P(M j T) is unbiased because the method for estimating P(T j M) is clearly unbiased, and P(M) adds no error.
65:123	4.1 Summary Measures P(M j T) allows the computation of a number of useful summary measures5.
66:123	For example, we 4We might consider the Bosnian con ict to be a sample point from the larger population of all wars, but that population  if it exists at all  is certainly dif cult to quantify.
67:123	5Detailed discussion of several summary measures for the system we evaluated can be found in King and Lowe (2002).
68:123	can easily compute P(M;T) from quantities already available, so  J P(M = i;T = i) is the proportion of time the system extracts the correct category.
69:123	Alternatively, if it is more important to extract some categories than others, then various weighted measures can be constructed e.g.  J P(M = i j T = i)wi where ws are non-negative and sum to 1, representing the relative importance of extracting each category.
70:123	Some more graphical methods of evaluation using P(M j T) are presented below.
71:123	4.2 Estimator Properties Given a likelihood function for the extraction system we can investigate its properties as an estimator.
72:123	It is particularly useful to know the bias of an estimator, de ned in this case as the difference between the expected category response from the system when the true event category is i, and i itself, where the expectation is taken of repeated information extraction tasks that instantiate the same event categories.
73:123	We do not examine the corresponding variance here, and a more complete evaluation might also address the question of consistency.
74:123	4.2.1 Con ict and Cooperation The machines response and the true category is best seen as a set of multinomial probabilities (with a unit vector with the value 1 at the index of the systems extracted category or the true category respectively.
75:123	Estimator properties are cumbersome to represent in this format, so here we map the systems response to a single real value corresponding to the level of con ict or cooperation of the event category.
76:123	This re-representation is usual in international relations and allows standard econometric time series methods to be applied (Schrodt and Gerner, 1994; Goldstein and Freeman, 1990; Goldstein and Pevehouse, 1997).
77:123	For our purposes it also allows the straightforward graphical presentation of the main ideas.
78:123	We de ne the level of con ict or cooperation level of an event category i as Gi, a real number between -10 (most con ictual) to 10 (most cooperative) (see Goldstein, 1992, for the full mapping).
79:123	For example, according to this scheme, when i denotes the event category extending economic 10 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 1010 8 6 4 2 0 2 4 6 8 10 Gi g i Figure 1: Expected (gi) versus true (Gi) con ictcooperation level for each event category.
80:123	aid, Gi = 7:4, policy endorsement maps to 3.6, halt negotiations maps to -3.8, and a military engagement maps to -10, the maximally con ictual event.
81:123	The mapping allows univariate, and politically relevant comparison between the true con ict level and that of the event categories the system extracts.
82:123	The expected system response when the true category has con ict/cooperation level Gi is: gi = J G jP(M = j j T = i;M 6= 0) (4) where P(M = j j T = i;M 6= 0) = P(M j T)1(M 6= 0)P(M 6= 0 j T) : and 1(M 6= 0) is an indicator function equaling 1 if M 6= 0 and 0 otherwise.
83:123	A plot of Gi against gi for each event category is shown in Figure 1.
84:123	An unbiased estimator would show expected values on the main diagonal.
85:123	Estimator bias for event category i is simply gi  Gi.
86:123	Estimator variance is simply the spread around the diagonal.
87:123	4.3 Comparison We also compared the systems performance to 3 undergraduate coders (U1-3) working on the same data set.
88:123	To examine undergraduate performance requires  rst P(U;T), from which we can get P(U j T).
89:123	However, we cannot simply count the proportion of times each undergraduate assigns a lead to category i when it is in fact in category i because this ignores the fact that we have sampled the leads themselves using the system, and must therefore condition on M. On the other hand we do have access to the relevant conditional distribution P(U;T j M = i).
90:123	This is the distribution of undergraduate and true categories, conditioned on the fact the the system assigns an event to category i. The desired P(U;T) is a weighted average of these distributions: P(U;T) = i P(U;T j M = i)P(M = i): P(U j T) is then obtained by marginalization6.
91:123	Clearly these calculations can also be used to compare other systems with the same ontology using the same materials.
92:123	Summary statistics similar to those described above can be easily computed (King and Lowe, 2002).
93:123	Here we provide graphical results: Figure 2 plots the bias of the system and that of the undergraduates over the category set (with smoothed estimates superimposed).
94:123	In the  gure, the bias Gi  gi is plotted against Gi, so de ections from the horizontal are systematic bias.
95:123	In almost all cases we  nd that more con ictual (negative valued) categories are mistaken for more cooperative ones, with some suggestion of a similar effect at the cooperative end too.
96:123	Of most interest is the basic similarity in performance between undergraduates and the information extraction system.
97:123	It would be helpful if the bias that appears in these plots were systematically related to the expected system response.
98:123	If this was the case, in future use we could simply adjust the systems response up or down by some coef cient determined in the evaluation process and remove the bias.
99:123	However,  gure 3 shows that there is no systematic relation between the expected reponses and the level of bias, so no such coef cient canbe computed.
100:123	This is a rather pessimistic result for this system, suggesting a level of bias that cannot be straightforwardly removed.
101:123	On the other 6We would normally expect to use P(U j T;U 6= 0), but the undergraduates never failed to assign categories.

105:123	Deviations from the horizontal suggest the possibility of a post-output correction to correct for bias in subsequent application.

107:123	hand, one of the advantages of the methods presented here is that this bias is now estimated, and, since bias estimates are available on a categoryby-category basis, redesigning effort can be directed in a way that maximizes generalization performance.
108:123	Finally,  gure 4 plots the probability that the machine failed to assign an event category, P(M = 0 j T = i) (denoted p(null) in the  gure), as a function of that categorys con ict/cooperation value, Gi.
109:123	Our interest in Gi re ects the use this data is typically put to, since we are most concerned with errors that make the world look systematically more (or less) cooperative than it really is. But we might equally have plotted P(M = 0 j T = i) against i itself, or any other property of events that might be suspected to generate dif cult to categorize event descriptions.
110:123	Like the previous  gures, plotting P(M = 0 j T = i) against other quantities is a useful diagnostic, indicating where future work should best be applied.
111:123	In this case there appears to be no systematic relationship between the true level of con ict/cooperation and the probability that either the system or the undergraduates will fail to assign the event to a category.
112:123	5 Conclusion We have presented a set of statistical methods for evaluating an information extraction system without unreasonable manual labour when the distribution of categories to be extracted is heavily skewed.
113:123	The scheme uses a form of biased sampling and subsequent correction to estimate a probability distribution of system responses for each true category in the data.
114:123	This distribution costitutes a likelihood function for the system.
115:123	We then show how functions of this distribution can be used for evaluation, and estimate the systems statistical bias.
116:123	The two main ideas: using estimates of P(M j T) as the basis for evaluation, and using a nonstandard sampling scheme for the estimation, are separate.
117:123	Emphasis on using P(M j T) comes from standard statistical theory, and if correct, suggests how evaluation in information extraction might be integrated in to that body of theory.
118:123	When a sample of leads is randomly chosen and can be expected to be reasonably representative, then the sampling machinery described above, the computation of P(M), and the application of Bayes theorem will not be necessary.
119:123	But when the distribution of categories to be extracted is so highly skewed then our method is the only one that will make it feasible to evaluate a system on all of its categories in an unbiased way.
120:123	The principle difference between these and standard evaluation methods is in our explicitly statistical framework, and our consideration of how to sample in a representative way, and methods to get around cases where we cannot.
121:123	The exact relationship to precision, recall etc. is the topic of current research.
122:123	In the meantime we hope that the methods presented might advance understanding of effective evaluation methods in computational linguistics.
