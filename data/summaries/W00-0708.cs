We used six values for the countability feature: FC (fully countable) for nouns that have both singular and plural forms and can be directly modified by numerals and modifiers such as many; UC (uncountable) for nouns that have no plural form and can be modified by much; SC (strongly countable) for nouns that are more often countable than uncountable; WC (weakly countable) for nouns that are more often uncountable than countable; and PT (pluralia tantum) for nouns that only have plural forms, such as for example, scissors (Bond et al., 1994).

Our particular goal is to be able to use an article generator in conjunction with a symbolic generator for AAC (Copestake, 1997; Carroll et al., 1999).

The best cited results, 88% accuracy, are quoted by Heine (1998) which were obtained with respect to a very small corpus of 1,000 sentences in a restricted domain.

Work There has been considerable research on generating articles in machine translation systems (Gawrofiska, 1990; Murata and Nagao, 1993; Bond and Ogura, 1998; Heine, 1998).

discuss a variety of lexical, syntactic and semantic features that 1We assume a postprocessor to determine whether to generate a or an as described in Minnen et al.(2000). 43 play an important role in automated article generation, and compare our results with other researchers'.
