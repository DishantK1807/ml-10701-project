We restrict the test to senses within a single part of speech to focus the work on the harder part of the disambiguation problem--the accuracy of simple stochastic part-of-speech taggers such as Brill's (Brill 1992) suggests that distinguishing among senses with different parts of speech can readily be accomplished.
A92-1021
At each training-set size, a new copy of the network is trained under each of the following conditions: (1) using SULU, (2) using SULU but supplying only the labeled training examples to synthesize, (3) standard network training, (4) using a re-implementation of an algorithm proposed by Yarowsky (1995), and (5) using standard network training but with all training examples labeled to establish an upper bound.
P95-1026
Yarowsky (1993) suggests that the sense of an adjective is almost wholly determined by the noun it modifies.
H93-1052
For example, Yarowsky (1993) has demonstrated that exploiting frequency information can improve disambiguation accuracy.
H93-1052
Yarowsky (1993) and Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1996) also found that local context is a highly reliable indicator of sense.
H93-1052
While Black's results were encouraging, our attempt to use C4.5 (a decision-tree algorithm \[Quinlan 1992\]) on the topical encoding of line were uniformly disappointing (Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993).
