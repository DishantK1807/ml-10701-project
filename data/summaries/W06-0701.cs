Our implementation of MMR (Figure 1) uses Î» annealing following (Murray et al., 2005a).

Murray et al.(2005a) address the same concerns but retain the Gong and Liu framework.

Rouge estimates the coverage of appropriate concepts (Lin and Hovy, 2003) in a summary by comparing it several human-created reference summaries.

It has been shown in DUC 2005 and in work by Murray et al.(2005b; 2006) that Rouge does not always correlate well with human evaluations, though there is more stability when examining the correlations of macroaveraged scores.

We also use the statistical combined partof-speech (POS) tagger and sentence boundary disambiguation module from LT TTT (Mikheev, 5http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/ duc/duc2005/tasks.html 3 1997).

Further linguistic markup is added using the morpha lemmatiser (Minnen et al., 2000) and the C&C named entity tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003) trained on the data from MUC-7.

While researchers have used such large semantic spaces to aid in automatically judging the coherence of documents (Foltz et al., 1998; Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), to our knowledge this is a novel technique in summarisation.
