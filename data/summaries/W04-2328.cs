(Stolcke et al., 2000) showed that in the Switchboard corpus there was little dependence beyond the immediately adjacent utterance, but whether this also applies in this multi-party domain is unknown.

About 200,000 SWBD utterances were rst annotated with DAMSL tags: it was observed that only 220 combinations of tags occurred (Jurafsky et al., 1998).

Apart from the data recently available in the IM2 project, results reported in this paper make use of the ICSI Meeting Recording (MR) corpus of transcribed and annotated dialogues (Morgan et al., 2003; Shriberg et al., 2004)3.

Each channel was manually transcribed and timed, then annotated with dialogue act and adjacency pair information (Shriberg et al., 2004).
W04-2319
The resulting search space (42 mutually exclusive tags) was well adapted to the initial goals, viz., the automatic annotation of dialogue acts and the use of dialogue act speci c language models in speech recognition (Stolcke et al., 2000).

This is an empirically very well-founded distinction: the ICSI-MR group have provided some inter-annotator agreement gures(Carletta et al., 1997) for a very similar task and report a kappa of 0.79.

2Many other potential uses of dialogue act information have been hypothesized, such as their use to increase ASR accuracy (Stolcke et al., 2000), or to locate \hot spots" in meetings (Wrede and Shriberg, 2003).

We use a Maximum Entropy (ME) classi er (Manning and Klein, 2003) which allows an e cient combination of many overlapping features.
