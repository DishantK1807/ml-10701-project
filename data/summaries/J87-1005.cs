But we can get around this if, following the approach taken by Hobbs (1983), we take a donkey to be generic, take it to refer to the unique generic donkey that m owns, and assume that to beat a generic donkey is to beat all its instances.

The separation of these two semantic roles of range and scope into restriction and body as an important fact of the logical structure of English can be seen, for example, in Woods's four-part quantifier structures (Woods 1977), in the recommendations of Moore (1981), and in the generalized quantifier research of Barwise and Cooper and others.

Then, using the notation of Moore (1981) for four-part quantifier structures, the logical form must have the following structure: all(r, representative(r).......

Quantifiers are expressed in the output language as operators that take three arguments: the variable bound by the quantifier, a wff restricting the range of the quantified variable, and the body scoped by the quantification, schematically quantifier(variable, restriction, body) This encoding of quantification is the same as that found in Woods (1977) and Moore (1981).
