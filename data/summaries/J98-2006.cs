Under the standard assumption that phonological representations are not structurally recursive, but rather are combined using essentially iterated concatenation, we can use well-known algebraic properties of regular languages (see for instance Kaplan and Kay 1994) to show that c is regular.

This is done using a construction, first suggested in Ellison (1994), which, expressed intuitively, replaces any such constraint function by a finite number of constraint functions having codomain of size two.

This shift has, however, had relatively little impact upon computational work (but see Bird and Ellison 1994).

alternative to composition of transducers involves running multiple rule transducers in parallel, producing so-called two-level phonological systems (Koskenniemi 1984).

As first pointed out by Johnson (1972), the effects of phonological rewrite rules can be simulated using only finitestate machinery, with iterative application accomplished by sending the output from one transducer to the input of the next, a process that can be compiled out into a single transducer (Kaplan and Kay 1994).

Ellison (1994) addresses the question of Q 1998 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 2 raises a particularly interesting theoretical question in this context: it allows the specification of a ranking among the constraints and allows lower-ranked constraints to be violated in order for higher-ranked constraints to be satisfied.
