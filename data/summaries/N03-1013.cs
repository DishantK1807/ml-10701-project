Other lexical semantic features such telicity, sentience and changeof-state can also be induced from morphological cues (Light, 1996).

WordNet has been used by many researchers for different purposes ranging from the construction or extension of knowledge bases such as SENSUS (Knight and Luk, 1994) or the Lexical Conceptual Structure Verb Database (LVD) (Green et al., 2001) to the faking of meaning ambiguity as part of system evaluation (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).

the CatVar The CatVar database was developed using a combination of resources and algorithms including the Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) Verb and Preposition Databases (Dorr, 2001), the Brown Corpus section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), an English morphological analysis lexicon developed for PC-Kimmo (Englex) (Antworth, 1990), NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1998), Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 2For a deeper discussion and classification of Porter stemmer’s errors, see (Krovetz, 1993).

However, we have found that most morphological analyzers, including ones with large-scale coverage such as the Xtag system (Karp et al., 1992), address inflectional—not derivational—morphology; thus, their basis for comparison is even weaker than would be provided by the Porter stemmer.
