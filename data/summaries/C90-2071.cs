The construction is defined in Fillmore's (1988) Construction Grammar as "a pairing of a syntactic pattern with a meaning structure"; they are similar to signs in HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1987) and pattern-concept pairs (Wilensky & Arens 1980; Wilensky et al.1988). Figure 3 shows a sample construction containing both syntactic and semantic feature-structures.

This allows (1) easy transformation from semantic feature-structures to more convenient frame-based semantic network representations, and (2) efficient encoding of partially redundant lexical/syntactic categories using inheritance (see, for example, Pollard & Sag 1987; Jurafsky 1990).
