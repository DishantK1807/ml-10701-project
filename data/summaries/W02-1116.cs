Gan and Tham (1999) added sense tagging and subsequently Gan and Wong (2000) annotated the corpus with semantic dependency relations as defined in HowNet.

There are, however, several difficulties to WSD (Yang et al, 2000): (i) The evaluation of word sense disambiguation system is not yet standardized.

For this work, an off-the-shelf maximum entropy tagger 10 (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) was used.

Yang et al (2000) pioneered this work by using sememe co-occurrence information in sentences from a large corpus to achieve an accuracy of 71%.

Unlike the work of Yang et al (2000) and Wang (2002) that applied unsupervised methods using sense definitions in HowNet, the paper is the first study to use a supervised learning method with the availability of the HowNet sense tagged corpus.
