Within all modern M(A)T systems, including EUROTRA (now in the specification phase), a text is viewed, from an ~IJt~point of view, as a set of decorated nodes, organized according to a particular geometrical distribution (often a tree structure, as in ARIANE-78 (Boitet et al., 1982)).

WHAT COULD BE DONE IN EUROTRA ? Our proposals are based on our experience with GETA's ARIANE-78 system (Boitet et aL., 1982), but also on some others approaches (Morin, 1978 ; Bennett et al., 1984 ; Hawes, 1983 ; Hundt, 1982).
