The word-breaking colnponent of out" system is described in detail in Kacmarcik et al.(2000). For the lmrpose of robust parsing, the component is expected to solve the following two problems: â€¢ Lemmatization: Find possible words in the input text using a dictionary and its inflectional morphology, and return the dictionary entry forms (lemmas).

Nagata 1994), on the other hand, do not allow such manual cost manipulation and precisely for that reason, improvements in segmentation accuracy are harder to achieve.

Instead, we parse them into a default analysis, which can then be expanded and disambiguatcd at later stages of processing using a large semantic knowledge base (Richardson 1997, Richardson et al.1998). One of the goals o1' Ihis paper is to show that the syntactic information alone can resolve the ambiguities in the word lattice sufficiently well to select the best breaking analysis in the absence of elaborate semantic information.
