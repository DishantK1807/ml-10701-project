15:682	This paper investigates the power and use of reference in natural language.
16:682	and the problems involved in its resolution.
17:682	An algorithm is sketched for accomplishing reference resolution using a notion of cross-sentential focus, a mechanism for hypothesizing all possible contextual references, and a judgment mechanism for dis ~rirninati ng among the hypotheses.
18:682	The reference resolution problem The present work began as an attempt to develop a set of algorithms and/or heurietics to enable a primitive-based, inference driven model of a natural language user (Schank 1972 Rieger 1974) to properly resolve pronomial references acmee eentence bmndaries.
19:682	The authors quickly realized, however, that the problem of pronomial reference resolution is only a .small aspect of a problem which might be termed nominal reference resolution, itself but a 8-11 aspect of the problem 'of the coherence of d text, (or conversation) i, em the manner in which it llmeansu more than the logicd conjunction of the meaningp of its individual constituent aentences, Examples of tqe first problem, i. e. pronomial reference resohtion are given in sentence sequences 1-4 below.
20:682	1.
21:682	Yesterday some boys from our village chased a pack of wild dogs; the largest one fell into a ditch.
22:682	2.
23:682	The wild dogs which forage just outside our village suffer from a strange bone-wealeining disealte.
24:682	Yesterday some boys from our village chased a pack of wild dogs* the largeat one broke a leg and fell into a ditch.
25:682	3.
26:682	Yesterday John chased Bill half a block; he was soon out of breath.
27:682	4.
28:682	My friend Bill has an extremely severe case of asthma.
29:682	Yesterday John chased Bill half a block; he was soon out of breath.
30:682	The ~roblem in utterance (text, conversation etc. ) excerpts of the above type is #hat of determining the referents of We various occurrences of the pronouns I' one, I' and "heN For the moment we simply note that usually preferred referents of the two occurreqces of llonell are I1boyl1 and Ild~g~~, (examples 1 and 2 respectively) and those of the two occurrehces of "hew are I1Johnl1 and Bill (exampies 3 and 4 respectively.
31:682	) The more general pr~blem of nominal reference resolution is exhibited in he following annotated excerpt from a recent newpaper article (N. Y. Times 7/15/75, byline Arnold Lubasch); subscripted bracketing of the excerpt is intended only to enable later reference to specific parts of the text.
32:682	1 [Some of the tnajor provisions of [the state's Fair Campaign 2 \ were declared unconstitutional here yesterday oy [a special 3 Federal court] that assailed [the restiictions on election campaigning] 3 4 as "repugnant to the right of freedom of speech.

36:682	l1 If newpaper reporters had a bit more sympathy for those of us concerned with natu-1 language poocessing, the above excerpt might have read as follows: The state has a Fair Campaign Code.
37:682	Some of the major provisions of the state's Fair Campagin Code are provisions which restrict something.
38:682	Some of the things restricted by some of the major provisions of the state's Fair Campaign Code which restrict something are activities having to do with election campaigning.
39:682	Same of the activities having to do with election campaigning which are restricted by some of the major,provisions of the state's Fair Campaign Code whioh restrict something are attacking a political candidate's race, sex, religions or ethnic background and misrepresenting a) candidate1 s party affiliation, position on political is sue s . . .
40:682	Last year three state assembly canddiates filed a constihtional challenge to some of the major provisions of the state's Fair Campaign Code which restrict something.
41:682	Y esterday a special Federal court declared unconstitutional thou of the major provisione of the state's Fair Campaign Code which restrict . something . ., The p& is that in order for a machine or a human to validly claim to have Ilunder~tood~~ the original excerpt& helshelit must be able at the very least to dekonstrate that he/she/it has established the following relationships between various items occurring in the excerpt.
42:682	(Iqtegers aprbsent subscripted bracketed regments of the original excerpt.
43:682	) (f) The identity of 2, 7, and 11 (ii) The identity of 3, 5, 8, and 12 (iii) The fact that 4, 6, 9, and 15 are elements, subsets or pafb of 1 (iv) The fact that 13 and 14 are members of 3 and on and on and on.
44:682	(I. em a closer analysis of the original excerpt reveals many more relationships which must be established before llundeirstandingu may be clamed.
45:682	) It people sctually wrotelspoke in the style of the somewhat facetious paraphrase of the original excerpt, the nominal reference problem would be reduced to one of matching lexcial patterns and recognising a few syntactic cues; to state the obvious, the necessity for more* succinct linguistic communication has forced the development of elliptical devices which shia the burden of nominal reference resolution from syntactic analysis to an analysis of the Hsemanticsll of sentences in context.
46:682	More specifically, nominal references cannot in general be resolved without the use of general semantic infarmation as well as specific world knowledge.
47:682	While the fact that syntactic a-lysis alone is insufficient for understmding is anything but novel, the question of the magnitude of the nominal reference problem and of its solution1 s crucial dependence upon local context seems to have been little commented upon.
48:682	(Clark (1975) discussee the problem from a viewpoint different from that of this paper, ) The reader who remains unconvinced by the examples above that local context (and specific world knowledge relating to local context) must play a crucial role in reference resolution is asked to consider the two sentence sequences 5a, 6, and 5b, 6.
49:682	5. a. The founding fathers had a difficult time agreeing on how the basic laws governing our country should be framed.
50:682	b. Those foolish people at the country club have spent an incredible amount of time arguing about club rules.
51:682	6.
52:682	The second article of the constitution, for example, was argued about for months before agreement was reached.
53:682	In sentence sequence 5a, 6, Itthe second articlett clearly refers to the second article of the constitution of the United States, while in sentence sequence 5b, 6, the reference is to the second article of the constitution of the country club.
54:682	In each case the only factor involved in resolving the reference is the semantic content of its 10-1 aontextin this case the meaning of the sentende preceding the one in which tke reference occurs.
55:682	Since the lexical item Itthe constitutiontt appears in the example just considered, a wordconcerning such proper-noun-like objects is in order.
56:682	In any language here are lexical Items and phrases such as those appearing in 7 below, which, in the absence of compelling alternative, have standard default ref erentsf for example the standard default referents of the items in 7 are the corresponding items in 8 7.
57:682	a. The constitution b. The founding fathers c. Wall Street d. The establishment e. The presiaent f. Madison Avenue 8.
58:682	a. The constitution of the U. S. b. The flhnding fathers of the U. S. C. The U. S. business.
59:682	community (or that part of it residing in New Yotk City.
60:682	) d. Those people who have the power to influence the course of events in the nation etc. etc. e. The president of the U. S. f. The advertising industry.
61:682	In order for textual occurrm-ce of such proper-noun-like objects to be properly handled, their standard default referents must be listed in the lexicon.
62:682	This is not to say that occurrences of proper-noun-like objects cannot be references to objects occurring previously in the text; rather it is the case that their default options must also be considered as possible referents.
63:682	As final examples of the reference resolution problem let us consider sentence sequences 9 and 10 below.
64:682	9.
65:682	The president was shot while riding in a motorcade down one of the major boulevards of Dallas yesterday; it caused a panic on Wall Street.
66:682	10.
67:682	John was invited to tea at the Quimbyls last Saturday; he would have loveq to go, but he knew held be busy then.
68:682	In example 9, while t&e first sentence of the eequence contains a number of noun objects (president, motorcade, boulevards, Dallas) which are potential referents for the occurrence of rlitll in the second sentence, none of the these is in fact, the proper referent; rather, the proper referent of Ifitlt is the event (or fact) that "The president was shot while . . .
69:682	It In example 10 we have an instance of an adverbial reference ("thenf1) which must be recognized as referring to flyesterday" rather than bo some non adverbial object occurring in the first sentence of that example, Sketch of a Solution Frsm the point of view of computer implementation, the problem of nominal reference resolution is one of creating tokens for noun objects mentioned in a text, and discovering and encoding the relations, alluded to in the text, which hold between them and various other tokens in memory.
70:682	This problem, though certainly not it s magnitude or ramifications, was noticed by Rieger (1974) in his poineering implementation of a primitive-based model of a natural language user.
71:682	Riegerls system, however, suffers from the incredible inefficiency r esuIting from its need to search all of memory in order to attempt any reference resolution; in addition it will often miss a quite obvious referent entirely, and, in fact, resolves non-pronomial references only accidentally if at all.
72:682	Before presenting a sketch of a proposed solution to the nominal reference resolution problem, it would be well to detail more precisely the overall language processing enviornment within which it is meint to operate and of which it is a most necessary part.
73:682	First, we adsume that a relatively small set, S, of semantic primitives and $ logical-calculus -like language, L, for expressing ltmeaningsll are available.
74:682	The set S and language L must satisfy the following two conditions.
75:682	(i) The predicate, function, and constant eymbols of L are members of S.
76:682	(ii) There is a one-to-o* mapping from meanings of (natural language) sentences to formulas of L. While a set of prkiitives and a meaning representation language even demonstably close to satisfying the above conditions have yet to be produced, we will, in examples to follow, make use of meaning represen tations; the only claim we will make for them is that the functibns served by their constituent constructs must be served by the elements of any adequate system.
77:682	In addition to a meaning representation scheme we will assume en encoding of world knowledge of the sort which a lltypicallt adult might possess, again with the same obvious caveat.
78:682	While the question of translation from natural language sentence8 to'meaning representations will not be touched upon here, we will sasume sentence -bysentence translation of the sort exhibited in various examples to follow.
79:682	The solution PO the reference resolution problem rests in recognizing the fact that reference is an elliptical device, and +that the human under stander of.
80:682	natural language cannot recapture that which was elided once he is too far from it in the text; in fact, he cannot resolve a reference to a pint in the text more than a few-sentences back without going back and pondering it (if he can do so at all).
81:682	We should note that this is true even ih the case in which the referent doesn't actually appear in the text, but appears only in an inference from some statement made in the text.
82:682	In this latter case a case which we will discuss only at the very end of this paper the reference is not resolvable (and would not therefore have Been made by the c~eator of the text in the first place).
83:682	unless the statement from which the inference is made appears shortly before in the text . Though we cannot say precisely how far back is meant by.
84:682	"shortly before, " it is certainly no more than a few sentences.
85:682	Fbr a given sentence, S, appearing in a text we will refer to the gequence of sentences preceding S by no more than the intended distance as the focus of S. In terms of computer implementation, we will, in the processing of a text (which we conc-eive of as proceeding sentence-by-sentence), maintain the following focus sets.
86:682	%bje CJ' (i) The noun-object focus the set of tokens of a noun meaning representation~ of the focus of S (where S is the bentence currently.
87:682	being processed) (ii) The event focus -a set aontaining, for every sentence W in the focus of S, the object EVENT(F), where F is the meaninq representation of W, and EVENT is a function which maps the meaning of a formula, F, into a noun-like object whose meaning is "the event (or fact) that F" (iii) The time focus a set containing taken8 for all time references (e. g, yesterday, five olclock, etc. ) occurring in the meaninq representation of the focus of S. The reader may question our inclusion of every object appearing in the meaning xepresentation of the focus of S in one of the above focus sets, i. e. in the set of potential referents.
88:682	In fact, however, it seems to be the case that any object (of one of the above-mentioned types) occurring in the meaning representation of the focus of S may be the referent of an object occurring later in the meaning representation of S. Sonsidex, for example, the sentence sequences formed by taking each of he sentences af 12 below, in turn as an immediate continuation of a text zontaining sentence 1 1 below.
89:682	11.
90:682	Stan argued with his sister Fran in an attempt to convince her that she should bring Mary, whom he would like to get to knpw, on their planned trip to the San Diego Zoo tomor~ow.
91:682	12.
92:682	a. He was really insistent.
93:682	b. She was hard to convince.
94:682	C. It was useless.
95:682	d. He thinks she's the prettiest one of all Frads friends.
96:682	e. The prospect really excites him.
97:682	f. He arguecl that ft wouldn't tie Mary up for more than half a day.
98:682	g. It's he best one in the country, you know.
99:682	h. She thruught it was a twrible idea.
100:682	i. She happened to be busy then, but expressed an interest in coming along ahother the.
101:682	Ea& of the mderlined items in sentences 12a-12i references some object in senten11.
102:682	(For the sake of clarity we present in 13 below the referents as we understand them, ) 13, a, Stan b. Fran c. The attempt (to convince, . . d. Mary em EVENT \Stan will get to know Mary) f. The trip g. The San Diego Zoo h. Both --@he a& it are ambiuous; if she is taken to be "Fran, l1 then it refers to EXENT (Fran will bring Mary,.
103:682	.); if she is taken to be "Maryll), then it refers to EVENT (Mary will come . ) The point is, of course, that any item in (the meaning representation of) a sentence, S, may be referenced by some item in (the meaning repr eeentation of) a latter sentence.
104:682	On the other side of the coin the question of identifying potential references is just as important as that of identifying the seb of all possible referents for an object which is known to reference something.
105:682	If we were' concerned only with pronomial referenee reaolution, the problem would have a simple solution; every pronoun is a reference.
106:682	For nominal items other than pronouns the problem is far less simple; if a noun occurs in a text just how do we know if there is a previously occurring nominal item to which it refers?
107:682	As much as we would like there to be algorithmically testable criteria, i. e. recognizable syntactic and/or semantic cues, for making the decision, there seem to be none.
108:682	Thus, the mechanism we propose considers every token appearing in the translation of a sentence as a possible reference.
109:682	At present, we hypothesize the existence of a small set, R, of relations which are suffvient to account for all instances of nominal reference.
110:682	Included in this set are, at the very least, the relations identity, member of, subset of, and part of.
111:682	Noje that although this list of relations im quite small, it suffices to handle all the examples of reference presented thus far (i. e. those occurring in sentence sequences 1-6 and 9-12 as well as those occurring in the excerpted newpaper article above).
112:682	All of the above observations taken together lead to the following sketch of an algorithm for reference resolution.
113:682	I. #AS each new sentence, S, is transrated into its meaning representation, the various focus sets (noun-object, event, time) are updated.
114:682	11.
115:682	A set, H, is formed containing all tuples of t&e form (N1, N2, P) such 'that N1 is a nominal item occurring in(the meaning representation of S, Nz is an object occurring in the focus set (noun-object, event, or time) appropriate to N1, and is a member of R; H is the set of all current refewnce hypotheses arising-from S. III.
116:682	A lljudgment mechanism, " discussed below, is invoked to determine the liklihoods of the correctness of the various members of H. It is clear that following step II any further processing of reference hypotheses requires that all members of H be considered relahive to one avther, since the correctness or incorrectness of one may depend crucially upon that of others.
117:682	In the general case not all hypotheses will turn out to be correct, and in fact some may contradict others for instance in the case of two hypothesis-triples with identical first and second elements and different third elements.
118:682	Once it has been created, the set H is submitted to a "judgment mechanismft whose task it is to choose some of the hypotheses as valid and others as invalid.
119:682	The judgement mechanism must clearly have access to the world knowledge stored in memory, and must be capable of performing inferencing of a sort which produces decisions as to the relative Eklihoods of the various hypotheses.
120:682	Before giving example8 of just how such a judgment mechanism might work, we should make it clear that our sense of I1inferencing1l is very different from Riegerls (1974).
121:682	In Riegerls sense inferencing is undirected, while ours is directed toward the goal of validati~g hypotheses.
122:682	There is, in addition, another sense in which the sort of inferencing to be done by the judgment mechanism is directed.
123:682	The fact that the rgasons for validating or throwing out a particular reference hypothesis (on the part of human natural language users) involve the information coweyed in local context as well as world knowledge relating to items contained in that information (and world knowledge relating to items contained in world knowledge relating to items contained in that information, ctc.
124:682	) constitutes a good guess as to the particular pieces of world kncrwledge and the rules of inference which must be involved in judging that hypothesis.
125:682	Ekamples of reference resolation 14 and 15 below contain components of possible meaning repfek sentations of the two sentencel of sentence sequence 1 at the beginning of this paper.
126:682	14.
127:682	C 1 : CHASED (xl, q) C2: TIME (cis YESTERDAY) C3: SUBSET (x [BOYS]) C4: SUBSET (x~, [DOGS]) C5: GREATER (SIZE(xl),l) C6: GREATER (SIZE (IS,), 1) 15, C7: FALL INTO (yI, y2) C8: TIME (C7, PAST) C9: MEMBER (y,, [DITCH]) 30: MEMBER(yl,y3) C11: LARGEST (yl, y3) 'The meaning reprecentations proposed for the two sentences are C1A%hGhGAC5AC& and G7hCshCo AC~OAC~~ respectively.
128:682	Note that we are not claiming that the predicates CHASED, and FALL INTO and the constants YESTERDAY, BOY, DOG, PAST and DITCH are at the leve3.
129:682	of semantic primitives; rather, the above analyses are at just the level which we need to illustate the operation of the reference resolution mechanism.
130:682	Further more, the symbols YESTERDAY, BOY, DOG, PAST and DITCH ahould be taken as pointers to the definitions of the appropriate items encoded in memory in whatever fashion.
131:682	The brackethg in the notation [A], where A is a pointer to a definition, is meant to be a function which takes A into an object whose meaning ie the class of items satisfying the meaning pointed to by A. Once the translation of the first sentence of sequence 1 into its meaning representation has been completed on the assumption that that sentence is at the beginning of the text being processed the various focus sem will contain the followkg: no.object focus: [xl, xz) ; event fbcps.: [(cfic21\~/\chcd\~~ )3 ; time focus [YESTERDAY ] . After the second sentence is translated the set, H, of reference triple hypotheses presented to the judgment mechanism will then be the following : is a member of is a sqbget of is~part of Note that no member of the event focus occurrs in H because the translation of the second sentence contains no term of the form EVENT(y); for simplicae omit the question of time referencing.
132:682	All of the relations between y2 and xl or rt can be ruled out pn the basis of SUBSET (x,, [DOC]) SUBSET (xl.
133:682	[BOY]), MEMBER Or,, [DITCH]) and of the world knowledge to the effect that boysldogs cannot be identical to, members of, eubsets of or parts of ditches (of course in some weird fairy tale setting one of these might be possible and shouldn't be thrown out; but in such a case local context would inform us of the "weirdrr situation and the appropriate one wouldn't be thrown out.
134:682	) The hypothesis that or y3 is a part of either xl or xz can be 20 ruled out on the basis of SUBSET (q, [BOY]) and SUBSET (x,, [DOG]), which tell us that q and x2 are sets of objects, and the world knowledge that sets don't have "partsi1 in the sense of the "part of1!
135:682	relation.
136:682	Identify between yl and either XI or x2 can be ruled out on the basis of MEMBER (yl, y3) which tells us that yl is an ihdividual and SUBSET (x1, [BOY]), SUBSET (x2, [DOG]), GREATER (SIZE (x,), l), and GREATER (SIZE (xz), 11, which tell us that xl and x2 are sets containing more than one object.
137:682	(Remember that we're not doing axiomatic set theory in which there are no lgindividuals in our sense and in which the sort of ll-iindividualll which is dealt with can be a subset of some set.
138:682	) Fmally, the "member of" relation between y3 and either xl or x2 can be ruled out pn the basie of MEMBER (yl, y3) which requires thpt y3 be a set, SUBSET (xl, [BOY]), SUBSET (x, [DOG]), GREATER (SIZE (xl), I), and GREATER (SIZE (x2), 1), which tell us that x1 and x2 are sets containing more thad one element each, and the fact that sets are not members of sets.
139:682	(Again, we're not dealing with set theory; if in fact, we were talking about axiomatic set theory in English, then local context would contain that information, and aiff erent inferences would come into play.
140:682	) This leaves us with the following hypotheses : is identical to '' {is a subset ofj [:j y, is a member of { :g But some of these hypotheses are consistent with one another: in fact the hypotheses ie identical to X. i = l,2 1 is a subset of -C 3 imply the hypotheses yl is a member of x. i = l,2 1 respectively because of MEMBER (yl, y,).
141:682	At any rate, the judgment mechanism assumes at this point that either yl is a member of xl or yl is a member of x2.
142:682	The readear is asked to recall at this point that in presenting the usually preferred referents for references in sentence sequences 1-4 the claim was made that in sentence sequence 1, the usually preferred referent for "onefr is lfboys".
143:682	The reason for this claim is the authort s observation.
144:682	that, when such a pronomial refercnce occurs as the surface subject of a sentence, in the absence of semantic content which discrminates among the various possible referents, most people seem to take the eurface subject of the last sentence in the focus as the inbnded referent.
145:682	The reason for this human judgment is probably that the readerlhearer takes the surface subject to be the "topicll of a sentence.
146:682	If this observation is correct, the judgment mechanism should, in the current example, simply choose "one of the boysr1 (yl is a member of xl) as the proper referent.
147:682	If this observation is incorrect, the judgment mechaaism should judge that there is ambiguity in the reference 'lone Sentence sequence 2 at the beginning of this paper would be handled in precisely the same manner as sentence sequence 1 up to the point at which 11y3 is a member of xl1I and "y, is a member of x," were the remaining hypotheses.
148:682	The knowledge that Ifthe dogsLt refer red to suffer from a strange bone -weakening diaease would bhen cause the judgment mechaniam to strengthen the likelihood that tlonell refers to "dogs, thus causing Ityl is a member of x," to be the preferred judgment.
149:682	Sentence sequence16 below contains an example of EVENT reference.
150:682	16.
151:682	The presidnet was shot yesterday.
152:682	It caused a panic on Wall Street.
153:682	Omitting all other details of the translation into meaning representation we simply note that the primitive -level predicate into which cause" is tranqlated requires an object of the form EVENT (F) as its subject (i. e. if we say something like "John caused a stir" what we mean is that John did something and the event (or fact) that he did that caused a stir).
154:682	Thus, when the 2nd sentence is handled, the only possible referents for will be the objects contained in the EVENT focus, namely just EVENT (the president was shot yesterrlay).
155:682	The judgment mechanism thus must skply decide if the event (or fact) that the president was shot yesterday was likely to have caused a panic on Wall Street, a judgment which, with adequate world knowledge, should certainly be confirmed.
156:682	Sentence sequence 17 is a very similar case.
157:682	17.
158:682	The president was shot yesterday.
159:682	Bill told me all about it.
160:682	It caused a panic on Wall Street.
161:682	In order to resolve the reference 'lit" in the last sentence of 17, the judgment mechanism would have to decide on the relative likelihoods of i and ii below (i) The event (or fact) that the president was shot yesterday caused a panic on Wall Street.
162:682	(ii) The event (ok fact) that Bill told me about the president being shot yesterday cauaed a panic on Wall Street.
163:682	Again, with the availability of reasonable world knowledge about such things as presidents, their being shot and panics, the judgment mechanism should be able to choose the proper referent for "it1I While a fully detailed specification of the judgment mechanism must await further investigation, the above examples should illustrate, at least in part, the manner in which we conceive of its operation.
164:682	Conclusions The phenomenon with which we have been dealing is one example of what we would like to call the llcreativefl aspect of language use; more specifically, reference of the sort we have described and attempted to handle is an elliptical device necessary for effective communication; moreover, it is a device which exhibits the ability of language to "change the ground rulestf in a very flexible and fluid manner in response to context.
165:682	At this point we must admit that there is an even more creative type of reference than the sort we have dealt with.
166:682	18 below is an example of this type of reference.
167:682	18.
168:682	Last week I caught a cold while vieiting my mother in Chicago; as ueual, the chicken eoup had too much pepper in it.
169:682	The interesting reference in the above example is ILchickeh soup.
170:682	There is no item in the first sentence to which it is directly related; on the other hand, few people have any trouble resolving it by interpolating between the two sentences of example 18 the idea expressed in sentence 19 below: 1,q. When I get sick my mother makes me chicken soup.
171:682	If sentence 19 were available, our reference resolution mechanism would easily come up with an identity relation between the two occurrences of It chicken eoup Obviously, for our proposed mechanism to resolve this reference, some sort of inferencing must first work on the 1st sentence of 18 to produce the meaning of 19 as an inference.
172:682	Thus it is clear that reference resolution and general inferencing must be inter leaved.
173:682	The mechanism proposed abave does not handle the entire problem.
174:682	It does, however, seem to be a minimal model of reference resoIdtion (minimal in the sense that at least this much must be going on).
175:682	In addition, it provides for that control over the use of general inferencing which is required to avoid a combinatbrial explosion (BOOM).
176:682	American Journal of Computational Linguistics Miaofiche 36 : 26 How DOES A SYSTEM KNOW WHEN TO STOP INFERENCING?* The Moore School of Electrical Engineering University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19174 Abstract The problem of constmining the set of hfemtces added to a set of beliefs is considered.
177:682	One method, based on finding a minimal unifying structure, is frresented and discussed.
178:682	The method is meant to pnxride internal criteria for inference cut-off.
179:682	I. Introduction Natural language processing systems that are sensitive to the semantic and logical content of processed sentences and to the p~glratics of their use generally draw inferences.
180:682	A set of fonmilas representing the meaning of a sentence and the 'state of belieft of the system is augnented by other related formulas (the inferences) which are retrieved and/or constructed during the pmcessing.
181:682	The problem to be investigated here is: How can thi$ process be contmlled?
182:682	Can reasonable criteria be found for restraining the addition of inferences?
183:682	Top-down inferences fol.luwing from the meaning of lexical items (often expressed by decomposition into primitives) are clearly bounded, if no interactions are allowed amng the generated sub-formulas.
184:682	This process (which we call EXPANSION) will not be discussed here.
185:682	Rather, we shall be concerned with SYNlESIS, i.e., the addition of new formulas based on the * This work was partially suppored by NSFGrant SCC 72-05465A01.

187:682	zxsence of already generated lower-level formulas, 'v~hich we shall call kliefs.
188:682	In particular, we are concerned with infererces addgd because a set cf beliefs is recognized as fitting a plre-defined pattern.
189:682	The question we ask is: Given an initial set of beliefs ovm a set of ;ri&ives, what 'crite~ion can be us& to Mt the pmcess of pattern matcljng r-d associated inference addition?
190:682	The major structuralfeature that we use % wide such a criterion is a partial order over the set of patterns.
191:682	Before pursuing this suggestion any further, let us examme sane d -3s ait~~native ap-pmaches to infence and iiiCsrence c~r-off.
192:682	To logicians, deductive inference involves rules by which fanmilas can 3e added to a set (which ki~ally cantains the dons) in certain ways pvided other formulas are dLready in the set.
193:682	In general, this sort of infexence is quite open-ended in that one can keep applying the rules of LnXerence and ccrme up with mre and ao~e famulad dl of which represent 'pvablet statements.
194:682	Xhe terminaticm criterion for a particular invocation of the m&ankmmi&t be the appemce of an 'intestingt farmola or the loss of interest of the infemcer, but in general the stdement of the rules of inference says nohing about when to cease deriving fbmulas.
195:682	This parafrom logic has been carried over into ktificbl 3telligence qmtenrs, where the issue of terndnaticm is very real.
196:682	The usual solution has been to invoke the inferencer under the very strict control of a supervising pgran w*&has its own gmls progmnmd in which mkes c-ain that appropriate criteria are applied to hdlt the inferenchg.
197:682	This is =st apparent in systems written in PLANNER-like languages ach has use~~pmgrammble me&anisms for conbmlling the pl~gf process . In the work uf Schank and Riege, (Sch, 75) (Ri, 74 inference has nore of the flavor of be association; inferences are conceive$ of as expan&g sph~s in'inference space.

202:682	These osnstants, presumbly, have little to do with the m-iical stru~tuce of t?e foninl inferace scha~~, and as such we would call them 'extaml criteria.
203:682	' A stmtegy like (1) above, on the other hard, is nure tintexmalt and is to be pfm'.
204:682	A gwl of 'the present mrlj is to fcmnulate a reasonable internal criterion for infmce cut-off tjhich can be stated fcmnally as part of the inference rule.
205:682	To do this, we &EL impose a stmchm on the set of patterns to be used in inferencing, and the rule for adding inferences will be fc~rmkted in terns of .this strutme.
206:682	The operatibns to be de-ibed below ate expmrre fully in (R,75), where a desmiption of a ccquter iqlem~ntath is also presented.
207:682	* See also (C,75), (W,75).
208:682	1 A Partial Order for the Patterm Set !he inference rule we are aiming fop is to depend on the ret of input beliefs and the set 0s patterns.
209:682	The notion we are trying to fcmnalize is ''What does this set of beliefs suggest with respect to this set af patterns"?
210:682	The particular class of inferences we are concerned with are those gotten by matching beliefs in the input set against a pattern and augmenting the beliefs with additional ppositions as dictated by the pattern.
211:682	We want to find the least instarlces of patterns which cover (include) the set of input beiiefs.
212:682	We will take as inferences all pmpositions (an arbitrary nunber) wW& a. entailed by that instance of the pattern.
213:682	Put another way, the inference operaticsl is to jump to ~onclusions.
214:682	However, it is cmly to jump to those conclusion required to make the resulting set an instance of,the least possible pattern in the pattern set.
215:682	The key concept here is 'least' in that thls is what cmtmls how many inferences are added.
216:682	What would be a suitable dering relation far patterns and ~aopositional beliefs?
217:682	One which naturally suggests itself and which is c~rrartly unclexinvestigation relies Qn the relations of instantiation and substitution instance and (2) S 5, S' if S a St. < {q l,,,%I, where the p 's Carbbing these two, we say that q,.

219:682	,s(p 1) < Iq,enm 9%)n n -1 1 We adopt the notational convention of prefixing variables with ''?
220:682	and let Q = I (HAPPY JOHN), (GIVE MR. JONES JOHN TOY), (PIIRE;YT MR. JONES JOHN)).
221:682	Then P 5 Q under the substitution ?x+JOHN, ?y+MR. JWS.

232:682	extansions.
233:682	Let P { pl = {(A ?XI, (B ?g), (C ?XI), p2 = I (B 7x1, (C ?XI, (D ?XI), p3 = {(A ?XI, (B ?XI, (C ?XI, (G ?XI} 1 Represented graphically: If input bet Bel = {(A JOHN), (C JOHN)3 then SYNEESIZE(Bel) = I I (A JOHN), (B JOHN), (C JOHN)) 3.
234:682	There is only one possible ndnimdL extenshn; (B JOHN) is inferred.
235:682	If input set Bel = (B JOHN), (C JOHN)) then sYN'mSIZE:(Bell = { f (A JOHN), (B JOHN), (C JOHN) 1 C(B JQRN), (C JOHN), (D JOfN)) 1.
236:682	There are two possible rmrundl . . extensions, but the set of clear extensions contains no inferences beyond the input set, Bel.
237:682	(Had pl and pq shared another clause, however, an inference would have been added).
238:682	If the input set Be1 = (G JOHN), (B JOHN11 then SYNTHESIZE(l3el) I { (G JOHN), (A JOHN), (B JOHN), (C JOHN)} I, Pattern pa is the least pattern which wheh instantiated covers the inputs, and there are two inferxed pru,positions : (A JOHN) and (C JOHN).
239:682	me descripti~n given here has been necessmily brief and incomplete A mre farnodl trea-t of SYNTHESIZE in tams of lattice-themetic operations is given in (R,75) and is miz zed in (JR,75).
240:682	One additional technical point should be made: It often happens that for a given input set there are no single pattinstances which cover all the inputs, though patterns exist mse instances cover subsets of the inputs.
241:682	In such a case we use an extended SYNTHFLSIZE operationt~hich is defined in the same spirit as SYWHESIZE.
242:682	(See (R,75)).
243:682	Even witbut the firU fd treatment, several things should now be clear.
244:682	First, the actual nunibex of inferences dra (propositions added) for a particular input set may be small or large (depending on the inputs and the pattern set,) but it is bounded in a phcipled way because of the definitim of SYNTHESIZE.
245:682	Second, the usual distinction between 'antecedent' and 'consequent' clauses in the pattern is not htained; a clause in the pattern may serve as an antecedent on one occasion and a consequent on ano-Eher.
246:682	Third, if 'defined1 lexical item were to be associated with tht: patterns, noting which variables are to be bound as arguments upon instantiation, then the SYN'IIESIZE function can be used to canpute sumnarizhg expressions.
247:682	a*ls SYNTHESIZE remsents a possiELe formalism for lexical insertion.
248:682	IV.
249:682	An f5wmole of the beration SYNTHESIZE Far the sake of illustration, let the primitives be: (BENIGN ?x) (?X ?y) -?X thr?ebtesls ?y (GIVE ?x ?ob ?y) -?x gives ?ob to ?y (BELONG ?ob ?XI -?ob belongs to ?x ~IlITEND ?x ?Q) -?x intends to do ?Q (LEIURN ?X ?ob ?y) -?X ?ob to ?y (?*ljlS-n~sT ?x ?y) ?x -pays i.nt-:-sz: ?y (These primitives and the patterns below may appear somwhat arkificu, but we have chosen a sinrple illustration due to the difficulties in following examples with axre than a few clauses).
250:682	kt the pattern set consist of the following four pattms: E (BENIGN ?x), (BMNG ?ob ?y), (GIVE ?y ?ob ?XI, (INTEND ?x (REIURN ?x ?ob ?yl)l PAT-2 : ?x takes-loan-% ?y : --I (BENIGN ?x), (EELOM; ?ob iy), (GIVE ?y ?ob ?x), (INEND ?x (REIURI'V ?x ?ob ?y)), (PAYS-INEREST ?x ?y)) pm-3: ?x roba ?y: {(NOT (KEXLGN ?XI), (BElXlNG ?ob ?y), (?x ?y), (GIVE ?y ?ob ?XI, (NOT (INEND ?x (RFNRN Tx ?ob ?y))) 3 Pm-4: ?x plays-practid joke on ?y : { (BENIGN ?XI, (BWla ?ub ?y), (mm ?x ?y), (GIVE ?y ?ob ?y), (DVIEND ?x (RFNRN ?x ?ob ?y))) A rough graphic 'pepsentation of the set of patterns is sham in Figure 1.

256:682	Input beliefs Be1 ={(INTEND JOHNDOE (REXKN JOHNDOE 1000-DOLLARS BANK)), (PAYS-INTEREST JOHNDOE BANK) 1 Here SYNTHESIZE(I3el) fiturns exactly the same set as was returned in Situation 2.

258:682	In Situation 2, (1) was an input and ( 2 ) was infemed, whereas in Situation 3, (2) was input wd (1) inferred.
259:682	The curresponding clauses of the loan pattke2*n were serving as antecedents on one occasion and consequents on the other.
260:682	This follows naturKLly fran the way SYNIPIESIZE was defined.
261:682	In this regard the reader rnay notice that sane input belief sets might yield 'warrantedt or 'spu~?ious' inferences--jumping to too many cmclusicms.
262:682	Hawever, the incmmntal addition of new patterns corrects this anom19 in a natural way: Patterns which formerly were 'least covers' may cease to be so in the extended pattern set.
263:682	V. Using Definitions to Set -Up the Pgttem Space We have been particularly interested in using definitions of words to set up pattern spaces in which SYNTHESIZE could wark as an inferencer and a lexical insertion technique.
264:682	Special attention was payed to the 'speech actv verbs, and a bief sample list is presented below.
265:682	(The symbol '?Prt denotes a predicate variable.
266:682	Also, primitive predicates are capitalized, while defined predicates are underlined.
267:682	) Again, the definitions are greatly oversimplified for illustrative purposes.
268:682	(define tell (?x ?y ?p ?t) (and (-RE ?tO ?t) (NOT (KNOW ?y ?p ?to)) (SAY ?x ?y ?p ?t) (KNOW ?y ?p ?t) (CAUSE (SAY ?x ?y ?p ?t)(KNW ?y ?p ?t)))) (define request (?x ?y ?p ?t) (tels ?x ?y (W ?x ?p ?t) ?t)) (define mse (?x ?y ?Pr ?t) (and (EELS-OBLIGA'FD ?x (?Pr ?XI ?t) (tell ?x ?y UNTENP ?x (?Pr ?x) ?t) ?t))) (define camand (?x ?y ?Pr ?t) (request ?x ?y (?Fb ?y) ?t 1) (define implare (?x ?y ?Pr ?t ) (and WWl?S-FAVOR-FROM ?x ?y) 38 The expansion of these items to patterns over the primitives yields a set in which, far example, KNOW < tell 5 request iccnmand.
269:682	The input set Be1 = {CBEFQRE tl t2), (SAY JAMES MASTER (INTEND JAMES (OPEN JAMES DOOR) t2) t2), (FEELS-OBLIGATED JAMES (OPE3 JAMES DOOR) t2 1) tmuld be synthesized to (pmmise JAMES MASER (O?EN + LX)OR) t2), with &eed inferences (KNOW FASTER (DElfi) JLLCES (OPEN JAI CCOi:?

MARQUE^ Department of Mathematics and School of Education Universi t y of the Wes t Indi es St. Augustihe, Tr2nidad ABSTRACT Linguistic communication in Trinidad and Tobago i~ characterised by intraand inter-ideolectal variation in a spectrum ranging frbm CreoleEnglish to Internationally Acceptab le English.
280:682	The tape-recorded speech of a sample of children is being analysed to determine the structure of their language, its correlation with socio-linguistic facters and their progress in the use of English.
281:682	X.2 coqvter system is designed to deal with manually codified data in the form of parse trees with associated grammatical and semantic information.
282:682	The communication complex does not have readily identifiab le norms.
283:682	The analytical method and compwr sys tern effect recognition of stable sub-systems (regardless of the external criteria which determine these sub-system), comparison of these sub-systems with English as well as state the evolution of the children's language.
284:682	Acknowledgement The research of which tkis paper is a working document is partially funded by Ford Foundation Grant 690-06641).
285:682	The authors acknowledge the kind assistance of the IBM worid Trade Corporation, Port of Spain, Trinidad.
286:682	The design and some results ~f the research to which the computer system relates are described by Carrington, Borely and Knight (1969, 1972, 1974 a + b) . Part of the intention of the project is to describe in terms applicable to curriculum development and teacher education, the structure of the speech of school-children aged 5-11+ in Trinidad and Tobago and to compare this speech with English.
287:682	The official language and medium of instruction is Englfsh.
288:682	However, the medium of daily communication ranges from a type of Creole-English to a modifed variety of Internationally Acceptable English (IAE).
289:682	The term 'postcreole dialect continuum" has been used by several researchers, notably Le Page (1957), De Camp (1971) and Bickerton (1973) to refer to apparently analagous situations in Jamaica and Guyana.
290:682	In addition to Creole, English and variants of both, a large part of the population is exposed to a local variety of Hindi (Bho jpuri) . Smaller numbers are exposed to Lesser Antillean French Creole and fewer still to Spanish.
291:682	Communication within the society is characterised by inter-ideolectal variation related to several socio-linguistic factors ethno-linguistic background, social class, educational level, occupation, sex and age.
292:682	Codeswitching and intra-ideolectal variation related to the context, content and purpose of communication complicate the examinat ion of the communication s)btem.
293:682	Since the variant levels of the complex appear to overlap they are difficult f o separate into distinct sub-systems . ne kinpistic Data The available corpus comprises 100 hours of the recorded conversation of almost 1,000 children between 5 and 11+ selected randomly from 30 schools.
294:682	me data fall into two pre-determined categories: (a) free (with pees group); controlled (with investigator) . Given the nature of the communication compaex stated above, variation and contrast are central to the data.
295:682	In addition to the usual socio-linguistic correlates of variation, these data have the possibility of containing linguistic elements which are not paralleled anywhere else in the community.
296:682	These elements may occur as a result of the instability intrinsic to the performance of a vulnerable age cohort.
297:682	We are not dealing with fully learned discrete languages or dialects but with partially learned systems of speech communication being used by children who, by virtue of being in school, are under pressure to abandon part of their communication repertoire in favour of another variety of speech.
298:682	hplic~ltions of the Data Type for the Analytical Procedure hglish is the only code of the communication complex for which adequate grammatical descriptions are available . It is demonstrably untenable to assume that the informants are attempting to speak English at all times.
299:682	They are communicating in a set of language varieties which are assumed to be rule-governed.
300:682	A statement of frequency and type of deviation from Bnglish cannot therefore be an adequate analysis.
301:682	The first task of the analysis must be to determine the structures, both major and minor, used by informants of' various socio-linguistic descriptions.
302:682	A preliminary examination of the data shows that at the level of phrase-structure of utterances; the structures will appear to be predominantly identical with English.
303:682	It is the components of the elements, their meanings and functions that will show the differences from English.
304:682	Consequently, the analysis mst note the levels at which derivational trees cease to be compatible with English.
305:682	In view of the variability inherent in the data, the analysis must discover the socio-linguistic correlates of the occurence of elements, as hue11 as state co-occurence restrictions of a given element.
306:682	Since it is possible that some elements may be distributed ih a way that does not perinit correlation with the stated socio-linguistic factors, the analysis must permit grouping of informants based on shared linguistic features for sasequent re-examination.
307:682	This provision admits the possibility that sets of features may be typical of a language acquistion stage of the informants mgardless of their socio-linguistic descriptions.

329:682	Developing the Computer System The strucfure of the parse tree is, in general, quite complex and a simple ad hoc approach to validity checking was quickly seen to be inadequate.
330:682	7 As a result a formal description of the tree was developed and used to construct a (partially) syntax-driven validity checking rgutine.
331:682	The output of this routine consists of a listing of the input, with error comments where necessary, together with the internal representation of the valid trees which is written onto a file the parse-tree file for the subsequent analyses.
332:682	several other files are used in addition to the parse tree file.
333:682	There is the informant file which contains profiles of the informants, (e.g. age, sex, linguistic background, etc), a set of form class files and a set of classification files.
334:682	The form class files are groupings of the various keywords which may occur in the data.
335:682	Thus, for example, one form class file contains all keywords which may occur on the left-hand side of a rewrite.
336:682	A classification file contains a group number for each informant; for example, one classification file contains 0 for each informant not aged 5 1 if the informant is aged 5 with a Hindi linguistic background and 2 otherwise: In any operation on the data the utterances of informants in group 0 of the relevant classification will be ignored.
337:682	Each node of a tree in the parse tree file consists of a name in the case of a rewrite this is the left-hand side of the rewrite, otherwise it is the level number and a set of descriptors, e .g. the grammar associated with the name.
338:682	Thus, in the example of Figure 1, the lines 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.2.1 become the sub-tree of Figure 2 where the descriptors are put in parentheses.
339:682	Figure 2 SUBJ PRMD (PADJ, ST, SG, OK) HDW (ANIM, NOK; IAE: NEQV) I I NCO ASOC For any tree, each analysis starts at the root and many of the tasks to be described below may be regarded, in part, as a pattern matching exercise.
340:682	The difficulties, and interest, arise because each node of the parse tree carries a substantial amount of information, and except for literals, only a partial matching of the nodes is usually required.
341:682	In addition, some tasks requira the matching of disjoint sub-trees within a given parse tree, occasionally subject to side conditions which may involve nodes not lying on the paths between the root and any of the sub-trees of interest.
342:682	Apart from the pattern matching,there is the problem of classification of the occurrences of the various patterns.
343:682	This is a simple tabulation complicated, in some cases, by the fact that the total number of categories is unknown.
344:682	The basic task of the system may be cast in the form: count with respect to a given classification file, and subject to stated side conditions, the occurrences of a given pattern.
345:682	Since there are only 1,000 informants and they fall into a reasonably small nunher of classes it is economical to pre-classify on the basis of the informant profiles rather than build the classification process into the rest of the analysis.
346:682	The system is instructed to produce a classification file by a statement of the form: CLASS = ( classification file name ), (4 expression list >) where (classification file name) is the name by which the file will be known, and each expression in<eqression list 7 is a Boolean expression.
347:682	For example : CLASS = HINDI, (AGE = 5 e LANG = HINDi, AGE = 5 4 LmG + HIND11 will produce the classification file given earlier as an example.
348:682	The side conditions refer to items ih the parse trees which must occur if the tree is to be i~~cludd in a given analysis.
349:682	For example, if only affirmative active uHerances are to be analysed the side condition Q. 7 AFM AC171 is used.
350:682	me patrern to be used is stated in a manner similar to that used in specifying the input data.
351:682	Thus, the pattern description PRED r  . + AUX . GR: @ CTN, NEUT TM, @ PROG, PATT Pdicates that the sub-tree PRED (GR: @ CTN, NEUT TM, @ FROG, PATT) is of interest, subject to the convention that both the order of node descriptors (where given) and node descriptors not mentioned in the pattern are to be Lgnored.
352:682	The occurrence of keyword FORM = < form class file name) indicates that the contents of the stated form class file are to form an additional dimension to the final tabulations.
353:682	Thus the pattern AUX --+ [?I FORM = OKFILE where OKFILE contains the keywords OK and NOK and is an abbreviation Sor the pair of patterns.
354:682	AUX -P [?I OK AUX+ [?I NOK The symbol ? indicates that the items found there are also to add an additional dimension to the tabulations.
355:682	The output of each tabulation may also be used to construct a classification file of the informants, to be used in further analyses.
356:682	CONCLUSION In respect of performance of groups with different socio-linguistic descriptions, for purposes of this study, it is assumed that the frequency of occurrence of particular basic parse trees is a meaningful indicator of differences in speech patterns.
357:682	A major difficulty is that no two trees in the study are identical but at the same time if we strip too much information from each node there are too few trees to make an analysis worthwhile, and in part, the study aims at determining the degree to which strippilrp of information at interior nodes is necessary if the Gomputer is to be a qseful aid.
358:682	American Journal of Computational Linguistics Microfiche 36 : 52 DAVID BRILL AND BEATRICE T. OSHIKA Speech Communications Research Laboratory, Inc. 800A Mirarnonte Drive Santa Barbara, California 93109 ABSTRACT A set of SAIL programs has been implemented for analyzing large bodies of natural language data in which associations exist between strings and sets of strings.
359:682	These programs include facilities for compiling information such as frequency of occurrence of strings (e.g. word frequencies) or substrings (e.g. consonant cluster frequencies), and describing relationships among strings (e.g. various phonological realizations af a word).
360:682	Also, an associative data base may be interactively accessed on the basis of keys corresponding to different types of data elements, and a pattern matcher allows retrieval of incompletely specified elements.
361:682	Applications Of this natural language processing package include analysis of phonological variation for specifying and testing phonological rules, and comparison across languages for historical reconstruction.
362:682	f, NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING PACKAGE A. General characteristics The natural language processing package implemented at the Speech Communications Research Laboratoqy (SCIU;) is currently wed in the analysis of associated lists @f string data such as discourse transcriptions or pronouncing dictionaries.
363:682	The package consists of a) a set of "batchw programs which provide frequency and context information on the lexical and phonological forms appearing in the input; and b) a system for interactively accessing the data dn the basis of orthographic and phonological patterns.
364:682	All of the programs in this package are written in SAIL, an ALGOL-based language offering extended string and set manipulation operations and an associative data base.
365:682	The programs run on a DEC PDP-10 at Carnegie-Mellon University via the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) computer network (ARPANET).
366:682	The ARPANET is accessed by the ELI?
367:682	operating system developed by SCRL, which runs on a local PDP-11 [I].
368:682	While the processing package is applicable to various types of natural language data, it has been used most extensively at SCRL in the analysis of discourse transcriptions.
369:682	The discourses consist of conversational speech gathered in interviews with adult speakers of various dialects of American English.
370:682	More than twenty-five discourses, transcribed orthographically and phonologically, have been prmssed, yielding detailed information on over 28,000 utterances representing about 3,500 distinct lexicalitems.
371:682	All examples in this section are taken from a typical discburse.
372:682	B. "Batchw Facility Discourse processing usually begins with the generation of a transcription reference file in which orthographic and phonological representations are listed in discourse order, as illustrated in Figure 1.
373:682	WELL LET ' S TRY CLASSIFYING THEM ACCORDING= TO THE EXCUSES 086 TRAY 887 KLAES$CFAYIHNS 888 DHAXM 88s //AXK$ORDIHN/TUW// Figure 1 In this example, the phonological realization of TRY is /tray/ (coded TRAY).
374:682	The phonological code shown is a basic ARPA phonemic alphabet augmented by special symbols indicatim some phonetic detail, such as vowel height.
375:682	The realization of THE, for example, is coded DH$I, indicating that the vowel fell between /i/ and /I/.
376:682	Reference number's assigned to each utterance serve as an index to the discourse context in which utterances occur, and are used to interpret the output of other programs in the package.
377:682	Separate reference number sequences are provided for the orthographic and phonological forms in the reference files, since there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between these forms, as in the case of phonological merging whl-eh obscures word boundaries, In Figure 1, for example, the two orthographic items WELL and LET'S are realized as a single phonological item /wl E ts/ (coded WELEHTS) The core of the "batch!
378:682	processing facility is a set of three programs: PROCON, ENVIRN and CLUSTR.
379:682	PROCON provides frequency and context information on the lexical level, while the other two provide similaf information on the phonological level, PROCON output contains an alphabetically sorted list of the utterance types occurring in the input discourse transcription file as illustrated in Figure 2.
380:682	Frequency of occurrence of each type is given, along with the various phonological realizations.
381:682	For each phonological realization, frequency count and reference numbers are provided.
382:682	8 HAVE 3 AXV 11,337,703 3 HHAEI 354,828,1397 1 HHAXh 710 1 HH$GV 1067 Figure 2 In Figure 2, for example, HAVE occurred eight times, and was pronounced (/av/) three times and HHAEV v three times.
383:682	Using the reference numbers associated with these pronunciations, it is possible to establish the discourse context.
384:682	One would find that the tbree AXV pronunciations (i.e. utterances 11, 337 and 703) all involved the auxiliary construction in ",.
385:682	,may have felt,,,seemed to have been which have since been.
386:682	II ENVIRN tallies occurrences of phonological segments and environments in the discourse transcriptions.
387:682	The output of this program lists frequencies of all phonemes appearing in &he input file, as illustrated in Figure 3.
388:682	Figure 3 Glottal stop, coded Q, occurred a total of thirty times in the discourse, The immediate environments of Q are listed alphabetically by left context, with word boundaries indicated by slash /, and a frequency count and reference numbers are given for each environment.
389:682	For example, Q appeared eight times in the context EH--EN (E-n, and a check of the reference list shows that all these occurrences were in the word sentence (s) . ENVIRN output also provides a frequency ordered liSt of phonemes, with frequency totals brokerr down according to occurrence in word initial, medial and final position.
390:682	CLUSTR, the third of the "batch" programs,is used in the analysis of phoneme cluster distribution in the discourse data.
391:682	All clusters are indexed by each of their component phonemes, so that the cluster NDZ (fndz)') which is listed under D in Figure 4 also appears under N ad 2 in the full output.
392:682	DENTS 1 699 DQENTS 1 486 D V 2 1417, 1445 D Z 5 278, 284, 837, 1341, 1350 NDZ 1 1429 Figure 4 Separate output may be generated for clusters occurring within woxds or across word boundariesCurrently, consonant and vawel clusters are tallied, but the program can be easily modified to handle sequences of phonemes belonging to arbitrary user-defined classes (e.g. voiced sounds,, nasals, unvoiced stops, etc. ) . For each phoneme belonging to a selected class, CLUSTR provides a count of the number of times that the phoneme appears in clusters, an alphabetically sorted list of those clusters, and a frequency count and reference numbers for each cluster.
393:682	Figure 4, a sample of CLUSTR output for within-word consonant clusters, shows that D appeared in clusters a total of 70 times, with 32 of these being ND clusters.
394:682	Reference numbers may be used to establish the discourse context of any cluster.
395:682	For example, the cluster D Q EN T S (/di?nts/) appears in utterance 486 which is the word students.
396:682	Like ENVIRN, CLUSTR provides a frequency ordered list of cluster types in addition ts the alphabetic list.
397:682	CInteractive Retrieval Facility The set of "batch" programs is complemented by a language data retrieval system which allows the user to interactively retrieve data items conforming to various orthographic, phonological and syntactic patterns.
398:682	Linguistic data is inte~nally stored in the system as a network of associations between items of various types.
399:682	These associations are implemented in SAIL as LEAP triples [2J and the element types entering into these associations vary according to the particular application.
400:682	For example, in analysis of the discourse data described above, triples contain orthographic, phonological and syntactic elements.
401:682	For study of phonetic-to-phonemic mapping, triples might be orthographic, phonemic and phonetic elements.
402:682	In comparative linguistic research, triples might consist of an orthographic element and two phonological elements corresponding to two languages or dialects Data can be accessed on the basis of patterns directed to any one (or any combination) of these elements.
403:682	For example, if the data base contains associations between orthographic, phonological and syntactic elements, then the query P/ 0: THE retrieves the phonological items associated with the .spelling THE, and might return DHAX(/Ba/) and DHIY i).
404:682	The query O/ P: TUW would retprn the orthographic items pronounced Tm (/tu/), e.g two, too, tor --Patterns such as THE and TUW completely specify the element to which they are directed, but various special forms allow partial.
405:682	specifications to be expressed also.
406:682	The symbol $ matches any single segment (in a phonological pattern) or character (in an orthographic pattern), and the symbol = matches any number, llncluding zero, of contiguous segments (or characters).
407:682	Thus, if N is the syntactic code for Nounr the query O/ P: $$, S: N, 0: D= searches for all two-phoneme nouns which begin with the letter D, and might return dye, day, doe, dough.
408:682	Each phonological element is defined in terms of a set of features such as UV (unvoiced) and ST (stop), and these features may be used to specify segments in phonological pawerns.
409:682	To search for phonological realizations containing /i/ between unvoiced stops, one could use the query P/ P: =(UV + ST)IY(UV + ST)= to find /kip/ (keep), /pik~ ?/ (peeking), and /r pit d/ (repeated) Boolean operators are also available for specifying pattern segments.
410:682	For example, the query 0 6: (C OR K)=, P: (NOT K)= returns arthographic ikems which begin with C or K and are not pronounced with initial k, e.g. cite, change, know.
411:682	Several capabilities lacking in the current interactive system will be available in the near future.
412:682	The user will be able to (1) specify optional segments and sequences of segments in phonological patterns; (2) create and name sets containing items of interest, e.g. monosyllabic function words, and use set operations such as union and intersection; (3) interactively modify feature definitions of phonological symbols: (4) retrieve several elements, e.g. orthographic and phonological forms, simultaneously; (5) display the discourse context of any given item, and (6) write retrieval queries and responses to a file for subsequent analysis.
413:682	11.
414:682	APPLICATIONS The processing package can be used in the analysis of various kihds of natural language data, as illustrated in the following examples.
415:682	A. Phonological variation The programs can be used to efficiently index and sort natural language data so that systematic phonological variation can be easily examined.
416:682	For example, inspection of a PROCON output for a ten minute interview consisting of over 2,000 utterance tokeno yields general observations such as -final /t/ alternates with final glottal stop /?/ under certain conditions; -alveolar flapping occurs under several stress conditions whidh appear to be related to noun affixes.
417:682	These preliminary observations can be systematically investigated using the interactive query system.
418:682	The data base can be queried for all phonological realizations ending in T (/t/) or Q (/?/), and the corresponding orthographic entries, using the queries P/ P: =(T OR Q) and O/ P: =(T OR 9) The resulting list might include art /a*/ but /bat/ can' t /k=nt/ /k en?/ fished /f 1Jt/ limit raft that want That is, final /t/ appears to vary with final /?/ following vowels arid following nasals, but not elgewhere.
419:682	This hypothesis, represented as a context-sensitive phonological rule, could then be tested against additional data using any of several computer rule testers [3-51.
420:682	Forthcoming modifications will allow queries with set operations, such that the intersection of orthographic entrieshaving final /t/ alternating with /?/ can be requested directly by the query 01 P: =T n P: =Q . That is, only entrieq with /t/ and /?/ alternation would be retrieved, and the entties art, fished and raft would not be returned, In order to determine the conditions under which alveolar flapping occurs, the queries O/ P: =DX= and P/ P: =DX= can be used to retrieve phonological items which contain DX () and correspondihg orthographic items.
421:682	Such a list might include ability lab il xfi/ city /s ifid/ facility /f as il IF^/ letter /l ;fa/ petty /p ;pi/ responsibility /r~spans~bil~~i/ writing /rd~f I g/ Flapping occprs in a descending stress pattern, e.g. city letter, petty, wrdting in which a stressed vowel precedes the flap and an unstressed vowel follows.
422:682	In addition, trhe flap appears to occur between unstressed vowels when the sequence rppresents the noun asfix -ity, as in ability.
423:682	To check this, the query P/ 0: =ITY, S: N could be used to retrieve a81 nouns ending in -ity, and the subset involving affixed forms (i.e. excluding city, pity) could be examined for occurrences of flapping.
424:682	B. Word Error Recognition testing The interactive facility can be used to examine the kinds of word recognition errors which might occur in a speech understanding system due to indeterminacies in segment labelling.
425:682	If a string is completely specified as /likrg/(coded LIYKIHNX), then it matches a single word, leaking.
426:682	However, if labelling is less precise, then alternative (and incorrect)word matches might occur.
427:682	Using the inte~ctive retrieval system, alternative labels and resulting word matches can be examined for any given lexicon.
428:682	In the example above, the labelled string might be L (VOC HIGH ANT) K IH NX with the stressed vowel represented as a set of features: vocalic, high, anterior.
429:682	Resulting word matches might include leaking and licking.
430:682	If the initial consonant is also specified as a set of features (consonant, sonorant, continuant), as in the string* (CON SON CONT) {VOC HIGH ANT) K IH NX then the resulting word matches might be leaking, lickinq, reeking.
431:682	If the K is specified less precisely as $ voiceless stop, word matches might include leakinq, licking, reeking, leaping, rippinq.
432:682	The interactive facility allows the system designer to easily determine the nature of possible incorrect matches due to phonological indeterminacy, especially as the size of the lexison increases.
433:682	C. Comparative Linguistic Relationships If the data base is represented as an orthographic list with two associated phonological lists representing two languages or dialects, the interactive system can be used to discover systematic sound correspondences, and to aid in the study of dialect relationships and historical reconstruction.
434:682	A sample'data base might be: Gloss a fish to have no, not brother bamboo Lanquaqe A Lanquage B plaa Pa mi i mia plaaw Paw phii fia phaay fay The query would retrieve those items in language B which correspond to items in language A with initial /pl-/ clusters, e.g. and paw, indicating that consonant cluster simplification may have occurred in language B. The query B/ A: =IYIY would retrieve those items in language B which correspond to items in language A with final /-ii/, e.g. the drphthongized mia and f ia. A large data base could be accessed in this way to discover systematic correspondences between languages A and B, such as the correspondences /pl-/:/p-/, m:m, /ph-/:/f/, ii:ia aa:a, etc. The flexibility of the interactive system, combined with the linguistic intuition of the user, can be used.to specify and retrieve any set of correspondences, without the need to format the data according to initial consonants or clusters, vowel nuclei, finals, etc. Information such as tonal cnntours and stress can also be represented and accessed.

436:682	1975 ACL Meeting ON THE ROLE OF WORDS AND PHRASES IN AUTOMATIC TEXT ANALYSIS Automatic indexing nom~ally consists in assigning to documents either single terms, or more specific entities such as phrases, or more general entities such as term classes.
437:682	Discrimination value analysis assigns an appropriate role in the indexing operation to the single terms, term phrases, and thesaurus categories.
438:682	To enhance precision it is useful to form phrases from high-frequency single term components.
439:682	To improve recall, low-frequency terms should be grouped into affinity classes, assigned as content identifiers instead of the single terms.
440:682	Collections in different subj ect areas are used in experiments to characterize the type of phrase an8 word class most effective for content representation.
441:682	The following typical conclusions can be reached: a) the addition of phrases improves performance considerably; b) use of phrases is better with corresponding deletion of single terms in practically all cases; c) the use of both high-frequency and medium-frequency phrases is generally more effective than the use of either phrasetype alone; d) the most effective thesaurus categories are those which include a large number of low-frequency terms; e) the least effective classes either consist of only one or two terms, or else they include terms wi~h unequal frequency characteristics permitting the high-frequency terms to overcome the others.
442:682	The discrimination value theagr is developed and appropriate experimental output is supplied.

450:682	Sentences may be embedded within other sentenaes by means of nominalization and complementation.
451:682	Various grammatical transformations involve deletion of certain parts of the sentence.
452:682	In medical records, we find entries such as no evidence of metastases, which may be said to be derived Trea something like There is no evidence of metastases.
453:682	Such incomplete sentences are not common in the spoken language of the medical records (i.e. dictated reports).
454:682	However when physiciakrs themselves are requirbd to writematerial for records, compression mechanisms are qmmonly use&.
455:682	Although this paper will deal with a mific corpus, similar devices would I often be used for compression in other s-ations where there is pressure to write as little as possible, Legal, educational, and scientific recordg where informal notes are kept woum be other examples of this class of sitqations.
456:682	The original motivation for this study was to develop effective methods for storing &e information in a medical record and to be able to retrieve this information for purposes of research, medical care, or administration.
457:682	Fsoan previous research, the feasibility of verbatim input of dictated narrative has been established, Computerized extraction of the information has been shown to be feaeible i~ a test system ACORN (Automated Coding of Report ~arrative).
458:682	his system has been described in detail in a series of previous papers.
459:682	1dt3 1 For a highly structured medical record where the entries are single words or very restricted sentences, the feasibility'of computer-assisted editing and coding has also been established.
460:682	A procedure for typing in the entdes verbatim in a medical record,called 'TICPIS' (Type-In Coding and Editing System) 4 ha8 been reported e1sew)rere.
461:682	However, the thitd, intermediate class of material cannot be handled by ACORN or by TICES.
462:682	Therefore, a linguistic analysis of this type of material has been undertaken with the ultimate objective of setting up a comprehensive eomputer system that can handle almost everything in the medical records.
463:682	In the earlier effoxts to develop natural language technology, the work was facilitated by the fact that the documents involved were strictly for the trans5 mission of factual information.
464:682	Such documents are regarded as important both by the persons who are filling them out and by the persons who read them.
465:682	In this no-nonsense situation where the record may be critically reviewed by the peers of the person who is reporting the information, unambiguous and informative transmission of information is a critical need.
466:682	Some of the simplicities in the present analysis may be~eculiar to ws type of situatfon.
467:682	The existence of a subculture with shared training, objectives, and experience may facilitate the note-taking process in somewhat the same way that a person taking notes for himself can somehow be more concise without ambiguity.
468:682	Howeveb, r many other note-taking situations would involve subculture, though not necessarily a medical one, and the findings here might be expected to have sdne general applicability.
469:682	Source of Material The medical&es discussed here are ffom tjhe records of the Surgical Adjutrant Breast Project, a nationwide collaborative study involving 36 medical institutions.
470:682	The records were filled out by medical and paramedical personnel at the participating institutions and cehtralized at Ro$glell Park Nemri&l Institute in a Statistical unit under thq direction\of-Dr. Nelson S-lack.
471:682	A sample of approximately 50 was taken from the 2734 cage histories of patients in the program and is being used in the lbguistic analysis.
472:682	Each case history ordinarily consiats df 3-6 pages of detailed information on the patient's initial status, treatment, pathology report, nledicai problems, and subsequent fate.
473:682	When the structured information in the record was excluded, each case history had between 6 and 26 notated items, each item consisting of 1 t6 5 partial-sentences.
474:682	While this material is speckalized to me purposes of the collaborative study, this type of information iq fairly typical of what is found in the usual hospital record.
475:682	The notes were typed vexbath using An IBM Mag Card Communicator so as to obtain simultaneously a typed paper document and a record in computer-usable form.
476:682	This device is used in the data-input sgstem of T~CES; an existing system for handling completely structured records.
477:682	It would presumably be usea in any extension of TICES which would handle medical nates.
478:682	In eis'analysis the computer was used to reorganize the material in a fbrmmore convenient for manual analysis by the linguist.
479:682	Anderson analyzed the linguistic structure of the entries in a sample of the medical records involving radiation findings, A discussion of this analysis will take up the next part of the paper.
480:682	Sager and associates used some of the findings from this study to develop methods for processing these same medical records by computef, adapting% program and grananar which had been developed fok parsing science articles.
481:682	This project will be discussed in the final part of the paper.
482:682	Linguistic Characteristics of Medical Notes Many of the entries on the medical records are in the form of notes which are neither complete sentences nor single word entries, but linguistic strings of an intermediate type, which we will hereafter call fragments, Fragments are a compressed typ of linguistic material resulting from various transformations which have the effect of making linguistic strings shorter by reducing or deleting materihl.
483:682	The writer of these stretches of material must make his entries brief, in order to save time and effort, but also make them informative and unambiguous.
484:682	For this reason the deleted material has to be easily recoverable, or in other words it must not contain much information.
485:682	An analysis of the fragments shows that deletion is maiinly of a small class of sentence parts: (1) tense and the verb be (t be); (2) subject, tense and the verb be; (3) the subject; and (4) subject, tense, and verb (V) other than be.
486:682	A second characteristic of fragments which makes deleted material recoverable is that both the meted material and the remainders consist of words in easily defined subclasses, based on both distributional and semantic criteria.
487:682	These subclasses are easily defined because of the nature of the sublanguage; in general the vocabulary is limited and each word has a limited semantic range.
488:682	The question on a form khich is being answered can also be used as a basis for retoring deleted material.
489:682	One of the most commonly deleted items in the medical records is t be (1 and 2).
490:682	Tense is perhaps the most important information be gives.
491:682	The deletion of tense in the medical records causes no ambiguity because usually the physician describes the situation at the time of filling out the report, Otherwise he gives the time in a time phrase: x-rays on November 2.
492:682	Fragment Types In Table 1 we list the fragment types, giving an example of each, but not with all occurring word subcl&!3ses.
493:682	The types will Sirst be given according to what material is deleted and then will be futther subclassed according to the highest nodes of the tree structure of the remainder.
494:682	The material in brackets is the word subclasses which are assumed .So have been deldted.

508:682	The word subclasses ate based on both semantic and distributional criteria.
509:682	To a large extent nouns can conveniently be subclassed on a semantic basis and verbs can be subclassed on a distributional basis, according ta the subclasses of nouns which they take as subject and object.
510:682	Due to the nature of the sublanguage there is relatively little overlap (e.g. , a given verb is likely to take only one noun subclass as shject) compared to what we would find in the language as a whole.
511:682	Two impoftant subclasses of h-n nouns used in the medical records are N-physician and N-patieht.
512:682	Each has only a few members, but is important because many verbs chqacteristically take it as subject or object, and also because both, but particularly N-physician, are usually deleted.
513:682	It is on the basis of the verbs which characteristically take them as subject or object that they can usually be recovered without ambiguity.
514:682	Other noun subclasses concern more directly the subject matter of the reports, the concrete objects with which the physician is dealing.
515:682	Unlike Nphysician and N-patient, these classes usually have many mmbers and they are seldom deleted.
516:682	As with N-physician and N-patient, certain uerb subclasses char~cteristically take them as subject or object.
517:682	Table 2 gives some of the word subclasses with examples of each.

522:682	8 The LSP grqmmar of English is based on the same linguistic principles as the ACORN grammar.
523:682	Hence it could also serve to test the feasibility of adding a note-handling capability to the ACORN-TICES system.
524:682	The LSY sylr which was designed for text-processinQ, was adapted to the parsing of medical records by deleting portions of the grammar which are not required for this type of material and adding a section covering sentence fragments.
525:682	These change$ are described below, followed by the parsing resultb.
526:682	The corpus which was parsed consisted of 12 sections of the Radiation Findings extracted in their order of appearance from the medical records.
527:682	These sections contained 245 sentences or sentence fragments (word sequences ending in a period).
528:682	Of these, 37 were complete English sentences and 205 were fragments; 3 were combinations of both types.
529:682	21 entries were identical to others in the corpus, accounting in all for 139 of the sentences ox sentence fragments.
530:682	Of the complete sentences, same were quite long, e.g., Reexamination shows some scarring and thickening over the right apex which is perhaps slightly more evident than it was before, but nothing is seen that is typical of tumor involvement.
531:682	Typical sxorter sentences are Chest films on 10-25-68 and 12-14-68 do not show any essential changes sincelast reports, Liver scan 1-29-69 was normal.
532:682	Fragments were, as predicted, of the types listed in Table 1, above, though not all tyMs were represent-ed in the parsed corpus.
533:682	Table 3 shows the new definitions or redefinitioqd which were added to the LSP grammar to cover fragments.
534:682	These definitions are written in ~ahs-Naur Form (BNF), as ilze all the ca.
535:682	180 definitions which comprise the context-free-part of the LSP English grammar.
536:682	The BNF definitions are used by the parser to construct a tree representing the structure of the input sentence.
537:682	In addition to BNF definitions, the grammar contains restrictions, which test the sentence trees for grammatical and selectional well-formedness.

551:682	In the case of medical records, the unit may be.
552:682	longer than one sentence, but we have retained the root-word SENTENCE and defined SENTENCE in this case to be a TEXTLET (definition 2),,which.consists of a sentence (called OLD-SENTENCE, definition 3) optionally followed by more sdntences (MORESENT, definition 4).
553:682	The definition of OLD-SENTENCE has the same three elements (INTRODUCER, CENTER, ENDMARK) that the definition of SENTENCE does in the LSP grammar; however, in this case, tho INTRODUCER (definiqion 5) is NULL; the CENTER (definition 6) contains an option FRAGMENT in addition to the options ASSERTION and IMPERATIVE defined in the English grammar; (other~options of CENTER, e.g. QUESTION, have been deleted); and the ENDMARK (definition 10) contains unconventional punctuation, such as dashes and cornma, in addition to the period and semicolon.
554:682	Since our main interest here is in FRAGMENT (definition 7), we will elaborate onlhis definition.
555:682	R. Grishman, "The Restrictton Language for Computer Grammars of TFatural Language' Commun.
556:682	of the ACM, 18, 390-400, 1975, and the references cited there.
557:682	In defining FRAGMENT, we have used parts of the grammar which were defined independently of the fragment problem.
558:682	That this is possible is in itself a partial verificatian of the conclusion from manual analysis that only limited, grammatically specifiable, deletion-forms occur in the fragments seen in notes and records.
559:682	For example, the dropping of the verb (type 1 of Table 1) can occur in normal English when a sentence containing the verb be occurs as the object of a verb like find, e.g. We found the chest clear to pekcussion and auscultation.
560:682	itn the UP grammar there is an object string defined for such occurrences; it is calleg SOBJBE (Subject + Object of be) . This same string can then be made an option of CENTER to analyze fragments having the same om e,g. Cheet clear to.percussion and auscultation.
561:682	In detail, the definition of FRAGMENT begins with the element SA (Sentence Adjunct).
562:682	The definition' of SA (not shown here) contaihs 16 options covering all types of sentence modifiers* In this material the most frequent SA is a the expzession, usually a date [called PDATE, for optional Preposition + date) or this examination, this visit.
563:682	Following SA in the definition FRAGMENT are the options proper, naming definitions already in the LSP grammar.
564:682	The first option SOBJBESHOW (Subject + Obj ect of be or show), corresponds to the second and third structures of type 1 and also occurrences like Chest film no change, which is an expansion of SOBJBE, discussed above.
565:682	This option covers deletions of the two most common verbs in this material, be and show.
566:682	The plade of be or show (definition 8) in a fragment is either empty or is filled by a dash.
567:682	The mkond and fourth options, ASTG and VENPASS, in FRAGMENT correspond to structures of type 2 in Table 1 (e.g. , Negative_, felt to be a benign lesion), where the subject, tense and verb be have been dropped.
568:682	In the LSP grammar, ASTG (Adjective strind is an option of OBJBE, and VEWASS (V-en passive string) is also permitted after -C be and in other places.
569:682	The thitd option, NSTG Noun strind, is an object of show e.g., Mild degenerative chanqes ($om, X-rays show -' mild*degenerative changes).
570:682	It ale0 covers occurrences of the first structure of type 1 (e.g. No X-rays taken) where for regularity with more complete entries the passive Verb (taken) is seen as a right adjunct of the noun.
571:682	The last option, consisting of NSTG followed by either ASSERTION or SOBJBESHOW, covers such occurrences as PA and lateral chest 1l,-5-71 reexamination shows some scarring and thickening over the right apex.
572:682	where a noun phrase (PA and'lateral chest 11-571) precedes an assertion about that ngun phrase.
573:682	Space permits only a few remarks about these definitions.
574:682	It was helpful to order the options so that the longer options precede the shorter ones, since some of the shorter options (e.g. , NSTG) can have the &form as the first element of the longer ones.
575:682	This is not required in parsing texts, since in full senthces there is usually no other way of fitting in the remainder of the sentence.
576:682	Also, in text sentences, many nouns require a preceding determiner, so that compound nouns are not split into separate noun phrases.
577:682	In this material, determiners are rarely emplbyed, so this constraint cannot be applied.
578:682	Thi~, combined wim verb deletions and the use of commas both in the text and as sentence sepamtors, makes fof a great deal of syntactic ambiguity.
579:682	However, as the next section shows, it was possible to obtain the intended parse as the firs* output in most cases.
580:682	This was accomplished without using the subclasses special to the medical material, which are used in a subsequent stage of processing preparatory to information retrieval.
581:682	Parsing Results Parsing output is in the form of a tree, illustrated for a typicdl fragment in Fig.
582:682	1.
583:682	(Only the nodes mentioned above are shown, plus LN/RN = left/ right modifiers of Noun,) The full power of the parser is better illustrated by the along full sentences; but space does not permit presenting them here.
584:682	Fig.
585:682	1 Parse tree for FRAGMENT = 5-2-67 chest--no chanqe sjnce 2-7-67 FRAGMENT.
586:682	A summary of the parsing results is given in Table 4.
587:682	Of the total 245 sentences, a correct firat parse was obtained for 171 or 69.8%, and a first parse adequate for further processing to obtain an "information format1' in 213 cases, or 86.9%.
588:682	The latter statement brings us to the important question of how these parses are to be used.
589:682	Full sentence Fragment Full S + Fragment TOTAL 1st parse correct TABU3 4.
590:682	PARSING RESULTS Number of Sentences 1st parse OK for format 2nd or 3rd parse OK for format No parse ox parse9 i-3 not OK for format TOTAL Average time for 1st par$e 5.158 seconds Percentage 15.1 83.7 1.2 100.0 The aim in processing natural language notes and records is to arrive at forms for the data which are suitable for computerized information retrieval.
591:682	The data structures must not change the meaning.
592:682	This is why syntactic methods are knpo%ant.
593:682	Parsing with an English grammar provides the gross structure of input sentences.
594:682	(The use of English transformations makes the grammatical analysis more refined,) In each specialized technical area, more specific structure is p~s~ibie, making use of the restricted word usage characteristic of the disqourse in the given subject area.
595:682	K) A second stage of processing of this type is now being applied to the parsed corpus of medical records and will be reported in a subsequent paper.
596:682	A convenkent test of the adeqyacy of the parsing outputs is therefore whether they can serve as input to this second stage of processing (called forhatting).
597:682	It can be seen in Table 4 that a number of "wrong" parses were still adequate as input to the formatting; the segmentation of the sentence into parts was correct even if the parts were assigned an incorrect syntactic status, e.g., object instead of adjunct.
598:682	Only when the first parse was not adequate for formatting was the sentence rerun to obtain alternative analyses.
599:682	The parsing times are a rough indication of the efficiency of the parsing but two points should be kept in mind.
600:682	(1) The present LSP system is not a production model, but a research tool, with all that implies.
601:682	(2) A bignificant fraction of the input sentences were "no data" types, e,g. , None this visit.
602:682	These word sequences were so limited linguistically that a literal formula could serve to reaogniae them.
603:682	The experimental use of such a formula cut down parsing times on the no-data entries from about 1.817 to0.030.
604:682	However, this formula was not used in the parsing summarized in Table 4, This investigation was supported by Public Health service Research Grant number CA-11531 from the National Cancer Institute.
