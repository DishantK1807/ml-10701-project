Syntactic relations between words are validated in terms of semantic relations between word classes using a set of semiautomatically acquired selectional rules Basili, (1992a).

More recent papers Hindle (1990), Pereira and Tishby (1992) proposed to cluster nouns on the basis of a metric derived from the distribution of subject, verb and object in the texts.

In short, sentences including verbs are processed as follows: First, a (general-purpose) morphologic and a partial syntactic analyzer Basili, (1992b) extracts from the sentences in the corpus all the elementary syntactic relations (esl) in which a word participates.

Verb usages input to the clustering algorithm are represented by their thematic roles, acquired semi-automatically from corpora by a process that has been described in Basili, (1992a), (1992b), (in press).

Upon a careful analysis of the clusters obtained from each domain, the resulting classifications were judged quite expressive, and semantically biased from the target linguistic domains, a part from some noise due to wrong semantic interpretation of elementary syntactic structures Basili et al., (1992a).

The decision to assign a word to a category is far from being straightforward (Nirenburg and Raskin (1987)) and often the lexicon builders do not use consistent classification pfincipia.
