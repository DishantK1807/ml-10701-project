(Yarowsky, 1994) reports good results with statistical methods for Spanish and French accent restoration.

There is a vast literature on spelling correction (Jones and Martin, 1997; Golding and Roth, 1996) using both linguistic and statistical approaches.
A97-1025
(Chieu and Ng, 2002) attempted to extract named entities from non-cased text by using a weaker classifier but without focusing on regular text or case restoration.

The alternative to truecasing text is to destroy case information in the training material SNORIFY procedure in (Bikel et al., 1997).
A97-1029
The base system is an HMM based tagger, similar to (Bikel et al., 1997).
A97-1029
Work Truecasing can be viewed in a lexical ambiguity resolution framework (Yarowsky, 1994) as discriminating among several versions of a word, which happen to have different surface forms (casings).
P94-1013
Also, (Brill and Moore, 2000) apply a noisy channel model, based on generic string to string edits, to spelling correction.
P00-1037
(Mikheev, 1999) also approaches casing disambiguation but models only instances when capitalization is expected: first word in a sentence, after a period, and after quotes.
