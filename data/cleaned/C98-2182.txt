Abstract 
This paper ln'esenl.s a semantic interpretation of adjecti
val modilicatiotl in terms of the Generative l,cxicon. It. 
tfighlights the elements wlfich can be borrowed from the 
GI, and develops limitations and extensions. We show 
how elements of the Qualia structure can bc incorpo
rated into semantic composition rules to make explicit 
the semantics of the combination adjective + noun. 
1 Aims

Investigations within the generative perspective aim 
at modelling, by means of a slnall number of rules, 
principles an(I constraints, linguistic phenomena at. 
a high level of abstraction, level which seems t.o be 
appropriate for research on multi-linguism and lan
guage learning. 
Among works within the generative l)erspcclive, 
one of the most innowttive is the Generative Lexi
con ((;-L) (l'ustejovsky 91, 95) which introduces an 
abstract model ()l)posed to sense enunmration lexi
cons. The GI. is based (1) on the close cooperation 
of three lexieal semantic structures: the argument 
structure, the aspectual structure and the Qualia 
structure (with four roles: Telic, Agentiw.', Consti
tutive and Formal), (2) on a detailed type theory and 
a type coercion inference rule and (3) on a refined 
theory of compositionality. The Generative I,exicon 
investigates the problem of polysemy and of the mul
tiplicity of usages from a core sense of a lexeme and 
shows how these usages can be analyzed in terms 
of possible type shirtings w.r.t, the type exl)ected 
by the core usage. Type shifting is modelled by a 
specific inference lnechanisn-l: type coercion. 
In this paper, the following points are addressed: 
• Generative systems require a clear analysis of 
the notions of word-sense and of sense delimita
tion. Dq)ending on the strategy adopted (e.g. 
large Ulllnber of narrow senses for a lexeme as 
in WordNet, or very few but large senses as in 
many A I works), tile nature and the scol)c ot' 
generative operations may be very different. 
• The Qualia structure is a complex structure, 
quit(; dillicult to describe, in spite of evidence 
of its existence, in particular fin: the Telic role, 
(explored e.g. ill the EnroWordNet project, tile 
Eurol)ean WordNet). Qualias are well-designed 
and useful for nouns, lint look more. artificial \['or 
other lexical categories. We show that it is the 
telic role of nOllllS which is the most useful. We 
also show how the internal structure of this role 
can be nlade lrlOre precise and its use more re
liable and accurate by means of types and how 
it can be partitioned by means of types into on
tological domains tbr modelling some R)rms of 
metaphors. 
• Types are not sutficicntly 'constrained' to ac
count for the constraints holding, for each 
predicate, on the different sense/usage wn'ia
tions they may be sub.jcci, t,o. We show that 
an underspe.citied 1,exical (lonccptual Struclure 
(1,CS) (,lackendotl" 90) is more appropriate be
cause of its ability to rel)resent underspecilicd 
meaning and therefore I, hc polymorl)hism of 
senses in the GI,, be.cause, of the rele~vance and 
low-granularity of its printitives (that we have 
slightly enhanced). 
• Elements of the Qualia sLructure can be in
corporated into semantic conlposition rules to 
make explicit the semantics of the combination 
predicate-argument, instead of developing lcxi
cal redundancy rules. 
• A rule-based approach (also used by other 
authors such as ((?opestake and Briscoe 95), 
(Ostler and Atkins 92), (Numberg and Zaenen 
79)) is contrasted with the Qualia-based ap
proach to deal with sense shirtings and in \[)artic
ular selective binding, metaphors (that the G1, 
cannot resolve a priori) and metonymies. An
other view is presented in (Jackendotl' !)7) with 
the principle of cm'icl,:d composition, which is 
in fact quite close t,o our vie.w, but, restricted 
to a few specific coercion situations (aspectual, 
mass-count, picture, begin-ell.joy). 
• The ruh.'s Rn' type shifting we present here are 
not lexical ruh.'s, as in (Colmstake an(\[ Briscoe 
95), but they are part of the semantic composi
1143 
tion system, which makes them more general. 
This paper is devoted to adjectival modification 
(see also (Bouillon 97, 98)). The goal is to study 
the use and impact of the Qualia structure of the 
modified noun in the determination of the semantic 
representation of the association Noun + Adjective. 
To illustrate this study, we have chosen one of the 
most polysemic French adjectives: bon (good), which 
covers most of the main situations. Other adjectives, 
often cited in tile GL literature, such as aad, \]bst, 
difficult or noisy have been studied and contirm this 
analysis. We observed also many similarities within 
semantic families of adjectives. 
2 Conceptual
versus Lexicographic 
Analysis of Lexical Items 
In this section, we outline tile differences but also tile 
cooperation between conceptual and lexicographic 
analysis of the semantics of lexical items to build 
a lexicon suitable for tile development of generative 
devices. 
2.1 Adjectives
in technical texts 
We have considered a sample of technical texts in 
French from various origins and used a sintple tag
ging and extraction system developed for our needs. 
We have considered a total of 386 pages of text, with 
a total of 193 14(3 word occnrences, among which, 
we have 14 598 occurences of adjectives. These 
occurences correspond to 754 differenl, adjectives, 
among which 720 are restrictive adjectives. \Ve will 
only consider t.his latter set. 
A small number of adjectives appear frequently: 
Fig. 1 Adjective fl'equencies 
interval nb. of adjectives concerned 
> 300 5 
'> 300 and -< 150 12 
> 150 and -4 50 81 
This means that 98 adjectives appe~ir relatively 
frequently in texts, i.e. only about 13.6% of the t.o
tal. In terms of occurences, these adjectives cover 
11887 occurences, i.e. about 81% of the occurences. 
Adjectives from eight main 'semantic' families ap
pear frequently. These families do not correspond 
exactly to those defined by (Dixon 91) (see also an 
introduction in (Raskin et al. 95)), which look too 
vague (figures have been rounded up or down to the 
closest integer) :

In terms of 'polysemic power', evaluative, loca
tional, and shapes are the families which are the 
most polysemic, with a ratio of all average of 3.8 
senses per adjective. Nationalities, technical and as
pectual adjectives are much less l)olysemic. 
2.2 A
conceptual analysis of adjectives 
The GL approach requires a conceptual analysis of 
adjectives in order to focus on a relatively small 
nulnber of senses. The idea is to isolate generic con
ceptual 'behaviors', while taking also into account 
the constraints on linguistic realizations as in the 
lexicographic approach. 
The principle that we attempt at wdidating is to 
detine a 'deep' LCS representation for each predica
tive lexical item, which is generic enough to accomo
date variations within a sense and precise enough to 
be mettningful and discriminatory w.r.t, other word
senses. To be able to represent sense variations in an 
efficient and re\]iable way, the variable or underspec
ified elernents should be 'h)w level' elements such as 
functions or paths. Semantic fields may also be al
tered, e.g. going front location to psychological or 
to epistemological (Pinker 93). Such an approach is 
being validated on various semantic families of verbs. 
'File variable elements see, n to belong to various 
ontologies (a crucial topic under intense investiga 
lion), such as the ontology of events (actiw~', sleep
ing, terminated, etc.), of people's quilities, etc. 
2.3 Meanings
of bon 
In this short document, R)r the purpose of illustra
tion, let us consider the adjective bon (corresponding 
quite well to good), which is one of the most pol
ysemic adjective: 25 senses identified in WordNet 
(e.g. (Fellbaum 93)). In fact, bo/i Call be combined 
with ahnost any noun in French, and as (Katz 66) 
pointed out, good would need as many different read
ings as there are functions for objects. 
We have identified the following senses and sense 
variations (metaphors and metonymies in particular, 
expressed as in (Lakoff 80)): 
1. Idea of a good working of a concrete object 
w.r.t, what it has been designed for: un bon 
tournevis, de boris ycux (good screw-driver, good 
1144 
eyes). Metaphors abound: e.g.: 'communica
tion acts as tools': une bonne plaisanterie/mise 
au point (a good joke), 'fimction for tool' (un 
boa odorat), 'paths as tools' (a good road), t 
Metonymies are rather unusual since if X is a 
part of Y, a good X does not entail a good Y 2 
2. Positive evaluation of moral, psychological, 
physical or intellectual qualities in humans: 
bonne personne, bon musicien, (good person, good 
musician). The basic sense concerns professions 
and related activites or humans as a whole: it 
is the ability of someone to realize something 
for professkms, and, for humans, the high level 
of their moral qualities (an enmneration can be 
given or a kind of higher-order, typed expres
sion). 
This second sense could be viewed as a 
large metaphor of tile tirst, with a structure
preserving transposition to a different ontology: 
from tools to professional or moral skills. 
There are some 'light' metaphors such as: 'so
cial positions or ranks as professions' (a good 
boss/fatlu~r/friend/citizen), and a large num
ber of metonylnies: 'image for person, image t)e
ing a part of a person' (a good reputation), 'tool 
for profession' (a good scalpel), 'place for pro
fession' ( a good restauran O. These metaphors 
have a good degree of systematicity. 
3. Intensifier of one or more properties of tile noun, 
producing an idea of pleasure, and satisfaction 
(this is dilli:rent for sense 5) a: 
notnl(+edil)le): good meal/dish/taste = t.asty, 
with metonymies such as 'container tbr con
tainee' (a good bottle/glass), 
noun(+fh,e-~,,',,): good flm/book'/t, ai,"",g = 
valuable, with metonymies such as 'l)hysieal 
support for contents' (good CD), 
noun(+smelling): good odor, 
noun(+psycho): good relation/experienc( 
noml(+human relations): good neighbour.~. 
Note that boa can only be used with neutral or 
positiw~ nouns, we indeed do not have in l?reneh 
*good ennemies, *good humidity with the sense 
outlined here. 
4. Quantification applied to measures or to quan
tities: a good meter, a good liter, a good 
1in tim combination noun + adjective, the ,mun is the 
element that undergo the metaphor. The adjectiw: being a 
predicate, it is its relation to tim noun it modifies which is 
metaphorical, similarly to the relation verb-noun. The se
mantics of the noun remains a priori unaltered. 
2This needs relinements: there are some weak forms of 
upward i,flmrit.ance in the I)art-of relation: e.g. if the body of 
a car is red, then the car is said to be red. 
3Norms are being defined for about 600 top-most nodes of 
a general purpose ontology in different projects and research 
grmlps (e.g. NMSU, ISI, Eagles IgEC project), they will be 
used as soon as available. 
amount/salary, a good wind. In this cause, good 
means a slightly more than the unit/measure 
indicated or above the average (for terms which 
are not measure units such as wind or salary). 
This sense being quite different since it is bmsi
cally a quantifier, it won't be studied hereafter. 
5. Idea of exactness, accuracy, correctness, 
validity, freshness, etc.: un bon raison
nement/calcul = exact, accurate ( a good deduc
tion~computation), good note~ticket = valid, a 
good meat = flesh or eatable, a good use = ap
propriate, good knowledge = efficient, large and 
of good quality, q'he meaning of boa is there
fore uuderdetermined. Depending on the noun, 
the semantics of boa is slightly different, this is 
not really a case of co-composition. It is the se
mantic type of the noltn and that of the selected 
predicate in the telic role of the noun which de
termine the meaning of the adjective in this par
ticular NP. We call this phenomenon, by com
parison with selective binding, selective pro
jection, because the meaning is projected t'rom 
the noun's telic role. Sense 5 is substantially dif
ferent fi'om sense l: it is basically boolean (e.g. 
exact or not), there is no idea of tool, function 
or even activity. 
I3on appears in a large number of \[ix<'d or semi-fixed 
tbrms such as: le boa trait, le boa seas, le b<m temps, 
une bonne giffle. 
Ahnost the same. behavior is observed for all eval
uative adjectives such as exce.llent, terrific, bad or 
lousy in French. For exalnple, for ma,wais (bad), 
senses 1, 2 and 3 are identical, sense 4 is only ap
plicable to amounts (mauvais salaire), not to units 
and sense 5 is almost identical, it; conveys the idea 
of erroneous deduction, invalid ticket, bad use and 
rotting meat. Note. that it, WordNet, bad has only 
14 senses, whereas good has 25 senses, with no clear 
justification. 
2.4 A
comparison with WordNet 
We have carried out a comparison of our concet)tual 
analysis with the lexicographic analysis in WordNet. 
We have compared manually a subset of 54 adjec
tives among the abow~ mentioned frequently used 
adjectives. Among these adjectives, 20 are poly
semic in our api)roach willie 44 belong to several 
synsets in WordNet:

of our descriptions are close to WordNet (for adjec
tives which are not much l)olysemic) while 32 differ 
1145 
largely (for highly polysemic adjectives), for which 
our approach identifies much less senses. 
2.5 Underspeeification
versus polysemy 
Each of the senses of boa has many facets and inter
pretations depending on the noun it modifies. As 
for verbs or nouns (Busa 97), polymorphie types 
are used to represent the semantics of the expected 
nouns, viewed as arguments of the adjective predi
cate. The semantic representation associated with 
a sense is therefore underspecified and tuned to re
flect this polymorphism. The scope of underspec
ified elements must however be bounded and pre
cisely defined by 'lexical' types and by additional 
constraints. The generative expansion of underspec
ified fields can be defined from lexical items using a 
fix-point semantics approach (Saint-Dizier 96). 
2.6 Towards
an automatic acquisition of 
conceptual descriptions 
Some on-line resources and dictionaries may effi
ciently contribute to this task. We have consid
ered several monoand bi-lingual dictionaries in or
der to ewduate convergences. Only those struc
tured on a co,meptual basis are worth considering. 
Among them, the \[larrap's German-French dictio
nary is very nicely structured in a conceptual per
spective, providing translations on an accurate se
mantic basis. Senses are slightly more expanded 
than in the GL approach to account for translation 
variations, but closely related senses can be grouped 
to form the senses defined above. 
Another source of knowledge for English is 
Corelex 4 which is just being made accessible. It 
contains word delinitions specifically designed for 
the GL. Its evaluation is about to start. 
3 Generative
Devices and Semantic 
Composition 
Let us now analyze from a GL point of view the 
meanings of the, adjective boa. 
In (Pustejovsky 95), to deal with the compound 
adjective+noun, a predicate in the telic of the noun 
is considered. For example, fast, modifying a noun 
such as typist., is represented as follows: 
he \[tyve'(e,a:) A fast(e)\] 
where e denotes an event. This formulasays that the 
event of typing is fast. A similar representation is 
given for long, in a long record. This approach is ap
propriate to represent temporal notions in a coarse
grained way, i.e. the event is said to be fast (with 
e.g. potential iuforences on its expected duration) 
or long. But this approach is not viable for boa, and 
many other adjectives with little or no temporal di
mension. In: 
4 available at,: 
www.cs.brandeis.ed u / paulb/CoreLex/corelcx.html 
\[tvm'(< x) A good(e)\] 
it is not the typing event which is 'good' but the 
way the typing has been performed (certainly fast, 
but also with no typos, good layout, etc.). A precise 
event should not be considered in isolation, but the 
representation should express that, in general, some
one types well, allowing exceptions (some average or 
bad typing events). This involves a quantification, 
more or less explicit, over typing events ofx. Finally, 
bon being polysemous, a single representation is not 
sufficient to accomodate all the senses. 
As introduced in section 1, the semantic represen
ration framework we consider here is the LCS. The 
nature of its primitives and its low-level granularity 
seem to be appropriate for our current purpose. Un
derdetermined structures arc represented by a typed 
A-calculus. 
3.1 sense 1: Bon -that works well 
This first sense applies to any noun of type tool, 
machine or technique: a good car, a good screw
driver. The semantic representation of bon requires 
a predicate from the telic role of the Qualia struc
ture of the noun. It is the set (potentially infinite) 
of those predicates that characterizes the polymor
phism. We have here a typical situation of selective 
binding (Pustejovsky 91), where the representation 
of the adjective is a priori largely underspecificd. Let 
us assume that any nOtlll which can be modified by 
boa has a telic role in which tile main fnnction(s) of 
the object is described (e.g. execute programmcs for 
a computer, run for a car s), then the semantics of 
the compound adjective + noun can be defined as 
tbllows: 
Let N be a noun of semantic type a, and of Qualia: 
\[..., Telic: T, ...\] 
where T denotes the set of predicates associated with 
the telic role of the noun N. Let Y the variable as
sociated with N and let us assume that T is a list of 
predicates of the form Fi(-,-). Then the LCS-based 
representation of boa is: 
A Y :c~, A Fi, \[,t,t~ \]3\[5+cha,',+taent(\[thing g \], 
\[+vro,, ABILITY TO(P; (Y, _)) = high \])\] . 
which means that the entity denoted by the noun 
works well, expressed by tile evaluation function 
ABILITY-TO and the value 'high'. This type of 
low-level function abounds in the LCS, this princi
ple is introduced in (.lackeudoff 97). Note that the 
second argument of the predicate Fi does not need to 
be explicit (we use the Prolog notation '_' for these 
positions). 
The Qualia allows us to introduce in a direct way 
a pragmatic or interpretative dimension via 
the instanciation of Fi (_, _). 
5Less prototypical predicates can also be considered, e.g. 
comfort or security for a car, which are properties i)ro|)a|)ly 
described in the constitutiw: role of the Qualia of cat'. 
1146 
The constant 'high' can be replaced by a more 
accurate representation, e.g. 'above average', but 
the problem of evaluating a functionality remains 
open. More generally, the introduction of low level 
functions, such as ABILITY-TO, and specific values, 
such a~s 'low', should be introduced in a principled 
way, following the definition of ontologies of different 
domains, e.g. action, intensities, etc. This is quite 
challenging, but necessary for any accurate semantic 
framework. 
Note finally that instead of quantifying over 
events, bon is described ms a state: the function
alities of the object remain good, even when it is 
not used effectively. If several functionalities are at 
stake, we may have a conjunction or a more complex 
combination of functions Fi. 
From a compositional point of view, the combina~ 
tion Adjective + Noun is treated as follows, where 
R is the semantic representation of the adjective, 'I', 
the contents of the telic role of the Qualia of the 
noun N of type a, r, a particnlar element of T, and 
Y, the variable associated with the noun: 
sem-composition (Adj (R),Noun (Qualia(T)) = ,W : c~, ~I"~(Y, _) C T, 
(N(y) A 
The open position in R,(Y) is instanciated by fl
reduction. The selection of Fi is simple: for basic 
tools, there is probably only one predicate in the 
Qualia (screw-driver -+ screw), for more complex 
nouns, there is an ambiguity which is reflected I)y 
the non-determilfistic choice of Fi, but lm)bably or
ganized with preferences, which should toe added in 
the Qualia. tl is the constraint on the type of Y 
that restricts the application of that semantic con> 
position rule. This notation is particularly si,nple. 
attd convenient. 
Mel.aphors are treated in a direct way: the con
straint on the type of g can be enlarged to: 
AY :/3 A a' , mr.taphor(f\], c,) 
and the renlaiuder of the semantic composition rule 
and semantic formula remains unchanged. We have, 
for example: 
metaphor(communication act, tool) (joke). 
rnetaphor( eommun.ication path, tool) (road). 
which is l)aral)hrased as 'communication path 
viewed a~s a. tool'. 
We have eval uate.d that, in French, there are about 
12 frequent forms of metaphors for this sense.. The 
study of this first sense suggests that the introduc
tion of a hierarchy of preferences would be a useflfi 
exte,lsion to the rl'elic role, reflecting forms of proto
typicality anlollg predicates. 
3.2 SellS¢. ~ 2: Boll restricted to cognitive or 
lnOl'al qualities 
Another sense of bolt modifies nouns of tyl)e pro
fession or huma.n. The treatment is the same as 
in the above section, but the selection of tile pred
icate(s) r = FI(X,Y) in the telic of the noun's 
qualia must be restricted to properties related to 
the moral behavior (makes-charity, has-compassion, 
has-integrity) when the noun is a person; and to 
some psychological ~Lttitudes and cognitive capabil
ities when the norm denotes a profession (e.g. a 
good composer). Alternatively, some of these prop
erties could be found in the constitntive role (ap
proximately the part-of relation), if properties can 
be parts of entities. 
The typing of the predicates in the Qualia roles 
can be done in two ways, (1) by means of labels iden
tifying the different facets of a role, as in (Bergler 
91) for report verbs, but these facets are often quite 
ad'hoc and hard to define, or (2) by means of types 
directly associated with each predicate_ These types 
can, R)r example, directly retlect dilferent verb se
mantic (:lasses as those detined in (Levin 93) or 
(Saint-Dizier 96) on a syntactic basis, or the ma
jor ontological classes of WordNet or EuroWordNet 
and their respective subdivisions. This solution is 
preferable, since it does not involve any additional 
developmeut of the Telic role, but simply the ad.junc
tion of types from a separate, pre-detined ontology. 
The WordNet or EnroWordNet types also seem to 
be quite easy to handle and well-adapted to the phe
nomena we model. This remains to 1)e validated on 
a large scale. 
An LCS representation lk)r this sense of bon is, as
suming the following types for Fi: 
A Y : hum(m, F, : action -o relatedto-
profession V moral-behavior, Y : o. 
\[,,,,~ lSl~+~h,,,.,+,~,,,(\[,,,,,, Y \], 
\[+,,,.o,, ABILFI'Y 7'O(I,'~(Y, _)) = high \])\] . 
When several predh:ates are at slake, a set. of 
&(Y,_) can be" considered in the rel)re.sentation , or 
the statement is ambiguous. 
Metonymies such as a flood scalpel arc resolved by 
the general rule: 'tools tbr professions'. This infof 
mation could be in a knowledge base or, alterna
tively, it can be infered from t.lm 'D'.lic role of the 
tool: any instrument has a predicate in its telic role 
that describes its use= the type. of the first argument 
of the predicate is directly related to the profession 
that uses it. For example, scalpel has in its relic role: 
cut(X : surgeon V biologist, Y : body). 
When the proti;ssion is i(lel,tified, the standard pro
cedure for determining the meaning of the com
pound can be applied. Metonymies using the part-of 
relation are quite simple to resolve using the consti
tutive role, as in the GL. 
3.3 Sense
3: Bon as an intensifier 
Another main role of bon is to emphasize a quality of 
the object denoted by the noun. As shown in section 
2, there is a certain action associated with the telic of 
the moditied noun that produces a certain pleasure. 
1147 
For example, watching a good film entails a certain 
pleasure. 
Let us consider again a noun N of type a (e.g. 
edible object) associated with the variable Y. The 
entity (human) undergoing the pleasure is ,lot, ex
plicit in the NP, it is represented by X, and included 
in the scope of a A-abstraction. Let FI(X, Y) be the 
predicate selected in the telic role of N. The LCS 
representation is then: 
XX :human, Y :a, Fi(X,Y) 
\[ .... , CAUSE(\[ .... t F~(X, Y)\], 
\[,,o,~ m~+,,~,.(\[,,,,.~ x \], \[,,o. 
AT+,.~(\[+~,o. pteas.,-e \])\])\])\]. 
We have here another form of representation for boa, 
where F/ is a. CAUSE. 
The term 'pleasure' is an element of an ontology 
describing e.g. mental attitudes and feelings. It is 
relatively generic and can be replaced by a inore pre
cise term, via selective projection (see below for sense 
5), depending ou the nature of the pleasure. 
An alternative representation describes a path to
wards the value 'pleasure', giving an idea of progres
sion: 
AX :human, Y :a, P~(X,Y) 
\[ .... , CAUSE(\[ ..... t Fi(X, Y)\], 
\[ .... , co+,,,,(\[,~,,,~ x \], 
\[p.,,, TOW.4RDS+~,.. (\[+,a~ pleasure \])1)\])\]. 
Notice that this sense of boa does not imply an 
idea of quantity: a good meal does not entail that 
the meal is big, a good telnperature does uot, entail 
that tile temperature is high, but rather mild. The 
semantic composition rule is similar as in 3.1. 
The. metonylny 'container for containee" (a good 
bottle) is resolved 1) 3' a type shifting on Y. Y Jnay be 
of type fl iff: 
3 Z
: ~, Y : container A containerfor(Y,Z). 
Inferences are identical for e.g. a good CD. 
3.4 Sense
5: Boa = exact or correct 
We have here a situation of selective projection: the 
exact meaning of boa is projected from the type of 
the modified noun and the type of the predicate se
lected in the noun's Telic role. 
For example, if the noun is of type bank note V 
ticket and the type of the predicate selected in the 
noun's Telic role is pay V give access to, then 
the meaning of boa is 'valid': 
AX : bank note v ticket, 
\[,u,,~ BE+~h.,.,+,d~,. (\[tm.a X \], 
\[j,,a~, AT+¢, .... +ia~,,t(\[+m-o,,valid(X)\])\])\]. 
The constraint on the type of the relic role is stated 
in the semantic composition rule: 
sem-eolnpositiou(Adj(R),Noun(X,Qualia(T))) = 
AX : bank note V ticket, 
3Fi(-,-) :pay V .qivc -access -to C T, 
(N(X) A R(X)). 
It is necessary to have both a constraint on the 
noun and on the predicate(s) in the telic role: (1) 
the type of the predicate in the telic role is certainly 
not a sufficient constraint , e.g. every noun's telic 
role in which there is the predicate pay cannot be 
combined with bon with sense 5; (2) the constraint 
on the type of the noun is also not sufficient, e.g. a 
medecine is a kind of food, but we don't eat it. 
4 Representing
the core meaning of 
a word-sense 
Tile work presented here has shown t;he necessity of 
describing the semantics of a lexical item at a rel
atively 'deep' level, in order to make explicit the 
meaning elements subject to alterations in the sense. 
variations shown above. It turns out, so far, that 
these elements can be represented by LCS primitives 
and a few functions and values, assumed to belong 
to general-purpose, and often commonly-admitted, 
ontologies. This remains an assumption since this 
type of ontological knowledge is still under devel
opment, but the elements used are relatively simple 
and standard. Besides ontologies, and not very far 
from them, we also find information contained in the 
noun's Qualias, but in a less structured way, making 
selection more difficult. 
Core meaning definition requires a good analysis 
of a word-sense and of its behavior in difl>rent con
texts. This is however not so difficult to elaborate 
once the formalism is stabilized. Also, we noted that 
semantically close words share a lot, making descrip
tions easier. This is in particular true tbr verbs. 
Besides adjectives, we have also studied a mnnber 
of different types of verbs, as e.g. the verb couper 
(cut), often used as an examl)le in the literature. \[ts 
core representation would be the following: 
1, J \[ ..... , CAUSE(\[..,,~ ~ \], 
\[ ..... , ao~(x, \[~,,,,, Y \])\])\]. 
with the following values for the (:ore sense: 
a = +loc ; X = \[thing tL4RTOT(J) \] 
Y = AWAY FROMA(\[r,t ..... LOCAT'ION OF(.\])\]) 
For the metaphor: 'to cat a conversation/ a film, 
etc...', the values for the above variables become: 
A = +char, +ideal, X= \[ ..... t/,t(,~ J \] 
Y = AWAYrHOMA(\[p,.op ACTIVE(J)\]) 
where ACTIVE(,\]) is an elementary property of an 
ontology describing the status of events. A conver
sation is viewed as a flow which becomes non-active. 
A similar treatment is observed for other types of 
metaphors, with elliptic forms, such as couper l'eau/ 
IVlectricitd/les crddits, also viewed as flows. The 
property AVAII, ABLE(J) will then be used, which 
is at a comparable abstract; level in an ontology than 
ACTIVE(J). 
5 Long-distance compositionality 
The NP a good meat is related to senses 2 oz" 5, it 
therefore includes in its domain of meanings struc
tures presented in sections 3.2 and 3.4. hlstead of 
1148 
choosing one solution solution (a generate and test 
strategy), a set can be provided (as in constraint 
programming). Now, if we have an NP of the form: 
une viande bonne it consommer, then the parsing 
of consommer will provoque the selection of sense 5 
(and subsense 'fresh/consumable' via selective pro
jection) because of the type of consommer. If, con
versely, we have une viande bonne d ddguster, then, 
since ddguster is of type 'eat.enjoy' (a dotted type in 
the GL), sense 2 is selected. The space of meanings 
is restricted when additional information is found. 
A second case involves default reasoning (as in 
(eernelle 9S)). In un bon couteau pour sculpter (a 
good knife to carve), by default, the action that the 
knife performs well is that protypically found in its 
telic role. But, i\[' a less prototypical action is found 
explicitly in the sentence, then this latter is prcfered 
and incorporal.e(\[ into the semantic represcntatiolt 
instead of the default ease. Indeed, the relic role 
describes prototypical actions, since the others are 
often unpredictable. The default meaning of bon is 
kept and 'frozen' until the whole sentence has been 
parsed. If there is no contracdiction with that sense, 
then it is assigned to the adjective, otherwise, it is 
discarded in favor of the sense explicitly found in the 
sentence. 
Finally, we COllsider the ext)ressions Y makes a 
9ood X, Y is a flood X as collocations where flood is 
not fldly treated compositionally. 
6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have presented an analysis of ad
jectival modification within the GL perspective, with 
the illustration of the French adjective boa. We have 
proposed several extensions to tim "\['eli(: role to be 
able to account for l.he representation of the differ
ent forms of sense variations. In particular, we have 
shown how tyl)es can be added, and how pre(li(:ates 
from the I.clic t)articipate to the constructio,~ of the 
semantic rct)rescntal, ion of the compound noun + 
adjective. 
Coercions aim the treatment of nlel, al)hors an(I 
metonymies are generally assumed to I)e general 
principles, howew:r, they are in fact more specialized 
than they seem at. first glance (e.g. une bonne toque/ 
plume = a good cook/ writer is quite specific, or 
w:ry constrained). It is then necessary to introduce 
narrow selectional restrictions on their use. Also, 
the similarities, quite important, outlined between 
the different eases presented here and observed for 
other families of adjectives suggest, that there is a 
common typology for adjectival modification. What 
then woukl be a general formalism ? Itow nmeh arc' 
these rules subject to linguistic variation ?
