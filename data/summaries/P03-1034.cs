Other theoretical research consists, for example, of adapting existing grammatical formalisms such as TAGs (Webber and Joshi, 1998) for discourse-level phenomena.

Adding each new module typically entailed that an NLG system designer would justify not only the reason for including the new module (i.e., what linguistic phenomena it produced that had been previously unattainable) but how it was integrated into their architecture and why its placement was reasonably optimal (cf., (Elhadad et al., 1997), pp.

Like STREAK,Shaw’sCASPER system (Shaw, 1998) produces single sentences from sets of sentences and doesn’t attempt to deal with discourse markers.

The RTPI system (Harvey and Carberry, 1998) takes in sets of multiple, lexicalized sentential plans over a number of medical diagnoses from different critiquing systems and produces a single, unified sentence plan which is both coherent and cohesive.
P98-1084
In an early instance, Elhadad and McKeown (1990) followed Quirk’s pre-existing non-computational account of discourse connectives to produce single argumentative discourse markers inside a functional unification surface realizer (and thereby postponing lexicalization till the last possible moment).
C90-3018
For instance, Grote (1998) attempted to create declarative lexicons that contain applicability conditions and other constraints to aid in the process of discourse marker selection.
W98-0304
For example, the MOOSE system (Stede and Umbach, 1998; Grote and Stede, 1999) lexicalized discourse markers at the sentence planning level by pushing them directly into the lexicon.

4–7). At the same time, (Reiter, 1994) argued that implemented NLG systems were converging toward a de facto pipelined architecture (Figure 1) with minimal-to-nonexistent feedback between modules.
