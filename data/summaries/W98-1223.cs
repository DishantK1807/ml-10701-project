It might be possible that instance-based learning algoritkms (e.g., IBI-IG (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997)), which have been demonstrated to outperform IGTREE on several language tasks (Daelemans, GiIlis, and Durieux, 1994; Van den Bosch, Dacleroans, and Weijtets, 1996; Van den Bosch, 1997), perform better on the modular systems.

(Chomsky and Halle, 1968), have generally adopted the idea of abstraction levels in various guises (e.g., levels, tapes, tiers, grids) (Goldsmith, 1976; Liberman and Prince, 1977; Koskenniemi, 1984; Mohanan, 1986).

Such explicit implementations of abstraction levels can indeed be witnessed in many state-of-theart speech synthesisers, implemented as (sequential) modules (Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt, 1987; Daelemans, 1988).
