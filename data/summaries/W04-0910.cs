Thus for instance, (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Copestake et al., 2001) describes a Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) which supports the parallel construction of a phrase structure (or derived) tree and of a semantic representation and (Dalrymple, 1999) show how to equip Lexical Functional grammar (LFG) with a glue semantics.

For these or for a specific domain, basic synonymic dictionaries can be complemented using learning methods based on distributional similarity (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998).
P93-1024 P98-2127
The language chosen for semantic representation is a flat semantics along the line of (Bos, 1995; Copestake et al., 1999; Copestake et al., 2001).
P01-1019
Semantic construction proceeds from the derived tree (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003) rather than – as is more common in TAG – from the derivation tree.

While corpus driven efforts along the PARSEVAL lines (Black et al., 1991) are good at giving some measure of a grammar coverage, they are not suitable for finer grained analysis and in particular, for progress evaluation, regression testing and comparative report generation.

Similarly, (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) and (Shinyanma et al., 2002) learn sentence level paraphrase templates from a corpus of news articles stemming from different news source.
