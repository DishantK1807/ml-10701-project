Translation System For testing we used the alignment template translation system, described in Och, Tillmann, and Ney (1999).

It aimed to provide multimodel support for negotiation (Nespole! 2000; Lavie et al.2001). Table 5 summarizes the corpus statistics of the Nespole! training set.

Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Garc´ıa-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al.2001; Nießen et al.1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position.

The translation models they presented in various papers between 1988 and 1993 (Brown et al.1988; Brown et al.1990; Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer 1993) are commonly referred to as IBM models 1–5, based on the numbering in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993).

Apart from the theoretical problem of how to incorporate external dictionaries in a mathematically sound way into a statistical framework for machine translation (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Goldsmith 1993) there are also some pragmatic difficulties: As discussed in Section 2.2, one of the disadvantages of these conventional dictionaries as compared to full bilingual corpora is that their entries typically contain single words or short phrases on each language side.

For a description of the underlying approach, the reader is referred to Karlsson (1990).

The use of dictionaries to augment or replace parallel corpora has already been examined by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Goldsmith (1993) and Koehn and Knight (2001), for instance.

Phrases Some recent publications deal with the automatic detection of multiword phrases (Och and Weber 1998; Tillmann and Ney 2000).

Alternatively one can think of defining a much more general set of features and applying some method of feature selection, as has been done, for example, by Foster (2000), who compared different methods for feature selection within the task of translation modeling for statistical machine translation.
