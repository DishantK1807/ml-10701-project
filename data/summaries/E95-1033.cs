Hahn and Strube (1995)) and the interpretation of text macro structures (a preliminary study is presented in Hahn (1992)).

The most detailed description of grammatical regularities and an associated parsing procedure has been supplied by Lappin and McCord (1990).

Schacht et al.1994; Hahn et al.1994). Word actors combine objectoriented features with concurrency yielding strict lexical distribution and distributed computation in a methodologically clean way.

A particular problem we have not yet solved, the plausible ranking of single antecedents from a candidate set, is dealt with in depth by Lappin and Laess (1994) and Hajicova et al.(1992). Both define salience metrics capable of ordering alternative antecedents according to structural criteria, several of which can directly be attributed to the topological structure and topic/comment annotations of the underlying dependency trees.

Most importan't, however, is that our model incorporates the text-level of anaphora resolution, a shortcoming of the original SG approach that has recently been removed (Lappin and Leass, 1994), but still is a source of lots of problems.
J94-4002
These primitive relations can be considered declarative equivalents to the procedural specifications used in several tree-walking algorithms for anaphora resolution, e.g., by Hobbs (1978) or Ingria and Stallard (1989).

Our exposition builds on the well-known focusing mechanism (Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
