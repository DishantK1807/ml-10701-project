(Karlgren and Cutting, 1994) reports good results in a genre classification task based on a subset of these features, while (Kessler et al., 1997) show that a prudent selection of cues based on words, characters, and ratios can perform at least equally well.

(Lewis, 1992; Yang and Pedersen, 1997) indicate that for good content classification, we basically need a vector which contains the most relevant words of the text.
H92-1041
e.g. (Klavans and Kan, 1998)), which should therefore only be undertaken for corpora with both well-defined and well-represented genres, where inherently fuzzy class boundaries are less likely to counteract the effect of careful feature selection.
P98-1112
In their paper on genre categorization, (Kessler et al., 1997) take a somewhat different approach.
