Second, the automatic approach, in which the model is automatically obtained from corpora (either raw or annotated) 1, and consists of n-grams (Garside et al., 1987; Cutting et ah, 1992), rules (Hindle, 1989) or neural nets (Schmid, 1994).

The language models more commonly used are based on two main approaches: first, the linguistic approach, in which the model is written by a linguist, generally in the form of rules or constraints (Voutilainen and Jgrvinen, 1995).

Aha et al., 1991) to genetic algorithm strategies (Losee, 1994), through the transformation-based error-driven algorithm used in (Brill, 1995), Still another possibility are the hybrid models, which try to join the advantages of both approaches (Voutilainen and Padr6, 1997).

The more similar conditions reported in previous work are those experiments performed on the WSJ corpus: (Brill, 1992) reports 3-4% error rate, and (Daelemans et al., 1996) report 96.7% accuracy.

Decision trees, recently used in NLP basic tasks such as tagging and parsing (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995: Daelemans et al., 1996; Magerman, 1996), are suitable for performing this task.

The high level data trend acquires more sophisticated information, such as context rules, constraints, or decision trees (Daelemans et al., 1996; M/~rquez and Rodriguez, 1995; Samuelsson et al., 1996).
