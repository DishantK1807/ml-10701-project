For instance, Marcus \[1987\] complained that most generators don't really choose words at all; McDonald \[1991\], amongst others, lamented that lexical choice has attracted only very little attention in the research community.

Style has also been investigated from a linguistic perspective (e.g., Sanders \[1973\]), and recently a computational treatment has been proposed by DiMarco and Hirst \[1993\].

Such subtle semantic distinctions demand a fine-grained knowledge representation if a generator is expected to make these choices \[DiMarco et ai., 1993\].

Nirenburg and Nirenburg \[1988\] give this example to illustrate the lexical choice problem: If we want to express the meaning "a person whose sex is male and whose age is between 13 and 15 years", then candidate realizations include: boy, kid, teenager, youth, child, young man, schoolboy, adolescent, man.

Wanner and Bateman \[1990\] viewed lexical choice from a situationdependent perspective: the various aspects of the message to be expressed by the generator can have different degrees of salience, which may give rise to certain thematizations and also influence lexical choice.

Besides, ultimately the work on lexical style has to be integrated with efforts on syntactic style \[DiMarco and Hirst, 1993\].
