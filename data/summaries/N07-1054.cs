M&E Framework We model two RSRs, Cause and Contrast, adopting the de nitions of Marcu and Echihabi (2002) (henceforth M&E) for their Cause-ExplanationEvidence and Contrast relations, respectively.
P02-1047
We adopt the approach of Marcu and Echihabi (2002), using a small set of patterns to build relation models, and extend their work by re ning the training and classi cation process using parameter optimization, topic segmentation and syntactic parsing.
P02-1047
We use the Collins parser (Collins, 1996) to parse 400,000 instances each of Cause and Contrast for our nal results.
P96-1025
We draw on and extend the work of Marcu and Echihabi (2002).
P02-1047
Marcu and Echihabi (2002) use a pattern-based approach in mining instances of RSRs such as Contrast and Elaboration from large, unannotated corpora.
P02-1047
Marcu and Echihabi (2002) lter training instances based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags, and Soricut and Marcu (2003) use syntactic features to identify sentence-internal RST structure.
N03-1030 P02-1047
Lapata and Lascarides (2004) focus their work syntactically, analyzing temporal links between main and subordinate clauses.
N04-1020
Other work uses human-annotated corpora, such as the RST Bank (Carlson et al., 2001), used by Soricut and Marcu (2003), the GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), used by Wellner et al.(2006), or adhoc annotations, used by (Girju, 2003; Baldridge and Lascarides, 2005).

We use an automatic topic segmentation tool, LCSeg (Galley et al., 2003) setting parameters so that the derived segments are of the approximate desired length.
P03-1071
In the Cause versus Contrast case, their reported performance exceeds ours signi cantly; however, in a subset of their experiments which test Cause versus Contrast on instances from the human annotated RSTBank corpus (Carlson et al., 2001) where no cue phrase is present, they report only 63% accuracy over a 56% baseline (the baseline is > 50% because the number of input examples is unbalanced).
W01-1605
While there are a number of different relation taxonomies (Hobbs, 1979; McKeown, 1985; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Martin, 1992; Knott and Sanders, 1998), many researchers have found that, despite small differences, these theories have wide agreement in terms of the core phenomena for which they account (Hovy and Maier, 1993; Moser and Moore, 1996).
