Cheng et al.(2005) used a root finder to divide one sentence into two parts by the root word and parsed them separately.

Chang et al.(2006) applied a pipeline framework in their dependency parser to make the local predictions more robust.

After analyzing the dependency structure of sentences in Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (Xue et al., 2002), we found an interesting phenomenon: if we define a main-root as the head of a sentence, and define a subsentence as a sequence of words separated by punctuations, and the head1 of these words is the child of mainroot or main-root itself, then the punctuations that depend on main-root can be a separator of sub-sentences.

To transfer the phrase structure into dependency structure, head rules are defined based on Xia’s head percolation table (Xia and Palmer, 2001).

Recently, as an attractive alternative to probabilistic parsing, deterministic parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004) has drawn great attention with its high efficiency, simplicity and good accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art generative probabilistic models.

The basic idea of deterministic parsing is using a greedy parsing algorithm that approximates a globally optimal solution by making a sequence of locally optimal choices (Hall et al., 2006).
