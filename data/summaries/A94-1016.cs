Instead, we are planning to use an English language model on the output, in a manner similar to that done by speech and statistical translation systems (Brown et al., 1990).

MULTI-ENGINE OUTPUT In our experiment we used three MT engines: * a knowledge-based MT (KBMT) system, the mainline Pangloss engine (Frederking et al., 1993b); • an example-based MT (EBMT) system (see (Nirenburg et al., 1993; Nirenburg et al., 1994b); the original idea is due to Nagao (Nagao, 1984)); and • a lexical transfer system, fortified with morphological analysis and synthesis modules and relying on a number of databases -a machine-readable dictionary (the Collins Spanish/English), the lexicons used by the KBMT modules, a large set of user-generated bilingual glossaries as well as a gazetteer and a list of proper and organization names.
