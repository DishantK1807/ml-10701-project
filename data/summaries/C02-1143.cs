In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).

The maximum entropy system performed competitively with the best systems on the English verbs in SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 (Dang and Palmer, 2002).

We used a maximummatching algorithm and a dictionary compiled from the CTB (Sproat et al., 1996; Xue, 2001) to do segmentation, and trained a maximum entropy part-ofspeech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and TAG-based parser (Bikel and Chiang, 2000) on the CTB to do tagging and parsing.4 Then the same feature extraction and model-training was done for the PDN corpus as for the CTB.

In addition, an automatic named entity tagger (Bikel et al., 1997) was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes.

Under the maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996), evidence from different features can be combined with no assumptions of feature independence.

Several efforts have been made to develop automatic WSD systems that can provide accurate sense tagging (Ide and Veronis, 1998), with a current emphasis on creating manually sense-tagged data for supervised training of statistical WSD systems, as evidenced by SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001).
