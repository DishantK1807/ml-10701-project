'\['here are three main approaches in tagging problem: rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons 1%3; Brodda 1982; Paulussen and Martin 1992; Brill et al.1990), statistical approach (Church :1988; Merialdo 1994; Foster 1991; Weischedel et al.1993; Kupiec 1992) and connectionist approach (Benello et al.1989; Nakanmra et al.1989). In these approaches, statistical approach has the following advantages : • a theoretical framework is provided • automatic learning facility is provided • the probabilities provide a straightforward way to disambiguate Many information sources must be combined to solve tagging problem with statistical approach.
