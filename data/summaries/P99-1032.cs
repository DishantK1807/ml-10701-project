Two disjoint corpora are used in steps 2 and 5, both consisting of complete articles taken from the Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).

In the method we use for developing classifters (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), a search is performed to find a probability model that captures important interdependencies among features.

This paper presents a case study of analyzing and improving intercoder reliability in discourse tagging using the statistical techniques presented in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1998; Bruce and Wiebe, to appear).

Learning Results Recently, there have been many successful applications of machine learning to discourse processing, such as (Litman, 1996; Samuel et al., 1998).

We perform a statistical analysis that provides information that complements the information provided by Cohen's Kappa (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996).

These questions are particularly important in news reporting, in which segments presenting opinions and verbal reactions are mixed with segments presenting objective fact (van Dijk, 1988; Kan et al., 1998).

In this work, model fit is reported in terms of the likelihood ratio statistic, G 2, and its significance (Read and Cressie, 1988; Dunning, 1993).

are many other features to investigate in future work, such as features based on tags assigned to previous utterances (see, e.g., (Wiebe et al., 1997; Samuel et al., 1998)), and features based on semantic classes, such as positive and negative polarity adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) and reporting verbs (Bergler, 1992).

The average pairwise percentage agreement between D, J, and M and the bias-corrected tags in the entire data set is 89.5%, while the system's percentage agreement with the bias-corrected tags (i.e., its accuracy) is 72.17%. aThe per-class enumerated feature representation from (Wiebe et ai., 1998) is used, with 60% as the conditional independence cutoff threshold.

For example, sen1 The category specifications in the coding manual axe based on our previous work on tracking point of view (Wiebe, 1994), which builds on Banfield's (1982) linguistic theory of subjectivity.
