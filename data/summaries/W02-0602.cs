Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) have developed a system that learns such rules given a preliminary morphological hypothesis and part of speech tags.

A similar MDL approach is described by Goldsmith (2001).

Our probability model differs slightly from that of Snover and Brent (2001), but the main difference is in the search technique.
P01-1063
Gaussier (1999) describes an explicitly probabilistic system that is based primarily on spellings.
W99-0904
Using latent semantic analysis, Schone and Jurafsky (2000) have previously demonstrated the success of using semantic information in morphological analysis.
W00-0712
The results obtained from Directed Search algorithm can be significantly improved by incorporating the hill climbing search detailed in Snover and Brent (2001).
P01-1063
We compared our directed search system, which consists of the probability model described in Section 2 and the directed search described in Section 3 with Goldsmithâ€™s MDL algorithm, otherwise known as Linguistica1 and our previous system (2001), which shall henceforth be referred to as the Hill Climbing Search system.

We previously, Snover and Brent (2001), presented a very conservative unsupervised system, July 2002, pp.
P01-1063
The distribution is based on a seven-model model for the generation of hypothesis, which is heavily based upon the probability model presented in Snover and Brent (2001), with steps 1-3 of the generative procedure being the same.
