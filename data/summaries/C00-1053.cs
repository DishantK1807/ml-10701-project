~ Commands Figure 1 Modular architecture (Johnston 1998a) As an example of a multimodal command, in order to reposition an object, a user might say 'move this here' and make two gestures on the display.

Johnston 1998a proposes a modular approach to multimodal language processing in which spoken language parsing is completed before lnultimodal parsing.

1 Unification-based nmltimodal parsing Johnston 1998a presents an approach to language processing for multimodal systems in which multimodal integration strategies are specified declaratively in a unification-based grammar formalism.

The constraints that drive parsing are 363 specific to the combining elements and there is not the same general means for predictive parsing (Johnston 1998a).

While the modularity of spoken language processing and multimodal parsing in Johnston 1998a has many advantages, the assumption that all processing of the spoken string takes place before multimodal integration leads to significant difficulties as the spoken language processing component is expanded to handle more complex language and to provide a compositional analysis of spoken language containing deictics.

Johnston 1998a proposes a modular approach in which the individual modes are parsed and assigned typed feature structures representing their combinatory properties and semantic content.

The complexity of the inultidilnensional parsing algorithm is exponential in the worst case (Johnston 1998a) and so it is important to limit the number of elements that need to be considered.

Conclusion I have proposed an approach to nmltimodal language processing in which spoken language parsing and nmltimodal parsing are more tightly coupled than in the modular pipeliued approach taken in Johnston 1998.
