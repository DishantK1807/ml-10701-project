In recent years work on a number of languages other than English, the renewed interest in nontransformational grammars, and the taking into account of the experience in parsing have influenced the appearance of new linguistic theories, such as lexical-functional grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar and Pullum 1982), functional unification grammar (FUG) (Kay 1979), definite clause grammar (DCG) (Pereira and Warren 1980), and tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Levy 1982).

Worth mentioning here are Church and Patil (1982) and Barton et al.(1987), who attempt to put some order in the chaos of complexity and computational load.

Parsing goes basically bottom-up, with top-down confirmation, with an improvement of the so-called left corner technique, a version of which is referred to in Wiren (1987).

A particularly interesting aspect is that the system had also a twin generator, called PHRED (Jacobs 1985), that reversed the process, as both are based on the same linguistic representation.

Wiren (1987) compares a number of proposals.

A recent work on idioms with a similar perspective and with particular attention to the problem of learning idioms is Dyer and Zernik (1986).

Given the present tendency to emphasize the reducibility of natural language to tractable formal languages (see, for instance, Joshi and Levy 1982), and the high level of ambiguity typical of natural language, this is a fairly natural choice.
