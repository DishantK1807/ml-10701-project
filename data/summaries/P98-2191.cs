However, since this work requires a great deal of labor and it is difficult to keep description of dictionaries consistent, the researches of automatical dictionaries making for machine translation (translation rules) from corpora become active recently (Kay and RSschesen, 1993; Kaji and Aizono, 1996).

This algorithm is called the Basic Feature Selection (Berger et al., 1996).

can be solved by one of the numerical algorithm called the Improved Iteratire Scaling Algorithm (Berger et al., 1996).

Therefore, estimating a natural language model based on the maximum entropy (ME) method (Pietra et al., 1995; Berger et al., 1996) has been highlighted recently.
