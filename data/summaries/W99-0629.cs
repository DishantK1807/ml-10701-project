In recent work Daelemans et al.(1999b) have shown that for typical natural language processing tasks, this approach is at an advantage because it also "remembers" exceptional, low-frequency cases which are useful to extrapolate from.

Note however that Argamon et al.(1998) do not identify the head of subjects, subjects in embedded clauses, or subjects and objects related to the verb only through a trace, which makes their task easier.

+0.7%). Argamon et al.(1998) report FZ=i for subject and object identification of respectively 86.5% and 83.0%, compared to 81.8% and 81.0% in this paper.

Moreover, automatic feature weighting in the similarity metric of an MB learner makes the approach well-suited for domains with large numbers of features from heterogeneous sources, as it embodies a smoothing-by-similarity method when data is sparse (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997).

Several MB modules have been developed in previous work, such as: a POS tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996), a chunker (Veenstra, 1998; Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) and a grammatical relation (GR) assigner (Buchholz, 1998).

The data for all our experiments was extracted from the Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).

Argamon et al.(1998) applied Memory-Based Sequence Learning (MBSL) to NP chunking and subject/object identification.

(Collins, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1997) use cascaded processing for full parsing with good results.

The very first stage consists of a MemoryBased Part-of-Speech Tagger (MBT) for which we refer to (Daelemans et al., 1996).

Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) first assigned a chunk tag to each word in the sentence: I for inside a chunk, O for outside a chunk, and 240 type precision B tbr inside a chunk, but tile preceding word is in another chunk.

Brants and Skut (1998) describe a partially automated annotation tool which constructs a complete parse of a sentence by recursively adding levels to the tree.
