For example, it has been shown (Lee, 2004) that determiner segmentation and deletion in Arabic sentences in an Arabic-to-English translation system improves sentence alignment, thus leading to improved overall translation quality.

For example, (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2004) showed that factored language models, which consider morphological features and use an optimized backoff policy, yield lower perplexity.

The framework suggested here is most closely related to (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006), which uses a probabilistic model to generate Japanese case markers for English-to-Japanese MT.

The sentence pairs were word-aligned using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and submitted to a treelet-based MT system (Quirk et al., 2005), which uses the word dependency structure of the source language and projects word dependency structure to the target language, creating the structure shown in Figure 1 above.

Ideally, the best word analysis should be provided as a result of contextual disambiguation (e.g., (Habash and Rambow, 2005)); we leave this for future work.

Another work (Koehn and Knight, 2003) showed improvements by splitting compounds in German.

More recently, (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005) achieved improvements in Czech-English MT, optimizing a 129 Features Russian Arabic Both POS (11 categories) (18 categories) Person 1,2,3 Number dual sing(ular), pl(ural) Gender neut(er) masc(uline), fem(inine) Tense gerund present, past, future, imperative Mood subjunctive, jussive Case dat(ive), prep(ositional), nom(inative), acc(usative), gen(itive) instr(umental) Negation yes, no Determiner yes, no Conjunction wa, fa, none Preposition bi, ka, li, none ObjectPronoun yes, no Pers/Numb/Gend of pronoun, none PossessivePronoun Same as ObjectPronoun Table 1: Morphological features used for Russian and Arabic set of possible source transformations, incorporating morphology.

This work can be viewed as a generalization of (Suzuki and Toutanova, 2006) in that our model generates inflected forms of words, and is not limited to generating a small, closed set of case markers.

The algorithm is similar to the one described in (Toutanova, 2006).
