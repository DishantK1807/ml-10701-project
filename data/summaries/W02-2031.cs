The other system, proposed by (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Yamada et al., 2001), uses the ”dynamic features”.
W00-1303
Compared to the previous systems (van Halteren et al., 1998; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Yamada et al., 2001), our system is: (i) employing more than two levels stacking, (ii) using only one algorithm and training only one learner at each level, (iii) using the surrounding tag given by the lower level learner.
