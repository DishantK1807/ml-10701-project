Previous corpus-based sense disambiguation methods require substantial amounts of sense-tagged training data (Kelly and Stone, 1975; Black, 1988 and Hearst, 1991) or aligned bilingual corpora (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan, 1991 and Gale et al.1992). Yarowsky (1992) introduces a thesaurus-based approach to statistical sense disambiguation which works on monolingual corpora without the need for sense-tagged training data.

On the other hand, the thesaurus-based method of Yarowsky (1992) may suffer from loss of information (since it is semi-class-based) as well as data sparseness (since H Classes used in Resnik (1992) are based on the WordNet taxonomy while classes of Brown et al.(1992) and Pereira et al.(1993) are derived from statistical data collected from corpora.

Like the thesaurusbased approach of Yarowsky (1992), our approach relies on the dilution of this noise by their distribution through all the 1792 defining concepts.

For some of the words, more than one sense listed in LDOCE corresponds to a sense as used in Yarowsky (1992).

Our system is tested on the twelve words discussed in Yarowsky (1992) and previous publications on sense disambiguation.

In the similaritybased approaches (Dagan et al., 1993 & 1994; Grishman et al., 1993), rather than a class, each word is modelled by its own set of similar words derived from statistical data collected from corpora.

187 such as that described in Yarowsky (1992) are very unlikely to be capable of acquiring this finer knowledge because the problem of data sparseness becomes even more serious with the introduction of syntactic constraints.

However, fully automatic lexically based approaches 3 Hatzivassiloglou (1994) shows that the introduction of linguistic cues improves the performance of a statistical semantic knowledge acquisition system in the context of word grouping.

Dagan et al.(1993) argue that using a relatively small number of classes to model the similarity between words may lead to substantial loss of information.

average sentence length in the Brown corpus is 19.41Â° words which is 5 times smaller than the 100 word window used in Gale et al.(1992) and Yarowsky (1992).

The class-based approaches (Brown et al., 1992; Resnik, 1992; Pereira et al., 1993) calculate co-occurrence data of words belonging to different classes,~ rather than individual words, to enhance the co-occurrence data collected and to cover words which have low occurrence frequencies.
