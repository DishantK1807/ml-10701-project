We introduced a different type of constraint, graded conslraints, inspired by the concept of graded unification discussed it, (Kim, 1994).
P94-1044
Processing and Disambiguation Context-based ranking of ambiguities is performed by the plan-based discourse processor described in (Rosd et aL., 1995) which is based on (Lambert and Carberry, 1992; Lambert, 1993).
P92-1025
First, most plan-based or finite state automaton based discourse processors (Allen and Schubert, 1991; Smith, Hipp, and Biermann, 1995; Lambert, 1993; Reithinger and Maim:, 1995), including tile one we initially developed (l~.osd et al., 1995), only take one semantic representation as input at a time: thus, we had to extend the discourse processor so thai; it can handle multiple hypotheses as input.
