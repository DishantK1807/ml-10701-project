The system is trained by #0Crst using the Collins parser #28Collins, 1997#29 to parse the 36,995 training sentences, matching annotated frame elements to parse constituents, and extracting various features from the string of words and the parse tree.

Our statistical algorithms are trained on a hand-labeled dataset: the FrameNet database #28Baker et al., 1998#29.

More recently, a domain independent system has been trained on general function tags such as Manner and Temporal by Blaheta and Charniak #282000#29.
