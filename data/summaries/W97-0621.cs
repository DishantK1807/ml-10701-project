initiative The primary facility needed for variable initiative is the ability either to control the movements between subgoals (dialogue segments) or to release control and to follow the user's movements (Guinn, 1995; Kitano and Ess-Dykema, 1991; Novick, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990).

Mechanisms for both managing movement between subgoals and deciding when to release control to the other participant, including extensive analyses of their effectiveness, are given in (Smith and Hipp, 1994; Guinn, 1995; Guinn, 1996).

edu 1 A Theory of Dialogue The central mechanism of a dialogue system must be a planner (Allen et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1995; Young et al., 1989) that seeks the dialogue goal and organizes all behaviors for that purpose.

This is called plan recognition in the literature and has been the object of much study (Allen and Perrault, 1980; Litman and Allen, 1987; Pollack, 1986; Carberry, 1988; Carberry, 1990).

The missing axiom discovery mechanism simply selects subdialogues for interaction at the levels in the proof tree where the user has knowledge and these levels are where the interaction occurs (Smith et al., 1995).
