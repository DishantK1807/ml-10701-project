For English, a number of methods have been proposed to cope with real-word errors in spelling correction (Golding, 1995; Golding and Roth, 1996; Golding and Schabes, 1993; Tong and Evans, 1996).

For unknown words, P(wilUnknown word) is computed by using the unknown word model in (Nagata, 1996).

The existing approach for correcting the spelling error in the languages that have no word boundary assumes that all substrings in input sentence are error strings, and then tries to correct them (Nagata, 1996).

Following previous works (Golding, 1995; Meknavin et al., 1997), we have tried two types of features: context words and collocations.

One method to do OCR error correction using the above model is to hypothesize all substrings in the input sentence as words (Nagata, 1996).

The candidate generation routine uses a modification of the standard edit distance and employs the error-tolerant finite-state recognition algorithm (Oflazer, 1996) to generate candidate words.
