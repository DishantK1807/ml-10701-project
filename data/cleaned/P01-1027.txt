de Los Naranjos, s/n 46071 Valencia, Spain fcn@iti.upv.es Abstract Typically, the lexicon models used in statistical machine translation systems do not include any kind of linguistic or contextual information, which often leads to problems in performing a correct word sense disambiguation.
One way to deal with this problem within the statistical framework is to use maximum entropy methods.
In this paper, we present how to use this type of information within a statistical machine translation system.
We show that it is possible to significantly decrease training and test corpus perplexity of the translation models.
In addition, we perform a rescoring of a2 -Best lists using our maximum entropy model and thereby yield an improvement in translation quality.
Experimental results are presented on the so-called “Verbmobil Task”.
1 Introduction
Typically, the lexicon models used in statistical machine translation systems are only single-word based, that is one word in the source language corresponds to only one word in the target language.
Those lexicon models lack from context information that can be extracted from the same parallel corpus.
This additional information could be: a3 Simple context information: information of the words surrounding the word pair; a3 Syntactic information: part-of-speech information, syntactic constituent, sentence mood; a3 Semantic information: disambiguation information (e.g.
from WordNet), current/previous speech or dialog act.
To include this additional information within the statistical framework we use the maximum entropy approach.
This approach has been applied in natural language processing to a variety of tasks.
(Berger et al., 1996) applies this approach to the so-called IBM Candide system to build context dependent models, compute automatic sentence splitting and to improve word reordering in translation.
Similar techniques are used in (Papineni et al., 1996; Papineni et al., 1998) for socalled direct translation models instead of those proposed in (Brown et al., 1993).
(Foster, 2000) describes two methods for incorporating information about the relative position of bilingual word pairs into a maximum entropy translation model.
Other authors have applied this approach to language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1996; Martin et al., 1999; Peters and Klakow, 1999).
A short review of the maximum entropy approach is outlined in Section 3.
2 Statistical
Machine Translation The goal of the translation process in statistical machine translation can be formulated as follows: A source language string a4a6a5a7a9a8 a4 a7a6a10a11a10a11a10 a4 a5is to be translated into a target language string a12a14a13 a7 a8 a12 a7a6a10a11a10a11a10 a12 a13. In the experiments reported in this paper, the source language is German and the target language is English.
Every target string is considered as a possible translation for the input.
If we assign a probability a15a17a16a19a18 a12 a13a7a21a20a4a6a5a7a23a22 to each pair of strings a18 a12a14a13a7a25a24 a4 a5a7 a22, then according to Bayes’ decision rule, we have to choose the target string that maximizes the product of the target language model a15a17a16a19a18 a12a14a13a7 a22 and the string translation model a15a17a16a19a18a26a4a6a5 a7 a20 a12 a13 a7 a22 . Many existing systems for statistical machine translation (Berger et al., 1994; Wang and Waibel, 1997; Tillmann et al., 1997; Nießen et al., 1998) make use of a special way of structuring the string translation model like proposed by (Brown et al., 1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target string is described by alignments that assign one target word position to each source word position.
The lexicon probability a27a28a18a26a4 a20a12 a22 of a certain target word a12 to occur in the target string is assumed to depend basically only on the source word a4 aligned to it.
These alignment models are similar to the concept of Hidden Markov models (HMM) in speech recognition.
The alignment mapping is a29a31a30 a32 a8a34a33a21a35 from source position a29 to target position a32 a8a36a33a37a35 . The alignment a33 a5 a7 may contain alignments a33a37a35a38a8a40a39 with the ‘empty’ word a12a14a41 to account for source words that are not aligned to any target word.
In (statistical) alignment models a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5 a7a28a24 a33 a5 a7 a20 a12a25a13 a7 a22, the alignment a33 a5 a7 is introduced as a hidden variable.
Typically, the search is performed using the socalled maximum approximation: a42 a12 a13 a7 a8 a43a37a44a46a45a48a47a49a43a21a50 a51a53a52a54 a55 a15a17a16a19a18 a12 a13 a7 a22a57a56a21a58a60a59a62a61 a54 a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5 a7 a24 a33 a5 a7 a20 a12 a13 a7 a22a14a63 a8 a43a37a44a46a45a48a47a49a43a21a50 a51 a52a54 a55 a15a17a16a19a18 a12 a13 a7 a22a57a56 a47a64a43a21a50 a59 a61 a54 a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5 a7 a24 a33 a5 a7 a20 a12 a13 a7 a22a14a63 The search space consists of the set of all possible target language strings a12a25a13a7 and all possible alignments a33 a5 a7 . The overall architecture of the statistical translation approach is depicted in Figure 1.
3 Maximum
entropy modeling The translation probability a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5a7 a24 a33 a5a7 a20a12a25a13a7 a22 can be rewritten as follows: a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5 a7 a24 a33 a5 a7a65a20 a12 a13 a7a66a22 a8 a5a67 a35a69a68 a7 a15a70a16a71a18a26a4 a35 a24 a33a21a35 a20 a4 a35a11a72 a7 a7 a24 a33 a35a25a72 a7 a7 a24 a12 a13 a7a66a22 a8 a5a67 a35a69a68 a7a48a73 a15a17a16a19a18 a33a21a35 a20 a4 a35a11a72 a7 a7 a24 a33 a35a25a72 a7 a7 a24 a12 a13 a7 a22a74a56 a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a35 a20 a4 a35a25a72 a7 a7 a24 a33 a35 a7 a24 a12 a13 a7 a22a53a75 Source Language Text Transformation Lexicon Model Language Model Global Search: Target Language Text over Pr(f 1 J |e 1 I ) Pr( e1I ) Pr(f1 J |e1I ) Pr( e1I ) e1I f1 J maximize Alignment Model Transformation Figure 1: Architecture of the translation approach based on Bayes’ decision rule.
Typically, the probability a15a70a16a71a18a26a4 a35 a20a4 a35a11a72 a7 a7 a24 a33 a35 a7 a24 a12a14a13 a7 a22 is approximated by a lexicon model a27a28a18a26a4 a35 a20a12 a59a77a76 a22 by dropping the dependencies on a4 a35a11a72 a7 a7, a33 a35a25a72 a7 a7, and a12 a13 a7 . Obviously, this simplification is not true for a lot of natural language phenomena.
The straightforward approach to include more dependencies in the lexicon model would be to add additional dependencies(e.g.
a27a74a18a26a4 a35 a20a12 a59a53a76 a24 a12 a59a77a76a46a78 a54 a22 ).
This approach would yield a significant data sparseness problem.
Here, the role of maximum entropy (ME) is to build a stochastic model that efficiently takes a larger context into account.
In the following, we will use a27a74a18a26a4 a20a79a80a22 to denote the probability that the ME model assigns to a4 in the context a79 in order to distinguish this model from the basic lexicon model a27a28a18a26a4 a20a12 a22 . In the maximum entropy approach we describe all properties that we feel are useful by so-called feature functions a81a28a18 a79 a24 a4 a22 . For example, if we want to model the existence or absence of a specific word a12a11a82 in the context of an English word a12 which has the translation a4 we can express this dependency using the following feature function: a81 a51a84a83a66a85a86a51a77a85 a18 a79 a24 a4 a22 a8 a55a88a87 if a4 a8 a4 a82 and a12 a82a90a89 a79 a39 otherwise (1) The ME principle suggests that the optimal parametric form of a model a27a28a18a26a4 a20a79a90a22 taking into account only the feature functions a81a92a91 a24a94a93 a8 a87 a24 a10a11a10a11a10 a24a46a95 is given by: a27a28a18a26a4 a20a79a80a22 a8 a87 a96 a18 a79a90a22a28a97 a50a99a98 a73a101a100 a58 a91 a68 a7a99a102 a91a103a81a92a91a99a18 a79 a24 a4 a22a53a75 Here a96 a18 a79a80a22 is a normalization factor.
The resulting model has an exponential form with free parameters a102 a91 a24a94a93 a8 a87 a24 a10a11a10a11a10 a24a46a95 . The parameter values which maximize the likelihood for a given training corpus can be computed with the socalled GIS algorithm (general iterative scaling) or its improved version IIS (Pietra et al., 1997; Berger et al., 1996).
It is important to notice that we will have to obtain one ME model for each target word observed in the training data.
4 Contextual
information and training events In order to train the ME modela27 a51 a18a26a4 a20a79a80a22 associated to a target word a12, we need to construct a corresponding training sample from the whole bilingual corpus depending on the contextual information that we want to use.
To construct this sample, we need to know the word-to-word alignment between each sentence pair within the corpus.
That is obtained using the Viterbi alignment provided by a translation model as described in (Brown et al., 1993).
Specifically, we use the Viterbi alignment that was produced by Model 5.
We use the program GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000b; Och and Ney, 2000a), which is an extension of the training program available in EGYPT (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).
Berger et al.(1996) use the words that surround a specific word pair a18 a12 a24 a4 a22 as contextual information.
The authors propose as context the 3 words to the left and the 3 words to the right of the target word.
In this work we use the following contextual information: a3 Target context: As in (Berger et al., 1996) we consider a window of 3 words to the left and to the right of the target word considered.
a3 Source context: In addition, we consider a window of 3 words to the left of the source word a4 which is connected to a12 according to the Viterbi alignment.
a3 Word classes: Instead of using a dependency on the word identity we include also a dependency on word classes.
By doing this, we improve the generalization of the models and include some semantic and syntactic information with.
The word classes are computed automatically using another statistical training procedure (Och, 1999) which often produces word classes including words with the same semantic meaning in the same class.
A training event, for a specific target word a12, is composed by three items: a3 The source word a4 aligned to a12 . a3 The context in which the aligned pair a18 a12 a24 a4 a22 appears.
a3 The number of occurrences of the event in the training corpus.
Table 1 shows some examples of training events for the target word “which”.
5 Features
Once we have a set of training events for each target word we need to describe our feature functions.
We do this by first specifying a large pool of possible features and then by selecting a subset of “good” features from this pool.
5.1 Features
definition All the features we consider form a triple (a27a65a104a103a105 a24 label-1a24 label-2) where: a3 pos: is the position that label-2 has in a specific context.
a3 label-1: is the source word a4 of the aligned word pair a18 a12 a24 a4 a22 or the word class of the source word a4 (a106a107a18a26a4 a22 ).
a3 label-2: is one word of the aligned word pair a18 a12 a24 a4 a22 or the word class to which these words belong (a106a107a18a26a4 a22 a24a109a108 a18 a12 a22 ).
Using this notation and given a context a79 : a79 a8 a12a11a110 a72a92a111 a10a112a10a112a10 a12a25a110 a10a112a10a112a10 a12a25a110a114a113 a111 a4 a35a25a72a92a111 a10a112a10a112a10 a4 a35 Table 1: Some training events for the English word “which”.
The symbol “ ” is the placeholder of the English word “which” in the English context.
In the German part the placeholder (“ ”) corresponds to the word aligned to “which”, in the first example the German word “die”, the word “das” in the second and the word “was” in the third.
The considered English and German contexts are separated by the double bar “a20a112a20”.The last number in the rightmost position is the number of occurrences of the event in the whole corpus.

(a39 a24 a4 a35 a24 ) 2.
(a125 a87 a24 a4 a35 a24 a12 a82 ) and a12 a82 a8 a12a11a110a114a126 a7 3.

(a125 a87 a24 a106a132a18a26a4 a35 a22 a24a109a108 a18 a12 a82 a22 ) and a12 a82 a8 a12 a110a114a126 a7 5.
(a125a17a127 a24 a106a132a18a26a4 a35 a22 a24a109a108 a18 a12a11a82 a22 ) and a12a11a82 a89a133a129 a12a11a110 a72a92a111 a10a112a10a112a10a12a25a110a112a113 a111a103a131 6.

(a134 a87 a24 a106a132a18a26a4 a35 a22 a24 a106a107a18a26a4 a82 a22 ) and a4 a82 a8 a4 a35a11a72 a7 9.
(a134a135a127 a24 a106a132a18a26a4 a35 a22 a24 a106a107a18a26a4 a82 a22 ) and a4 a82a128a89a136a129 a4 a35a25a72a92a111 a10a112a10a4 a35a11a72 a7 a131 Category 1 features depend only on the source word a4 a35 and the target word a12a25a110 . A ME model that uses only those, predicts each source translation a4 a35 with the probability a137a27 a51 a18a26a4 a35 a22 determined by the empirical data.
This is exactly the standard lexicon probability a27a28a18a26a4 a20a12 a22 employed in the translation model described in (Brown et al., 1993) and in Section 2.
Category 2 describes features which depend in addition on the word a12 a82 one position to the left or to the right of a12a25a110 . The same explanation is valid for category 3 but in this case a12 a82 could appears in any position of the context a79 . Categories 4 and 5 are the analogous categories to 2 and 3 using word classes instead of words.
In the categories 6, 7, 8 and 9 the source context is used instead of the target context.
Table 2 gives an overview of the different feature categories.
Examples of specific features and their respective category are shown in Table 3.
Table 3: The 10 most important features and their respective category and a102 values for the English word “which”.

In order to reduce the number of features we perform a threshold based feature selection, that is every feature which occurs less than a138 times is not used.
The aim of the feature selection is two-fold.
Firstly, we obtain smaller models by using less features, and secondly, we hope to avoid overfitting on the training data.
In order to obtain the threshold a138 we compare the test corpus perplexity for various thresholds.
The different threshold used in the experiments range from 0 to 512.
The threshold is used as a cut-off for the number of occurrences that a specific feature must appear.
So a cut-off of 0 means that all features observed in the training data are used.
A cut-off of 32 means those features that appear 32 times or more are considered to train the maximum entropy models.
We select the English words that appear at least 150 times in the training sample which are in total 348 of the 4673 words contained in the English vocabulary.
Table 4 shows the different number of features considered for the 348 English words selected using different thresholds.
In choosing a reasonable threshold we have to balance the number of features and observed perplexity.
Table 4: Number of features used according to different cut-off threshold.
In the second column of the table are shown the number of features used when only the English context is considered.
The third column correspond to English, German and Word-Classes contexts.

The task is difficult because it consists of spontaneous speech and the syntactic structures of the sentences are less restricted and highly variable.
For the rescoring experiments we use the corpus described in Table 5.
Table 5: Corpus characteristics for translation task.

LM) (40.3) 28.8 To train the maximum entropy models we used the “Ristad ME Toolkit” described in (Ristad, 1997).
We performed 100 iteration of the Improved Iterative Scaling algorithm (Pietra et al., 1997) using the corpus described in Table 6, Table 6: Corpus characteristics for perplexity quality experiments.

6.2 Training
and test perplexities In order to compute the training and test perplexities, we split the whole aligned training corpus in two parts as shown in Table 6.
The training and test perplexities are shown in Table 7.
As expected, the perplexity reduction in the test corpus is lower than in the training corpus, but in both cases better perplexities are obtained using the ME models.
The best value is obtained when a threshold of 4 is used.
We expected to observe strong overfitting effects when a too small cut-off for features gets used.
Yet, for most words the best test corpus perplexity is observed when we use all features including those that occur only once.
Table 7: Training and Test perplexities using different contextual information and different thresholds a138 . The reference perplexities obtained with the basic translation model 5 are TrainPP = 10.38 and TestPP = 13.22.

This algorithm take as input the standard lexicon model (not using maximum entropy) and the 348 models obtained with the ME training.
For an hypothesis sentence a12 a13a7 and a corresponding alignment a33 a5a7 the algorithm modifies the score a15a17a16a19a18a26a4 a5a7a28a24 a33 a5a7 a20a12a25a13a7 a22 according to the refined maximum entropy lexicon model.
We carried out some preliminary experiments with the a2 -best lists of hypotheses provided by the translation system in order to make a rescoring of each i-th hypothesis and reorder the list according to the new score computed with the refined lexicon model.
Unfortunately, our a2 -best extraction algorithm is sub-optimal, i.e. not the true best a2 translations are extracted.
In addition, so far we had to use a limit of only a87 a39 translations per sentence.
Therefore, the results of the translation experiments are only preliminary.
For the evaluation of the translation quality we use the automatically computable Word Error Rate (WER).
The WER corresponds to the edit distance between the produced translation and one predefined reference translation.
A shortcoming of the WER is the fact that it requires a perfect word order.
This is particularly a problem for the Verbmobil task, where the word order of the German-English sentence pair can be quite different.
As a result, the word order of the automatically generated target sentence can be different from that of the target sentence, but nevertheless acceptable so that the WER measure alone can be misleading.
In order to overcome this problem, we introduce as additional measure the position-independent word error rate (PER).
This measure compares the words in the two sentences without taking the word order into account.
Depending on whether the translated sentence is longer or shorter than the target translation, the remaining words result in either insertion or deletion errors in addition to substitution errors.
The PER is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the WER.
We use the top-10 list of hypothesis provided by the translation system described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) for rescoring the hypothesis using the ME models and sort them according to the new maximum entropy score.
The translation results in terms of error rates are shown in Table 8.
We use Model 4 in order to perform the translation experiments because Model 4 typically gives better translation results than Model 5.
We see that the translation quality improves slightly with respect to the WER and PER.
The translation quality improvements so far are quite small compared to the perplexity measure improvements.
We attribute this to the fact that the algorithm for computing the a2 -best lists is suboptimal.

7 Conclusions
We have developed refined lexicon models for statistical machine translation by using maximum entropy models.
We have been able to obtain a significant better test corpus perplexity and also a slight improvement in translation quality.
We believe that by performing a rescoring on translation word graphs we will obtain a more significant improvement in translation quality.
For the future we plan to investigate more refined feature selection methods in order to make the maximum entropy models smaller and better generalizing.
In addition, we want to investigate more syntactic, semantic features and to include features that go beyond sentence boundaries.
