A similar data structure to suffix arrays was proposed by Nagao and Mori (1994) for processing Japanese text.

While these are often reasonable assumptions, we have found that if the corpus contains long repeated substrings (e.g., duplicated articles), as our English corpus does (Paul and Baker 1992), then the sort can consume quadratic time, since each comparison can take order N time.
H92-1073
Nagao and Mori (1994) and Nagata (1996) proposed n-gram methods for Japanese.
C94-1101 W96-0205
Like Nagao and Mori (1994), we were also able to apply this procedure quite successfully to our Japanese corpus, but for the English corpus, after 50 hours of CPU time, we gave up and turned to Manber and Myers's (1990) algorithm, which took only two hours.
C94-1101
In any case, automatic word extraction is not an easy task for Japanese (Nagata 1996).
W96-0205
It has been noted elsewhere that the English corpus contains quite a few duplicated articles (Paul and Baker 1992).
H92-1073
Nagao and Mori (1994) ran this procedure quite successfully on a large corpus of Japanese text.
