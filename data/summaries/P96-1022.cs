One of our future goals is to optimise the prolog implementation for speedy processing and to add debugging facilities along the lines of (Carter, 1995).

Listing 1 A two-level rule is described using a syntactic variant of the formalism described by (Ruessink, 1989; Pulman and Hepple, 1993), including the extensions by (Kiraz, 1994c), tl_rule( <id),<LLC>, (Lex}, (RLC}, COp>, <LSC>, <RSC>, (variables>, (features)).

The former provides better performance, while the latter facilitates the debugging of grammars (by tracing and by providing debugging utilities along the lines of (Carter, 1995)).

The paper assumes knowledge of multi-tape two-level morphology (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994c).

Issues Finite-state models of two-level morphology implement morphotactics in two ways: using 'continuation patterns/classes' (Koskenniemi, 1983; Antworth, 1990; Karttunen, 1993) or unificationbased grammars (Bear, 1986; Ritchie et al., 1992).
C86-1065
The compilation of the above formalism into automata is described by (Grimley-Evans et al., 1996).

To test the integrity, robustness and performance of the implementation, a two-level grammar of the most frequent words in the Syriac New Testament was compiled based on the data in (Kiraz, 1994b).

The SEDRA database (Kiraz, 1994a) provides such data.
