Constraint Programming (CP) has been used in computational linguislics in several areas, for example in (typed) featut'e-lmsed systems (Smolka, 1995), or condio tional constraints (Matiasek, 1994), or adwmccd compilation techniques (G6tz and Meurcrs, 1997) or specialized constraint solvers (Manandhar, 1994).

The parsing-as-deduction approach proposed in Pereira and Warren (1983) and exlended in Shieber et al.(1995) and the parsing schemala detincd in Sikkel (1997) are well established parsing paradigms in computalional linguistics.
