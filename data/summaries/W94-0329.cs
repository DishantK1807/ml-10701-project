Other NLG systems that extract and summarise information have been developed in other research, particularly by CoGenTex; their systems include, for example, FOG (Bourbeau et al., 1990), which produced weather reports; LFS (Iordanskaja et al., 1992), which summarised employment statistics; and Joyce (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992), which summarised software designs from a security perspective.
