Formal complexity analysis has not been carried out, but my algorithm is simpler, at least conceptually, than the variable-word-order parsers of Johnson (1985), Kashket (1986), and Abramson and Dahl (1989).

Most dependency parsers have followed a "principle of adjacency" that requires every word plus all its direct and indirect dependents to form a contiguous substring (Hays and Ziehe 1960; Starosta and Nomura 1986; Fraser 1989; but not Hellwig 1986 and possibly not J/ippinen et al.1986). This is equivalent to requiring constituents to be continuous.
