More recently, (Zelenko et al., 2003) have proposed extracting relations by computing kernel functions between parse trees and (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) have extended this work to estimate kernel functions between augmented dependency trees.

For the Template Relations task of MUC-7, BBN researchers (Miller et al., 2000) augmented syntactic parse trees with semantic information corresponding to entities and relations and built generative models for the augmented trees.
