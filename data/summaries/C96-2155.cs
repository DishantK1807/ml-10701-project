Kay (1996) provides a mole general view of the chart structure which is designed to provide for generation advantages comparable to those it provides for parsing.
P96-1027
The first demonstration of using charts for generation appeared in Shieber (1988).

We will concentrate on a detailed description of these annotations as they are a crucial component of our method and they are the major difference between the current proposal and the one described in Kay (1996).

Shieber, Stuart (1988).
C88-2128
The method is an extension of the chart based generation algorithm described in Kay (1996).

This may open the possibility for considering target language statistics (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Dagan et al., 1991) or more generally for applying other criteria to select the "best" translation, which take into account properties of both languages for example, prefering ambiguity preserving translations.
