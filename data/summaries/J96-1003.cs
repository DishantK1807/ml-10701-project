Veronis (1988) presents a method for handling quite complex combinations of typographical and phonographic errors (phonographic errors are the kind usually made by language learners using computer-aided instruction).

More recently, Bowden and Kiraz (1995) have used a multitape morphological analysis technique for spelling correction in Semitic languages which, in addition to insertion, deletion, substitution, and transposition errors, allows for various language-specific errors.

In some cases, however, the proposed approach may not be efficient and may be augmented with language-specific heuristics: For instance, in spelling correction, users (at least in Turkey, as indicated by our error model \[Oflazer and Gfizey 1994\]) usually replace non-ASCII characters with their nearest ASCII equivalents because of inconveniences such as nonstandard keyboards, or having to input the non-ASCII characters using a sequence of keystrokes.

Two-level transducers (Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992) provide a suitable model for the application of error-tolerant recognition.

The approach presented in Oflazer and G6zey 1994 generates a valid sequence of the lexical forms of root and suffixes and uses a separate morphographemic component that implements the two-level rules to derive surface forms.

Oflazer and G6zey (1994) present a two-level morphology approach to spelling correction in agglutinative languages using a coarser morpheme-based morphotactic description rather than the finer lexi8 Ranking is dependent on the language, the application, and the error model.

Our earlier study of an error model developed for spelling correction in Turkish indicated similar results (Oflazer and G/izey 1994).

Aduriz et al.(1993) present a two-level morphology approach to spelling correction in Basque.

Under these circumstances, one may use language-specific heuristics first, before resorting to error-tolerant recognition, along the lines suggested by morphological-analysis-based approaches (Aduriz et al.1993; Bowden and Kiraz 1995).
E93-1057 P95-1004
Error-tolerant recognition can be used in many applications that are based on finite-state recognition, such as morphological analysis, spelling correction, or even tagging with finite-state models (Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993; Roche and Schabes 1995).

In the context of spelling correction, error-tolerant recognition can universally be applied to the generation of candidate correct forms for any language, provided it has a word list comprising all inflected forms, or its morphology has been fully described by automata such as two-level finite-state transducers (Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992).

Full-scale descriptions using this approach already exist for a number of languages such as English, French, German, Turkish, and Korean (Karttunen 1994).
