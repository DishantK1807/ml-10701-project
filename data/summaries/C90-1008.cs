The vocabulary in GENESYS should grow to 34,000 word-senses (or possibly more if an ambitious planned procedure is successful), and it will have a near--complete coverage of both punctuation and intonation, the latter being a complex matter where there is little previous work to build on; for the generation of semantically motivated intonation see Fawcett 1990b.
