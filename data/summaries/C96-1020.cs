Briefly, the tirst of these problems, which applies even where the grammar being trained has been induced from the training treebank (Sherman el; al., 1990), is thai; the syntactic sketchiness of a skeleton ~ parsed treebank leads a statistical training algorithm to overcount, in some circumstances, and in other cases to un~The 1995 release Penn Treebank adds flmctionM intormation to some nonterminals (Marcus et al., 1994), but with its rudimentary (roughly 45 tag) tagset, its non detailed internal analysis of noun con> pounds and NPs more generally, its lack of semantic categorization of words and phrases, etc., it arguably remains a skeleton parsed treebank, albeit an enriched one.

Treebanks have been used within the field of natural language processing as a source of training data for statistical part og speech taggers (Black et al., 1992; Brill, 1994; Merialdo, 1994; Weischedel et al., 1993) and for statistical parsers (Black et al., 1993; Brill, 1993; aelinek et al., 1994; Magerman, 1995; Magerman and Marcus, 1991).
