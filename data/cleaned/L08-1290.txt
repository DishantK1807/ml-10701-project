As reported in (Bohnet, 2003), also phrase structures in the NEGRA corpus were mapped to particular dependency structures called SSynt structures1. This experiment, which is quite similar to ours, achieved an overall accuracy of</context>

We could compare the results to those obtained by (Chanev, 2005) using Malt with the Turin University Treebank and to the performance of the same parser with other languages. Eventually, we could think of reducing the tagset and test the difference in parsing per</context>

Besides, we applied Collins’ procedure (Collins, 1999) to determine heads, following a head table which contains an entry for every non-terminal symbol in the grammar. During the conversion process, we basically followed three steps, namely Sentence roo</context>

To our knowledge, the only dependency annotated corpus for Italian available is the Turin University Treebank (Lesmo et al., 2002), which has 25,000 tokens and is about 1/10 of VIT. As manual corpus annotation is expensive and time-consuming, we decided to exploit an existing constituency-based treebank, the VIT, to derive depe</context>
