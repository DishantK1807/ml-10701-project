The latter two use a transformation-based error-driven learning method \[Brill, 1992\].

In \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], the method is used for NP chunking, and in \[Cardie and Pierce, 1998\] the approach is indirectly used to evaluate corpus-extracted NP chunking rules.

We also extensively compared our approach to a recently proposed new memory-based learning algorithm, memory-based sequence learning (MBSL, \[Argamon et al., 1998\] and showed that MBL, which is a computationally simpler algorithm than MBSL, is able to readl similar precision and recall when restricted to the MBSL definition of the NP chunking, subject detection and object detection tasks.

Similar cascading ideas have been explored in other approaches to text analysis: e.g. finite state partial parsing \[Abney, 1996, Grefenstette, 1996\], statistical decision tree parsing \[Magerman, 1994\], maximum entropy parsing \[Ratnaparkhi, 1997\], and memory-based learning \[Cardie, 1994, Daelemans et al., 1996\].

Moreover, the automatic feature weighting in the similarity metric of a memory-based learner makes the approach well-suited for domains with large numbers of features from heterogeneous sources, as it embodies a smoothing-by-similarity method when data is sparse \[Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997\].

Introduction Recently, there has been an increased interest in approaches to automatically learning to recognize shallow linguistic patterns in text \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995, Vilain and Day, 1996, Argamon et al., 1998, Buchholz, 1998, Cardie and Pierce, 1998, Veenstra, 1998, Daelemans et aI., 1999a\].

Combined with previous results on PP-attachment \[Zavrel et al., 1997\], the results presented here will be integrated into a complete shallow parser.

In \[Daelemans et al., 1996\] both algorithms are explained in detail in the context ITiMBL is available from: http:\[/ilk.kub.nl/ of MBT, a memory-based POS tagger, which we presuppose as an available module in this paper.

The approach is evaluated by cross-validation on the WSJ treebank corpus \[Marcus et al., 1993\].

Chunking For NP chunking, \[Argamon et al., 1998\] used data extracted from section 15-18 of the WS.J as a fixed train set and section 20 as a fixed test set, the same data as \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\].

Since part of the chunking errors could be caused by POS errors, we also compared the same baseNP chunker on the santo corpus tagged with i) the Brill tagger as used in \[Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995\], ii) the Memory-Based Tagger (MBT) as described in \[Daelemans et al., 1996\].

Discussion and Related Research In \[Argamon et al., 1998\], an alternative approach to memox3'-based learning of shallow patterns, memorybased sequence learning (MBSL), is proposed.
