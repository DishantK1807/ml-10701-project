In a corpus analysis done in connection with (Poesio et al., 1997; Poesio et al., 1998), we found that 7 out of 70 inferential descriptions were of this type; in the SOLE corpus, in which 3 out of 11 bridging descriptions behave this way.

The relation between G&S's and RST's notion of structure has been analysed by, among others, (Moore and Paris, i 993; Moser and Moore, 1996).

And finally, keeping track of previous MSEs seems essential for bridging descriptions as well: in order to find the reasons for the low performance of algorithms for resolving bridging descriptions entirely based on lexical knowledge, (Poesio et al., 1998) examined the bridging descriptions their corpus to find out their 'preferred' antecedent.

Conversely, the claim that everything stays on the stack would have to be supplemented by some story concerning how information gets forgotten-e.g., by some caching mechanism such as the one proposed by Walker (1996).

A point worth keeping in mind throughout the following discussion is that, although the concept • O" of c8 (centerm~ theory s name for the current most salient entity) was originally introduced as 'roughly corresponding to Sidner's concept of discourse focus', in fact it is not clear that the two concepts are capturing the same intuitions (Poesio and Stevenson, 1998).

Even an approach in which only previous MSES are on the stack would still allow access to entities which are part of what Grosz called the IMPLICIT FOCUS of these MSEs, i.e., the entities that 6As discussed in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), in general there is more than one potential 'antecedent' for a bridging description in a text.

First of all, G&S propose a distinction between two components of the attentional state: the GLOBAL FOCUS, structured as a stack of focus spaces and accessed to interpret definite descriptions; and the LOCAL FOCUS, consisting of the information preferentially used to interpret pronouns• In addition, they adopt CENTERING THEORY (Grosz et al., 1995) as a theory of the local focus.

of focus Space unfortunately prevents a full discussion of Grosz's (1977), Sidner's (1979), and G&S's (1986) theories of focus and the attentional state in this abstract.

The component of the theory that deals with pronominal reference, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), only accounts for cases in which the antecedent of a pronoun is introduced by the previous sentence; cases such as (1) have to be handled by different mechanisms.

(Guindon, 1985) proposed an alternative model of the attentional state involving a cache instead of a stack, and Walker (1996) argues that the cache model can account for all of the data that originally motivated the stack model and, in addition, explains the use of informationally redundant utterances.

Unlike Sidner's theory of focus (Sidner, 1979), the theory of the attentional state in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) (henceforth: G&S) does not include explicit provision for long-distance pronominalisations, although some of the necessary tools are potentially already there, as we will see.

Poesio et al.(1997; 1998) report experiments in which different types of lexical knowledge sources are used to resolve bridging descriptions and other cases of definite descriptions that require more than simple string match for their resolution.
