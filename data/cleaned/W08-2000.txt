Introduction
Recent years have shown an increased interest in bringing the field of graph theory into Natural
Language Processing. In many NLP applications entities can be naturally represented as nodes in a
graph and relations between them can be represented as edges. Recent research has shown that graph-
based representations of linguistic units as diverse as words, sentences and documents give rise to novel
and efficient solutions in a variety of NLP tasks, ranging from part of speech tagging, word sense
disambiguation and parsing to information extraction, semantic role assignment, summarization and
sentiment analysis. The contribution of the graph representation, in addition to its intuitiveness, resides
in the possibility to relate linguistic entities beyond pairwise comparison. This volume contains papers
accepted for presentation at the TextGraphs-3 2008 Workshop on GraphBased Algorithms for Natural
Language Processing. This event took place on August 24, 2008, in Manchester, UK, immediately
following COLING 2008, the 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics. It was
the third workshop on this topic, building on the success of the first and second TextGraphs workshop
at HLT-NAACL 2006 and 2007. The workshop aimed at bringing together researchers working on
problems related to the use of graph-based algorithms for Natural Language Processing and on the
theory of graph-based methods. It addressed a broad spectrum of research areas to foster exchange of
ideas and to help identify principles of using the graph notions that go beyond an ad-hoc usage.
We issued calls for both regular and short, late-breaking papers. Six regular and three short papers were
accepted for presentation, based on the careful reviews of our program committee. We are indebted
to all program committee members for their thoughtful, high quality and elaborate reviews, especially
considering our extremely tight time frame for reviewing. The papers appearing in this volume have
surely benefited from their expert feedback. This year’s workshop attracted papers employing graphs
in a wide range of settings, so we are proud to present a very diverse program this year. N. Hathout
acquires morphological structure from a lexicon employing the bipartite graph between headwords’
formal semantic features. Mapping of text to a graph-based meaning representation is conducted by
S. Muresan, using a recent grammar formalism. A. B. Mass´e et al. lay out a general theoretical
framework for addressing the symbol grounding problem in digital dictionaries. A. Moschitti and F.M.
ZanzottouseKernelmethodsontreepairsforrecognizingtextualentailment. Combiningco-occurrence
and phonological similarity, K. Ichioka and F. Fukumoto semantically cluster onomatopoetic words in
Japanese. D. Rao et al. examine several random walk based approaches to measure word similarity. B.
McGillivray et al. address cluster overlapping with correspondence analysis and apply their method
to cluster English and Italian verbs and nouns. A domain-specific summarization method ranking
nodes in a graph of concepts is introduced by L. Plaza Morales et al. The topology of associative
concept dictionaries is modeled by H. Akama et al., who report interesting scale free properties of such
networks.
Finally, having a prominent researcher as an invited speaker greatly contributes to the quality of the
workshop. We thank Dragomir Radev for his talk and for the support he provided for this as well as all
the previous Textgraphs workshops. We are also grateful to Microsoft Research India for sponsoring
the travel and accomodation of the invited speaker.
