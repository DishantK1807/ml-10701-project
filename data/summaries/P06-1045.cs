Various methods (Hindle, 1990; Lin, 1998; Hagiwara et al., 2005) have been proposed for synonym acquisition.

(4) The similarity between word w with senses w1,...,wn and word v with senses v1,...,vm is defined as the maximum similarity between all the pairs of word senses: sim(w,v) = maxi,j sim(wi,vj), (5) whose idea came from Lin’s method (Lin, 1998).
P98-2127
For example, Hindle (1990) used cooccurrences between verbs and their subjects and objects, and proposed a similarity metric based on mutual information, but no exploration concerning the effectiveness of other kinds of word relationship is provided, although it is extendable to any kinds of contextual information.
P90-1034
Lin (1998) also proposed an information theorybased similarity metric, using a broad-coverage parser and extracting wider range of grammatical relationship including modifications, but he didn’t further investigate what kind of relationships actually had important contributions to acquisition, either.
