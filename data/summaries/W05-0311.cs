Given that the characterization of such discourse models is usually considered part of the area of the semantics of anaphora, and that the relations to be annotated include relations other than Sidner’s (1979) COSPECIFICATION, we will use the term ANNOTATION OF ANAPHORA for this task (Poesio, 2004), but the reader should keep in mind that we are not concerned only with nominal expressions which are lexically anaphoric.

It suffers however from a number of problems (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000), chief among which is the fact that the one semantic relation expressed by the scheme, ident, conflates a number of relations that semanticists view as distinct: besides COREFERENCE proper, there are IDENTITY ANAPHORA, BOUND ANAPHORA, and even PREDICATION.

The first problem is the lack of a truly systematic study of agreement on anaphoric annotation in the literature: none of the studies we are aware of (Hirschman, 1998; Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Byron, 2003; Poesio, 2004) is completely satisfactory, either because only a small number of coders was involved, or because agreement beyond chance couldn’t be assessed for lack of an appropriate statistic, a situation recently corrected by Passonneau (2004).

7According to our (subjective) calculations, at least one annotator made one obvious mistake of this type for 20 items out of 72 in the first half of the dialogue–for a total of 35 careless or mistaken judgment out of 1296 total judgments, or 2.7%. 8Things are different for associative anaphora, see (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).

The task of ‘anaphoric annotation’ discussed here is related, although different from, the task of annotating ‘coreference’ in the sense of the so-called MUCSS scheme for the MUC-7 initiative (Hirschman, 1998).

All noun phrases except temporal ones were treated as phrase markables (Poesio, 2004).

For this study we simply developed a coding manual for the purposes of our experiment, broadly based on the approach adopted in MATE (Poesio et al., 1999) and GNOME (Poesio, 2004), but introducing new types of annotation (ambiguous anaphora, and a simple form of discourse deixis) while simplifying other aspects (e.g., by not annotating bridging references).

In all annotation studies we are aware of,1 the fact that an expression may not have a unique interpretation in the context of its 1The one exception is Rosenberg and Binkowski (2004).
