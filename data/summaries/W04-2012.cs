Based on the analysis above, we employ the metrics proposed by Sato and Sasaki (2003).

Intuitively, our method of keyword selection is more natural than that of Magnini et al.(2002), since it considers both the question sentence and an answer candidate.
P02-1054
Major diﬀerence between the method of Magnini et al.(2002) and ours is in keyword selection.

P02-1054
In the method of Magnini et al.(2002), the initial keywords are content words extracted from a question sentence.
