We described in (Ide et al.2002) how this program is used in word clustering and in checking out the validity of the cross-lingual links between the monolingual wordnets of the multilingual Balkanet lexical ontology (Stamatou et al.2002). In this paper we describe the TREQ-AL system, which builds on TREQ and aims at generating a word-alignment map for a parallel text (a bitext).
