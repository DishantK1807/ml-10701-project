Introduction
Open domain question answering (QA) has become a very active research area over the past decade,
due in large measure to the stimulus of the TREC Question Answering track (now a track within the
recently formed Text Analysis Conference, TAC). This track addresses the task of finding answers to
natural language questions (e.g. “How tall is the Eiffel Tower?”, “Who is Aaron Copland?”, “What
effect does second-hand smoke have on non-smokers?”) from large text collections. This task stands
in contrast to the more conventional information retrieval (IR) task of finding documents relevant to
a query, where the query may be simply a collection of keywords (e.g. “Eiffel Tower”, “American
composer, born Brooklyn NY 1900, ...”).
Finding answers requires processing texts at a level of detail that cannot be carried out at retrieval time
for very large text collections. This limitation has led many researchers to rely on, broadly, a two
stage approach to the QA task. In stage one a subset of question-relevant texts are selected from the
whole collection. In stage two this subset is subjected to detailed processing for answer extraction.
Clearly performance at stage two is bounded by performance at stage one, and previous work has
shown that, despite the sophistication of standard IR ranking algorithms, they are not well suited to the
stage one task of retrieving relevant documents given short natural language questions. It is likely that
improvements in this area will come from linguistic insights into why QA focused IR is different from
the traditional IR model.
With the continued expansion of QA research into more complex question types and with the speed
with which answers are returned becoming an issue, the importance of having good, QA-focused IR
techniques is likely to increase. To date this topic has received limited explicit attention despite its
obvious importance. This 2nd IR4QA workshop aims to address this situation by continuing to attract
the attention of researchers to the specific IR challenges raised by QA.
For this workshop, we solicited papers that addressed any aspect of QA-focused IR, in order to improve
overall system performance, , suggesting possible topics such as:
• parameterizations/optimizations of specific IR systems for QA
• studies of query formation strategies suited to QA, e.g. named entity pre-processing of questions
• different uses of IR for different question types (e.g. factoid, list, definition, event, how, ...)
• utility of term matching constraints, e.g. term proximity, for QA
• analyses of differing IR techniques for QA
• impact of IR performance on overall QA performance
• QA-orientated corpus pre-processing, e.g. indexing POS tags, named entities, semantically-
tagged entities, relationships, etc. rather than simply tokens
• evaluation measures for assessing IR for QA
• retrieval from semi-structured data i.e. QA from Wikipedia articles
From the papers submitted, 10 were selected following peer review. These papers are included in this
proceedings. The enthusiastic response to this workshop confirms the belief that this is an important
area of interest to a significant number of researchers.
