In recent approaches, syntactic information is translated into features which, together with information from FrameNet, WordNet or VerbNet, will be used with ML tools to make predictions for each example in the test set (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005).

These systems share two ideas which make them different from the approach presented here: they all analyse verb-argument relations, and they all use machine learning or probabilistic approaches (Pradhan et al., 2005) to assign a label to a new instance.

In other methods, lexical resources are speci cally tailored to meet the requirements of the domain (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) or the system (Gomez, 1998).

role labelling (Baker et al., 1998; Kipper et al., 2000; Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005; Atserias et al., 2001; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005).

Such systems extract information from some types of syntactic units (clauses in (Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Hull and Gomez, 1996); noun phrases in (Hull and Gomez, 1996; Rosario et al., 2002)).

Labelling every instance relies on the same previously encoded knowledge (see (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005) for an overview of the systems in the semantic role labelling competitions from 2004 and 2005).

Pradhan et al.(2005) combine the outputs of multiple parsers to extract reliable syntactic information, which is translated into features for a machine learning experiment in assigning semantic roles.

Work Some methods of semantic relation analysis rely on prede ned templates lled with information from processed texts (Baker et al., 1998).

Most approaches rely on VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) to provide associations between verbs and semantic roles, that are then mapped onto the current instance, as shown by the systems competing in semantic role labelling competitions (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005) and also (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005).
