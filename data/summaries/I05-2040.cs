However both corpora are under the same standard from ACE project, and our training data (about 66K) is smaller than Florian et al.(2004) (about 80K).

Segmentation Adaptation The method of applying TBL to adapt the Chinese word segmentation standard has been described in Gao et al.(2004). Our approach is slightly different for not have a correctly segmented corpus according to ACE standard.

In fact, [Ji and Crishman, 2004] has used five hubristic rules based on coreference results to improve the name recognition result.

Abstract This paper proposes a unified Transformation Based Learning (TBL, Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT).

Recent research (Soon et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2003; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Ittycherah et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2004) focuses on the use of statistical machine learning methods and tries to resolve references among all kinds of noun phases, including name, nominal and pronoun phrase.

The ACE-value of our Chinese EDT system is better than 58.8% of Florian et al.(2004). In fact, the two systems are not comparable for not basing on the same training and test data.

Florian et al.(2004) formulate the mention detection problem as a character-based classification problem.

In this paper, we propose a unified EDT model based on the Transformation Based Learning (TBL, Brill, 1995) framework for Chinese.

The TBL entity tracking model has more widely clustering/searching space as compare with previous strategies (Soon et al.2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004).
