A later study (Pang and Lee, 2004) found that performance increased to 87.2% when considering only those portions of the text deemed to be subjective.

Turney (2002) noted that the unigram unpredictable might have a positive sentiment in a movie review (e.g.

Dependency We conducted an experiment to compare the accuracy when training a classifier on one domain (newswire articles or movie reviews from the Polarity 1.0 dataset used by Pang et al.(2002)) and testing on the other domain.

The models were trained using unigram features, accounting for the presence of feature types in a document, rather than the frequency, as Pang et al.(2002) found that this is the most effective strategy for sentiment classification.

Pang et al.(2002) used a bagof-features framework (based on unigrams and bigrams) to train these models from a corpus of movie reviews labelled as positive or negative.
