Bethard et al.evaluate their system on manually annotated FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) sentences and achieve 48% recall with 57% precision.

For this reason, we applied the CRF feature induction approach introduced by McCallum (2003).

Other research efforts analyze opinion expressions at the sentence level or below to recognize opinions, their polarity, and their strength (e.g., Dave et al.(2003), Pang and Lee (2004), Wilson et al.(2004), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Wiebe and Riloff (2005)).

Part-of-speech features Based on the lexical categories produced by GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), each token xi is classified into one of a set of coarse part-of-speech tags: noun, verb, adverb, wh-word, determiner, punctuation, etc.

Two pre-processing steps are required before features can be constructed: 3Some words are drawn from Levin (1993); others are from Framenet lemmas (Baker et al.1998) associated with communication verbs.

Much of this research explores sentiment classification, a text categorization task in which the goal is to classify a document as having positive or negative polarity (e.g., Das and Chen (2001), Pang et al.(2002), Turney (2002), Dave et al.(2003), Pang and Lee (2004)).

This task goes beyond Named Entity recognition (e.g., Bikel et al.(1997)) because it requires the recognition of role relationships.

To illustrate the nature of this problem, consider the examples below: S1: Taiwan-born voters favoring independence... 1In related work, we investigate methods to identify the opinion expressions (e.g., Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Wiebe and Riloff (2005), Wilson et al.(2005)) and the nesting structure of sources (e.g., Breck and Cardie (2004)).

Errors from the sentence boundary detector in GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002) were especially problematic because they caused the Collins parser to fail, resulting in no dependency tree information.

CRFs have been used successfully for Named Entity recognition (e.g., McCallum and Li (2003), Sarawagi and Cohen (2004)), and AutoSlog has performed well on information extraction tasks in several domains (Riloff, 1996a).

Many applications could benefit from these opinion analyzers, including product reputation tracking (e.g., Morinaga et al.(2002), Yi et al.(2003)), opinion-oriented summarization (e.g., Cardie et al.(2004)), and question answering (e.g., Bethard et al.(2004), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003)).
