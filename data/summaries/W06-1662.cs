Lapata (2003) proposed a probabilistic ordering (PO) method for text structuring, which can be adapted to majority ordering if the training texts are those documents to be summarized.

For sentence ordering, we used Kendall’s τ coefficient (Lapata, 2003), as defined in 10), 2/)1( )(21)10 −−= NN N Iτ where, NI is number of inversions of consecutive sentences needed to transform output of the algorithm to manual summaries.

Recently, it has also drawn attention in multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003; Bollegala et al., 2005).

Furthermore, temporal inference in texts is still a problem, in spite of some progress in automatic disambiguation of temporal information (Filatova et al., 2001).
