Abstract 
In this paper we present a method to 
automatically identify linguistic contexts 
which contain posible causes of 
emotions or emotional states from Italian 
newspaper articles (La Repubblica 
Corpus). Our methodology is based on 
the interplay betwen relevant linguistic 
paterns and an incremental repository of 
comon sense knowledge on emotional 
states and emotion eliciting situations. 
Our aproach has ben evaluated with 
respect to manualy anotated data. The 
results obtained so far are satisfying and 
suport the validity of the methodology 
proposed. 
1 Introduction

As it has ben demonstrated in Balahur et al. 
(2010), mining the web to discriminate betwen 
objective and subjective content and extract the 
relevant opinions about a specific target is today 
a crucial as well as a challenging task due to the 
growing amount of available information. 
Opinions are just a part of the subjective content, 
which is expresed in texts. Emotions and 
emotional states are a further set of subjective 
data. Natural Language is comonly used to 
express emotions, attribute them and, most 
importantly, to indicate their cause(s).  
Due to the importance of linking the emotion to 
its cause, a recent subtask of Sentiment Analysis 
(SA) consists in the detection of the emotion 
cause event (ECE, Le et al., 2010; Chen et al., 
2010) and focuses on the identification of the 
phrase (if present, as in 1 in bold) mentioning 
the event that is related to the emotional state (in 
italics):  
 
(1) Non poteva mancare un aceno ala 
strage di Bologna, che costringe l' animo 
a infinita vergogna. 
[There was a mention of Bologna 
masacre,  
that forces us to feel ashamed.] 
 
This kind of information is extremely 
interesting, since it can provide pragmatic 
knowledge about content words and their 
emotional/subjective polarity and consequently 
it can be employed for building up useful 
applications with practical purposes. 
The paper focuses on the development of a 
method for the identification of Italian sentences 
which contain an emotion cause phrase. Our 
approach is based on the interplay between 
linguistic patterns which allow the retrieval of 
emotion – emotion cause phrase couples and on 
the exploitation of an asociated incremental 
repository of comonsense knowledge about 
events which elicit emotions or emotional states. 
The methodology is only partialy language 
dependent and this approach can be easily 
extended to other languages such as Spanish. 
The repository is one of the main results of this 
work. It alows the discovery of pragmatic 
knowledge asociated with various content 
153
words and can asign them a polarity value 
which can be further exploited in more complex 
SA and Opinion Mining tasks. 
The present paper is structured as folows. 
Section 2 shortly describes related work and 
state of the art on this task. Section 3 focuses on 
the description of the methodology. Section 4 
describes the annotation scheme and the corpus 
used for the creation of the test set. Section 5 
reports on the experiments and their results. 
Conclusions and future works are described in 
Section 6. 
1 Related
Works 
Emotional states are often trigered by the 
perception of external events (pre-events) 
(Wierzbicka, 1999). In addition to this, 
emotional states can also be the cause of events 
(post-events; Chun-Ren, 2010). This sugests to 
consider emotional states as a pivot and structure 
the relations betwen emotional states and 
related events as a tri-tuple of two pairs: 
 
(2) <<pre-events, emotional state> 
<emotional state, post-event> 
 
This study focuses on the relationship betwen 
the first pair of the tri-tuple, namely pre-events 
(or ECE), and emotional states. 
Previous works on this task have ben caried 
out for Chinese (Le et al., 209, Chen et al., 
2009, Le et al., 2010). ECE can be explicitly 
expressed as arguments, events, propositions, 
nominalizations and nominals. Le et al (2010) 
restrict the definition of ECE as the imediate 
cause of the emotional state which does not 
necesarily correspond to the actual emotional 
state triger or what leads to the emotional state. 
Their work considers al posible linguistic 
realization of EKs (nouns, verbs, adjectives, 
prepositional phrases) and ECEs.  On the basis 
of an anotaed corpus, corelations betwen 
emotional states and ECEs have been studied in 
terms of different linguistic cues (e.g. position of 
the cause events, presence of epistemic 
markers..) thus identifying seven groups of 
cues. After that, they have been implemented in 
a rule-based system, which is able to identify: i.) 
the EK; ii.) the ECE and its position (same 
sentence as the EK, previous sentence with 
respect to the EK, folowing sentence with 
respect to the EK) and (ii.) the experiencer of 
the emotional state(s).The system evaluation has 
been performed on the annotated corpus in two 
phases: firstly, identifying those sentences 
containing a co-occurrence of EK and ECE; 
secondly, for those contexts where an EK and 
ECE co-occurs, identifying the correct ECE. 
Standard Precision, Recal and F-measure have 
been used. The baseline is computed by 
assuming that the first verb on the left of the EK 
is the ECE. The system outperforms the baseline 
f-score by 0.19. Although the results are not 
very high, the system acuracy for the detection 
of ECEs is reported to be thre times more 
accurate than the baseline. 
2 Emotional
states betwen linguistic 
patterns and commonsense 
knowledge 
The work of Lee et al. (2010) represents the 
starting point for the development of our 
method. We depart from their aproach in the 
folowing points: i.) use of data mining 
techniques (clustering plus a clasifier) to 
automatically induce the rules for sentential 
contexts in which an event cause phrase is 
expressed; and i.) exploitation of a 
comonsense repository of EK elicitng ECE 
noun couples for the identification of the correct 
ECE noun. The remaining of this section wil 
describe in details the creation of the repository 
and the methodology we have adopted. 
2.1 A
source for comonsense knowledge 
of EKs and ECEs in Italian 
Recently crowdsourcing techniques that exploit 
the functionalities of the Web 2.0 have ben 
used in AI and NLP for reducing the eforts, 
costs and time for the creation of Language 
Resources. We have exploited the dat from an 
on-line initiative launched in December 2010 by 
the Italian newspaper “Il Coriere dela Sera” 
which asked its readers to describe the year 2010 
with 10 words. 2,378 people participated in the 
data collection for a total of 22,469 words. We 
exploited these data to identify preliminary 
couples of emotional states and cause events, 
and thus create a repository of affective 
comonsense knowledge, by extracting all 
154
bigrams realized by nouns for a total of 18,240 
couples noun1-noun2. After this operation, an 
adapted Italian version of WN-Affect 
(Straparava – Valitui, 204) obtained by 
means of maping procedures through 
MultiWordNet (MWN) has ben aplied to each 
item of the bigrams. By means of a simple 
query, we have extracted al bigrams where at 
least one item has an asociated sense 
coresponding to the “emotion” category in WN-
Affect. We have aplied WN-Affect again to 
these results and extracted only those bigrams 
where the unclasified item coresponded to the 
WN-Affect label of “emotion eliciting 
situation”. Finally, two lists of keywords have 
been obtained: one denoting EKs (133 lemas) 
and the other denoting posible ECEs associated 
with a specific EK. The posible ECEs have 
been extended by exploiting MWN synsets and 
lexical relations of similar-to, pertains-
to, atibute and is-value-of. We 
have filtered the set of ECE keywords by 
selecting only those nouns whose top nodes 
uniquely belongs to the following ontological 
classes, namely: event, state, phenomenon, and 
act. After this operation we have 161 nominal 
lemas of posible ECEs.  
2.2 Exploiting
the repository for patern 
induction 
The preliminary version of the repository of EK 
ECE couples has ben exploited in order to 
identify relevant syntagmatic patterns for the 
detection of nominal ECEs. The pattern 
induction phase has ben performed on a parsed 
version of a large corpus of Italian, the La 
Republica Corpus (Baroni et al., 204). 
We have implemented a patern extractor that 
takes as input the couples of the sed words 
from the commonsense repository and extracted 
all combinations of EKs and its/their associated 
ECEs ocuring in the same sentence, with a 
distance ranging from 1 to 8 possible intervening 
parts-of-spech. We have thus obtained 1,39 
possible paterns. This set has been cleaned both 
on the basis of patern frequencies and with 
manual exploration. In total 47 paterns were 
selected and were setled among the features for 
the clustering and clasifier ensemble which will 
be exploited for the identification of the 
sentential contexts which may contain an 
emotion cause phrase (see Section 5 for details). 
3 Developing
a gold standard and 
related annotation scheme 
With the purpose of evaluating the validity and 
reliability of our aproach, a reference anotated 
corpus (gold standard) has ben created. 
The data colection has ben performed in a 
semi-automatic way. In particular, we have 
extracted from an Italian lexicon, 
SIMPLE/CLIPS (Ruimy et al., 203), all nouns 
marked with semantic type “Sentiment” to avoid 
biases for the evaluation and measure the 
coverage of the comonsense repository. The 
keywords have been used to query the La 
Republica Corpus and thus creating the corpus 
colection. We have restricted the length of the 
documents to be annotated to a maximum of 
thre sentences, namely the sentence containing 
the emotion keyword, the one preceding it and 
the sentence immediately following. As a 
justification for this choice, we have asumed 
that causes are a local focus discourse 
phenomenon and should not be found at a long 
distance with respect to their efects (i.e. the 
emotion keyword). Finally, the corpus is 
composed by 6,00 text snipets for a total of 
738,558 tokens. 
The coresponding anotation scheme, It-
EmoCause, is based on recomendations and 
previous experience in event annotation (ISO-
TimeML), emotion event anotation (Le et al., 
2009, Chen et al., 2010), emotion and afective 
computing annotation (EARL
1, the HUMAINE 
Emotion Anotation and Representation 
Language, EmotiBlog, Boldrini et al, 2010). The 
scheme applies at two levels: phrase level and 
token level and it allows nested tags. Figure 1 
reports the BNF description of the scheme. 
Text consuming markables are 
<emotionWord>, <causePhrase> and 
<causeEmotion> tags, which are 
responsible, respectively, for marking the 
emotion keyword, the phrase expressing the 
cause emotion event and the token expressing 
the cause emotion. The values of the attribute 
emotionClass is drid frm Ekman

(1972)'s clasification and extended with the 
value UNDERSPECIFIED. This value is used as 
a cover term for all other types of emotion 
reducing disagreement and alowing further 
classifications on the basis of more detailed and 
diferent lists of emotions that each user can 
specify. Finaly, the non-text consuming 
<EmLink> lik puts in relation the cause 
emotion event or phrase with the emotion 
keyword.

The anotation has ben performed by two

tool used for the anotation is the Brandeis 
Annotation Tol (BAT)

under annotation and we concentrated mainly on 
the development of a test set. Not all markables 
and attributes have been annotated in this phase.

The inter-annotator agreement (IA)

 on the 
detection of the cause event and the cause phrase 
are not satisfactory. To have reliable data, we 
have adopted a correction strategy by asking the 
annotators to assign a comon value to 
disagrements. This has increased the IA on 
cause emotion to K=0.45, and P&R= 0.46. A 
revision procedure of the anotation guidelines 
is necesary and anotation specifications must 
be developed so that the disagrement can be 
further reduced. Table 1 reports the figures 
about the annotated data so far.

cause detection: experiments 
and results 
In order to find out a set of rules for the 
detection of emotion cause phrase contexts, we 
experimented a combinton of Machin
Learning techniques, namely clustering and rule 
induction clasifier algorithms. In particular, we 
want to exploit the output of a clustering 
algorithm as input to a rule learner classifier 
both available in the Weka platform (Witen and 
Frank, 205). 
The clustering algorithm is the Expectation-
Maximization algorithm (EM; Hofman and 
Puzicha, 198). The EM is an unsupervised 
algorithm, comonly used for model-based

clustering and also applied in SA tasks 
(Takamura et al. 206). In this work, we 
equiped the EM clustering model with 
syntagmatic, lexical and contextual features. The 
clustering algorithm has been trained on 2,00 
corpus instances of the potential EK ECE 
couples of the repository from the La 
Republica corpus along with a thre sentence 
context (i.e the sentence imediately preceding 
and that imediately folowing the sentence 
containing the EK). 
Four groups of features have ben identified: the 
first set of features coresponds to a re-
adaptation of the rules implemented in Lee et al. 
(2010); the second set of features implements 
the 47 syntagmatic patterns that specifically 
codify the relation between the EK and the ECE 
(se Section 3.2); the last two set of features are 
composed, respectively, by a list of intra-
sentential bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams for a 
total of 364 different part-of-spech sequences 
with the EK as the first element and by a list of 6 
relevant colocational paterns which expres 
cause-effect relationship between the  ECE and 
the EK, manually identified on the basis of the 
authors' intuitions. In Table 2 some examples of 
each group of features are reported

We expected two data clusters, one which

the emotion cause it is not present or it ocurs in 
a diferent sentence (i.e. the one before the EK 
or in the one following it). 
In order to evaluate the godnes of the cluster 
configuration created by the Weka version of the 
EM algorithm, we have run diferent clustering 
experiments. The results of each clustering 
analysis have been passed to the Weka PART 
rule-induction clasifier. The best results were 
those which confirmed our working hypothesis, 
i.e. two clusters. The first cluster contains 869 
items while the second 1,131 items.  
The PART clasifier provided a total of 49 
detection rules for the detection of EK – ECE 
contexts. The clasifier identifies the ocurence 
of a cause phrase in the same sentence but is not 
able to identify the noun which coresponds to 
the ECE. 
The evaluation of the clasifier has ben 
performed on the 121 couples of EK – cause 
phrase of the test set. As we are aiming at 
spoting nominal causes of EKs, we have 
computed the baseline by considering as the 
corect phrase containing the ECE the first noun 
phrase occurring at the right of the emotion 
keyword and in the same sentence since this 
kind of ECEs tends to occur mostly at this 
position. In this way the baseline has an 
accuracy of  0.14 (only 3 NPs were corect 
over a total of 227 NPs at the right of the EKs). 
By aplying the rules of the PART clasifier, we 
have obtained an overal acuracy of 0.71, 
outperforming the baseline. As for the 
identification of the EK cause phrase couples 
occurring in the same sentence, we computed 
standard Precision, Recall and F-measure. The 
results are reported in Table 3. The system tends 
to have a high precision (0.70) and a low recall 
(0.58).

After this, we tried to identify the corect 
nominal ECE in the cause phrase. Provided the 
reduced dimensions of the anotated corpus, no 
training set was available to train a further 
157
classifier. Thus, to perform this task we decided 
to exploit the comonsense repository. 
However, the first version of the repository is 
too small to obtain any relevant results. We 
enlarged it by applying two set of features (the 
syntagmatic paterns manualy identified and the 
colocational patterns used for the clustering 
analysis). 
4.1 Incrementing
the repository and 
discovering EK – ECE couples 
Our hypothesis is that the identification of the 
ECE(s) in context could be performed by 
looking for a plausible set of nouns which are 
associated with a specific EK and asumed to be 
its cause. This type of information is exactly the 
one contained in the repository described in 
Section 3.1. 
In order to work with a larger data set of ECE 
entries per emotion keyword, we have applied 
the syntagmatic paterns manually identified and 
the collocational patterns on two corpora: i.) La 
Republica and i.) ItWaC
5
 (Baroni et al., 209). 
For each EK ECE couple identifed we have 
kept track of the co-occurrence frequencies and 
computed the Mutual Information (MI). 
Frequency and I are extremely relevant 
because they provide a reliability threshold for 
each couple of EK and ECE. In Table 4 we 
report some co-occurrences of the EK “ansia” 
[anxiety] and ECEs.

Each ECE has ben asociated to a probability 
measure of eventivity derived from MWN top

ontological clases, obtained from the ratio 
betwen 1 and the sum of al top ontological 
classes associated to the ECE lemma. The top 
nodes “event”, “state”, “phenomenon”, and 
“act” have been considered as a unique top class 
by applying the TimeML definition of event
6
. 
This measure is useful in case more than one 
ECEs is ocuring in the context in analysis as a 
disambiguation strategy. In fact, if more than 
one ECEs is present, that with the higher 
frequency, MI and eventivity score should be 
prefered. 
Furthermore, to make the repository more 
effective and also to associate an emotional 
polarity to the ECEs (i.e. whether they have 
positive, negative or neutral values) we have 
further extended the set of information by 
exploiting WN-Affect 1.1. In particular we have 
associated each EK to its emotional category 
(e.g. despondency, resentment, joy) and its 
emotional superclass (e.g. positive-emotion, 
negative-emotion, ambiguous-emotion). 
This extended version of the repository has ben 
applied to identify the corect ECE noun for the 
95 couples of EK – ECE in the test set. We have 
splited the whole set of EK – ECE couples into 
two subgroups: i.) EK – ECE couples ocuring 
in the same sentence (82/95); and ii.) EK – ECE 
couples occurring in diferent sentences (13/95). 
By aplying the repository to the first group, we 
were able to corectly identify 50% (41/82) of 
the ECE nouns for each specific EK when 
occurring in the same sentence. Moreover, we 
applied the repository also to the EK – ECE 
couples of the second group: a rough 30.76% 
(4/13) of the ECE ocurring in sentences other 
that the one containing the EK can be corectly 
retrieved without increasing the number of false 
positives. This is possible thanks to the 
probability score computed by means of MWN 
top ontological clases, even if the number of 
annotated examples is to small to justify strong 
conclusions.

 To clarify, the ECE “guera” [war] has four 
senses in MWN. Three of them belong to the top 
ontological clas of “event” and one to “state”. This 
possible ECE has 1 top ontological node, and its eventivity 
mesure is 1.

5 Conclusions
and future works 
In this paper we describe a methodology based 
on the interplay betwen relevant linguistic 
paterns and an incremental repository of 
comon sense knowledge of EK – ECE
couples, which can be integrated into more 
complex systems for SA and Opinion Mining. 
The experimental results show that clustering 
techniques (EM clustering model) and a rule 
learner clasifier (the PART clasifier) can be 
efficiently combined to select and induce 
relevant linguistic paterns for the discovery of 
EK – ECE couples in the same sentence. The 
information thus collected has ben organized 
into the repository of comonsense knowledge 
about emotions and their posible causes. The 
repository has ben extended by using corpora 
of varying dimensions (la Repubblica and 
ItWaC) and efectively used to identify ECEs of 
specific emotion keywords. 
One interesting aspect of this approach is 
represented by the reduced manual efort both 
for the identification of linguistic paterns for the 
extraction of reliable information and for the 
maintenance and extension of specific language 
resources which can be aplied also to domains 
other than SA. In adition to this, the method 
can be extended and applied to identify ECE 
realized by other POS, such as verbs and 
adjectives. 
As future works, we aim to extend the repository 
by extracting data from the Web and connecting 
it to SentiWordNet and WN-Affect. In 
particular, the connection to the existing 
language resources could be used to spot 
possible misclasifications and polarity values.
