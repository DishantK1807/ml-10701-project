299 4 Future Work While the modi cation given in section 2.2 is speci c to CYK parsing, we believe that placing restrictions based on the output of a chunk parser is general enough to be applied to any generative, statistical parser, such as the Charniak parser (2000), or a Lexical Tree Adjoining Grammar based parser (Sarkar, 2000).

Michael Collins, rst in (1996), and then in his PhD thesis (1999), describes a modi cation to the standard CYK chart parse for natural languages which uses probabilities instead of simple context free grammars.

Clause Identi cation is the partial parsing process of annotating the hierarchical structure of clauses groupings of words that contain a subject and a predicate (Tjong Kim Sang and DÂ·ejean, 2001).

(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) Unlike a parse tree, a set of syntactic chunks has no hierarchical information on how sequences of words relate to each other.
