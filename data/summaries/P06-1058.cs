A semi-supervised method proposed by Niu et al.(2005) clustered untagged instances with tagged ones starting from a small seed corpus, which assumes that similar instances should have similar tags.

Yarowsky (1994 and 1995), Mihalcea and Moldovan (2000), and Mihalcea (2002) have made further research to obtain large corpus of higher quality from an initial seed corpus.

This reinforcement algorithm dates back to Gale et al.(1992a). Their investigation was based on a 6word test set with 2 senses for each word.

Ide et al.(2001 and 2002), Ng et al.(2003), and Diab (2003, 2004a, and 2004b) made research on the use of alignment for WSD.

The lower bound as Gale et al.(1992c) suggested should be very low and it is more difficult to disambiguate if there are more senses.
P92-1032
This process is similar to the use of general pseudowords (Gale et al., 1992b; Gaustad, 2001; Nakov and Hearst, 2003), but has some essential differences.

The first statistical model of WSD was built by Brown et al.(1991). Since then, most machine learning methods have been applied to WSD, including decision tree, Bayesian model, neural network, SVM, maximum entropy, genetic algorithms, and so on.
P91-1034
Diab and Resnik (2002) investigated the feasibility of automatically annotating large amounts of data in parallel corpora using an unsupervised algorithm, making use of two languages simultaneously, only one of which has an available sense inventory.
P02-1033
The method by Li and Li (2002) does not require parallel corpus.
