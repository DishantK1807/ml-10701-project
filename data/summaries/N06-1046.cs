For instance, Walker et al.(2001) propose an overgenerate-and-rank approach to aggregation within the context of a spoken dialog application.

The interplay of different constraints is usually captured by a set of hand-crafted rules that guide the aggregation process (Scott and de Souza, 1990; Hovy, 1990; Dalianis, 1999; Shaw, 1998).

To date, this task has involved human analysis of a domain-relevant corpus and manual development of aggregation rules (Dalianis, 1999; Shaw, 1998).

Using an ILP formulation may be an advantage here since we could use feedback (in the form of constraints) from other components and knowlegde sources (e.g., discourse relations) to improve aggregation or indeed the generation pipeline as a whole (Marciniak and Strube, 2005).

Another approach is put forward by Cheng and Mellish (2000) who use a genetic algorithm in combination with a hand-crafted preference function to opportunistically find a text that satisfies aggregation and planning constraints.

Data For training and testing our algorithm, we employed a corpus of football game summaries collected by Barzilay and Lapata (2005).

ILP models have been successfully applied in several natural language processing tasks, including relation extraction (Roth and Yih, 2004), semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al., 2004) and the generation of route directions (Marciniak and Strube, 2005).

Our model is inspired by research on text aggregation in the natural language generation community (Cheng and Mellish, 2000; Shaw, 1998).

Furthermore, Di Eugenio et al.(2005) demonstrate that aggregation can improve learning in the context of an intelligent tutoring application.

Aggregated texts tend to be more concise, coherent, and more readable overall (Dalianis, 1999; Cheng and Mellish, 2000).
