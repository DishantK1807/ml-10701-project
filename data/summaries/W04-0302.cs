We write afl for the operation of adjoining fl and afl( ) for the result of applying afl to . The substitution operation is similar to rule expansion of top-down incremental parsing such as (Matsubara et al., 1997; Roark, 2001).

The elementary trees were extracted from the parse trees in sections 02-21 of the Wall Street Journal in Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), which is transformed by using parent-child annotation and left factoring (Roark and Johnson, 1999).

To fulfill the requirement, the system needs to understand spoken language at least incrementally (Allen et al., 2001; Inagaki and Matsubara, 1995; Milward and Cooper, 1994), that is, to analyze each input sentence from left to right and acquire the content.
C94-2120
Several incremental parsing methods have been proposed to date (Costa et al., 2001; Haddock, 1987; Matsubara et al., 1997; Milward, 1995; Roark, 2001).
