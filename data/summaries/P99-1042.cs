Using the MUC coreference scoring algorithm (see Vilain et al.1995), this had a precision of 77% and a recall of 18%.

The system makes use of the Alembic automated named entity system (Vilain and Day 1996) for finding named entities.

We created hand-tagged named entity data, which allowed us to measure the performance of Alembic: the accuracy (Fmeasure) was 76.5; see Chinchor and Sundheim (1993) for a description of the standard MUC scoring metric.
