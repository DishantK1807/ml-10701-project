W99-0629
Central to our approach is the choice to adopt the instance encoding analogous to Buchholz et al.(1999) to have our examples represent relations between pairs of verbs and chunks.
W99-0629
and Features The CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004) supplied data sets for the semantic role labeling task with several levels of annotation apart from the role labels to be predicted.
