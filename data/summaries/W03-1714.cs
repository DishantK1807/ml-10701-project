Malouf (2002) and Sha and Pereira (2003) show that gradient-based algorithms, particularly limited memory variable metric (LMVM), require much less time to reach convergence, for some NLP tasks, than the iterative scaling methods (Della Pietra et al., 1997) previously used for log-linear optimisation problems.

Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).

A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).

This confirms our earlier hypothesis that humans are less likely to agree at high compression ratio and system performancewillalsosufferathighcompressionratio. TheconstancyofFTacrossdifferentcompressionratios is reasonable since FT scores should only depend on how well the unigram co-occurrence scoring method capturescontentoverlapbetweenafulltextanditsreference summaries and how likely humans use vocabularyoutsidetheoriginaldocument. 6 Conclusions In this paper we presented an empirical study of the potential and limitations of sentence extraction as a method of automatic text summarization. We showed thefollowing: (1) Howtouseoracleextractstoestimatetheperformance upper bound of sentence extraction methodsatdifferentextractlengths.Weunderstandthatsummariesoptimizedusingunigram co-occurrence score do not guarantee good quality in terms of coherence, cohesion, and overallorganization.However,wewouldargue thatagoodsummarydoesrequiregoodcontent andwewillleavehowtomakethecontentcohesive, coherent, and organized to future research.

This has been addressed by providing guided summarization tasks in DUC 2003 (DUC 2002). We guesstimate the gap should besmallerinDUC2003data.

(4) The potential performance gains (15% from E100 to E150 and 24% to FT) estimated by oracleextractsofdifferentsizesindicatedthat sentence compression or sub-sentence extractionarepromisingfuturedirections. (5) Therelativeperformanceofhumansandoracle extracts at three inter-human agreement intervalsshowedthatitwasonlymeaningfultooptimize sentence extraction algorithms if interhuman agreement was high. Although overall highinter-humanagreementwaslowbutsubsets of high inter-human agreement did exist. For example, about human achieved at least 60% agreement in 59 out of 303 (~19%) documentsof30sentencesorless. (6) We also studied how compression ratio affectedinter-humanagreementandsystemperformance, and the results supported our hypothesis that humans tend to agree less at high compression ratio, and similar between humansandsystems.Howtotakeintoaccount thisfactorinfuturesummarizationevaluations isaninterestingtopictopursuefurther.

In recent empirical studies on maximum entropy models and CRFs, limited memory variable metric (LMVM) has proven to be the most efficient method (Malouf, 2002; Wallach, 2002); accordingly, we have used LMVM for CRF estimation.

Parsing Using Cascaded Chunking (CaboCha) Our method is based on the cascaded chunking method (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) proposed as the CaboCha parser 1. CaboCha is a sort of shiftreduce parser and determines whether or not a segment depends on the next segment by using an 1 http://www.chasen.org/?taku/software/cabocha/ 225 SVM-based classifier.

Based on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown et al.(1993), the basic principle of our translation model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sentences, if two words often co-occur in the source and target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they are translations of each other.

These are parts of a feature set that many papers have referenced (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

Another body of related work is the literature on word clustering in computational linguistics (Brown et al.1992; Finch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grefenstette 1994a) and document clustering in information retrieval (van Rijsbergen 1979; Willett 1988; Sparck-Jones 1991; Cutting et al.1992). In contrast to this earlier work, we cluster contexts or, equivalently, word tokens here, not words (or, more precisely, word types) or documents.

Popular parsers are CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), which were developed to analyze formal written language expressions such as that in newspaper articles.
