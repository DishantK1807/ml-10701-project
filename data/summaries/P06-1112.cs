Relation Path Extraction We parse questions and candidate sentences with MiniPar (Lin, 1994), a fast and robust parser for grammatical dependency relations.
C94-1079
We use the same semantic path finding algorithm, relation weights and semantic similarity measure as (Moldovan and Novischi, 2002).
C02-1167
(Berger et al., 1996) gave a good description of ME model.
J96-1002
The model we use is similar to (Shen et al., 2005; Ravichandran et al., 2003), which regard answer extraction as a ranking problem instead of a classification problem.
