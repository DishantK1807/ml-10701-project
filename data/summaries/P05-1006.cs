(Lee and Ng, 2002) explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources and learning algorithms to WSD; they used Support Vector Machines (SVM) and included local collocations and syntactic relations, and also found that adding syntactic features improved accuracy.

In the case of role labels, only the 45 gold-standard labels found in PropBank were used, because the best automatic semantic role labelers only perform at about 84% precision and 75% recall (Pradhan et al., 2004).
N04-1030
In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the models, all sentences containing the target word were automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).

(Gomez, 2001) described an algorithm using WordNet to simultaneously determine verb senses and attachments of prepositional phrases, and iden48 tify thematic roles and adjuncts; our work is different in that it is trained on manually annotated corpora to show the relevance of semantic roles for verb sense disambiguation.

In addition, an automatic named entity tagger (Bikel et al., 1997) was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes.1 2.1 Topical features We categorized the possible model features into topical features and several types of local contextual features.

This is in comparison to the 61.1% accuracy achieved by (Lee and Ng, 2002), which has been the best published result on this corpus.
