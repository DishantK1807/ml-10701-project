The first sizable application of logic grammars was a Spanish/French-consultable data base system by Dahl (1977, 1981), which was later adapted to Portuguese l Visiting in the Computer Science Department, University of Kentucky, during part of this research.

This is contrary to what seems to be the general tendency today, both in theoretical linguistics (for example, Gazdar 1981) and in computational linguistics (for example, Hirshman and Puder 1982, Joshi and Levy 1982, Robinson American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 2, April-June 1983 79 Veronica Dahl and Michael C.

Pereira (1981); definite clause grammars (Pereira and Warren 1980) are a special case of metamorphosis grammars.

In the first place, they provide various advantages that have been illustrated in Dahl (1981), namely modularity and conciseness, clarity and efficiency.

It would also be interesting to include collective and respective readings of coordinated noun phrases, perhaps along the lines proposed in Dahl (1981).

Pereira's (1981) extraposition grammars (XGs), and MSGs can be compiled into XGs (which in turn can be compiled into Horn clause systems).

F. Pereira's (1981) extraposition grammars (XGs) are essentially generalizations of MGs designed to handle (left) extraposition.
