van Deemter (2000) discusses the generation of vague descriptions when entities have gradable attributes like size; for example, in a domain with four mice sized 2, 5, 7 and 10cm, it is possible to refer to the large mouse (the mouse sized 10cm) or the two small mice (the mice sized 2 and 5cm).

As our algorithm works in open domains, we were able to perform a corpus-based evaluation using the Penn WSJ Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

The Dale and Haddock (1991) algorithm allows for relational descriptions but involves exponential global search, or a greedy search approximation.

of Prior Approaches The incremental algorithm (Reiter and Dale, 1992) is the most widely discussed attribute selection algorithm.

Unlike in traditional generation, the starting point in 1The predicate dog1 is selected because it has a distinguished status, referred to as type in Reiter and Dale (1992).

The table below compares the computational complexity of an optimal algorithm (such as Reiter (1990)), our algorithm and the IA.

Subsequent work on referring expression generation has expanded the logical framework to allow reference by negation (the dog that is not black) and references to multiple entities (the brown or black dogs) (van Deemter, 2002), explored different search algorithms for nding the minimal description (e.g., Horacek (2003)) and offered different representation frameworks like graph theory (Krahmer et al., 2003) as alternatives to AVMs.
