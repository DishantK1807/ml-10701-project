The system modules that we collected information from were the acoustic processer/automatic speech recognizer (ASR) (Riccardi and Gorin, to appear), the natural language understanding (NLU) module (Gorin et al., 1997), and the dialogue manager (DM) (Abella and Gorin, 1999).

The different prompt features for initial prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and subdialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frustrating for callers and that callers are likely to hyperarticulate when they have to repeat themselves, which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al., 1992; Levow, 1998).

Research prototypes exist for applications such as personal email and calendars, travel and restaurant information, and personal banking (Baggia et al., 1998; Walker et al., 1998; Seneff et al., 1995; Sanderman et al., 1998; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999) inter alia.

Once the task has been determined, the information needed for completing the caller's request is obtained using dialogue submodules that are specific for each task (Abella and Gorin, 1999).

System and Data HMIHY is a spoken dialogue system based on the notion of call routing (Gorin et al., 1997; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999).

The use of running tallies and percentages is based on the assumption that these features are likely to produce generalized predictors (Litman et al., 1999).

Our work builds on earlier research on learning to identify dialogues in which the user experienced poor speech recognizer performance (Litman et al., 1999).
