The natural language processing and story conversion pipeline are improvements over a pipeline that was shown to successfully compare stories in a manner similar to a teacher (Halpin et al., 2004).

2. The words are tagged for their part of speech using the CandC tagger (Clark and Curran, 2004) and the Penn Treebank tagset.

Current work in story understanding is focusing on the use of logical forms, yet these are not extracted from text automatically (Mueller, 2003).

Despite some recent advances in this direction (Bos et al., 2004), it is still the case that it is hard to obtain deep semantic analyses which are accurate enough to support logical inference (Lev et al., 2004).

The merging task is a more logic-based approach than similar techniques like information fusion used in multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999).

36 KRAQ06 for generic XML manipulation (LTXML (Thompson et al., 1997)) as well as NLP-specific XML tools (LT-TTT (Grover et al., 2000), LT-CHUNK (Finch and Mikheev, 1997)).

As mentioned at the beginning of this paper, the conversion of unrestricted text to some logical form has experienced a recent revival recently (Bos et al., 2004).

3. Pronoun resolution is carried out using the Glencova Pronoun Resolution algorithm (Halpin et al., 2004), based on a series of rules similar to the CogNIAC engine (Baldwin, 1997), but without gender informationbased rules since this is not provided by the Penn Treebank tagset.
