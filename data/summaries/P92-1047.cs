INTRODUCTION Among others, both Lakoff and Johnson (1980), and Fass (1991) divide metonymic expressions into several fixed patterns such as Part-For-Whole and Container-ForContent.

An analysis based on actual data allows us to establish a clear set of patterns and sub-groups, for example to decide whether we require either Producer-For-Product (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) or Artist-for-Artform (Fass 1991), or both of them.

Given the lack of such knowledge, our basic heuristics for treating metonymy are as follows: Even if some language shows the tendency of unacceptability, if one or more languages show acceptance in the group to which the expression belongs to in the result of the survey, the system should accept it for analysis, and come up with some metonymic reading using its inference mechanism (Iverson and Helmreich 1992, Fass 1991).

All of the 25 sentences which are used in the survey are taken from metonymy examples in English in previous works (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, Fass 1991, Yamanashi 1987).

The patterns of previous works (Fass 1991, Lakoff and 309 Johnson 1980, Yamanashi 1987) seem to be obtained from the intuition of the analysts.
