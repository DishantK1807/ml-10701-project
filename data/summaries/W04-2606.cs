We extracted from its class description (where one was available) and/or from the COMLEX Syntax dictionary (Grishman et al., 1994) all the SCFs taken by its member verbs.

Our subcategorization acquisition method, based on predominant sense heuristics, is less adequate for these verbs rather, a method based on word sense disambiguation and the use of multi3For the details of these measures and their application to this task see Korhonen and Krymolowski (2002).

We will also include in the classi cation statistical information concerning the relative likelihood of different classes, SCFs and alternations for verbs in corpus data, using e.g. the automatic methods proposed by McCarthy (2001) and Korhonen (2002).

This fairly comprehensive classi cation incorporates 163 different subcategorization frames (SCFs), a superset of those listed in the ANLT (Boguraev et al., 1987) and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries (Grishman et al., 1994).

Verb classes have proved useful in various (multilingual) natural language processing (NLP) tasks and applications, such as computational lexicography (Kipper et al., 2000), language generation (Stede, 1998), machine translation (Dorr, 1997), word sense disambiguation (Prescher et al., 2000), document classi cation (Klavans and Kan, 1998), and subcategorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002).

Our method for SCF acquisition (Korhonen, 2002) involves rst using the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) to acquire a putative SCF distribution for each test verb from corpus data.

Some experiments have been reported recently which indicate that it should be possible, in the future, to automatically supplement extant classi cations with novel verb classes and member verbs from corpus data (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003).
J01-3003 P03-1007 P03-1009 W02-1016
A minimum of 300 corpus occurrences per verb is required to yield a reliable SCF distribution for a polysemic verb with multiple SCFs (Korhonen, 2002).
W02-2014
Dang et al.(1998) have supplemented the taxonomy with intersective classes: special classes for verbs which share membership of more than one Levin class because of regular polysemy.
P98-1046
While these results demonstrate clearly that the new classes can be used to support a critical NLP task, the improvement over the baseline is not as impressive as that reported in (Korhonen, 2002) where Levin’s original classes are employed4.
W02-2014
Korhonen and Preiss (2003) have proposed such a method, but the method is not currently applicable to our test data.
P03-1007 P03-1009
While it is possible that the new classes require further adjustment until optimal accuracy can be obtained, it is clear that many of our test verbs (and verbs in our new classes in general) are more polysemic on average and thus more ‘dif cult’ than those employed by Korhonen (2002).
W02-2014
Although many of the test verbs are polysemic, we relied on the knowledge that the majority of English verbs have a single predominating sense in balanced corpus data (Korhonen and Preiss, 2003).
P03-1007 P03-1009
One can grasp this easily by looking at intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998), created by grouping together subsets of existing classes with overlapping members.
