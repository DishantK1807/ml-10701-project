This approach to text summarization was shown to be quite successful in the recent SUMMAC evaluation of text summarization systems (Mani et al., 1999; Buckley et al., 1999).

Our implementation of the NP-based QA system uses the Empire noun phrase finder, which is described in detail in Cardie and Pierce (1998).

The approach is able to achieve 94% precision and recall for base NPs derived from the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal (Marcus et al., 1993).

Although a number of methods for query-dependent text summarization are beginning to be developed and evaluated in a variety of realistic settings (Mani et al., 1999), we again propose the use of vector space methods from IR, which can be easily extended to the summarization task (Salton et al., 1994): 1.
