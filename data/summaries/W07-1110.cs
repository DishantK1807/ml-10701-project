Entropy Model We use the Maximum Entropy (ME) Model (Berger et al., 1996) for our classification task.

(Xue, 2006) uses the Chinese Nombank to label nominalizations in Chinese.

Kim et al.(2006b) found that the relation between a student?s posting behavior and the grade obtained by that student can be assessed automatically.

(Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use supervised methods and explore classification features from a simple structured type hierarchy.

(Dahl et al., 1987; Hull and Gomez, 1996) use hand-coded slot-filling rules to determine the semantic roles of the arguments of a nominalization.

The conditional log-linear feature combination framework (Berger, Della Pietra and Della Pietra, 1996) is remarkably simple and effective in practice.

(Kim and Baldwin, 2006) use a set of seed verbs to characterize the semantic relation between the constituent nouns and explores a parsed corpus to classify NCs.

(Pradhan et al., 2004) use a SVM classifier for the semantic role labeling of nominalizations in English and Chinese based on the FrameNet database and the Chinese PropBank respectively.

Compared to English, the main difficulty of using supervised method for Chinese, as noted by Xue (2006), is that the precision of current parsers of Chinese is very low due to the lack of morphology, difficulty in segmentation and lack of sufficient training materials in Chinese.

This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.(2006), but we use a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to determine parser actions, which makes parsing extremely fast.

Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt) (Berger et al., 1996) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) were used to build the classifiers in our solution.

The same argument applies to the automatic assessment of product review usefulness (Kim et al., 2006c): 125 Stars Label on the website Number star Poor Post 1251 starstar Below Average Post 44 starstarstar Average Post 69 starstarstarstar Above Average Post 183 starstarstarstarstar Excellent Post 421 Table 1: Categories and their usage frequency.

74 3 Semantic Relations Although verb nominalization is commonly considered to have arguments as the verb predicate, Xue(2006) finds that there tend to be fewer arguments and fewer types of adjuncts in verb nominalizations compared to verb predicates in Chinese.

where li is the next BIO tag, li?? is the previous BIO tag, S is the target sentence, and fj and lj are feature functions and parameters of a log-linear model (Berger et al., 1996).

(Keller and Lapata, 2003) show that Web page counts and n-gram frequency counts are highly correlated in a log scale.

of the previous studies (Kim et al., 2004; Okanohara et al., 2006; Tzong-Han Tsai et al., 2006), features of shallow parsers had a large contribution to the performance.
