(Collins, 1999; Nivre, 2006)) and formal grammar-based parsers integrating statistics (e.g.
E06-1010
The hand-written grammar, which includes rules for most types of questions, fares relatively well on this domain since questions are rare in the Penn Treebank (see (Hermjakob, 2001)).
W01-1203
We have developed a parsing system that explores this space, in the vein of systems like (Kaplan et al., 2004), using a linguistic competence grammar and a probabilistic performance disambiguation allowing us to explore interactions between lexicon and grammar (Sinclair, 1996).
N04-1013
We have argued in (Schneider, 2005) that LFG f-structures can be parsed for in a completely context-free fashion, except for embedded WH-questions, where a device such as functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Zaenen, 1989) or the equivalent Tree-Adjoining Grammar Adjoining operation (Joshi and Vijay-Shanker, 1989) is used.
E89-1037 P89-1027
(Hindle and Rooth, 1993) exploit the fact that in sentence-initial NP PP sequences the PP unambiguously attaches to the noun.
J93-1005
In Dependency Grammar, this device is also known as lifting (Kahane et al., 1998; Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).
P05-1013 P98-1106
(Miyao et al., 2005; Riezler et al., 2002)).
P02-1035
We have achieved average results in the CoNLL domain adaptation track open submission (Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Kulick et al., 2004; MacWhinney, 2000; Brown, 1973).
J93-2004 W04-3111
We use a hand-written competence grammar, combined with performance-driven disambiguation obtained from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
