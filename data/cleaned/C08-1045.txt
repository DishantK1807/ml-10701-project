Abstract
To realize high quality machine transla-
tion, we proposed a Non-Compositional
Language Model, and developed a sen-
tence pattern dictionary of 226,800 pat-
tern pairs for Japanese compound and
complex sentences consisting of 2 or 3
clauses. In pattern generation from a par-
allel corpus, Compositional Constituents
that could be generalized were 74% of
independent words, 24% of phrases and
only 15% of clauses. This means that
in Japanese-to-English MT, most of the
translation results as shown in the parallel
corpus could not be obtained by methods
based on Compositional Semantics. This
dictionary achieved a syntactic coverage of
98% and a semantic coverage of 78%. It
will substantially improve translation qual-
ity.
1 Introduction
A wide variety of machine translation (MT) meth-
ods are being studied(Nagao, 1996; Brown et al.,
1990; Vogel et al., 2003), but to obtain high-quality
translations between languages belonging to dif-
ferent families that are alien each other is diffi-
cult. Most practical systems still employ a trans-
fer method based on compositional semantics. A
problem with this method is that it produces trans-
lations by separating the syntactic structure from
meaning, and is thus liable to lose the meaning of
the source text.

Better translation quality can be expected from
pattern-based MT and example-based MT where
the syntactic structure and semantics are handled
together. However, pattern-based MT require im-
mense pattern dictionaries that are difficult to de-
velop(Jung et al., 1999; Uchino et al., 2001).
Meanwhile, example-based MT(Nagao, 1984;
Sato, 1992; Brown, 1999) obtains translation re-
sults by substituting semantically similar elements
in structurally matching translation examples, so
a pre-prepared pattern dictionary is not needed.
However, the capability to substitute a constituent
in an example changes from one example to the
next, and to automate this judgement is impossi-
ble. This problem could be addressed by manually
tagging each example beforehand to specify which
constituents can be substituted, but the resulting
method would be just another pattern-based trans-
lation method.
Attention has been focused on the use of cog-
nitive grammar(Langacker, 1987) and construc-
tion grammar(Fillmore, 1988) in the search to find
methods that might help to resolve this problem.
However, the standards for determining the struc-
tural meaning units and the granularity needed for
meaning analysis have not been clarified.
As a method in which the syntactic structure and
meaning are dealt with as an integral whole, a sen-
tence pattern (SP)-dictionary called A-Japanese
Lexicon has already been developed for Japanese
simple sentences(Ikehara et al., 1997). This dictio-
nary includes 14,800 valency patterns. The trans-
lation quality of Japanese simple sentences into
English was 90% and this could be improved up to
97% by additional pattern pairs(Kanadechi et al.,
2003).
Therefore in this study we developed an SP-
dictionary for translating compound and complex
353
sentences. First we proposed a Non-compositional
Language model (NL-model) and a method for cre-
ating sentence patterns. Based on these, we built
a large scale SP-dictionary from a parallel corpus
through the generalization of compositional con-
stituents.
2 Language
Model
Conventional MT methods are based on the con-
cept of compositional semantics. However, real
languages have many expressions to which this
concept cannot be applied. Solving this problem
requires finding a mechanism acquiring the mean-
ing of entire expressions before their constituents
are analyzed.
2.1 Expressions
and Constituents
Arita(1987) has pointed out that humans employ a
framework of expressions (semantic structure) in
their mother tongue in the process of conceptualiz-
ing objects. In the semantic structure that come to
mind during the process when a speaker is forming
a concept, two types of constituents to be consid-
ered those that cause the overall meaning to be lost
when other constituents are substituted for them,
and those that do not cause the overall meaning to
be lost when an alternative constituent is substi-
tuted for them. Based on this idea, we derived the
following definitions.
Definition 1: Types of constituents:
A compositional constituent (C-constituent) is de-
fined as the constituent for which there are one
or more alternative constituents and for which the
meaning of a semantic structure does not change
when this constituent is substituted. Any other
constituent is defined as non-compositional con-
stituent (N-constituent).
Definition 2: Types of expressions:
A compositional expression (C-expression) is de-
fined as an expression that consists entirely of C-
constituents, and a non-compositional expression
(N-expression) is defined as an expression that has
one or more N-constituents.
Before we applying these definitions to actual
linguistic expressions, we need to clarify what we
mean by “the meaning of a semantic structure.”
This is very important problem for semantic anal-
ysis, because the guranularity needed for semantic
analysis is determined by the way of the meaning
defiition.
In this study, considering applications to
Japanese-to-English MT, the meaning of Japanese
semantic structures defined in terms of English se-
mantic structures.1
Figure 1 shows an example. The source text
is a Japanese expression expressing a relation-
ship between two events: “directly after some
event happened, somebody performed some ac-
tion,” and this meaning is defined by the English
expression. For individual constituents such as
“she” and “college,” there are domains of substi-
tutable constituents with which they can be substi-
tuted without changing the English semantic struc-
ture, so these constituents are classified into C-
constituents.
2.2 Characteristics
of C-constituents
From the above definitions, we can see that a C-
constituent possesses the following characteristics.
From these characteristics, possible guidelines for
pattern-forming can be obtained.
#1: The number and the scope of C-constituents
depends on the language used for defining the
meanings of expressions.
#2: C-constituents need to be independent of each
other.
#3: The domain of alternatives for a C-constituent
is syntactically and semantically limited.
#4: Whether a constituent is compositional de-
pends on the way it is articulated.
#5: C-constituents are defined in relation to the
entire expression. Many times these expres-
sions consist of plural words, and some of
them are N-expressions.
2.3 Non-compositional Language Model
According to definition 1, any linguistic expres-
sion consists of zero or more C-constituents and
one or more N-constituents. The scope of these
constituents can be arbitrarily selected. Then, we
assume that C-constituents are extracted from ex-
pressions with a meaningful range (e.g., a word,
phrase or clause). The C-constituent extracted in
1In this way, when the meaning of a linguistic expression
is defined in another natural language, semantic ambiguity oc-
curs in the language used in the definition. However, in the
case of MT, the meaning of the translation results is under-
stood by a speaker of the target language, so it is not thought
to constitute a problem.

this way may itself also be a N-expression ac-
cording to characteristic #5, so a linguistic expres-
sion can generally be expressed with the language
model designated as the NL-model in Figure 2.
As this figure shows, when C-constituents are
repeatedly extracted from an N-expression, the
end result is an N-expression that contains no C-
constituent. Although the resulting N-expression
may just be a single word, it could also be an
idiomatic phrase that has no substitutable con-
stituents. Thus, in NL-model, linguistic expres-
sions can finally be articulated into N-constituents
and N-expressions.
The difference from conventional Composi-
tional Language model (CL-model) is in that NL-
model does not assumes that all of expressions can
be articulated into only C-constituents2.
3 Pattern
Forming
3.1 Principles
of Pattern-forming
Not only words but also meaningful expression
units such as phrases and sentences represent con-
cepts, and the semantic structures of these ex-
pressions represent higher order concepts(Ikehara,
2003). Then, if we develop a pattern dictionary
of semantic structures for expressions, higher or-
der concept can be taken out of each expression by
pattern matching.
An important aspect of the NL-model is that the
N-expressions that appear at each stage of the de-
composition are meaningful expression units. In
2Translations by matching larger text unit are used in con-
ventional MT including recent phrase-based SMT. But it is
only that they regard phrases as C-constituents. The fact re-
mains that entire expression is regarded as C-expression.
this process, loss of the original meaning can be
avoided by using a semantic dictionary for N-
expressions at each stage. For example, if lin-
guistic expressions are classified into sentences,
clauses and phrases, and pattern dictionaries are
prepared for N-expressions at each of these levels,
then this would provide a mechanism for scooping
up the meaning of entire sentences.
We think that patterns are a suitable framework
for expressing the structure of N-expressions, be-
cause:
(a) N-constituents cannot be replaced by any
other constituent, so a literal description is ap-
propriate,
(b) the order of constituents is not flexible and
often fixed.
Therefore, in this study we use a patternforming
approach for N-expressions.
The Japanese-to-English parallel corpus is a typ-
ical example in which the meaning of Japanese
expressions is defined by English expressions.
Pattern pairs were therefore produced for N-
expressions in the parallel corpus by extracting C-
constituents and generalizing them.
When a parallel corpus is used, the following
two types of constituents need to be considered as
C-constituents:
(1) the constituent to which there is a semanti-
cally corresponding constituent in the English
expression,
(2) the constituent to which there is no corre-
sponding constituent in English, but deleting

3.2 Pattern
Description Language
A pattern description language was designed to
achieve the following aims:
a) patterns can be semi-automatically generated
from the result of morphological analysis of a
parallel corpus, and
b) patterns can be defined according to the degree
of generalization.
Here, a) is important in that it allows the develop-
ment of large-scale SP-dictionaries. This condition
also means that there is no need for syntactic or
semantic analysis when comparing the input text
with the SP-dictionary. If these analyses were re-
quired, problems would occur due to vagueness of
interpretation, and the significance of the pattern
method would be halved.
The descriptors used in this language are
shown in Table 1. They are divided into
four classes: literals, variables, functions, and
symbols. As a rule, C-constituents are de-
clared using variables(independent constituents),
functions(subordinate constituents), and sym-
bols(structural constituents), while N-constituents
are declared by using the literal of words.
Constituents of a pattern are classified as either
essential or optional. An essential constituent is
one without which it would be impossible to de-
fine a corresponding relationship with the English
pattern. An optional constituent is one that allows
a corresponding English pattern to be defined even
when it is omitted.
Optional constituents are further classified into
two types. One type contains constituents that can
be omitted from both the English and Japanese ex-
pression. The other contains constituents that do
not appear in either the English or the Japanese ex-
pression, but these constituents can be inserted into
those expressions.
3.3 Generalization
of C-constituents
(1) Generalization by Variables
According to the characteristics of #3, when gen-
eralizing C-constituents by variables, the domain
of a variable needs to be specified by syntactic
attributes and semantic attributes. A syntactic at-
tribute is represented by a variable name and a se-
mantic attribute is represented by an argument at-
tached to the variable. Attentions need to be paid
to the following points in this generalization.
(a) A C-constituent may itself be an N-
expression.
(b) Corresponding English constituents do not
necessarily have the same syntactic attributes.
(2) Generalization by Functions
Conjugated forms of words that have been con-
verted into variables are specified by a word form
function when necessary. Also, particles and sub-
ordinate words such as auxiliary verbs are speci-
fied using a Tense aspect modality function when
necessary.
(3) Generalization by Symbols
Fluctuations in expressions are also C-
constituents. These are declared using symbols.
Symbols are also used to specify omitted sub-
jects and objects when necessary. The optional
constituents mentioned in section 3.2(2) are also
C-constituents and word order that do not change

C-constituents, and are declared with a symbol.
(4) Higher-level Generalization
Fine-grained generalization is performed by, for
example, using equal-value group functions and
corresponding group functions whereby multiple
functions are grouped together, or by using literal
functions to apply fine constraints to the domains
of variables. The declaration of English patterns is
also simplified by using macro functions to synthe-
size a wide variety of English constructions such as
so-that constructions.
4 Development
of SP-dictionary
(1) Pattern Generation Process
A parallel corpus for basic compound and complex
sentences with two or three clauses was prepared,
and this corpus was generalized to produce a SP-
dictionary as follows.
Step 1: Creation of parallel corpus:
A parallel corpus consisting of 1 million sentence
pairs was created from about 30 types of docu-
ments.
Step 2: Extraction of translation examples:
From the results of morphological analysis of this
corpus, we extracted 150,000 target example sen-
tences. Analytical errors were corrected manually.
Step 3: Pattern generation:
Using resources such as Japanese-English word
dictionaries, semantically corresponding relation-
ships were found and converted into variables,
functions, and symbols in the following three steps:
(a) Word-level generalization:
Compositional independent words are con-
verted into word variables.
(b) Phrase-level generalization:
Compositional phrases are converted into
phrase variables.
(c) Clause-level generalization:
Compositional clauses are converted into
clause variables.
For C-constituents that can be automatically rec-
ognized, the generalization is performed automat-
ically, while cases that cannot be judged automati-
cally are entrusted to a language analyst. Example
of patterns produced in this way are shown in Table
2.
(2) Number of Generated Patterns

the resulting SP-dictionary. The number of pat-
terns was largest for word-level patterns, followed
by phrase-level and clause-level patterns. The
number of patterns created at the clause level was
particularly small.
(3) Ratio of C-constituents
Table 4 shows the number of constituents con-
verted into variables at each level of generaliza-
tion. The ratio of generalized C-constituents was
74% at the word level and 24% at the phrase level,
but just 15% at the clause level. This means that
most of the clauses in the parallel corpus are N-
constituents, which are impossible to generalize.
Acoodingly a semantically suitable translation
as found in a parallel corpus cannot be obtained
when N-constituents are extracted, translated, and
incorporated into an original sentence.
5 Coverage
of SP-dictionary
In the Pattern method based on NL-model, it is
very important to know whether a pattern dictio-
nary that cover most of the semantic structures can
be developed.
(1) Experimental Conditions
We produced a program (pattern parser) to com-
pare input sentences against the SP-dictionary, and
used it for evaluations.
Ten thousand sentences that we randomly se-
lected from the example sentences were used for
creating the patterns and used in experiments.
Since the input sentences will always match the
patterns from which they were created, experi-
ments were conducted in the manner of cross-
validation.
Normally more than one pattern matches to an
input sentence, and not all of them are necessarily

correct in semantics. Therefore, the coverage was
evaluated according to the following two parame-
ters:
 Syntactic coverage: The ratio of input sen-
tences that are matched to at least one pattern.
 Semantic coverage: The ratio of input sen-
tences for which there is one or more seman-
tically correct pattern.
(2) Saturation of Syntactic Coverage
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the num-
ber of patterns and the syntactic coverage at the
word, phrase, and clause levels. As the number
of patterns increases, syntactic coverage saturates
rapidly.
In the case of simple sentences, it was reported
that the number of valency patterns required to
cover all of them more or less completely was es-
timated to be 25 thousands(Shirai et al., 1995).
When the patterns are rearranged in order of
their frequency of matching, the saturation speed
in Figure 3 becomes about five times faster. Then,
we would expect the number of required patterns
for compound and complex sentences to be some-
where in the tens of thousands or thereabouts as is
the case of simple sentences.
(3) Evaluation of Coverage
Figure 4 shows the results of our evaluation of the
coverage of the SP-dictionary. The results show
that the whole dictionary covered almost all input
sentences. However, many cases of matches to se-
mantically inappropriate patterns occurred, and the
semantic coverage decreased to 78% when these
were eliminated.

Figure 5 shows the ratio of patterns that are
used when they are selected based on this se-
quence. As this figure shows, overall semantic
coverage is considered to be high enough for prac-
tical use. The achievement of such a large-scale
SP-dictionary is unprecedented in the world.
6 Summary
We proposed a NL-model and a pattern forming
method based on the model. We also developed
an SP-dictionary of basic Japanese compounds and
complex sentences that contains 227,000 pattern
pairs.
The important aspects of NL-model is in that
this model provides the standards for determin-
ing the structural meaning units and granularity
needed for meaning analysis.
According to our evaluation, the ratios of C-
constituents that could be generalized by variables
were 74% for independent words and 24% for
359
phrases, while that for clauses was only 15%. This
means that in Japanese to English MT, high quality
translations for compound and complex sentences
as found in a parallel corpus cannot be obtained
with methods based on Compositional Semantics.
We also found that the syntactic coverage of the
SP-dictionary was 98%, and the semantic cover-
age was 78%. These coverages are considered to
be high enough for practical use.
The SP-dictionary is aimed at the translation of
N-expressions. For C-expressions, conventional
MT methods can be applied, so we expect that
translation quality will be substantially improved
by incorporating this dictionary into conventional
MT systems
The patterns can be used as a mesh for scooping
up the entire meaning of expressions. We also ex-
pect that they will be used for semantic analysis in
a wide range of applications other than MT.
