However, the way that seems most appealing is how (Gabsdil & Lemon, 2004) and (Hacioglu & Ward, 2001) re-rank N-Best lists based on dialogue context achieving a considerable improvement in recognition performance.

An approach taken both in dialogue systems and dictation applications is to first write an interpretation grammar and from that generate an artificial corpus which is used as training corpus for the SLM (Raux et al, 2003; Pakhomov et al, 2001; Fosler-Lussier & Kuo, 2001).

A different approach is to compile the interpretation grammar into a speech recognition grammar as the Gemini and REGULUS compilers do (Rayner et al, 2000; Rayner et al, 2003).

This has lead to the idea of trying to combine both approaches, as shown in (Rayner & Hockey, 2003).
