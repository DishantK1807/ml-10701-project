This formalism, used in the implementation of TACITUS (Hobbs, 1986-2), accommodates a large variety of discourse inferences and, moreover, provides an elegant manner of localizing ambiguities, as was shown in (Bear and Hobbs, 1988).
A88-1032 H86-1003
To be able to assess the availability for reference resolution, they search for the presence of A and B in the list of forwardlooking centers of the previous sentences (thus using the functional centering framework defined in (Grosz et al., 1995)).

The interpretation of the ATT$ utterances is performed in the logical language imposed by the implementation in the DELPHI system (Bobrow et al., 1991).
H91-1033
Every synset is associated with a gloss, representing a textual definition, that can be translated in a logical form following the notation introduced in (Hobbs, 1986-1).
H86-1003
To be able to have computational access to the gloss semantic, synset definitions have been translated into logical formulae inspired by notation proposed in (Hobbs, 1986-1) and implemented in TAClTUS.
H86-1003
To evaluate this methodology of deriving metonymic coercions, a test set of 20 New York Times articles were parsed by FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1993) and used in conjunction with their coreference keys, as provided by the MUC test data.
M93-1019
Following the lessons learned from the WordNetbased inference of Gricean implicatures, reported in (Harabagiu et al., 1996), a novel methodology of producing metonymic paths was devised.
P96-1051
of metonymic coercions Stallard proposed in (Stallard, 1993) a distinction between two kinds of metonymy: (1) referential raetonymy, in which the referent of a nominal predicate argument requires coercion and (2) predicative metonymy, featuring the coercion of the predicate usually corresponding to a verbal lexicalization.
P93-1012
A similar path-finding methodology for deriving metonymies was used by the met* system (Fass, 1991), in which connections between the sense frames of textual concepts are retrieved from a lexicon of the size of 500 word senses.
J91-1003
The interpretation of this prepositional relation is produced when it is matched against WordNetbased classes of prepositional attachments collected from large treebanks, following the methodology described in (Harabagiu, 1996).

(Markerr and Hahn, 1997), (Fass, 1991) (Hobbs.

This prompts Stallard to state that "predicative I (Or), (Q2), ({~LFt) and (qLF2) are borrowed from (StaJlard, 1993) 143 metonymy can be loosely thought of as coercion of a predicate place, rather than that of the argument NP itself".
