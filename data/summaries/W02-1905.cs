Examples of the use of NLP and IE in Question Answering include shallow parsing (Kupiec, 1993), semantic parsing (Litkowski 1999), Named Entity tagging (Abney et al.2000, Srihari and Li 1999) and high-level IE (Srihari and Li, 2000).

It is worth noticing that in our experiment, the structural support used for answer-point identification only checks the binary links involving the asking point and the candidate answer points, instead of full template matching as proposed in (Srihari and Li, 2000).

QA is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or URLs, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction (IE) (Chinchor and Marsh 1998, Hovy, Hermjakob and Lin 2001, Li and Srihari 2000).
