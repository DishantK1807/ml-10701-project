However, advances in the area of automatic thesaurus discovery (Grefenstette, 1994) as well as progress in the area of automatic merger of machine readable dictionaries (Sanfilippo & Poznanski, 1992; Chang & Chen, 1997) indicate that availability of the lexical resources needed may gradually improve in the future.

Resnik (1995a) defines the semantic similarity between two words as the entropy value of the most informative concept subsuming the two words in a hierarchically structured thesaurus.

The reduction of input data requirements offers a significant advantage compared with methods such as those presented in Brown et al.(1991), Gale et al.(1992), Yarowsky (1995), and Karol & Edelman (1996) where strong reliance on statistical techniques for the calculation of word and context similarity commands large source corpora.

Although the assessment of semantic similarity using a dictionary database as knowledge source has been recognized as providing significant cues for word clustering (Resnik 1995b) and the determination of lexical cohesion (Morris & Hirst, 1991), its relevance for word disambiguation in running text remains relatively unexplored.
