Nigam and Hurst’s (2004) work on detecting opinions about a certain topic presages our notion of connecting attitudes to targets, while Popescu and Etzioni’s (2005) opinion mining technique also fits well into our framework.

The use of multiple text classifiers by Wiebe and colleagues (Wilson et al., 2005; Wiebe et al., 2004) for various kinds of sentiment classification can also be viewed as a sentencelevel technique for analyzing appraisal expressions.

Mullen and Collier’s (2004) notion of classifying appraisal terms using a multidimensional set of attributes is closely tied to the definition of an appraisal expression, which is classified along several dimensions.

We used an implementation of Brill’s (1992) part-of-speech tagger to find adjectives and modifiers; for parsing, we used the Stanford dependency parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).

Much of this work has utilized the fundamental concept of ‘semantic orientation’, (Turney, 2002); however, sentiment analysis still lacks a ‘unified field theory’.

Sentiment analysis includes a variety of different problems, including: sentiment classification techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative, based on bag of words (Pang et al., 2002) or positive and negative words (Turney, 2002; Mullen and Collier, 2004); classifying sentences in a document as either subjective or objective (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004); identifying or classifying appraisal targets (Nigam and Hurst, 2004); identifying the source of an opinion in a text (Choi et al., 2005), whether the author is expressing the opinion, or whether he is attributing the opinion to someone else; and developing interactive and visual opinion mining methods (Gamon et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

In this regard, we will be examining extension of existing methods for automatically building lexicons of positive/negative words (Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) to the more complex task of estimating also attitude type and force.
