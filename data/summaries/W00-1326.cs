In the course of extending available data, the efforts to use corpora tagged by independent teams of researchers have been shown to fail (Ng et al., 1999), as have failed some tuning experiments (Escudero et al., 2000), and an attempt to use examples automatically acquired from the Internet (Agirre & Martinez, 2000).

â€¢ Collocations for fine-gained word-senses are sensibly weaker than those reported by Yarowsky (1993) for two-way ambiguous words.

The sentences in the DSO collection were tagged with parts of speech using TnT (Brants, 2000) trained on the Brown Corpus itself.

used The DSO collection (Ng and Lee, 1996) focuses on 191 frequent and polysemous words (nouns and verbs), and contains around 1,000 sentences per word.

These collocations have been used in other word sense disambiguation research and are also referred to as features (Gale et al., 1993; Ng & Lee, 1996; Escudero et al., 2000).

Compared to Yarowsky (1993), who also took into account grammatical relations, we only share the content-word-to-left and the content-word-to-right collocations.

It is not clear how the smoothing technique proposed in (Yarowsky, 1993) could be extended to nway ambiguities.

Introduction In the early nineties two famous papers claimed that the behavior of word senses in texts adhered to two principles: one sense per discourse (Gale et al., 1992) and one sense per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993).
