Our method is obtained by extending Shinzato’s method (Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004) where a common hypernym for expressions in itemizations in HTML documents is obtained by using statistical measures.

To derive co-occurrence vectors, we parsed the documents by using a downgraded version of an existing parser (Kanayama et al., 2000) and collected co-occurrences from the parsing results.

Hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various NLP systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999; Imasumi, 2001; Fleischman et al., 2003; Morin and Jacquemin, 2003; Ando et al., 2003).

1As in Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004, we used the search engine “goo.” (http://www.goo.ne.jp).

(See Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004 for more details.) Recall that in Step 3, the ranked pairs of an HCS and its common hypernym are obtained.

In a similar attempt, Shinzato and Torisawa proposed an automatic method to obtain a common hypernym of expressions in the same itemizations in HTML documents (Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004) by using statistical measures such as document frequencies and inverse document frequencies.

This selection was made to eliminate the itemizations located extremely far from the given hypernyms and to keep the number of itemizations close to 2,000, which was the number of itemizations used in Shinzato and Torisawa, 2004.
