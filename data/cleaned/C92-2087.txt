Logical Form of Hierarchical Relation on Verbs and Extracting it from Definition Sentences in a Japanese Dictionary Yoichi TOMIUR.A *, Teigo NAKAMUItA *, Toru HITAKA * and Sho YOSHIDA ** • Department of Computer Science and Communication Engineering, Kyushu University Fukuoka, 812, JAPAN • * Department of Artificial Intelligence, Kyushu Institute of Technology Iizuka, 820, JAPAN ABSTRACT We are studying how to extract hierarchical relation on verbs from definition sentences in a Japanese dictionary.
The hierarchical relation on verbs has been dealt with as a binary relation on verbs, but it should be dealt with as logical relation on predicates.
We will define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs and then discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence represents that relation.
We will call the main predicate verb in this part the definition verb.
Furthermore we will describe how to semiautomatically select the proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence between cases of an entry verb and the definition verb in order to extract the hierarchical relation as logical relation.
1 Introduction
The syntactic processing has been playing the main role in a natural language processing system.
But we have come to know that we can't construct a practical system with only this processing and that the semantic processing is necessary for it.
Inference plays an important role in the semantic processing, we therefore need a large knowledge base about meaning of words and we must treat it as logical relation.
Hierarchical relation between words is inevitable and transitive, and it is a important relation in the large knowledge base.
Because inevitable relation holds at any time and the reliability of conclusions inferred from it doesn't fall down and transitive relation can be described efficiently.
There were some researches on extracting the hierarchical relation between words from definition sentences in a ordinary dictionary\[I\]\[2\]\[3\]\[4 l.
But they treated it as only binary relation between words.
Verbs correspond to n-ary predicates on entities and we therefore must describe the correspondence between the variables (that is case or syntactic role) of a subordinate verb and ones of its superordinate verb.
But this correspondence can't be described if the relation is treated as binary relation between words.
We will propose how to extract the hierarchical relation with a logical form on verbs from definition sentences in a Japanese dictionary.
Firstly, we will define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs and then discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence represents that relation.
We will call the main predicate verb in this part the definition verb.
Secondly, we will describe how to semiautomatically select the proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence between the variables of an entry verb and ones of the ~lefinition verb.
Lastly, we will report about the result of a experiment to extract the ACTES DE COLING-92.

A verb will be corresponded to the n-ary predicate according to a pattern of cases (syntactic roles).
Considering the polysemy of verbs, each meaning of a siugle verb must correspond to the distinct predicate.
For example, "~-~ & "(love) as first meaning is used with the form of "x~ $~ x2 '~ ~ ~"(xt love x~) * aa~d corresponds to '~-~)~ 1 (Xl, X2)'.
Furthermore, we will not deal with intensional verbs in this paper.
2 Logical
Form of Hierarchical Relation on Verbs Verbs correspond to predicates on entities.
If VL(rh,...,~,~) is the subordinate predicate of vU(~x,...,~,,), both predicates have the same arity ( i.e. m = n ), there is a one-to-one correspondence ¢ from {1, ..-,n} to {1, ...,n}, and if VL(~I, "",~n) is true, Vv(~f(U,...,~O(n) ) is also true at the same time.
That is, W \[VL(x) D VV(~)\], (1) where boldface ~e stands for a tuple of variables.
Strictly speaking, the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs is (1).
For example, "fiktr 1" is the subordinate verb of "~F,5 1"To describe this logically, Vz~x~ \[~ ~(x~, x~) ~ ~ • ~(x~, z~)\], where '~ 1 (rh, ~1~)' means that r/~ drink ~12 and '~A~,5 ~ (Yl, r~2)' means that ~\]1 take 712.
But there are v L and v U such that some arguments in vL(~h,...,~,~) don't correspond to any arguments in Vu((t, • "',(m) or some in Vu((I, "" ',(,n) don't correspond to any arguments in VL(rlx, ...,tin), although v L is a subordinate verb of v ~.
In this case, we conclude that the predicate denoted by 9yV~(~,y) is a subordinate one of the predicate denoted by qzVU(~e, z).
Therefore, by generalizing (1), we get • Syntactic role is represented by meazts of a postpo~ition, such as "7) 9, and "~", in Japanese.
that is, We expand (2) further to restrict the domain of z, and define the logical form of the hierarchical relation on verbs as follows.
Definition I v L is a subordinate verb of v v, if for some N w~ \[v~(~,~)~ N(~)^ V~(~,~)\], where bohlface N stands for a tuple of predicate letters and N(z) means Nl(Zl) A...
A N,(z,,).
A small letter, such as n, v, and v L, stands for a linguistic expression and a capital letter, such as N, V, and V L, stands for the predicate symbol corresponding to the linguistic expression represented by its small letter.
I~br example, "~ 5 1" is a subordinate verb of "~ rY 7., 1" because the following formula holds, Vxy3z\[i~ 5 l (y, x) 7J~:~J ~ (z) A '~ ~ 7o 1 (x, z)\], where ~ "3 1(r/1, r/2) : r/2 is irrigated by r/l, ff.~ (7/) : r/is moisture, ;~ff~7~ 1(~/1,r/2) : rll take on r/2.

For example, the definition sentence for "~tr 1 "(drink) is "~ ¢~/.# 7o l'(to take a drink) and the definition sentence for "il~ 5 1" is "TJ~ ~ o~d ~) & ~:tY'5 1"(to take on moisture fully).

We call the main predicate verb of a definition sentence the definition verb.
If the definition sentence of a entry verb v e corresponds to N(,~) A Yd(,~), (3) then we can easily derive the hierarchical relation between v* and its definition verb v d from Definition 2.
In this paragraph, we assume that the meaning of the definition verb has been selected correctly and we will omit the number of the meaning of definition verbs.
How to select it will be given in 8.2.
A definition sentence does not always correspond to the logical form as (3).
But if we can get the sentence s ~ which is a part of the definition sentence s and corresponds to the logical form as (3) and S D S d, then we can also derive the hierarchical relation between the entry verb and the definition verb.
We call s ~ the hierarchical expression in a definition sentence (HED).
Now, we will discuss which part of the syntactic structure of the definition sentence is HED.
Definition 3 We get rid of modifiers out of a simple sentence s.
We call the rest of s the kernel sentence s ~ of s.
Since there isn't a expression corresponding to a universal quantifier in the definition sentence of a verb, we can conclude the following characteristic.
Characteristic 1 lf s ~ is the kernel sentence of a simple sentence s, then S D S ~ and the logical form of ~* is (3).
For example, the kernel sentence of "~ © ~i ~--I~ lz~JT"(to kill a pain in the body temporally) is "~ ~'Y"(to kill a pain) and its logical form is a~d the following formula holds, V?\]1~2~8\[S(~1,7J2,718) 3 where S(711, r\]~, 7/8) is the formula corresponding to "~©~i~¢¢--I~=~T" and means that 112 is a pain, 7/s is a body, and ~\]1 kill 7/2 in ~/3 temporally.
'~ (r/)' means that ~/is a pain.
~T Qh,r/2)' means that 711 kill ~/2.
There is a sentence s which satisfies the following characteristic.
Characteristic 2 A sentence s includes a sentence s ~ and S D S'.
If the definition sentence s of a verb is complex, then s satisfies Characteristic 2 and s * is its main clause.
For example, the main clause of the sentence "~¢~ ~ ~ J: 5 ~zt~~3" (something adheres to X as it covers X) is "~ ~,~ ~ ;5 "(something adheres to), and it corresponds to the following formula, ~, (~) A ~'~~ (~1,~), and the following formula holds, V~l~\[s(~, ~) where S(~\]l,r/~) is the formula corresponding to "~;O~ ~ .~ 3: ~) {:~T.~,, and means that something rh adhere to r/2 as r/1 covers r/~, '~fi~ 0l)' means that ~/ is something, and '{'~ T ~ 0/1, r/~)' means that r/1 adhere to r/~.
Meaning of the compound sentence s, in which two sentences (81,82) are connected by a conjunction corresponding to 'and' in English, is either 'S\] ^ $2' or 'after $1, $2'.
Therefore, an operator needs to decide the relation between 81 and s~.
In the former case, s satisfies Characteristic 2 and s ~ can be both 81 and s~.
For example, a sentence "~r~ ~-~#" ~:~,~ ~ < ~ ?~ "¢ • "(to throw something and have it touched AcrEs bE COLING-92.

One is "/,J'~, ~k il~;:r" ;b" (to throw something), the otimr is "~ 3: < :~ ~ 4-,5 "(to have it touched hard), and two sentences correspond to following formulae respectively, ~, z < ~ 4-~ (~t~,~\]~,~3).
And two sentences are simultaneous.
So following formulae hold, V~/11'/2~/3\[S(~/h f12, r13) D t.~ (~) ^ ~'~.~' ~s (~a,~)\], V~I~, ~l~ rl~ \[S(~h, ~, ~/~) D where S(O\], ~/~, ~/3) is the formula con'esponding to "/~D)~ ~ ~17 T~w 3: < ~ ~7~"and means that r/1 throw 7/2 and have Y2 touched hard to ~a.
'@$~ (~/)' means that ~\] is something.
'~E ~f~5 (~/hO~)' means that ~1 throw ~12.
'~ 3: < ~ ~ 4~ (~ll, ~, ~/3)' means that ~/1 have r\]~ touched hard to fla.
To apply Characteristic 2 repeatedly, we conclude that there is a definition sentence s which include a simple sentence s ~ and S D S' aud that the kernel sentence of s ~ is HED.
~br exa~nple, the sentence s "~b,5 ~o (~)~k ~ oT<" ~:2;5 t,: ~ l:-{© ~ ¢) 1~ ~ ~ :~ o "( ~ T lhJ 1:-2 ¢ }911 "Z " (to hold both ends of something and apply force to both sides in order to make it straight) is complex.
It therefore satisfies Characteristic 2 and S D S1, where Sl is its main clause "~q) ~©~¢~o'~l~lfil~aJ3 ~-')JllP~ 7~ '' (to hold both ends of something and apply force to both sides), s\] is a compound sentence and is composed of s2 "-f ©~©~,'~o" (to hold both ends of something) and s3 "Ji~:)~J'l~l l,T-)3 ~ ~13 L 6 " (to apply force to both sides) and two sentence is simultaneous.
Sl therefore satisfies Characteristic 2 and S1 D $2 and S1 D $3.
Therefore, 5" D 5'2 and S D $3.
Because 82 and 83 are simple sentences, the kernel sentences of 82 and 83 are HEDs.
When the definition sentence is simple, its kernel sentence is HED.
If we decide the proper meaning of the definition verb and the proper correspondence from cases of v e to cases of v d correctly, we conclude (4) N,(~,) ^ N,(~) ^ V~(~, ~)\].
We can get a hierarchical relation between v e and v 't as follows from (4), wv~ \[v°(,~,v):~ N~(~)^ V%,~)\].
3.2 Necessary
Condition and Heuristic In this paragraph we supposed that an entry verb v ¢ has HED.
What we call the selectional restriction has been used to narrow down candidates fro' syntactic structnre in the syntactic processing.
It is the restriction about the semantic category of a noun phrase which a certain verb can take as a certain case.
The semantic category has been called the semantic marker or semantic prim~ itive, libr example, semantic categories of the subjective noun phrase and the objective noun phrase for the verb "fik¢~"(drink) must be 'animal' and 'liquid' respectively.
We use this inforo mation to semiautomatically select the proper meaning of v d and the proper correspondence from cases of v ~ to cases of v d.
The information is mentioned in the Japanese dictionary we used for the experiment of extraction.
The restriction that if a verb vk c~m take a noun phrase with a e~e e the semantic category of the noun phrase is D is expressed logically as follows, w \[vk(~) ~ D(~,)\], (~) where xi is the argument corresponding to the case c, and k is the meaning number of v.
We call D in (5) the domain for c of vk.
For example, V~a~12\[~tt 1 011, ~'/2) D animal@l) A liquidO?2)\], where 'fi~.O 1 (~h, 712)' means that ~/1 drink ~2.
If the semantic category of a nolm n is D, WIN(x) ~ D(~)\].
(6) We call D in (6) the domain for n.
If the k-th meaning is proper as v ~ in the definition sentence of v ~ and the correspondence from i-th case of v ~ to j-th ca~e of v~ is correct, then the following formula holds, ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~; 1992 5 7 7 PROC.

We establish (8) as the necessary condition in which the correspondence is valid.
We check (8) with BxN(x) (Assumption 1) and the relation between domain predicates.

The meaning of an entry verb v ~ is defined by using the definition verb v d.
Then, the less the number of the variables appearing either only in v ~ or only in v d ( i.e.
(size of tuple y) + (size of tuple z) in the formula (4)), the more v ~ restricts the meaning of vL An editor of a dictionary would select such a definition verb.
We therefore establish the following heuristic.
Heuristic The less the number of the variables appearing either only in v ~ or only in v d, the more we have chance of correct selection for meaning of v '~ and the correspondence of the variables.
3.3 Example
of Extraction In this paragraph the method how to extract the hierarchical relation on verbs will be introduced.
We suppose following definitions about "~-£ "5" and "~9".
~t-'5 I \](human) ~ (human) ~:\] ~-® & ~" ~) ~ ~ ~ a ~' "3 ~ ~ ¢ ~-9.
(to experience a strong feeling of fondness) I \[(human) ¢~ (hand) V (concrete) ~:\] :~ Iz ~ ~ ¢ ~'9.
(to have something with one's hand) II \[(human) ¢~ (human) Iz (mental) ~:\] ~ ~ lz~,~ b ~ ab,5 ~,~ ¢ ~ (.
(to experience a feeling toward somebody) III \[(all_entities) ~¢ (abstract) ~:\] (ghfi, g)~ck~-J-'5.
(to have some property or equipment) ®means that "~T .5 1" is used with the form of "npl ~ np2 ~ ~ "~ "5" and the semantic category of npl and np2 must have 'human'.
We get the following knowledge about domain of words.
Vn\[~ ~"5 ~(r/~, ~:) human(~l) A human(~2)\], Vr/\[~ ~ 1 (r/~, ~, r/a) D \[human(~l )h Ahand(r/2 ) A concreat(r/a)\]\], V~}\[~'9 ~ (r/i, r/~, ~'13) D \[human(r/1 )h Ahuman(r/2) A mental(r/~)\]\], all_entities(o1 ) A abstract(o2)\], Vr/\[~ (r/) D mental(~l)\].
'all_entities' expresses the set of all entities.
We suppose the following relation between domain predicates, Vr/\[human(r/) V hand(r/) D concrete(~)\], Vr/\[mcntal(~) O abstract(~)\], Vr/\[concrete(r/) V abstract(r/) D all.entities(r/)\], -,B~l\[concrcte(o) A abstract(r/)\], ~v\[human(~) ^ hand(r/)\].
We parse the definition sentence "~ "~ ~ ~ -~ & ~ 5 ~t9 ~-9" for the entry verb "~ AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28/,OOT 1992 5 7 8 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG.
23-28, 1992 7o 1", and we find this sentence is simple and its kernel sentence "~,~ ¢5 ~k ~-) " is HED.
We narrow down candidates for the meaning of the definition verb "~o" on parsing by selectional restriction.
Meanings of "i~:o" that satisfy selectional restriction are II and II1.
Since we can infer 3x\[human(x) A all_entities(x) l from Assumption I and the relation between domain predicate, the correspondence from the first case of "'~-~ 6 1" to the first case of "~ 3"satisfies the necessary condition described in paragraph 3.2.
Since we can infer ~-3x\[human(x) A mental(x) A abstract(x)\], the correspondence from the first case of "'Z!£ 70 1" to the second case of "~o a"does not satisfy the necessary condition.
After all, for "~ ~)2" and "~'~'-)a", partial one-to-one correspondences which satisfy the necessary condition are ~o2 : a.{}, b.{< 1,1 >}, c.{< 1,2 >}, d.{< 2,1>}, e.{< 2,2 >}, f.{< 1,1 >,< 2,2 >}, .q.
{< 1,2 >,< 2,1 >}, ~'oa: h.{}, i.
{< 1,1>}, j.{< ~,1 >}, For example, the correspondence g means that the first case of "N:-J,5 1" corresponds to the second case of "~."02" and the second case of "~-£ & 1" corresponds to the first case of "N~ ~D 2"Because the number of the variables which appear either" only in the entry verb or bl the definition verb for the correspondence g is 1 and one for the correspondence i is 2, the pair of "~o2" and the correspondence g is prior to the pair of "~o3" and the correspondence i by the heuristic.
The pair of "~o~" and the correspondence f and the pair of "~'9 2 and the correspondence g are given the highest priority by the heuristic after all.
it is decided by a operator that the second meaning of ~ and tile correspondence f are proper, and we get W~z\[~ ~)70 1(xl, z2) :9 4 Experiment of Extraction We have experimented on extracting the hierarchical relation using the machine-readable dictionary IPAL (IPA : Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan ; IPAL : 1PA Lexicon of the Japanese language for computers).
861 verbs and 3379 meanings are contained in this dictionary.
The definition sentence of an entry verb and the pattern of cases for the entry verb and the domain for each of the cases of the entry verb are given in this dictionary (see Appendix).
And we can also get the domain for a noun from this dictionary.
We made a lexical functional grammar which outputs the logical fornl of HED as a feature.
We parsed the definition sentences and got 1709 HEDs whose main predicate verb are given as an entry verb in this dictionary with this gramman.
We have extracted the hierarchical relations on verbs from 1288 IIEDs.
The average number of candidates which are given the highest priority by the heuristic described in paragraph 3.2 is 4.6 and there is the correct solution in 4.6 candidates at tile rate of 70.4%.
The number of meanings of verbs in the highest layer in the hierarchy is 288, and the average level in the hierarchy is 2.7.
Maybe this value is so little.
We think in this point since IPAL is a basic verh dictionary its entry verbs are in a comparatively high ordinate in hierarchy of all verbs.
5 Conclusion
We have defined the logical form of tile hierarchical relation on verbs and have described how to extract it from definition sentences ill a Japanese dictionary.
The method described in this paper is for a Japanese dictionary, but it can be applied to other languages dictionary, too.
