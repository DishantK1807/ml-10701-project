ThesubtitleofVladimirPericliev’sbook,AnIntroductionandSomeExamples,isasuccinct
and accurate description of its contents. Pericliev argues brieﬂy for the usefulness of
computer-aided techniques in linguistic discovery, contrasting it with the intuitionist
approachwhichhascharacterizedlinguisticdiscoverythroughoutmuchofitshistory.
The bulk of the book is devoted to examples of software-aided linguistic discovery
drawnfromhisownwork.
Chapter 1 starts by sketching out the current state of discovery techniques in lin-
guistic theory, categorizing scientiﬁc discovery into three main approaches: the intui-
tionistapproach,thechanceapproach,andtheproblem-solvingapproach.Discoveries
by intuition and by chance remain the purview of humans, but clearly the problem-
solvingapproachcanbeneﬁtfromtheapplicationofcomputationaltechniques.
Chapter2presentstheKINSHIPprogram,whichperforms“parsimoniousdiscrimi-
nation” in order to determine the minimal set of features which are necessary to dis-
criminate all of a language’s kinshipterms. The program is used to discover feature
geometries, superior to existing human-discovered ones, which describe the kinship
terminologyoflanguageslikeEnglishandBulgarian.
Chapter3extendstheideasusedinKINSHIPtoaprogramcalledMPD(maximal
parsimonious discrimination), which is then applied to a variety of other tasks, some
of which are unconnected to linguistics. Of these applications, the most interesting is
the use of MPD to determine the segment proﬁles which uniquely identify languages
in the UPSID-451 database (consisting of segment inventories from 451 languages,
selected to provide broad coverage of the world’s language families) (Maddieson and
Precoda1991).AlthoughPericlievdiscusseshisresultsatconsiderablelength,itisnot
clear what the theoretical usefulness of these proﬁles might be. What does it really
tell us about French to know that it is the only language in the database to contain
the phoneme [˜œ]? Of more practical interest was Pericliev’s discussion of the process
of converting the UPSID data into a featural representation to make it amenable to
processing,describinghowtorepresentunderspeciﬁedsegmentsandhowtodealwith
transcription variations. This sort of necessary preprocessing constitutes an important
and underemphasized part of the process of machine-aided linguistic discovery. The
study of UPSID does produce some interesting, though not unexpected, results. For
instance,whenaproﬁlecontainsmorethanoneuniquesegment,themajorityofthese

Chapters4and5presenttwomorepiecesofsoftwaredevelopedbyPericliev:UNIV
andAUTO.TheUNIVsoftwareisinspiredbyGreenberg’suniversals(Greenberg1966),
ComputationalLinguistics Volume36,Number4
andautomatesthehaphazardprocessbywhichuniversalshavebeenidentiﬁedinthe
past. Given a vector of features for each language being studied, UNIV identiﬁes all
universal patterns which hold above a user-speciﬁed threshold. Such universals can
be unrestricted or statistical and they can be stand-alone or implicational. Once a set
of universals has been identiﬁed, the results are fed through AUTO (for "AUthoring
TOol"), which assembles boilerplate text into a journal article; given the vast number
of (often trivial) universals which UNIV discovers, this can be useful. UNIV is ﬁrst
appliedtotwodatasets:oneofkinshipterms,andtheothertheword-orderdataused
byGreenberghimself.ThemostinterestingresultisthatGreenberg’ssetofword-order
universalswasneithercompletenorfullysupportedbythedata.
UNIV is then applied to the UPSID-451 database. UNIV identiﬁes a large number
of previously unnoted universals, most of which are rather low-level and of little in-
herenttheoreticalinterest.However,thelow-levelmachine-discoveredgeneralizations
can then be used as the basis for more interesting manually created generalizations.
The UNIV analysis also serves to reﬁne earlier claims made by Maddieson (1984) and
Gamkrelidze(1978).
Chapter6isdevotedtoMINTYP,whichisaprogramfordeterminingtheminimum
typology to account for an observed set of universals. The search for such typologies
is discussed by Greenberg (1966) and by Hawkins (1983). MINTYP takes a system of
universalsandasetoflogicallyadmissibletypes,andeliminatesanysuperﬂuousuni-
versalswhichcanbeimpliedbystrongeruniversalsinordertodeterminethesmallest
set of universals which still accounts for the observed data. This approach is able to
distillGreenberg’ssetofuniversalsintoasfewasfourcompositeuniversals.LikeUNIV
andKINSHIP,MINTYPfollowsPericliev’s basic approach: Reduce thedata toasetof
features,andthenﬁndthepatternswhichmosteconomicallycovertheobservedfeature
distribution.
Chapter7turnsthisfeaturalapproachtotheproblemofgeneticlanguageclassiﬁ-
cation with the RECLASS software. Pericliev extends the featural approach to include
Swadesh-type word-lists, for which he describes a method for calculating a similarity
metric based on phonological features of words in the list. A set of languages from
differentfamiliesisselectedforstudy,asimilaritymetriciscalculatedforpairsoflan-
guages,andunrelatedlanguageswhosesimilarityissigniﬁcantlygreaterthanexpected
are given further attention. In Pericliev’s test case, the initial feature data consists of
kinshipterminology, which revealed an unexpected similarity between the Kaingang
languages of Brazil and various Polynesian languages. He pursues this similarity ﬁrst
byusingfeaturesbasedonword-listsimilaritiesandthenbylookingatotherstructural
features,arguingatlengthfortheplausibilityofageneticconnection.Ofalltheresults
described in the book, this is probably the most interesting, because it represents a
discoverymadebyPericliev’smachine-aidedapproachwhichisunlikelyevertohave
beenfoundbythehaphazardmanualprocessofdiscovery.
The main weakness of the book is that all the software described in the book
was developed or co-developed by Pericliev himself, so the various programs all risk
seeminglikevariationsonasingletheme.Thebookwouldhavebeneﬁtedbyincluding
examples of software from others working in the ﬁeld, which might differ from the
feature-coverage approach favored by Pericliev. That being said, Pericliev’s essential
point is a valid one: Machine-aided discovery has a tremendous untapped potential
for analyzing data sets which are too large to be amenable to human inspection.
The success of this approach is best exempliﬁed by his machine-aided discovery of a
possiblegeneticrelationshipwhichwouldotherwisehaveeludedhumandiscovery.
