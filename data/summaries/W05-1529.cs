Roland & Jurafsky (1998) suggest that there are substantial subcategorization differences between spoken and written corpora.

Acquisition System Following the design proposed by Briscoe and Carroll (1997), we built an SCF acquisition system consisting of the following four components: Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000); an SCF extractor; a lemmatizer; and an SCF evaluator.

For type precision and recall, we used 14 verbs selected by Briscoe & Carroll (1997) and evaluated our results against SCF entries in COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994).

The first three components are responsible for generating SCF cues from the training corpora and the last component, consisting of the Binomial Hypothesis Test (Brent, 1993) and a back-off algorithm (Sarkar & Zeman, 2000), is used to filter SCF cues on the basis of their reliability and likelihood.

To this end, we applied our heuristics to the Switchboard corpus parsed by both Charniak’s parser and Bikel’s parsing engine (Bikel, 2004).
