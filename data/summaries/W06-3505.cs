Frequently, production systems (Engel, 2002), semantic chunkers (Bryant, 2004) or simple word-to-concept lexica (Gurevych et al., 2003) are employed for this task.

When the titles contain the hypernym it still is to be expected that they might not consist of full sentences, Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) are, therefore, unlikely to be found.
C92-2082
This is especially important for a later semantic disambiguation of the unknown term (Loos and Porzel, 2004).

Therefore, a well established algorithm which, for example applies a set of standard Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) would constitute a potential candidate.
C92-2082
These so-called Hearst patterns (Hearst, 1992) can be expected to occur frequently in lexicons for describing a term.
C92-2082
By applying natural language patterns, as proposed by Hearst (1992) and statistical methods, as proposed by Faulhaber et al.(2006) possible hypernyms or sets of hypernym candidates of the term can be extracted.
