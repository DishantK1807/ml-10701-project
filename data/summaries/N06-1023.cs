Blaheta and Charniak proposed a statistical method ∗Currently, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, JAPAN, dk@nict.go.jp †Currently, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, kuro@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp for analyzing function tags in Penn Treebank, and achieved a really high accuracy of 95.7% for syntactic roles, such as SBJ (subject) and DTV (dative) (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000).

Constructed Case Frames We employ automatically constructed case frames (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002) for our model of Table 1: Case frame examples (examples are expressed only in English for space limitation.).

Bikel also indicated that Collins’ parser can use bilexical dependencies only 1.49% of the time; the rest of the time, it backs off to condition one word on just phrasal and part-of-speech categories (Bikel, 2004).

The experimental results are shown in table 4, in which the baseline refers to a similarity-based method (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002).

The system input was tagged automatically using the JUMAN morphological analyzer (Kurohashi et al., 1994).

In the table, “baseline” means the rule-based syntactic parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), and “proposed” represents the proposed method.

Among these, Kudo and Matsumoto yielded the best performance (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

Recently, many accurate statistical parsers have been proposed (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) for English, (Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) for Japanese).

In recent years, there have been many studies on semantic structure analysis (semantic role labeling) based on PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

The process of case structure analysis in this table is a similarity-based method (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002).
