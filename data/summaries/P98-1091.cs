The Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) formalism (Schabes et al., 1988), (Schabes, 1990), although not context-free, is the most well-known instance in this category.

Then there are V q1 parameters associated with node r/ 1The best theoretical upper bound on time complexity for the recognition of Tree Adjoining Languages is O(M(n2)), where M(k) is the time needed to multiply two k x k boolean matrices.(Rajasekaran and Yooseph, 1995) 558 Elem~ntwy ~ ~: t l~t t~ptl 1 Â£ X, ~td I t~rd 2 twordn X word 2 X word n * $ Figure h A set of elementary LTIG trees that represent a bigram grammar.

The equations calculating the inside and outside probabilities for PLTIGs can be found in Hwa (1998).

This paper presents two sets of experiments, comparing PLTIGs with non-lexicalized Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) and non-hierarchical N-gram models that use the right branching bracketing heuristics (period attaches high) as their parsing strategy.

Examples of formalisms using this approach include the work of Magerman (1995), Charniak (1997), Collins (1997), and Goodman (1997).
