Preference models \[Petitpierre 1987, Fass 1983, Schubert 1984\], such as preference semantics, scoring, and syntactic preference are good candidates for a practical NLP system, because these models utilize simple readymade knowledge like semantic markers or case frame dictionaries.

However, preference knowledge extracted from a large corpus or an on-line dictionary \[Jensen 1987\] induces preference knowledge conflicts which block complete disambiguation.
