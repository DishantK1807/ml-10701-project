formed only on the domain corpus and the information about the original training set is incorporated in the form of the reference distribution in the maximum entropy formulation (Johnson et al 2000, Hara et al 2005).

Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) (Ratnaparkhi 1996) and their extensions (Tutanova et al 2003, Tsuruoka et al 2005) have been successfully applied to English POS tagging.

where the model parameters are determined with maximum entropy criterion in combination a regularization method called inequality constraints (Kazama and Tsujii 2003).
