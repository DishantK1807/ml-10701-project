and Generative Power Frank & Satta (1998) show that input-output mapping in OT isn't regular in the general case even if GEN and the constraints are implemented as finite state transducers.

Initial State: A Final State: C Transitions: (i, B, PI/pi), (i, B, HAP/hap), (B, C, OBJ/je),(S, C, OBJ/e), (B, C, IMF/je) Resulting Candidates Initial State: (0, A) Final State: (2, C) Transitions: ((0, A), (1, B) pi), ((1, B), (2, C), e) ((1, B), (2, C), je) Since the candidate set and the constraint in (2') are regular Ellisons (1994) algorithms for getting an automaton containing only optimal candidates, as long as candidate set and evaluation transducer are regular, can be used.

This however is not the 9 German orthography is used except for the phonemic writing of voiceless 't') 1Â°Ranking can be implemented along the lines of Ellison (1994).

11 7 Locality of Constraint Evaluation Ellisons (1994) algorithms offer a way of globally finding optimal candidates out of regular candidate sets.

The phonological constraint following Ellison (1994) has the form of a regular relation mapping phonological strings into sequences of constraint violation marks ('1') and 'O's which stand for no violation.

Though this works technically it seems highly undesirable to have two allomorphs for Tod one of which can be predicted.But the regular expression (Tod \[ Tot) can equally well be written as To(d\[t) or even as To\[-continuant -sonorant +coronal\] since regular languages can be enriched straightforwardly by bundles of finite-valued features (Kaplan Kayi 1994:349-351).

GCrossover product(A, T) is equivalent to the image of A under T (Kaplan & Kay, 1994:340-42), defined as the range of the composition Id(A) o R, where Id(A) is the identity relation that carries every member of A into itself.

Thus local as opposed to global evaluation (Frank & Satta, 1998) seems to guarantee the finite-stateness of the input-output-mapping.
