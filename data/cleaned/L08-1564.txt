<context>st Lëtzebuergesch is strongly embedded in a multilingual context entailing frequent code-switching and code-mixing. Lëtzebuergesch hence represents an interesting testbed for multilingual processing (Adda-Decker and Lamel, 2006). Secondly, Lëtzebuergesch may be considered as a partially under-resourced language, as the written production remains low. Such languages presently represent a hot topic in the field of automatic s</context>
<context>mparison with Luxembourgish. For the different languages, word lists typically correspond to the most frequent words occurring in newspapers, news transcripts and possibly some parliamentary debates (Adda-Decker and Lamel, 2006). In order to give an idea of the volume of lexical entries shared among languages, the number of common entries in the top-n words in recognizer word lists were compared pairwise for the French, Spa</context>

The existing phonetic, phonological, prosodic, lexical and morpho-syntactic studies are generally carried out using limited objective observations. Large oral corpus-based studies might be carried </context>

Steps to an autonomous ASR system include acoustic modeling, pronunciation dictionary and language modeling (Lamel et al., 2002) developments. Most languages make use of broadcast news audio data, together with, as written sources, newspaper texts, news wires and related web pages. In Luxembourg news broadcasts are proposed i</context>
