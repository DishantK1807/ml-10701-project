This confirms the hypothesis by Eckert & Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) to give high priority to these features.

We choose the best performing feature (fmeasure according to Vilain et al.(1995)), adding it to the model.

Previous research could avoid dealing with this phenomenon by either applying the algorithm by hand (Eckert & Strube, 2000) or excluding these cases (Byron, 2002) from the evaluation.

If we removed them from there, the recall of our experiments would approach the 51% Byron (2002) mentioned for her system using only domain-independent semantic restrictions.

Byron (2002) presented a symbolic approach which resolves pronouns with NPand non-NPantecedents in spoken dialogue in the TRAINS domain.

We evaluate the system on twenty Switchboard dialogues and show that it compares well to Byron’s (2002) manually tuned system.

Ng & Cardie (2002) select the set of features by hand, giving a preference to high precision features.
P02-1014
Inspired by the work of Eckert & Strube (2000) and Byron (2002), these features capture preferences for NPor nonNP-antecedents by taking a pronoun’s predicative context into account.
P02-1011 W02-1040
Inspired by the more linguistically oriented work by Eckert & Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) we also evaluated the contribution of features which used the predicative context of the pronoun to be resolved.
P02-1011 W02-1040
As for the first two pronouns in (B4), following Eckert & Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) we assume that referring expressions in disfluencies, abandoned utterances etc.

For anaphors with an agreement value of 3mf or 3p, mdist 3mf3p is measured as D = 1 + the num3It seemed preferable to compile our own list instead of using existing ones like Briscoe & Carroll (1997).

E.g. Soon et al.(2001) only compared baseline systems consisting of one feature each, only three of which yielded an f-measure greater than zero.

Paul et al.(1999) presented a corpus-based anaphora resolution algorithm for spoken dialogue.

This paper describes the extensions and adaptations needed for applying our anaphora resolution system (M¨uller et al., 2002; Strube et al., 2002) to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue.

Corpus-based methods and machine learning techniques have been applied to anaphora resolution in written text with considerable success (Soon et al., 2001; Ng & Cardie, 2002, among others).

Vilain, Marc, John Burger, John Aberdeen, Dennis Connolly & Lynette Hirschman (1995).
M95-1005
When an instance is labeled as coreferring, the IDs of the anaphor and antecedent are kept in a response list for the evaluation according to Vilain et al.(1995). For determining the relevant feature set we followed an iterative procedure similar to the wrapper approach for feature selection (Kohavi & John, 1997).
