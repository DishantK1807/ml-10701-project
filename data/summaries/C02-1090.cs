Another way to prepare a representation of a word class is what may be called the centroidbased approach (e.g., Pereira et al.1993). It is almost exactly like the category-based method, the only difference being that a class vector is computed slightly differently.

This choice of similarity measures was motivated by results of studies by (Levy et al 1998) and (Lee 1999) which compared several well known measures on similar tasks and found these three to be superior to many others.

When the method is applied to augment a thesaurus, a class of training instances is typically taken to be constituted by words belonging to the same synonym set, i.e. lexicalizing the same concept (e.g., Hearst and Schuetze 1993).

Another reason for this choice is that there are different ideas underlying these measures: while the Jaccardâ€™s coefficient is a binary measure, L1 and the skew divergence are probabilistic, the former being geometrically motivated and the latter being a version of the information theoretic Kullback Leibler divergence (cf., Lee 1999).

Its previous applications (e.g., Grefenstette 1993, Hearst and Schuetze 1993, Takunaga et al 1997, Lin 1998, Caraballo 1999) demonstrated that cooccurrence statistics on a target word is often sufficient for its automatical classification into one of numerous classes such as synsets of WordNet.
