In order to resolve the imperfective paradox, we may extend White (1993) by adding a mapping from events to processes (whose realizations need not terminate in the same way), as well as a means for distinguishing actual and hypothetical events.

The algorithm takes an input string and compositionally derives a sequence of logical forms (one for each sentence) using a simple categorial grammar (most of which appears in White 1993).

White (1993) argues that substances, processes and other such entities should be modeled as abstract kinds whose realizations (things, events, etc).

This treatment extends and refines those of Moens and Steedman (1988) and Jackendoff (1991).

Theory The present treatment builds upon the approach to aspectual composition developed in White (1993), a brief sketch of which follows.

This treatment extends and refines those of Moens and Steedman (1988) and Jackendoff (1991), at least for the restricted case of trajectory-of-motion events.

5Much as in Moens and Steedman (1988) and Jackendoff (1991), the introduction of gr is necessary to avoid having an ill-sorted formula.
