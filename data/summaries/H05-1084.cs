Typically, role assignment has been modeled as a classification task, with models being estimated from large corpora (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Màrquez, 2005).

1: Variance in role assignment Several studies have established that there is considerable variance in semantic role assignment performance across different semantic roles within systems (Carreras and Màrquez, 2004; Carreras and Màrquez, 2005; Pado and Boleda Torrent, 2004).

The benefit of semantic roles has already been demonstrated for a number of tasks, among others for machine translation (Boas, 2002), information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), and question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004).

Possible features include goodness of fit relative to pre-computed preferences (Baldewein et al., 2004), named entities (Pradhan et al., 2004), or broad ontological classes like “animate” or “artifact”.

The second learner, Malouf’s probabilistic maximum entropy (Maxent) system (Malouf, 2002), uses the LMVM algorithm to estimate log-linear models.

This is justified by earlier empirical results, namely that the argument labeling step requires more training data than argument recognition (Fleischmann and Hovy, 2003), and that it calls formoresophisticatedfeatureconstruction(Xueand Palmer, 2004).

This compounds the data sparseness problem, and automatic assignment for frames with no training data is very difficult (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

The data was parsed with the Collins model 3 (1996) parser; in addition, all tokens were lemmatized with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
