A more detailed analysis of the above experiments together with the discussion of advantages and disadvantages of our evaluation schema can be found in (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004).

This approach is similar to the calculation of recall, precision, and F-measure adopted in the recent NIST evaluation of long answers for definitional questions (Voorhees, 2003).

Thus, many summarization approaches use as conceptual units lexical features like tf*idf weighing of words in the input text(s), words used in the titles and section headings of the source documents (Luhn, 1959; H.P.Edmundson, 1968), or certain cue phrases like significant, important and in conclusion (Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997).

The ROUGE method (Lin and Hovy, 2003) is based on n-gram overlap between the system-produced and ideal summaries.
N03-1020
Conceptual units do not have to be directly observable as text snippets; they can represent abstract properties that particular text units may or may not satisfy, for example, status as a first sentence in a paragraph or generally position in the source text (Lin and Hovy, 1997).
A97-1042
Some summarization systems assume that the importance of a sentence is derivable from a rhetorical representation of the source text (Marcu, 1997), while others leverage information from multiple texts to re-score the importance of conceptual units across all the sources (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001).
W97-0713
This approach has been recently applied to the construction of paragraph-long answers (e.g., (Blair-Goldensohn et al., 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003)).
W03-1017
Conceptual units can also be defined out of more basic conceptual units, based on the co-occurrence of important concepts (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) or syntactic constraints between representations of concepts (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001).
