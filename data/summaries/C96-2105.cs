Kaplan and Kay (1994) describe a general method representing a replacement procedure as finite-state transduction.

Karttunen (1995) takes a somewhat simpler approach by introducing to the calculus of regular expression a replacement operator that is defined just in terms of the other regular expression operators.

RightContext... The versions (a) to.()c roughly, correspond to the three alternative interpretations of phonological rewrite rules discussed in Kaplan and Kay (1994).

xerox, fr/grenoble/mltt Abstract This paper extends the calculus of regular expressions with new types of replacement expressions that enhance the expressiveness of the simple replace operator defined in Karttunen (1995).

In the corresponding lower string the sections corresponding to Ui are instances of Li, and the intervening material remains the same (Karttunen, 1995).

We have incorporated the new replacement expressions into our implementation of the finitestate calculus (Kempe and Karttunen, 1995).

624 We compose the conditional parallel replacement of the six auxiliary relations described by Kaplan and Kay (1994) and Karttunen (1995) which are: (1) InsertBrackets \[22\] (2) ConstrainBrackets (3) LeftContext (4) RightContext (5) Replace (6) RemoveBrackets The composition of these relations in the above order, defines the npward-oriented replacement.

To make the two replacements sequentially is also impossible in either order, for reasons in detail explained in (Kempe and Karttunen, 1995).

However, this approach is impossible for the following reason (Kaplan and Kay, 1994): In an example like { a -> b II x _ x } ; \[15\] where we expect xaxax to be replaced by xbxbx, the middle x serves as a context for both a's.

For many practical l)urposes it is convenient to construct a version of empty-string replacement that allows only one application between any two adjacent symbols (Karttunen, 1995).

Phonological rewrite-rules (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), two-level rules (Koskenniemi 1983), syntactic disarnbiguation rules (Kar\]sson et al 1994, Koskenniemi, Tapanainen, and Voutilainen 1992), and part-of-speech assignment rules (Brill 1992, Roche and Schabes 1995) are examples of replacement in context of finite-state grammars.
