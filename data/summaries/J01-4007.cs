On the other hand, there is no mechanism within the theory to predict specific cases where a Retain or a Shift may be preferred over a Continue transition, as in the Retain-Shift pattern that has been argued to signal the introduction of a new discourse topic (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987 \[BFP\]; Strube and Hahn 1999).

(Strube and Hahn 1999, page 332) Cheapness is claimed to minimize the inferential costs of processing sequences of utterances, and is proposed as a constraint on pairs of successive transitions as a replacement for the canonical orderings in Rule 2, which is restated as follows: Rule 2 ~ Cheap transition pairs are preferred over expensive ones.

(Strube and Hahn 1999, page 334) This claim is supported by analysis of a variety of German texts.

I have argued elsewhere (Kibble 1999) that if CT is to be implemented in an NLG system, the principles I call "salience" and "cohesion" belong to different tasks within this scheme: "salience" is a matter for sentence planning, choosing a verb form or some other construction that makes the Cb prominent within a clause or sentence, while "cohesion"---ordering propositions in a text to maintain referential continuity-is a matter for text planning.

4. Conclusion Comparison of the standard preference ordering for centering transitions and Strube and Hahn's (1999) variant has established the following points: 1.

2 Applied to Generation Reiter (1994) claimed that existing generation systems converged on a "consensus," generic natural language generation (NLG) architecture consisting of the following tasks: • Content determination/text planning: deciding the content of a message and organizing the component propositions into a text tree; • Sentence planning: aggregating propositions into clausal units and choosing lexical items corresponding to concepts in the knowledge base, including referring expressions; • Linguistic realization: taking care of surface details such as agreement and orthography.

A new formulation of Rule 2 of centering theory is proposed that incorporates these principles as well as a streamlined version of Strube and Hahn's (1999) notion 0fcheapness.

Referential continuity as determined by CT is only one of a number of factors determining the fluency and acceptability of generated text; see Kibble and Power (2000) for further discussion.

The main assumptions of the theory as presented by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) (GJW) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) can be summarized as follows:. . . For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity that is the center of attention.

Strube and Hahn (1999, page 333) provide a table (not reproduced here) of 36 transition pairs, labeled as "cheap," "expensive," or "-" (not occurring).

In this paper, I explore an intermediate position put forward by Strube and Hahn (1999), which is a preference over pairs of transitions or triples of utterances, which may or may not cross segment boundaries.

studies have also tended to be flawed by imprecise notions of "coreference'; see van Deemter and Kibble (2000).
