To overcome data sparseness, it is useful to generalize from individual headwords Markert and Nissim (2003).

The organisers themselves have come to similar conclusions in their own experiments (Markert and Nissim, 2002).

In recent years, there has been growing interest in metaphor and metonymy resolution that is either corpus-based or evaluated on larger datasets (Martin, 1994; Nissim and Markert, 2003; Mason, 2004; Peirsman, 2006; Birke and Sarkaar, 2006; Krishnakamuran and Zhu, 2007).

(2) BMW slipped 4p to 31p (3) His BMW went on to race at Le Mans The importance of resolving metonymies has been shown for a variety of NLP tasks, such as ma36 chine translation (Kamei and Wakao, 1992), question answering (Stallard, 1993), anaphora resolution (Harabagiu, 1998; Markert and Hahn, 2002) and geographical information retrieval (Leveling and Hartrumpf, 2006).

Still, apart from (Nissim and Markert, 2003; Peirsman, 2006) who evaluate their work on the same dataset, results are hardly comparable as they all operate within different frameworks.

Markert and Nissim (2002) outlined a corpusbased approach to proper name metonymy as a semantic classification problem that forms the basis of the 2007 SemEval metonymy resolution task.
