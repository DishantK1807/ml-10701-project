It relies on the enrichment of morphosyntactic rules and the addition of fbur boolean syntactico-semantic features to a set of 1.,(}23 words.
It results in a significant enhancement of precision of 30% with a slight decrease in recall of 10%.
1 Overview
The recognition,of paraphrases and variants is an important issue in several areas of infornmtion retrieval and text mlderstanding.
Merging paraphrastic sentences ilnproves summarization by avoiding redundancy (Barzilay et al., 1999).
Term variant conilation enhances recall in intbrmation retrieval by pointing at documents that contain linguistic variants of (tuery terms (Arampatzis et al., 1998).
In (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999), a technique is proposed for the conflation of morpho-syntactic variants that relies solely on morphological and low-level syntactic features (part-of-speech category, munber agreement, morphological relationships, and phrase structure).
An analysis of these results shows the limitation of this approach: correct and incorrect variants cannot be separated satisfactorily on a purely morpho-syntactic basis.
Sonic additional lexical semantics must be taken into consideration.
In this study we propose a reasonably simple, domain-independent, large-scale approach of lexical semantics to noun-to-verb variant recognition.
It relies on the mere addition of two t)oolean syntactic features to 449 verbs and two boolean morpho-semantic features to 574 nouns.
It result,; in a significant enhancement of precision of 30% with a slight decrease in recall of 10%.
This new al)proaeh to semantics-human-based, ettlcient, involving simple linguistic tbatures --convincingly illustrates the positive role of linguistic knowledge in information processing.
It confirms that verbs and their semantics play a significant role in document analysis (Klavans and Kan, 1998).
2 Morpho-syntactic Approach to Nomino-verbal Variation In order to illustrate the contribution of semantics to the detection of paraphrastic structures, we focus on a specific type of wtriation: the vo.rl)al varbmts of Noun-Preposition-Noun terms o1" compounds in French.
For example, les corttraintes rdsiduellcs darts les coques sont anaIysdes (the residual constraints in the shells ~re mialyzed) is such a vert)al variant of analyse de corttraintc (constraint analysis).
As a baseline tbr the extr~mtion of these variants, we use a set of five morpho-syntactic transtbrmations fbr Noun-Preposition-Noun terms reported in (Jacquemin and Tzoukernlann, 1999) (see Table 1).
1 We
use the notation Ad(Ni)v for |;tie inorphological link between the initial term and the transibrmed structure.
It rel)resents any verb in the same morphological fanfily as Ni.
For instance, in English, and according to the CELEX database, Ad(analysis)v = {to analyze, to psychoanalyze}.
Given a NI P2 N8 structure, these transt'ornmtions are obtained through corpus-based tuning 1The following symbols are used for syntactic categories: N (nouI0, A (adjective), Av (adverb), V (verb), C (coordinating conjunction), P (pret}osition), and D (detcrminer).
In the regular exl}ressions, ? denotes optionality and I disjunction.
Morphologically related words are underlined.

the order of the two content words is retained or reversed, 3.
the dependency relation 1)etween 1;11(; two initial 11011118 is preserved.
For instance, rule NheadqlbVl/,ev corresl)onds to transfi)rmations in whi(:h the, head noun is morphologically re,1;~t(;d to the verl) and t:h(; ord('r of the two words is re, verse(l; rul(; Nmodit'FoV (modifier transfi)rmed, order r(;rained) has been divided into two sul)ruh;s: the first one Nmo(tifYoV1 re, quires the insertion of a pr(;positiou just 1)eft)re th(; verbal form.
3 The
Limits of the Morpho-syntactic AI)proach In the tirst step of this work, we ext)e(:ted th(, precision of wu:iant recoglfition to be controlled in two ways: firstty, by searching fi)r multiterm variants in which the two content words of the initial term are foulM, directly or via mor1)hological transformation.
Se(:ondly, by dell1> ing morpho-syntacti(: pa|;te.rns of variation in I;erms of l)art-of-sl)eech strings that are allowed to come in 1)e.tween these t;wo COlll;eltt words.
Yet, the sequences found on su(;h a morl)hosynl;acti(: basis prove to 1)e of wtrying quality regarding their at/ility to t)rovide t)arat)hrases of the initial l;erm.
Consider for instance some of l;he vm:imlts del, eeted for the term comparaison de rds'ultat (comparison of results), in which only t;11(; \[irst; |;we sequences are good variants: compare les rdsultats ((:onlpare the results) (rule Nhead~lbV, pattern A4 (N1)vDNa) r&ultats ezpdrirnc.ntauz sent compar& (exI)erimental results are compared) (rule NheadtoVRev, 1)atte.rn NaAVA4 (N~)v) com, pard.s a'ux 'rds'.,ltats (COmlmred to the results) (rule NheadToV, pattern Jt4(N1)vPN:{) rds'ultd d"unc eomparaison (resulted from ;t comparison) (rule NModiiToVRev, pattern J~d (Na)vPDN1 ) Such examples show that morpho-syntactie patterns ;~re 1;oo coarse-gr~tined to ensure l;hat the dependency relation between the two pivots (results is the object of the predieaÂ£e comparison) is maintained.
When trying to detine linguistic criteria to ewfluate such w~riants, it; apt)ears that the frontier between good and load variants lies between those that preserve the argument relation 1)etween the two content words and those that disrupt it.
This means that, in the verbal wtriant, the.
argument relation between the verb and l;he noun must be l;he same as t;he relal;io11 between the deverl)al llOUll add the othe.r noun in the nominal term.
None of the five rules ensures that the subcategorization frame is preserved.
For instance, if we consider t;11o rule NModifI'oVlev, we find se265 quences that obey this constraint and sequences that violate it2: cr'itdrc d'&aluation (evaluation criterion) -+ dvalv, d selon les crit~r'cs (evahmted according to the criteria) syst~me d'dvaluation (evaluation system) *--+ dvaht6 lc syst&ne (evaluated the system) In the second case, the transtbrmation is unacceptable because the instrumental relation expressed in the nonfinal term becomes an object relation in the verbal sequence.
Even when word order is preserved, the relation between the pivots can be totally different in the term and its transformation, as i.u: contrgIe d'installation (installation control) and contrgle ccntralisd installd (installed centralized control) (rule NModitToV2).
Our aim was to tbrmulate additional constraints in order to control argument structure preservation.
We thus had to cope with problem of handling nonfinal t)hrases (NP) in which one of the elements is morphologically linked to a verb.
In French, as in English, the semantics of these nominal phrases is an issue tbr linguistic description: the two nouns can be linked by the whole range of argmnent-predicate relations, and very few linguistic elements can be used to decide what relation is expressed.
Here is a brief list of the configurations that are likely to appear in such NPs: the second noun is the object of the first; one: comparaison de rdsultat (comparison of result) the second noun is the subject of the first one: augmentation de I'intcv, sitd (increase in intensity) the second noun is an adjunct: tr'aitcment g la chaleur (treating with heat) the first noun is an adjunct: taux d'augmentation (increase rate) Our aim was to find a way to use surface linguistic knowledge, as required in such an area of NLP, to deal with the interpretation of these phrases.
4 Light
Semantics for Nomino-verbal Variations Our approach consisted of two steps: firstly, defining semantic clues tbr accepting or discardsin what follows~ the symbols --~ and *----> respectively indicate correct and incorrect transformations ing variants and, secondly, defining new variation patterns based oll these features.
4.1 Filtering
Criteria First, using linguistic results on the semantics of French NPs (Fabre, 1996; Bartning, 1990), we identified predicate-argument configurations that cannot be matched by a given pattern ('reject' heuristics in the sense of (Lapata, 1999)).
For example, when rule NmodifToVRev applies, N1 de N3 terms cannot be i)araphrased by verbal sequences in which N1 is the ol)ject of the verb, as in: ezp&iencc d'utilisation (experiment of use) *-+ utilisait 'uric ezpdrier~,cc (used an experiment).
In such a configuration, only non-thematic arguments (adjuncts) of the deverbal noun may be tbund inside the NP.
Similarly, when rule NheadToVRev applies, N\] de N3 terms cannot be paraphrased by verbal sequences in which N\] is the subject of a transitive verb, as in: utilisation de l'ezp&'icnce (use of experiment) *-+ czpdriencc utilisant (ext)eriment using).
This configuration provides variants only when the verb is intransitive or ergative: ergative verbs allow tbr alternations of the tbrm: NP V (la dcnsitd au.qrncntc) / one V NP (on awlmonte la dcnsitd).
In this case, the tbllowing transtbrmation is correct: augmentation de densitd (density increase) / de,,,,s'itd av,9'mentc (density increases).
4.2 Enriched
Metarules Once it has 1)een established wtfich transformations should be rejected, we searched tbr surface linguistic clues that could help us to filter out these undesirable variants.
It led us to the redefinition of the metarules, in two ways: putting additional constraints on the part-of speech strings that can intervene between the two pivots, and defining new features to add linguistic control upon the application of the rules.
These t~atures are: the prepositional form, the morphological type of the noun, the transitivity of the verb, and the voice (active versus passive).
Here are two examples tbr the redefinition of the metarules (fllrther details and examples are given in table 3): rule NmodifToVRev In this case, the metarule is transtbrmed into a single 266 17elilled rule, in whi('h the ('oml)ilm|:ion of parts of sl)eech is mot(; res|;riel;ed: a preposition is required to elinfinate object rein|ions from the verbal phrase.

â¢ the transitivity of the verb: intr;msitive mid ergative verbs are marked in the lexi(;Oll.
This mine|at|on task is not tinm-(:onsuming (al)otd; 3 hours for 1.,023 words) and could be parl;ly automated: characteristic endings (:ould hell) to detect processive mid agent deverb~fls.
In addition, intrmlsitive mid ergative verbs form a sm~fll set of the vert)al lexicon (8% of the ver|)s) which is likely to 1)(', l)artly (lom~dnindel)endent.
5 Experiments

The achtition of semantics results in an in(:,'ease of precision of 0.29: from 0.499 fbr MS to 0.789 for MS+S.
The corresl)onding decrease of recall is nm(:h smaller: 0.11 from 0.696 for MS to 0.586 for MS+S.
Pre(:ision and recall can t)e (:onfloine(t into a single me,mute such as the eifeetiveness measure E~ given by Fonmfla (1) in which t~ is a parameter (0 _< a < 1) (van Rijsbergen, 1975): Ea = 1 (1) E~ varies fl:om 0 to 1.0.
Low wflues of Ea correspond to combined high recall and high preciI in order to assign an equal sion.
If we use oe = trot)or|ante to precision and recall, the E1 values are 0.419 fi)r MS and 0.327 for MS+S.
They indicate that the addition of semantics has significantly improved the quality of w~riant extraction.
Detailed values of recall and precision arc; showll ill Table 5.
Agreement on Judgment Agreement on ~ classification task can 1)e measured through the kappa coefficient (K).
It ewduato.s the pairwise agreement mnong a set; of coders making category.iudgment, correcting tbr expected chance agreement (Carletta, 1996).

The simple kappa cecil|(tent is PoP,!
K : -(2) I-P~.
7232. in which P0 = Ei~ and < = Ei(,/ ~2~-) (Cohen, 1960).
P0 is the proportion of times the coders agree and I~, is the proportion of tiines we would expect them to agree by chance.
The value of the kappa coetficient is 0.91 indicating a good reliability of the evaluation pertbrmed by the two independent .judges.

The problem of linguistic variation in information processing forces the linguist to reconsider parat)hrase and trm~sf'ormation mechanisms in a new perspective, based on real linguistic data and on systematic cort)us exploration.
The paraphrase judgment is evaluated in a new way, from a practical point of view: two sequences are said to be a paraphrase of each other if the user of an information system considers that they bring identical or sin> ilar information content.
Regarding linguistic methodology, this work led us to find "light" solutions in terms of lexical encoding to describe complex semantic t)henomena.
This approach is pronfising because it demonstrates that linguistic knowledge can really enhance the results of term recognition beyond the,norphology level, and that semantics can be taken into account to sonm extent.
