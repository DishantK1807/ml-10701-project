We explore such a technique in /Pustejovsky and Anick 1988/and compare our approach to/Hirst 1987/and other lexical disambiguation systems.

Assuming a first-order, partial-decomposition model of lexical semantics, as given in /Pustejovsky 1987/, the translations for this class would be as follows: 6 It should be pointed out here that these are not case~ of metonymy.

Within the calculus of aspect outlined in/Pustejovsky 1987/, play(z) and read(x,y) fall into different event-types, activity and ac.complishment, respectively, and license different temporal predicates.
