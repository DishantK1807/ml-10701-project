Statistical alignment methods at sentence level have been thoroughly investigated (Gale & Church, 1991a/ 1991b ; Brown et al., 1991 ; Kay & RÃ¶scheisen, 1993).
H91-1026 J93-1006 P91-1022 P91-1023
Some methods make alignment suggestions at an intermediate level between sentence and word 271 and word (Smadja, 1992 ; Smadja et al., 1996 ; Kupiec, 1993 ; Kumano & Hirakawa, 1994 ; Boutsis & Piperidis, 1998).
J96-1001 P93-1003
Purely statistical alignment methods are proposed at word level (Gale & Church, 1991a ; Kitamura & Matsumoto, 1995).
H91-1026 P91-1023
Others use various linguistic information (Simard et al., 1992 ; Papageorgiou et al., 1994).
