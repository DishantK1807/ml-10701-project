1:161	IJCNLP 2008 The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources (ALR 6) Proceedings of the Workshop 11-12 January 2008 Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, India c 2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing Sponsor Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science and Technology, MEXT Japan.
2:161	Preface This volume contains the papers presented at the sixth workshop on Asian Language Resources, held on 11 12 January 2008 in conjunction with the third International Joint Conference on Natural Langauge Processing (IJCNLP 2008).
3:161	Languageresourceshaveplayedanessentialroleinempiricalapproachestonaturallanguageprocessing (NLP) for the last two decades.
4:161	Previous concerted efforts on construction of language resources, particularly in the US and European countries, have laid a solid foundation for the pioneering NLP researches in these two communities.
5:161	In comparison, the availability and accessibility of many Asian language resources are still very limited except for a few languages.
6:161	Moreover, there is a greater diversity in Asian languages with respect to character sets, grammatical properties and the cultural background.
7:161	Motivated by such a context, we have organised a series of workshops on Asian language resources since 2001.
8:161	This workshop series has contributed to the activation of the NLP research in Asia particularly of building and utilising corpora of various types and languages.
9:161	In this sixth workshop, we had 31 submissions encompassing 13 languages.
10:161	The paper selection was highly competitive compared with the last ve workshops.
11:161	The program committee selected 10 regular papers, 3 short papers and 8 resource reports for presentation at the workshop.
12:161	The workshop is comprised of two parts, technical sessions and a session devoted to reporting activities related to language resources in several languages.
13:161	Following the resource report session, we have an open discussion on the collaboration in building, standardising and exchanging language resources in Asia.
14:161	We hope this workshop further accelerates the already thriving NLP research in Asia.

17:161	A Bengali news corpus has been developed from the web archive of a widely read Bengali newspaper.
18:161	A web crawler retrieves the web pages in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) format from the news archive.
19:161	At present, the corpus contains approximately 34 million wordforms.
20:161	The date, location, reporter and agency tags present in the web pages have been automatically named entity (NE) tagged.
21:161	A portion of this partially NE tagged corpus has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags with the help of Sanchay Editor 1 , a text editor for Indian languages.
22:161	This NE tagged corpus contains 150K wordforms.
23:161	Additionally, 30K wordforms have been manually annotated with the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages 2 . A table driven semi-automatic NE tag conversion routine has been developed in order to convert the sixteen-NE tagged corpus to the twelve-NE tagged corpus.
24:161	The 150K NE tagged corpus has been used to develop Named Entity Recognition (NER) system in Bengali using pattern directed shallow parsing approach, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Maximum Entropy (ME) Model, Condi 1  sourceforge.net/project/nlp-sanchay 2  http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08 tional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
25:161	Experimental results of the 10-fold cross validation test have demonstrated that the SVM based NER system performs the best with an overall F-Score of 91.8%.
26:161	1 Introduction The mode of language technology work has been changed dramatically since the last few years with the web being used as a data source in a wide range of research activities.
27:161	The web is anarchic, and its use is not in the familiar territory of computational linguistics.
28:161	The web walked into the ACL meetings started in 1999.
29:161	The use of the web as a corpus for teaching and research on language technology has been proposed a number of times (Rundel, 2000; Fletcher, 2001; Robb, 2003; Fletcher, 2003).
30:161	There is a long history of creating a standard for western language resources.
31:161	The human language technology (HLT) society in Europe has been particularly zealous for the standardization, making a series of attempts such as EAGLES 3 , PROLE/SIMPLE (Lenci et al., 2000), ISLE/MILE (Calzolari et al., 2003; Bertagna et al., 2004) and more recently multilingual lexical database generation from parallel texts in 20 European languages (Giguet and Luquet, 2006).
32:161	On the other hand, in spite of having great linguistic and cultural diversities, Asian language resources have received much less attention than their western counterparts.
33:161	A new project (Takenobou et al., 2006) has been started to create a common standard for Asian language resources.
34:161	They have extended an existing description framework, the  3  http://www.ilc.cnr.it/Eagles96/home.html The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 1 MILE (Bertagna et al., 2004), to describe several lexical entries of Japanese, Chinese and Thai.
35:161	India is a multilingual country with the enormous cultural diversities.
36:161	(Bharati et al., 2001) reports on efforts to create lexical resources such as transfer lexicon and grammar from English to several Indian languages and dependency tree bank of annotated corpora for several Indian languages.
37:161	Corpus development work from web can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) for Bengali.
38:161	Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the core components in most Information Extraction (IE) and Text Mining systems.
39:161	During the last few years, the probabilistic machine learning methods have become state of the art for NER (Bikel et al., 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002) and for field extraction (McCallum et al., 2000).
40:161	Most prominently, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used for the information extraction task (Bikel et al., 1999).
41:161	Beside HMM, there are other systems based on Support Vector Machine (Sun et al., 2003) and Nave Bayes (De Sitter and Daelemans, 2003).
42:161	Maximum Entropy (ME) conditional models like ME Markov models (McCallum et al., 2000) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) were reported to outperform the generative HMM models on several IE tasks.
43:161	The existing works in the area of NER are mostly in non-Indian languages.
44:161	There has been a very little work in the area of NER in Indian languages (ILs).
45:161	In ILs, particularly in Bengali, the work in NER can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a; Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b; Ekbal et al., 2007c).
46:161	Other than Bengali, the work on NER can be found in (Li and McCallum, 2003) for Hindi.
47:161	Newspaper is a huge source of readily available documents.
48:161	In the present work, the corpus has been developed from the web archive of a very well known and widely read Bengali newspaper.
49:161	Bengali is the seventh popular language in the world, second in India and the national language of Bangladesh.
50:161	A code conversion routine has been written that converts the proprietary codes used in the newspaper into the standard Indian Script Code for Information Interchange (ISCII) form, which can be processed for various tasks.
51:161	A separate code conversion routine has been developed for converting ISCII codes to UTF-8 codes.
52:161	A portion of this corpus has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags as described in Table 3.
53:161	Another portion of the corpus has been manually annotated with the twelve NE tags as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.
54:161	A table driven semi-automatic NE tag conversion routine has been developed in order to convert this corpus to a form tagged with the twelve NE tags.
55:161	The NE tagged corpus has been used to develop Named Entity Recognition (NER) system in Bengali using pattern directed shallow parsing approach, HMM, ME, CRF and SVM frameworks.
56:161	A number of detailed experiments have been conducted to identify the best set of features for NER in Bengali.
57:161	The ME, CRF and SVM based NER models make use of the language independent as well as language dependent features.
58:161	The language independent features could be applicable for NER in other Indian languages also.
59:161	The system has demonstrated the highest F-Score value of 91.8% with the SVM framework.
60:161	One possible reason behind its best performance may be the flexibility of the SVM framework to handle the morphologically rich Indian languages.
61:161	2 Development of the Named Entity Tagged Bengali News Corpus 2.1 Language Resource Acquisition A web crawler has been developed that retrieves the web pages in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) format from the news archive of a leading Bengali newspaper within a range of dates provided as input.
62:161	The crawler generates the Universal Resource Locator (URL) address for the index (first) page of any particular date.
63:161	The index page contains actual news page links and links to some other pages (e.g., Advertisement, TV schedule, Tender, Comics and Weather etc.) that do not contribute to the corpus generation.
64:161	The HTML files that contain news documents are identified and the rest of the HTML files are not considered further.
65:161	2.2 Language Resource Creation The HTML files that contain news documents are identified by the web crawler and require cleaning to extract the Bengali text to be stored in the corpus along with relevant details.
66:161	The HTML file is scanned from the beginning to look for tags like <fontFACE=BENGALI_FONT_NAME><font>, where the BENGALI_FONT_NAME is the name The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 2 of one of the Bengali font faces as defined in the news archive.
67:161	The Bengali text enclosed within font tags are retrieved and stored in the database after appropriate tagging.
68:161	Pictures, captions and tables may exist anywhere within the actual news.
69:161	Tables are integral part of the news item.
70:161	The pictures, its captions and other HTML tags that are not relevant to our text processing tasks are discarded during the file cleaning.
71:161	The Bengali news corpus has been developed in both ISCII and UTF-8 codes.
72:161	The tagged news corpus contains 108,305 number of news documents with about five (5) years (2001-2005) of news data collection.
73:161	Some statistics about the tagged news corpus are presented in Table 1.
74:161	Total number of news documents in the corpus 108, 305 Total number of sentences in the corpus 2, 822, 737 Avgerage number of sentences in a document 27 Total number of wordforms in the corpus 33, 836, 736 Avgerage number of wordforms in a document 313 Total number of distinct wordforms in the corpus 467, 858 Table 1.
75:161	Corpus Statistics 2.3 Language Resource Annotation The Bengali news corpus collected from the web is annotated using a tagset that includes the type and subtype of the news, title, date, reporter or agency name, news location and the body of the news.
76:161	A part of this corpus is then tagged with a tagset, consisting of sixteen NE tags and one non-NE tag.
77:161	Also, a part of the corpus has been tagged with a tagest of twelve NE tags 4 , defined for the IJCNLP08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.
78:161	A news corpus, whether in Bengali or in any other language, has different parts like title, date, reporter, location, body etc. To identify these parts in a news corpus the tagset, described in Table 2, has been defined.
79:161	The reporter, agency, location, date, bd, day and ed tags help to recognize the person name, organization name, location name  4 http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=3 and the various date expressions that appear in the fixed places of the newspaper.
80:161	These tags are not able to recognize the various NEs that appear within the actual news body.
81:161	In order to identify NEs within the actual news body, we have defined a tagset consisting of seventeen tags.
82:161	We have considered the major four NE classes, namely Person name, Location name, Organization name and Miscellaneous name.
83:161	Miscellaneous names include the date, time, number, percentage and monetary expressions.
84:161	The four major NE classes are further divided in order to properly denote each component of the multiword NEs.
85:161	The NE tagset is shown in Table 3 with the appropriate examples.
86:161	We have also tagged a portion of the corpus as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for South and South East Asian Languages.
87:161	This tagset has twelve different tags.
88:161	The underlying reason for adopting these tags was the necessity of a slightly finer tagset for various natural language processing (NLP) applications and particularly for machine translation.
89:161	The IJCNLP-08 NER shared task tagset is shown in Table 4.
90:161	One important aspect of IJCNLP-08 NER shared task was to annotate only the maximal NEs and not the structures of the entities.
91:161	For example, mahatma gandhi road is annotated as location and assigned the tag NEL even if  mahatma and gandhi are NE title person and person name, respectively, according to the IJCNLP-08 shared task tagset.
92:161	These internal structures of the entities need to be identified during testing.
93:161	So, mahatma gandhi road will be tagged as mahatma/NETP gandhi/NEP road/NEL.
94:161	The structure of the tagged element using the Shakti Standard Format (SSF) 5  will be as follows: 1 (( NP <ne=NEL> 1.1 (( NP <ne=NEP> 1.1.1 (( NP  <ne=NETP> 1.1.1.1 mahatma )) 1.1.2 gandhi )) 1.2 road ))  5 http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL 2007/ssf.html The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 3 2.4 Partially Tagged News Corpus Development A news document is stored in the corpus in XML format using the tagset, mentioned in Table 2.
95:161	In the HTML news file, the date is stored at first and is divided into three parts.
96:161	The first one is the date according to Bengali calendar, second one is the day in Bengali and the last one is the date according to English calendar.
97:161	Both Bengali and English dates are stored in the form day month year.
98:161	A sequence of four Bengali digits separates the Bengali date from the Bengali day.
99:161	The English date starts with one/two digits in Bengali font.
100:161	Bengali date, day and English date can be distinguished by checking the appearance of the numerals and these are tagged as <bd>, <day> and <ed>, respectively.
101:161	For e.g., 25 sraban 1412  budhbar  10 august 2005 is tagged as shown in Table 5.
102:161	Table 2.

106:161	Example of a Tagged Date Pattern 2.5 Named Entity Tagged Corpus Development The partially NE tagged corpus contains 34 million wordforms and are in both ISCII and UTF8 forms.
107:161	A portion of this corpus, containing 150K wordforms, has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags that are listed in Table 3.
108:161	The corpus has been annotated with the help of Sanchay Editor, a text editor for Indian languages.
109:161	The detailed statistics of this NE-tagged corpus are given in Table 6.
110:161	The corpus is in SSF form, which has the following structure:    <Story id=""> <Sentence id=""> 1 biganni NNE 2 newton PER 3 . </Sentence id="">  . </Story id="">  Another portion of the partially NE tagged Bengali news corpus has been manually annotated as part of the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task with the twelve NE tags, as listed in Table 4.
111:161	The annotation process has been very difficult due to the presence of a number of ambiguous NE tags.
112:161	The potential ambiguous NE tags are: NED vs NETP, NEO vs NEB, NETE vs NETO, NETO vs NETP and NEN vs NEM.
113:161	For example, it is difficult to decide whether Agriculture is NETE, and if no then whether Horticulture is NETE or not.
114:161	In fact, this the most difficult class to identify.
115:161	This NE tagged corpus contains approximately 30K wordforms.
116:161	Details statistics of this tagged corpus are shown in Table 7.
117:161	This NE tagged corpus is in the following SSF form.
118:161	<Story id="">    <Sentence id=""> 1 (( NP <ne=NEP> 1.1 (( NP <ne=NED> 1.1.1 biganni ))    1.1.2 newton NEP  )) 2 .    </Sentence id="">    </Story id="">  NE Class Number of wordforms Number of distinct wordforms Person name 20, 455 15, 663 Location name 11, 668    5, 579 Organization name 963 867 Miscellaneous name 11,554 3, 227 Table 6.
119:161	Statistics of the 150K-tagged Corpus The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 5 2.6 Tag Conversion A tag conversion routine has been developed in order to convert the sixteen-NE tagged corpus of 150K wordforms to the corpus, tagged with the IJCNLP-08 twelve-NE tags.
120:161	This conversion is a semi-automatic process.
121:161	Some of our sixteen NE tags can be automatically mapped to some of the IJCNLP-08 shared task tags.
122:161	The tags that represent person, location and organization names can be directly mapped to the NEP, NEL and NEO tags, respectively.
123:161	Other IJCNLP-08 shared task tags can be obtained with the help of gazetteer lists and simple heuristics.
124:161	In our earlier NER experiments, we have already developed a number of gazetteer lists such as: lists of person, location and organization names; list of prefix words (e.g., sree, sriman etc.) that predict the left boundary of a person name; list of designation words (e.g., mantri, sangsad etc.) that helps to identify person names.
125:161	The lists of prefix and designation words are helpful to find the NETP and NED tags.
126:161	The sixteenNE tagged corpus is searched for the person name tags and the previous word is matched against the lists of prefix and designation words.
127:161	The previous word is tagged as NED or NETP if there is a match with the lists of designation words and prefix words, respectively.
128:161	The NEN and NETI tags can be obtained by looking at our miscellaneous tags and using some simple heuristics.
129:161	The NEN tags can be simply obtained by checking whether the MISC tagged element consists of digits only.
130:161	The lists of cardinal and ordinal numbers have been also kept to recognize NETI tags.
131:161	A list of words that denote the measurements (e.g., kilogram, taka, dollar etc.) has been kept in order to get the NEM tag.
132:161	The lists of words, denoting the brand names, title-objects and terms, have been prepared to get the NEB, NETO and NETE tags.
133:161	The NEA tags can be obtained with the help of a gazetteer list and using some simple heuristics (whether the word contains the dot and there is no space between the characters).
134:161	The mapping from our NE tagset to the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task tagset is shown in Table 8.
135:161	3 Use of Language Resources The NE tagged news corpus, developed in this work, has been used to develop the Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems in Bengali using pattern directed shallow parsing, HMM, ME, CRF and SVM frameworks.

138:161	Tagset Mapping Table   We have considered the sixteen NE tags to develop these systems.
139:161	Named entity recognition in Indian Languages (ILs) in general and particularly in Bengali is difficult and challenging as there is no concept of capitalization in ILs.
140:161	The Bengali NER systems that use pattern directed shallow parsing approach can be found in The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 6 (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a) and (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b).
141:161	An HMM-based Bengali NER system can be found in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007c).
142:161	These systems have been trained and tested with the corpus tagged with the sixteen NE tags.
143:161	A number of experiments have been conducted in order to find out the best feature set for NER in Bengali using the ME, CRF and SVM frameworks.
144:161	In all these experiments, we have used a number of gazetteer lists such as: first names (72, 206 entries), middle names (1,491 entries) and sur names (5,288 entries) of persons; prefix (245 entries) and designation words (947 entries) that help to detect person names; suffixes (45 and 23 entries) that help to identify person and location names; clue words (94 entries) that help to detect organization names; location name (7, 870 entries) and organization name (2,225 entries).
145:161	Apart from these gazetteer lists, we have used the prefix and suffix (may not be linguistically meaningful suffix/prefix) features, digit features, first word feature and part of speech information of the words etc. We have used the C++ based Maximum Entropy package 6 , C ++  based OpenNLP CRF++ package 7  and open source YamCha 8  tool for ME based NER, CRF based NER and SVM based NER, respectively.
146:161	For SVM based NER system, we have used TinySVM 9  classifier, pair wise multi-class decision method and the second-degree polynomial kernel function.
147:161	The brief descriptions of all the models are given below: A: Pattern directed shallow parsing approach without linguistic knowledge.
148:161	B: Pattern directed shallow parsing approach with linguistic knowledge.
149:161	HMM based NER: Trigram model with additional context dependency, NE suffix lists for handling unknown words.
150:161	ME based NER: Contextual window of size three (current, previous and the next word), prefix and suffix of length upto three of the current word, POS information of the current word, NE information of the previous word (dynamic feature), different digit features and the various gazetteer liststs.

152:161	SVM based NER: Contextual window of size six (current, previous three words and the next two words), prefix and suffix of length upto three of the current word, POS information of window three (current word, previous word and the next word), NE information of the previous two words (dynamic feature), different digit features and the various gazetteer lists.
153:161	Evaluation results of the 10-fold cross validation test for all the models are presented in Table 9.
154:161	Evaluation results clearly show that the SVM based NER model outperforms other models due to its efficiency to handle the non-independent, diverse and overlapping features of Bengali language.

156:161	The date, location, reporter and agency tags present in the web pages have been automatically NE tagged.
157:161	Around 150K wordforms of this partially NE tagged corpus has been manually annotated with the sixteen NE tags.
158:161	We have also tagged around 30K wordforms with the twelve NE tags, defined for the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task.
159:161	A tag conversion routine has also been developed in order to convert any sixteen-NE tagged corpus to the twelve-NE tagged corpus.
160:161	The sixteen-NE tagged corpus of 150K wordforms has been used to The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008 7 develop the NER systems using various machinelearning approaches.
161:161	This NE tagged corpus can be used for other NLP research activities such as machine translation, information retrieval, cross-lingual event tracking, automatic summarization etc.
