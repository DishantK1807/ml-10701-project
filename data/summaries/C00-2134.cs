Brown (1996) approached to this problem employing a nmlti-engine architecture, where outputs from Transfer Machine Translation (MT), Knowledge-based MT and Example-based MT are combined on the chart during parsing.

Evans and Weir (1998) used finite state automata as representation of trees that can be merged and minimized to improve parsing efficiency, lit their method, the granlnlar is fixed to be I,TAG or seine lexicalized grammar and the automata are obtained by automatic conversion from the trees.
