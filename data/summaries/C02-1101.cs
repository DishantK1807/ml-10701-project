Eskin (2000) conducted corpus error detection using anomaly detection.

Using a probabilistic approach, Murata et al.(2000) detected errors of morphemes in a corpus with a precision of 70¡80%, and Eskin (2000) detected errors with a precision of 69%, but our approach achieved more than 80%.

SVMs are similar to boosting, and our approach uses the weights attached by SVMs in a similar manner to what Abney et al.(1999) studied.

Abney et al.(1999) studied corpus error detection using boosting.

Some probabilistic approaches for corpus error detection have also been studied (Eskin, 2000; Murata et al., 2000).

One of the approaches for corpus error detection is use of machine learning techniques (Abney et al., 1999; Matsumoto and Yamashita, 2000; Ma et al., 2001).

For example, many statistical part-of-speech (POS) taggers have been developed and they use corpora as the training data to obtain statistical information or rules (Brill, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

It is mentioned that the limitation is largely caused by inconsistencies in the corpus (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Padr´o and M`arquez, 1998; van Halteren et al., 2001).

Learning for POS tagging We use a revision learning method (Nakagawa et al., 2002) for POS tagging with SVMs1.

Many studies and improvements have been conducted for ⁄ Presently with Service Media Laboratory, Corporate ResearchandDevelopmentCenter, OkiElectricIndustry Co.,Ltd. POS tagging, and major methods of POS tagging achieve an accuracy of 96–97% on the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus, but obtaining higher accuracies is difficult (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
