More details on this system can be found in (Mihalcea, 2002b).
C02-1039
The starting corpus we use is formed by a mix of three different sources of data, namely the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), the Los Angeles Times collection, as provided during TREC conferences1, and Open Mind Common Sense2, a collection of about 400,000 commonsense assertions in English as contributed by volunteers over the Web.
J93-2004
The high accuracy of the LEXAS system (Ng and Lee, 1996) is due in part to the use of large corpora.
P96-1006
Estimations made in (Ng, 1997) indicated that a high accuracy domain independent system for WSD would probably need a corpus of about 3.2 million sense tagged words.
W97-0201
An analysis of the semantic annotation task performed by novice taggers as part of the SemCor project (Fellbaum et al., 1997) revealed an agreement of about 82.5% among novice taggers, and 75.2% among novice taggers and lexicographers.
W97-0206
We are considering using a AutoASC/GenCor type of approach to generate sense tagged data with a bootstrapping algorithm (Mihalcea, 2002a).
C02-1039
The next significant hand tagging task was reported in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994), where 2,476 usages of interest were manually assigned with sense tags from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE).
P94-1020
One of the first large scale hand tagging efforts is reported in (Miller et al., 1993), where a subset of the Brown corpus was tagged with WordNet July 2002, pp.
