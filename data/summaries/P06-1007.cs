This idea has been explored as one of the lexicalist approaches to sentence processing (Kim et al., 2002; Bangalore and Joshi, 54 1999).

Hale (2001) reported that a probabilistic Earley parser can make correct predictions of garden-path effects and the subject/object relative asymmetry.

Kim et al.(2002) suggest the feasibility of modeling human syntactic processing as lexical ambiguity resolution using a syntactic tagging system called Super-Tagger 49 (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994; Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).

One attractive future direction is to carry out simulations that compare the evolution of probabilities in the tagger with that in a theoretically more powerful model trained on the same data, such as an incremental statistical parser (Kim et al., 2002; Roark, 2001).

Probabilistic parsing techniques also have been used for sentence processing modeling (Jurafsky, 1996; Narayanan and Jurafsky, 2002; Hale, 2001; Crocker and Brants, 2000).
