Introduction
We are pleased to present the Proceedings of the Tenth Meeting of the ACL Special Interest Group on
Computational Morphology and Phonology (SIGMORPHON), to be held on June 19, 2008 at Ohio
State University in Columbus, Ohio.
The purpose of SIGMORPHON is to foster computational research on the phonological, morphological,
and phonetic properties of human language. All three of these sub-areas deal largely with the local
structure of words and so share many technical methods. Furthermore, computational work that
models empirical data must often draw on at least two of these areas, with explicit consideration of
the morphology-phonology or phonology-phonetics interface.
Morphology and phonetics were officially added to the SIG’s charter only in 2006, when the SIG
membership voted to amend the SIG’s constitution and change its name from SIGPHON. This
expansion of the SIG’s mission beyond phonology was supported and subsequently approved by the
ACL. The new name (suggested by Johanna Moore) is pronounced “SIG more fun,” which we hope is
an accurate assessment.
Since SIGMORPHON’s 2007 workshop was a special-topic workshop on computing and historical
phonology, the present 2008 workshop is the first that reflects the breadth of the new charter. In
particular, we are pleased to include two papers on unsupervised morphological analysis, and an invited
talk on articulatory modeling for speech recognition.
We are grateful to the program committee for their careful and thoughtful reviews and discussions of
the papers submitted this year. Just over half of the submissions were accepted on first review, with
an additional submission accepted after revisions. We also thank this year’s invited speakers, Karen
Livescu and Jason Riggle, for presenting their noteworthy work to the SIGMORPHON community.
We hope that you enjoy the workshop and these proceedings.
