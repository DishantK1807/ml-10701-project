Percent agreement is defined in \[Gale et al., 1992\] as the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion.

The discourse intentions of the speaker provide one basis for determining which utterances belong within one segment \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\].

Resolving the prononn in the initial clause of the resumption seglnent requires shifting the attentional state \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\], since the active focus space (correspon(ling to the intervening segment) does not contain a representation of the referent.

As discussed in \[Passonneau and Litman, 1993\], we are conducting an empirical study of the relation between discourse segments and intentions.

The cue words in the relnaining 3 cases are so, all right and then, none of which clearly signal attentional change \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993\].

There are 8 discourse pops of the type in Figure 2 in the 10 narratives that we have coded for referential relations (coding described in \[Passonneau, 1993\]).

In particular, this class of resumption segments begins with an utterance in which a third person definite pronoun refers to an entity that is not in the focus space \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\] associated with the intervening segment.

We note that for spontaneous oral narrative, discourse pops 1nay not lie explicitly signaled by cue words, and that structural and semantic relations among distinct segnlents may instead require inference, ht \[Passonneau and Litman, 1993\], we directly address how explicit devices such as pauses, cue words and referential noun phrases correlate with seglnental structure in order to posit constraints between surface structure choices and intentional and seglnental structure.
