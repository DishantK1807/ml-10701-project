It can also be compared to Angluinâ€™s famous work on reversible grammars (Angluin, 1982) which inspired a similar paper(Pilato and Berwick, 1985).

This was discussed in some detail by (Pilato and Berwick, 1985).

The task in NLP is normally taken to be one of recovering appropriate annotations (Smith and Eisner, 2005) that normally represent constituent structure (strong learning), while in grammatical inference, researchers 126 are more interested in merely identifying the language (weak learning).
P05-1044
This principle has been appealed to by many researchers in the field of grammatical inference, but these appeals have normally been informal and heuristic (van Zaanen, 2000).
C00-2139
A number of statistical models have been proposed over the last few years by researchers such as (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004) and (Solan et al., 2005).
