ac. uk Abstract This paper establishes a framework under which various aspects of prosodic morphology, such as templatic morphology and infixation, can be handled under two-level theory using an implemented multi-tape two-level model.
The paper provides a new computational analysis of root-and-pattern morphology based on prosody.
1 Introduction
Prosodic Morphology (McCarthy and Prince, 1986, et seq).
provides adequate means for describing non-linear phenomena such as infixation, reduplication and templatic morphology.
Standard two-level systems proved to be cumbersome in describing such operations see (Sproat, 1992, p.
159 ft).
for a discussion.
Multi-tape two-level morphology (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994, et.
seq). addresses various issues in the domain of non-linear morphology: It has been used in analysing rootand-pattern morphology (Kiraz, 1994), the Arabic broken plural phenomenon (Kiraz, 1996a), and error detection in non-concatenative strings (Bowden and Kiraz, 1995).
The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how non-linear operations which are motivated by prosody can also be described within this framework, drawing examples from Arabic.
The analysis of Arabic presented here differs from earlier computa\[ional accounts in that it employs new linguistic descriptions of Arabic morphology, viz.
moraic and affixational theories (McCarthy and Prince, 1990b; McCarthy, 1993).
The former argues that a different vocabulary is Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from St John's College.
This research was done under the supervision of Dr Stephen G.
Pulman. needed to represent the pattern morpheme according to the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis (see ยง1:1), contrary to the earlier CV model where templates are represented as sequences of Cs (consonants) and Vs (vowels).
The latter departed radically from the notion of root-and-pattern morphology in the description of the Arabic verbal stem (see ยง3).
The choice of the linguistic model depends on the application in question and is left for the grammarian.
Tile purpose here is to demonstrate that multi-tape two-level morphology is adequate for representing these various linguistic models.
The following convention has been adopted.
Morphemes are represented in braces, { }, and surface forms in solidi, / /.
In listings of grammars and lexica, variables begin with a capital letter.
The structure of the papcr is as follows: Section 2 demonstrates how Arabic templatic morphology can be analysed by prosodic terms, and section 3 looks into infixation; finally, section 4 provides some concluding remarks.
The rest of this section introduces prosodic morphology and establishes the computational framework behind this presentation.
1.1 Prosodic
Morphology There are three essential principles in prosodic morphology (McCarthy and Prince, 1990a; McCarthy and Prince, 1993).
They are: (i) a.
PROSODIC MORPHOLOGY HYPOTHESIS.
Templates are defined in terms of the authentic units of prosody: mora (it), syllable (~), foot (Ft), prosodic word (PrWd).
b. TEMPLATE SATISFACTION CONDITION.
Satisfaction of templates constraints is obligatory and is determined by the principles of prosody, both universal and language-specific.
664 c.
PROSODIC CIRCUMSCRIPTION.
The domain to which morphological operations apply may be circumscribed by prosodic criteria as well as by the more familiar morphological ones.
In the Prosodic Morphology Hypothesis, morn is the unit of syllabic weight; a monomoraic syllable, oh,, is light (L), and a bimoraic syllable, a~,~, is heavy (H).
The most common types of syllables are: open light, CV, open heavy, CVV, and closed heavy, CVC.
This typology is represented graphically in (2).
G (7 (7 CV CVV CVC Association of Cs and Vs to templates is based on the Template Satisfaction Condition.
Association takes the following form: a node a always takes a C, and a morn # takes a V; however, in bimorale syllables, the second # may be associated to either a C or a V} Prosodic Circumscription (PC) defines the domain of morphological operations.
Normally, the domain of a typical morphological operation is a grammatical category (root, stem or word), resulting in prefixation or sufilxation.
Under PC, however, the domain of a morphological operation is a prosodically-delimited substring within a grammatical category, often resulting in some sort of infixation.
The essential for PC is a parsing function ~I~ of the form in (3).
(3) PARSING FUNCTION +(c, E) Let B be a base (i.e.
stem or word).
The function ~I~ returns the constituent C that sits on the edge E E {right, left) of the base B.
The result is a factoring of B into: kernel, designated by B:~, which is the string returned by the parsing function, and residue, designated by B/O, which is the remainder of B.
The relation between B:~ and B/~ is given in (4), where ~ is the concatenation operator.
(4) FACTORING OF B BY (I) B = B:~ ~ B/,~ To illustrate this, let B = /katab/; applying the function O(al,, Left) on B factors it into: (i) the kernel B:~ = /ka/, and (ii) the residue 1Other conventions associate consonant melodies left-to-right to the morale nodes, followed by associating vowel melodies to syllable-initial morae.
= /tab/.
A morphological operation O (e.g.
O = "Prefix {t}") defined on a base B is denoted by O(B).
There are two types of PC: positive (PPC) and negative (NPC).
In PPC, the domain of the operation is tile kernel B:,IJ; this type is denoted by O:~ and is defined in (5a).
In NPC, the domain is the residue B/O; this type is denoted by 0/4) and is defined in (5b).
(5) DEFINITION OF PPC AND NPC a.
PPC, O:O(B) : O(B:~) ~ B/O b.
NPC, O/O(B) = B:O ~ O(B/,I~) In other words, in PPC, O applies to the kernel B:~, concatenating the result with the residue B/O; in NPC, O applies to the residue B/O, concatenating the result with the kernel B:O.
Examples are provided in section 3.
1.2 Multi-Tape Two-Level Formalism Two-level morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983) defines two levels of strings in recognition and synthesis: lexical strings represent morphemes, and surface strings represent surface forms.
Two-level rules map the two strings; the rules are compiled into finite state transducers, where lexical strings sit on one tape of the transducers and surface strings on the other.
Multi-tape two-level morphology is an extension to standard two-level morphology, where more than one lexical tape is allowed.
The notion of using multiple tapes first appeared in (Kay, 1987).
Motivated by Kay's work, (Kiraz, 1994) proposed a multi-tape two-level model.
The model adopts the formalism in (6) as reported by (Pulman and Hepple, 1993).
LLC LEX RLC {::~, ~} (6) LSC SURI,' RSC where LLC is the left, lexical context, LEX is the lexical form, RLC is the right lexical context, LSC is the left surface context, SURF is the surface form, and RSC is the right surface context.
The special symbol * indicates an empty context, which is always satisfied.
The operator =~ states that LEX may surface as SURF in the given context, while the operator <=~ adds the condition that when LEx appears in the given context, then the surface description must satisfy SuR~.
The latter caters for obligatory rules.
A lexical string maps to a surface string iff (1) they call be partitioned into pairs of lexical-surface subsequences, where each pair is licenced by a rule, and (2) no partition violates an obligatory rule.
665 One of the extensions introduced in the multitape version is that all expressions in the lexical side of the rules (i.e.
LLC, LEx and RLC) are n-tuple of regular expressions of the form (xl, x2,..., xn).
The ith expression refers to symbols on the ith tape.
When n = 1, the parentheses can be ignored; hence, (x) and x are equivalent.
2 2 Templatic Morphology Templatic morphology is best exemplified in Semitic root-and-pattern morphology.
This section sets a framework under which templatic morphology can be described using (augmented) twolevel theory.
Our presentation differs from previous proposals a in that it employs prosodic morphology in the analysis of Arabic, rather than earlier CV accounts.
Arabic verbal forms appear in (7) in the passive (rare forms are not included).
(7) ARABIC VERBAL MEASURES (1-8, 10) 1 kutib 2 kuttib 3 kuutib 4 'euktib 5 tukuttib 6 tukuutib 7 nkutib 8 ktutib 10 stuktib (McCarthy, 1993) points out that Arabic verbal forms are derived from the base template in (8), which represents Measure 1.
a~ represents an extrametrical consonant; thai; is, the last consonant in a stein.
(8) ARABIC BASE TEMPLATE O0" O-m kut ib The remaining measures are derived from the base template by afiqxation; they have no templates of their own.
The simplest operation is prefixation, e.g.
{n} + Measure 1 -+ /nkutib/ (Measure 7).
Measures 4 and 10 are derived in a similar fashion, but undergo a rule of syncope as shown in (9).
2Our implementation interprets rules directly (see (Kiraz, 1996c)); hence, we allow unequal representation of strings.
If the rules were to be compiled into automata, a genuine symbol, e.g. 0, must be introduced by the rule compiler.
For the compilation of our formalism into automata, see (Grimley-Evans et al., 1996).
aNon-linear proposals include (Kay, 1987), (Kornai, 1991), (Wiebe, 1992), (Narayanan and Hashem, 1993), (Bird and Ellison, 1994) and (Kiraz, 1994).
A working system for Arabic is reported by (Beesley et al., 1989; Beesley, 1990; Beesley, 1991).
(9) DERIVATION OF MEASURES 4 AND 10 Syncope: V ~ q5/\[CVC __ CVC\]ste m a.
Measure 4: ~u + kntib ~ */eukutib/ ~Y2~ pe /~uktib/ b.
Measure 10: stu + kutib */stukutib/ ~Y2~ ~'e /stuktib/ The following lexicon and two-level grammar demonstrate how the above measures can be analysed under two-level theory.
The lexicon maintains four tapes: pattern, root, vocalism and affix tapes.
1 {~.~,,<,:} 2 {ktb} 3 {ui} 4 {~V} 4 {n} 4 {stV} pattern : \[measure= (i-8,10) \] root : \[measure= (1-4,6-8,10) \] vocalism: \[tense=perf, voice=pass\] verb_affix: \[measure=4\] verb_af f ix : \[measure=g\] verb_affix: \[measure=lO\] The first column indicates the tape on which the morpheme sits, and the second column gives the morpheme.
Eactl lexical entry is associated with a category and a feature structure of the form cat : FS (column 3).
Feature values in parentheses are disjunctive and are implenlented using boolean vectors (Mellish, 1988; Pulman, 1994).
{a~a,,a~} is tile base-template.
{ktb} 'notion of writing' is the root; it may occur in all measures apart from Measure 5.
4 {ui} is the perfective passive vocalism.
Tile remaining morphemes represent the affixes for Measures 4, 7 and 10.
Notice that the vowel ill the affixes of Measures 4 and 10 is a variable V.
This maims it possible for the affix to have a different vowel according to the inood of the following stem, e.g.
\[a\] in /paktab/ (Measure 4, active) and \[u\] in/puktib/(Measure 4, passive).
Since the lexicon declares 4 lexical tapes, each lexical expression in the two-level grammar must be at most a 4-tuple.
A grammar for the derivation of the cited data appears below.
* (~.,ON,e) CV (~,C,<d (e,e,e,A) * โข a * <+,+,+#> C c,e,6,+ } --C R1, R2, R3, (X,*##) R4, R5 (6,~,c,A) (+,+,+,e) ** _ * :=> 4Roots do not occur in all measures in the literatm'e.
Each root is lexically marked with the measures it occurs in.
666 * (,~,,,C,V,e) * 1t6 Gig C C2V1C3 ยข:> where (~i=radical, Vi=vowel, A=verbal affix, and X ยข +.
Rule 11,1 handles monomoraie syllables mapping (r%,C,V,e) on the lexical tapes to CV on the surface tape.
11,ule R2 maps the extrmnetrieal consonant in a stem (i.e.
the last; consonant in a stem) to I;he sm'face.
Rule \]/,3 maps an atlix symbol from the fourth tap(', to the surface.
11,ules R4 and R5 delete the boundary symbols fl'om stems and af fixes, respectively.
Finally, rule R6 simulates the syncoI)e rule in (9); note |;hat V ill LS~ must unify with V in LEX, ensuring that the vowel of the affix has the same quality as that of the stem, e.g.
/'eaktab/aim /Pu+ktib/ (measure 4).
The two-level analysis of the cited forms appears below ST = sm'face tape, PT -pattern tape, 115.\[' -root tape, VT : vocalsin tat)e, and AT = attix tape.

The remaining Measures involve infixation and are discussed in the next section.
3 Infixation
Standard two-levels models can describe some (;lasses of infixation, but resorting to tile use of ad hoc diacritics which have no linguistic significance, e.g.
(Antworth, 1990, p.
156). This section presents a framework for describing infixalion rules using our multi-tape two-level formalism.
This is illustrated here by analysing Measures 2 and 8 of the Arabic verb.
Measure 2,/kutlib/, is derived by prefixing a mora to the base template under NI?C.
The operation is 0 = 'prefix i d and tile rule is ()/R~(a~, Left).
The new mora is filled by the spreading of the adjacent (second) consonant.
The steps of the derivation are: O/~\[~(kutib) = kutib@ * ()(kutib:{ 0 -ku * O(tib) = ku * /ztib = ku * ttib : kuttib Measure 8,/ktutib/, is derived by the aflixation of a {t} to the base template, under NP(\].
The operation is O = 'prefix {t}'; the rule is O/'I,(C, \[,eft;), where C is a consonant.
The process is: O/{l}(kutib)-kutib:{I~ * O(kutib:~) :: k * O(utib) -k * tutib ktut ib The following two-lew'J grammar builds on the one discussed in section 2.
The following lexieal entry gives the Measure 8 morpheums.
4: {t} verb_all ix : \[measure=8\] The additional two-level rules are: <~,~,c,,v~,0 E <~,~,c,*,c) -~ I7 * C * Features: \[measure= (2,5) \] โข (~,,,C,V,h) * ~.
1.8 * CAV * Features: \[measure=8\] where C,i:radical, 'Vi---vowel, A----verbal affix, a, nd X +.
Rules I1,7-11,8 are measure-struttic.
Each ruh; is associated with a feature structure which must unify with the feature structures of the affecl;ed lexical entries.
This ensures that each rule is applied only to the 1)roper ineasure.
I1,7 handles Measm'e 2; it represents the operation O -'prefix it' and the rule ()/~(a~, Left) by placing B:~I~ in LLC and the residue B/~ in 11LC, and inserting a consonant C (representing t ~) on the surface.
The filling of/t by the spreading of the second iadical is achieved by the unification of C in LFx with C in RLC.
I1,8 takes care of Measure 8; it represents the operation () -'prefix {t}' and the rule O/'li(C, Left).
Note that one cmmot place B:~\[~ and B/i\[, in LLC and I/,LC, respectively, as tilt; ease in 1/,7 because the parsing function cuts into the first syllable.
Oil(; remaining Measul'e has not been discussed, Measure 3.
11; is derived by prefixing the base template with It.
The process is as follows: 667 O(7 O"x O" G" O'm kut ib kut ib O" (T (Yx kuut ib The corresponding two-level rule follows.

4 Conclusion
This paper have demonstrated that multi-tape two-level systems offer a richer and more powerful devices than those in standard two-level models.
This makes the multi-tape version capable of modelling non-linear operations such as infixation and templatic morphology.
The rules and lexiea samples reproduced here are based on a larger morphological grammar written for the SemHe implementation (a multitape two-level system) for a full description of the system, see (Kiraz, 1996c; Kiraz, 1996b).
