3. Related Work TIPSTER Phase III first identified cross-document coreference as an area for research since it is a central tool to drive the process of producing summaries from multiple documents and for information fusion (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).

Smith Corpus Results Our main goal for the John Smith corpus is to demonstrate that we have successfully approximated the algorithm of Bagga and Baldwin (1998).
P98-1012 W98-0203
Results from Baldwin and Bagga (1998) are estimated and overlaid onto the graph.

Much of the work in this study is based on that by Bagga and Baldwin (1998), where they presented a successful cross-document coreference resolution algorithm to resolve ambiguities between people having the same name using the vector space model.

4. Corpora To evaluate the effectiveness of our various techniques for cross document coreference, we use the same “John Smith” corpus created by Bagga and Baldwin (1998).

5.1. Incremental vector space Our intent with the incremental vector space model is to approximate the work reported by Bagga and Baldwin (1998).
P98-1012 W98-0203
We use the B-CUBED scoring algorithm (Bagga and Baldwin 1998) because it is the one used in the published research.

The problem becomes more complex because documents might come from different sources, will probably have different authors and different writing conventions and styles(Bagga and Baldwin,1998), and may even be in different languages.

The Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) identified cross-document coreference as a potential task but it was not included because it was considered to be too difficult (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).
