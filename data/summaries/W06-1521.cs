For some more information about ACGs and their relation to TAGs, one may read (de Groote, 2001) and (de Groote, 2002).

The algorithm we present is a specialization to TAGs of a more general one dedicated to second order Abstract Categorial Grammars (ACGs) (de Groote, 2001).

Indeed, this algorithm, a special instance of a general one which can parse any second order ACG and it behaves exactly the same way as the algorithm given by (Schabes and Joshi, 1988) so that it parses a second order ACG encoding a TAG in O(n6).
