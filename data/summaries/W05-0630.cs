For accomplishing the CoNLL 2005 Shared Task on Semantic Role Labeling (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), we capitalized on our experience on the semantic shallow parsing by extending our system, widely experimented on PropBank and FrameNet (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004) data, with a twostep boundary detection and a hierarchical argument classification strategy.

The evaluations were carried out with the SVMlight-TK software (Moschitti, 2004) available at http://ai-nlp.info.uniroma2.it/moschitti/ which encodes the tree kernels in the SVM-light software (Joachims, 1999).

(Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005)) and structural (Moschitti, 2004) features developed in previous studies.

(Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005).

For example, we found that the SCF tree kernel (Moschitti, 2004) improves the AX multiclassifier AX AM CX RX # train.

In order to do this we used a tree kernel to classify the subtrees associated with correct predicate argument structures (see (Moschitti et al., 2005)).

To represent the Fp,a pairs we used the following features: the Phrase Type, Predicate Word, Head Word, Governing Category, Position and Voice defined in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002); the Partial Path, Compressed Path, No Direction Path, Constituent Tree Distance, Head Word POS, First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, SubCategorization and Head Word of Prepositional Phrases proposed in (Pradhan et al., 2005); and the Syntactic Frame designed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

We have also studied how to train an overlap resolver by means of tree kernels; the promising approach and results can be found in (Moschitti et al., 2005).
