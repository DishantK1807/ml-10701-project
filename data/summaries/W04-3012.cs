Alternatively, it may be included in the processing pipeline at a later stage, namely at the interface between the automatic speech recognizer and the spoken language understanding component (Gurevych et al., 2003a; Gurevych and Porzel, 2003).

Such knowledge can be integrated in the ASR component (Gao, 2003; Gao et al., 2003; Stolcke et al., 2000; Sarikaya et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2000).

A detailed description of the ontology employed in our experiments is given in Gurevych et al.(2003b). Ontological concepts are high-level units.

The emergence of wide coverage linguistic knowledge bases for multiple languages, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998; Baker et al., 2003), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2004) is likely to change this situation.

ratio In previous experiments (Gurevych et al., 2003a), we found that when operating on sets of concepts as representations of speech recognition hypotheses, the ratio of the number of ontological concepts n in a given CR and the total number of words w in the respective SRH must be accounted for.

Alternatively, this kind of disambiguation can be performed automatically, e.g., with the help of the system presented in Gurevych et al.(2003a). The system scores semantic coherence of SRHs, where the best CR is the one with the highest semantic coherence.
