These are same as three of the four knowledge sources used in (Lee and Ng, 2002).
W02-1006
6.1 Data The data used for our comparison experiments were developed as part of the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006), which uses the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
J93-2004
We utilize a maximum entropy (ME) model (Berger et al., 1996) to design the basic classifier used in active learning for WSD.
J96-1002
In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the ME model, all sentences containing the target word were automatically partof-speech (POS) tagged using the Brill POS tagger (Brill, 1992).
A92-1021
2005; Dang and Palmer, 2005), when enough labeled training data is available.
