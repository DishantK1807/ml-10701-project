Another option, followed by (Setzer, 2001) (and in a very simplified way, by (Katz and Arosio, 2001)) is to use a few rules of inference (similar to the example seen in the previous paragraph), and to compare the closures (with respect to these rules) of the human annotations.

The saturation of the graph of relations is not done with a few handcrafted rules of the form (relation between e1 and e2) + (relation between e2 and e3) gives (a simple relation between e1 and e3) (Setzer, 2001; Katz and Arosio, 2001) but with the use of the full algebra of Allen relation.
W01-1315
So we have chosen relations similar to that of (Bruce, 1972) (as in (Li et al., 2001)), who inspired Allen; these relations are equivalent to certain sets of Allen relations, as shown Table 2.

This will be enriched later with a notion of temporal focus, following for instance (Kameyama et al., 1993; Song and Cohen, 1991), and a notion of temporal perspective necessary to capture more complex tense interactions.
P93-1010
A few tasks can be distinguished in that respect: detecting dates and temporal markers detecting event descriptions finding the date of events described figuring out the temporal relations between events in a text The first task is not too difficult when looking for dates, e.g. using regular expressions (Wilson et al., 2001), but requires some syntactic analysis in a larger framework (Vazov, 2001; Shilder and Habel, 2001).

These rules for French are similar to rules for English proposed in (Grover et al., 1995; Song and Cohen, 1991; Kameyama et al., 1993), but 1We have defined 89 rules, divided in 29 levels.
P93-1010
To the best of our knowledge, only (Li et al., 2001) and (Mani and Wilson, 2000) mention having tried this kind of annotation, as a side job for their temporal expressions mark-up systems.
P00-1010 W01-1305
This is the path chosen by (Katz and Arosio, 2001; Setzer, 2001) with human annotators.
