in Conventional Systems One-sentence to one-sentence translation can be used for training a statistical translation model such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), which could be a strong baseline system for machine translation.

Actually, it has been reported that syntactic structures contribute to improving the accuracy of word alignment between Japanese and English (Yamada and Knight, 2001).

However, we can automatically estimate English word order by using a language model or an English surface sentence generator such as FERGUS (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).

For example, when we use a Japanese text generation system from keywords (Uchimoto et al., 2002), users should only select appropriate keywords.

Recently, accurate machine translation systems can be constructed by using parallel corpora (Och and Ney, 2000; Germann et al., 2001).

The definitions of part-of-speech (POS) categories and syntactic labels follow those of the Treebank I style (Marcus et al., 1993).

On the other hand, high-quality treebanks such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the Kyoto University text corpus (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997) have contributed to improving the accuracies of fundamental techniques for natural language processing such as morphological analysis and syntactic structure analysis.
