In the iNeast system (Leuski et al., 2003), the identification of relevant terms is oriented towards multi-document summarization, and they use a likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) which favours terms which are representative of the set of documents as opposed to the full collection.

(Lin and Hovy, 1997) compared different strategies to generate lists of relevant terms for summarization using Topic Signatures.

Previous work includes using noun phrases (Boguraev et al., 1998; Jones et al., 2002), words (Buyukkokten et al., 1999), n-grams (Leuski et al., 2003; Lin and Hovy, 1997) or proper nouns, multi-word terms and abbreviations (Neff and Cooper, 1999).

We have implemented the procedure described in (Rayson and Garside, 2000) using unigrams only.
