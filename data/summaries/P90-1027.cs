As Shieber et al.(1989) point out, the inherently top-down character of goal freezing interpreters may occasionally cause serious troubles during execution of certain types of recursive goals.

The method described here is contrasted with the approaches that seek to define a generalized but computationally expensive evaluation strategy for running a grammar in either direction without manipulating its rules (Shieber, 1988), (Shieber et al., 1989), 0Vedekind, 1989), and see also (Naish, 1986) for some relevant techniques.
