A very similar formulation, for another grammar transformation, is given in Nederhof (1998).

This idea was proposed by Krauwer and des Tombe (1981), Langendoen and Langsam (1987), and Pulman (1986), and was rediscovered by Black (1989) and recently by Johnson (1998).

See Nederhof (1998) for a variant of this approximation that constructs finite transducers rather than finite automata.

of RTN Superset Approximation We rephrase the method of Grimley-Evans (1997) as follows: First, we construct the approximating finite automaton according to the unparameterized RTN method above.

For determinization and minimization of automata, we have applied programs from the FSM library described in Mohri, Pereira, and Riley (1998).

The stack height is bounded by a low number; Johnson (1998) claims a suitable number would be 5.
P98-1101
This method can be generalized, inspired by Stolcke and Segal (1994), who derive N-gram probabilities from stochastic context-free grammars.
P94-1011
First, construction of an LR automaton, of which the size is exponential in the size of the grammar, may be a prohibitively expensive task (Nederhof and Satta 1996).
P96-1032
The motivation is that such sentences do not occur frequently in practice, since these subderivations make them difficult for people to comprehend (Resnik 1992).

representation in Mohri and Pereira (1998) is even more compact than ours for grammars that are not self-embedding.
