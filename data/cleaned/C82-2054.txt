ON AN APPROACH FOR DESIGNING LINGUISTIC PROCESSORS Radoslav Pavlov, Galia Angelova Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics, Institute of Mathematics with Computer Center, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, P.OvB. 373, I090 Sofia, Bulgaria The present paper discusses the principles of designing a system for man-computer di~lo6ue in natural, language.
The system is being elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics at the Institute of Mathematics with Computer Center of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
The desorlbed system requires: I.
A form~ description of the syntax of basic nuclear structures of the natural lanEuage sentences which has to be used during the process of syntactical analysis of the users" phrases in a natural language~ 2.
Techniques for representing in the computer the knowledge about a given problem area.
The obtained description has to be used during the process of semantical analysis of the users" phrases in a natural language! 3.
A dictionary containing the terms used in the chosan problem area.
The dictionary is compiled by specialists in the given problem area; 4e A dictionary containing the eel-vice vocabulary (independent of a particular problem area) word-groups as "less than", "geater than", "equal to", "slid", "or", "as... ash etc.
5. A basic software system a data base management 222 system (for example, a relational DBMS), or a program package (for example, BMDP bio-medical data processing).
These ready software products service users ofa given problem area and they usually have their own language for describing and processing the data.
The considered system is viewed as a superstructure over the given software system and it performs: 1.
Translation from a language close to the natur~al one into the internal software system's language for description or processing the data; 2.
An effort to analyse the correctness of the user's request in terms of the given problem area description and messages when discovering mistakes! 3.
When ambiguities happen a dialogue is carried out in order to make the user's request unambiguous.
4. ~rocessing the results from the basic software system and final shaping of the messages in the context of the user's request.
Such a system is called a linguistic processor (or linguistic preprocessor) and is considered as a dynamic system which can be generated over various problem areas and various basic software systems.
By "a natural fan.age as a tool for the man computer dialogue" in this paper we mean the following: a fixed list of appropriate natural language phrases is not aseigned~ restrictions are not imposed on the ~rammatical structures of the sentences the man enters into the computer! man has to interact with the computer in a correct natural language.

Functional relationships between different parts of the linguistic processor and the problem area descriptions.
224 The describe approach for creatin~ linguistic processors can be qualified as a semantic syntactical one since semantical analysis in terms of the given problem area description has a leading role in the process of "understanding" of the input phrase in a natural language, while syntactical analysis has an auxiliary role.
The structural description of the prob~ lem area is a network designed for the representation of the problem area semantics and is viewed as a static, inmoblle and determinative tool for "understanding" and accomplishing the dialogue.
The syntactical analysis does not presume a full scanning of the input sentence.
It involves analysis of syntactical dependences at different levels with respect to the problem area complexity and, naturally, to the input phrase complexity.
By means of an elaboration of the formal description of Bulgarian syntax, an improvement of the techniques for syntactical analysis is envisaged.
When workir~ out the principles of construction of linguistic processors, some peculiarities of the Bulgarian lan~age have been taken into account, namely, its flexiona~ character, the absence of a case system, free word-order, etc.
The approach proposed for the realization of the man computer dialogue in a natural language allows to process problem areas with different complexity.
Linguistics processors at two levels are bein~ elaborated at the Laboratory of Mathematical Linguistics for access of users nonprogr~mnere to a relational data base in Bulgarian l~ags and for access of users nonprogrammere to the facilities for statIstloal analysis proposed by the program package \]~DI ) Bulgarian language o 225 -
