For instance, the Alembic workbench (Aberdeen et al., 1995) contains a sentence splitting module which employs over 100 regular-expression rules written in Flex.

In contrast to (Palmer and Hearst, 1997), which also used POS categories as predictive features, we relied on a proper POS tagging technology, rather than a shortcut to POS tag estimation.

In our experiments we used the Brown Corpus and the Wall Street Journal corpus both taken from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini, 1993).

Thus, the second class of SBD systems employs machine learning techniques such as decision tree classifiers (Riley, 1989), maximum entropy modeling (MAXTERMINATOR) (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), neural networks (SATZ) (Palmer and Hearst, 1997), etc..

The best performance on the Brown Corpus, 0.2% error rate, was reported by (Riley, 1989), who trained a decision tree classifier on a 25 million word corpus.

By collecting sequences and unigrams of unambiguously capitalized and lowercased words in the document and imposing special ordering of their applications (Mikheev, 1999) reports that the document-centered approach achieved a 0.4-0.7% error rate with coverage of about 90% on the disambiguation of capitalized words in mandatory positions.
P99-1021
Feature Set (Mikheev, 1999) described a new approach to the disambiguation of capitalized words in mandatory positions.

SATZ System (Palmer and Hearst, 1997) described an approach which recognized the potential of the local syntactic context for the SBD problem.

There are two corpora normally used for evaluation and development in a number of text processing tasks and in the SBD task in particular: the Brown Corpus and the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus both part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Marcinkiewicz, and Santorini, 1993).
