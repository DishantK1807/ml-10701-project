~oth tools 08/% be adjusted to particular strata of languages via restricting gralmnatieal or computational complexity'.
I..Two questions about oategprial 6\]ra3,1ars In.
spite of the fascinating folnnal simplicity 8/Id lucidity of oategorial grammar as developed by Bar-Hillel \[I\] q~Eunbek \[7\] and followers, it has nevertheless never been brou~'ht into wide scale use.
Why' is this so?
We may' easily' recognize two drawbacks.
I/ .R.es,t,rieted scope oJ? o~t.eg~o_r!a_l ~r~unmars.
It was shown early' \[ I \] that the set of laxts~/ages describable by these g'rarm\[lars is exactly-that of context-free i8/%g~/a~'es.
\[Is this restriction inevitable or oa/~ a similar ty'pe of l~%ng%lage description be retained beyond the limit of context-free lan~lages?
This is the first question we try' to ~lswer.

abstract scheme cannot serve as a description of a realistic parsing procedure.
The suitable assig~ement appearing here as the first phase is in fact the goal of the parsing.
The "brute force" approach following the above scheme, which cheeks all possible assignements and tries to eEu~eel them is not eomputationally' tractable, since for most granmlarS the nul,ber of all possible assignements grows exponentially with the length of the analysed sentence.
The moral of this obsel~vation is that the assi~nement oaru~ot be separated from the cancellation.
Similarly as parsers based on phrase str~oture grammars have to make at each point of time an intelligent choice of rule to apply next~ the eategorial parser must m~ke an intelligen~ choice out of a list of alternative oaten'cries.
This necessity to look ahead at cancellation when making the assignement leads to the conclusion \[6 \] that assi~nement and cancellation must in any' actual parser be interwoven.
Therefore our second key qlles~ion reads: Can this interweaving" be grasped by' a simple formal model or does it unavoidingly lead to ~ mess of complicated ad hoe and heuristic teelmiques?
If. Proposed solution We introduce in nontechnical langn/a~'e the essence of the proposed generalization of eategorial gran.nars ~d their parsers.
Tile exact mathematical formulations can be found in \[3\].
Oranmlars. Tile principal difference between the "classical" eategorial granmlar and the ~eneralizcd cate_gorial 6-rams at (GCG) is 208 that inste~d of finite sets of categories corresponding to terminal syunbols, GCG allows fox, infinite sets of categories.
Bach such infinite sot, however~ can be generated b\['.
a @J:mple procedure, in fact procedure9 based on a finite state generator.
Automata° We offer list automaton (bA) as a mathematical model of oate~orial ~rEumnar parsing.
List automaton is schematically represented by' Fig.

consists of a nondeterministie finite state oont~ol unit attached to a finite -tape.
At the begilminc of the Oolnputation "the tape contains the analysed string° The automaton can read 8/id rewrite so~,~aned symbols and move the soauning head one tape cell to the left or right analogously as Tur:Lng machine° In addition to it, it can delete "the scamped oell~ i.e. out it out arid paste the remaining' tape parts to~'ether.
In the remainder of the paragraph we list results indicating, as we believe~ that the concepts of G-CO and LA give satisfaeto:cy' auswers be the above questions.

Both GCGs and LA represent exactly all context -sensitive :kan6~u~6"eSo Similarly' like in %he ease of Cl,'-6.r~umnars and pushdo~n automata or oon'bext-sensitive ~'ralmnars and linearly' bounded automata \[5 \] there exist transformations of GCGs to LA and "vice versa: au al~'or.ithm Aj, which for each GCG G y'ields a LA A I (G) representin C the sa.,e 1;luggage ~nd conversely' an algorithm A 2 which for each LA M y'ields an equivalent GCG A2(M ) The next step in our arg~nent is to point out a remarkab'ke feature of the interplay' between GCGs and LA, b/ Stratif'aeation.
Tihe correspondence between GCGs and LA ca~ be observed not only' in the whole class of context-sensitive languag'es, but also on the level of CF-lan6~ages and in each of infinitely many' strata between CF a CS-lang~ages.
The stratification can be defined via two complexity measures.
Or~u3nn~tic~l pomplexity": given a GCG C and a string w, the ~rmmnatieal complexity' of w wrt.
G, denoted G(w) ~ is defined as 'the lengt\[h of the longest category' used in the aualy'sis wrt.
~ . (For alabi~uous gralmllars~ "the oonlplexity' :ks defined for each \[parse of the string).
.C0mpn~ational complexity\[: given a LA M and 6% strin0; W, the computational complexity' of W wrt.
~ denoted M(w), is defined as the maximal number of visits paid to a sing'le square during the accepting computation (ambiguity being treated as before).
In "tile light of these complexity measures we can reconsider the relation between GCGs and LA determilled by' the above mentioned alF;oritl~us A I and A 2 For s.ny' GCG G and\[ any' sentence w, each ~r6Ullmabie~l description of w wrt.
is refleeted as a computation of A I (G) accepting w . :File g'r~umnatieal complexity of the description is approximately' the same as the eomputabional complexity' of the corresponding eon,p'atation~ Analogous result holds for &2 " Now, any function f mappin~ natural numbers on natural ntunbers debeT.lines a stratum S (f) of lan~.tla6"es : a langmlag~e L belongs to the stratum 8~ if and only' if it o~n be represented by' a GCG G (Or equivalently a LA M) such that from eaeb sentence w from L of length n, the complexity' G(w) (or M(w)) does not exceed the :numbel ~ f(n) . OuT previous considerations show that the algorithms /11 ' &2 respect the stratifi~ oatio_n.
