This particular combination has proven useful in analyzing various kinds of conditions and circumstances that 4 There is some question as to whether these semantically based relations should be termed rhetorical in the classic sense at all (Dale 1993).

Hovy's text structurer (Hovy 1988b), for example, uses rhetorical relations as defined in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson 1987) to order a set of propositions to be expressed.

(Airfone 1991) 2 1 It should be noted that this corpus is much smaller than the language corpora used in larger statistical studies (Church and Mercer 1993).

The current study has conflated them, as the instructional texts have not tended to display the complex intentional structure common to persuasive texts and interactive discourses (Vander Linden 1993b).

In the case of a purpose, for example, Penman will produce a non-fronted in order to infinitive clause, as in the following output of the structurer (Hovy 1988b, p.

(See the analytical work of Delin, Scott, and Hartley \[1993\] for a notable exception to this pattern).

The details of IMAGENE'S treatment of purpose expressions are given as representative of the coverage and form of the full system (more details concerning the other relations can be found elsewhere \[Vander Linden 1993c\]).

They are termed informational by Moore and Pollack (1992) and subject matter by Mann and Thompson (1987) because they are based on semantic content rather than on intentional or presentational content.

Text generators specifically designed for instructional text, such as Mellish and Evans' generator (Mellish and Evans 1989), EPICURE (Dale 1992), COMET (McKeown et al.1990), and TECHDOC (R6sner and Stede 1992b), display similar characteristics.
J89-4002
There is considerable debate in the field of discourse analysis concerning the relative importance of intentional structure and rhetorical relations (e.g., Grosz and Sidner 1986; Moore and Pollack 1992), most systems focusing on one or the other.

There are other studies of purpose expressions from the point of view of representation and understanding that are of use here (Di Eugenio 1992; Balkanski 1992).

Two such examples are Hovy's Pauline (Hovy 1988a) and Meteer's Spokesman (Meteer 1991, 1992), both of which are based, at least in part, on corpus studies.

The IMAGENE project employs a hypothesis generation and test cycle, such as the one advocated by Cumming (1990) in an attempt to identify correlations between the contextual features of communicative context on the one hand, and the lexical and grammatical forms on the other.

IMAGENE contains a sub-network implementing these two processes that is currently very preliminary (Vander Linden 1993c).

This specification is coded in terms of Penman's Sentence Planning Language (SPL) (Kasper 1989), a language that allows the specification of the lexical items and gram42 Keith Vander Linden and James H.

This reflects the greater diversity of procedural contexts in which preconditions arise and the corresponding diversity of the forms used to express them (see Vander Linden 1994).

Finally, RST has been used by many researchers for the purpose of text generation (e.g., Moore and Paris 1988; Hovy and McCoy 1989; Scott and Souza 1990; R6sner 33 Computational Linguistics Volume 21, Number 1 Precondition \[ (1) Instruct ~ 1 (2) Remove ~uence (3) Grasp (4) Pull Purpose 151 Return (6) Place Figure 1 The RST representation of the Remove-Phone text.
