There are several distance measures suitable for this purpose, such as the mutual information(Church and Hanks, 1990), the dice coefficient(Manning and Schueutze 8.5, 1999), the phi coefficient(Manning and Schuetze 5.3.3, 1999), the cosine measure(Manning and Schueutze 8.5, 1999) and the confidence(Arrawal and Srikant, 1995).

The Yamamoto-Church method(Yamamoto and Church, 2001) allows for the creation of a a21a29a22 a1 a19 a14 table using a0a8a1a4a3a15a14 memory space and a0a2a1a4a3 a5 a7 a9a12a11 a1a4a3a15a14a16a14 computation time, where a19 represents all substrings in a given corpus.
