A more operational system using semantic representation of referents is for instance LaSIE (Gaizauskas et al.1995), presented at MUC-6, which relies however a lot on task-dependent knowledge.
M95-1017
An interesting solution has been proposed by Lin (1995) using constraint solving to group REs into MRs.
M95-1010
The activation of an MR is computed according to salience factors (this technique is described for instance by Lappin and Leass (1994)).
J94-4002
of the model 3.1 Reference resolution mechanism We have particularized and implemented the theoretical model using algorithms in the style of Lappin and Leass (1994).
J94-4002
Our purpose here is to show how a simplified computational model of discourse reference can be implemented and give significant results for reference resolution; we showed previously (Popescu-Belis and Robba 1997) that it was also relevant for pronoun resolution.
