I would like to thank Hans van Halteren for supplying the Eindhoven corpus data set as used in (van Halteren et al., 2001).
J01-2002
The Wotan data is annotated with a tagset consisting of 345 tags (although a number of 341 is reported in (van Halteren et al., 2001)).
J01-2002
For example, the TnT trigram HMM tagger achieves state-of-the-art tagging accuracies on English and German (Brants, 2000).

These sentences received no contextual labels and thus not all of the training data used in (van Halteren et al., 2001) could be used in the Wotan experiment.
J01-2002
In the Wotan experiment, 36K sentences (628K words) are used for training (compared to 640K words in (van Halteren et al., 2001)), and 4176 sentences (72K words) are used for testing.
J01-2002
This data set was also used in (van Halteren et al., 2001), therefore the second experiment will allow for a comparison of the results with previous work on tagging Dutch.
