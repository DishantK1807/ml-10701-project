For example, for the text shown in (1 I) below, which is taken from (Moore and Pollack, 1992), one may argue from an informational perspective that A3 is a CONI)ITION \['or B3.

Moore and Pollack (1992) have already shown that different high-level intentions yield different RS-trces.

Reasoning fronl text structures to intentions can be also beneficial hi a context such as that described by Lochbaum (1998) because the rhetorical constraints can help prune the space of shared phms that woukl characterize an intEn tional interpretati o n of a d iscou rse.

limits of Moser and Moore's approach In a recent proposal, Moser and Moore (1996) argued that the primary intentions in a GST representation can be derived fi'om the nuclei ot'the corresponding RST representation.
J96-3006
In their seminal paper, Moore and Polhtck (1992) showed lhat a text may be characterized by intentional and rhetorical analyses that are not isomorphic.
J92-4007
This constraint is consistent with Moser and Moore's (1996) discussion of RST and GST.
