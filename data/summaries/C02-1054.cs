For training, we use ‘CRL data’, which was prepared for IREX (Information Retrieval and Extraction Exercise1, Sekine and Eriguchi (2000)).

‘ME’ indicates our ME system and ‘RG+DT’ indicates a rule-based machine learning system (Isozaki, 2001).
P01-1041
Since we followed Isozaki’s implementation (Isozaki, 2001), our system is different from Yamada’s system in the following points: 1) adjustment of word boundaries, 2) ChaSen’s parameters for unknown words, 3) character types, 4) use of the Viterbi search.

We also use additional data by Isozaki (2001).

Now, Japanese NE recognition is solved by the classification of words (Sekine et al., 1998; Borthwick, 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000).
C00-2167 W98-1120
SVMs have given high performance in various classification tasks (Joachims, 1998; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
N01-1025
His system is an extension of Kudo’s chunking system (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) that gave the best performance at CoNLL-2000 shared tasks.
N01-1025
The adjustment rules are also statistically determined (Isozaki, 2001).
P01-1041
We developed an SVM-based NE system by following our NE system based on maximum entropy (ME) modeling (Isozaki, 2001).
P01-1041
See Isozaki (2001) for details.

The recognizer runs at a rate of only 85 bytes/sec on an Athlon 1.3 GHz Linux PC, while rule-based systems (e.g., Isozaki, (2001)) can process several kilobytes in a second.
