Acoustic-Prosodic Characteristics of Repairs We studied the acoustic and prosodic correlates of repair events as defined in the RIM framework with the aim of identifying potential cues for automatic repair processing, extending a pilot study reported in (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993).

Although studies of large speech corpora have found that approximately 10% of spontaneous utterances contain disfluencies involving self-correction, or REPAIRS (Hindle, 1983; Shriberg et al., 1992), little is known about how to integrate repair processing with real-time speech recognition.

5Shriberg et al.(1992) report glottalization on 24 of 25 vowel-final fragments.

RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle (1983): (1) correction strategies are linguisticallyrulegoverned, and (2) linguistic cues must be available to signal when a disfluency has occurred and to 'trigger' correction strategies.

We used the 172 TI and SRI repair utterances from our earlier pilot study (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993) as training date; these served a similar purpose in the descriptive analysis presented above.

Importantly, Hindle's system allows for nonsurface-based corrections and sequential application of correction rules (Hindle, 1983, p.

An hypothesized acousticphonetic edit signal, "a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal" (Hindle, 1983, p.123), is assumed to mark the interruption of fluent speech (cf.

Bear et al.(1992) also speculate that acoustic information might be used to filter out false positives for candidates matching two of their lexical patterns -repetitions of single words and cases of single inserted words -but do not report such experimentation.

RIM builds upon Labov (1966) and Hindle (1983) by conceptually extending the EDIT SIGNAL HYPOTHESIS -that repairs are acoustically or phonetically marked at the point of interruption of fluent speech.

Recently, Shriberg et al.(1992) and Bear et al.(1992) have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs.
H92-1085 P92-1008
One proposal for repair processing that lends itself to both incremental processing and the integration of speech cues into repair detection is that of Hindle (1983), who defines a typology of repairs and associated correction strategies in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser.
P83-1019
Bear et al.(1992) note that INTERRUPTION GLO'I~ALIZATION (irregular glottal pulses) sometimes occurs at the reparandum offset.
P92-1008
Results of testing the first stage of this model, the lexical pattern matcher, are reported in (Bear et al., 1992): 309 of 406 utterance containing 'nontrivial' repairs in their 10,718 utterance corpus were correctly identified, while 191 fluent utterances were incorrectly identified as containing repairs.
P92-1008
4Shriberg et al.(1992) found that 60.2% of repairs in their corpus contained fragments.

3In our pilot study of the SRI and TI utterances only, we found that repairs occurred in 9.1% of utterances (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993).
