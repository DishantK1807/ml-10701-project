This is very ilar to the set up in (Kudo and Matsumato, 2000).

An alternative to our approach is the W-by-W approach proposed in (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003).

Here, we have illustrated that the Pby-P approach is a promising alternative to the recently proposed W-by-W approach (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003).

Shallow semantic parsing with the goal of creating a domain independent meaning representation based on predicate/argument structure was first explored in detail by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

An alternative set are thematic roles similar to those proposed in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002): AGENT, ACTOR, BENEFICIARY, CAUSE, etc.

Large semantically annotated databases, like FrameNet (Baker et.al, 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) have been used to train and test the classifiers.

In the W-by-W method (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003) the problem is formulated as a chunking task and the features are derived for each word (assuming part of speech tags and syntactic phrase chunks are available), and the word is classified into one of the semantic labels using an IOB2 representation.

Since then several variants of the basic approach have been introduced using different features and different classifiers based on various machine-learning methods (Gildea and Palmer, 2002;.Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Surdeanu et.
