Nonetheless, our experience already suggests, in keeping with \[Arnold et al., 1993\], that from the point of view of relative expressivity it is possible to move grammars from one formalism to another, and even perhaps to conceive of new grammars which arc designed from the start to be portable across a range of related formalisms.

In some ways, our work is similar in spirit to the reusability experiments reported in \[Arnold el al., 1993\], though these appear to have been limited to translation to a single, rather general formalism, and to have been concerned ahnost entirely with questions of relative expressivity.
