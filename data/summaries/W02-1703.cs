The starting basis for our annotation draws on some detailed non-computational accounts of the organization of multimodal pages/documents–most speciﬁcally, the seminal account of constraints on document design by Waller (1987)–and exploratory computational accounts–such as the layout structures introduced by Bateman et al.(2001).This organization reﬂects both artefact-internal considerations such as the layout, text and graphics, as well as artefact-external considerations such as design decisions, production constraints (e.g., cost), and artefact constraints (i.e., the limited size of a piece of paper contrasted with the theoretically unbounded scrollable window on a computer screen).These external considerations are often connected.
