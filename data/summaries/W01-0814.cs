Mani et al.(1999) proposes to incorporate the cohesionconcerned revision process into summarization.

For example, Marcu et al.(2000) proposes a computational model for transforming rhetorical structures between a source and target languages, aiming at the improvement of translation quality.

It is a matter of surface realization or sentence planning (Wanner and Hovy, 1996; Reiter and Dale, 1999).

and ellipsis Several works have explored the relation between rhetorical structure and reference in English (Fox, 1987; Cristea et al., 2000; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995).

The scope of the variations of linguistic cohesive devices we would like to consider here largely covers the matters of sentence planning (or micro planning) (Wanner and Hovy, 1996; Reiter and Dale, 1999) including referring expressions, discourse markers, sentence grouping, clause configuration, topicalization, etc.

Japanese reference, on the other hand, has been studied from a different perspective, being associated mainly with the linear nature of texts as in the centering theory (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1994).

(Fujii et al., 1998).

In most existing generation systems, however, the process of considering cohesiveness tends to be distributed over a number of choice points in the search space of generation (more specifically, for example, decision experts in blackboard-based a sentence planner (Wanner and Hovy, 1996; Grote and Stede, 1998)), which has obstructed reuse of implemented knowledge.

For example, works on discourse marker choice (Scott and de Souza, 1990; Vander Linden, 1994; Grote and Stede, 1998; Oates, 1999), generation of referring expressions (Dale, 1992), and clause aggregation based on discourse relation (Dalianis and Hovy, 1996; Show, 1998) are all related to linguistic realization of cohesive relations.
