Collapsing phrase-structure rules into the lexicon is the overt purpose of 'lexicali7ed' grammars as defmed by Schabes, Abeill6, Joshi 1988 : a 'lexicallzed' grammar consists of a fmite set of elementary structures, each of which is systematically associated with one (or more) lexical item serving as 'head'.
