Relevant references with an emphasis on spell-checking and OCR correction are Blair (1960), Riseman and Ehrich (1971), Ullman (1977), Angell, Freund, and Willett (1983), Srihari, Hull, and Choudhari (1983), Srihari (1985), Takahashi et al.(1990), Kukich (1992), Zobel 454 Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 4 and Dart (1995), and Dengel et al.(1997). Exact or approximate search in a dictionary is discussed, for example, in Wells et al.(1990), Sinha (1990), Bunke (1993), Oflazer (1996), and Baeza-Yates and Navarro (1998).
