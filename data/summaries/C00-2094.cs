We evaluated this simple method on a large number of real-world translations and got results comparable to related approaches such as that of Dagan and Itai (1994) where much more selectional int!ormation is used.

Induction via EM-Based Clustering 2.1 EM-Based Clustering For clustering, we used the method described in Rooth et al.(1999). There classes are derived from distributional data a sample of pairs of verbs and nouns, gathered by parsing an unannotated corpus and extracting tile fillers of grammatical relations.

The SENSEVAL '~tan(lard is clearly beaten by the earlier results of Yarowsky (1995) (96.5 % precision) and Schiitze (1992) (92 % precision).

We evaluated our resolution methods on a pseudo-disambiguation task sinlilar to that used in Rooth et al.(1999) for evaluating clustering models.

However, a comparison to these refrom his random baseline 28.5 % by taking 100/28.5; reversely, Dagan and Itai's (1994) random baseline can be calculated as 100/2.27 = 44.05.

Column 4 4The mnbiguity factor 2.27 attributed to Dagan and Itai's (1994) experiment is calculated by dividing their average of 3.27 alternative translations by their average of 1.44 correct translations.

Furthermore, we calculated the ambiguity factor 3.51 for Resnik's (1997) experiment shows the rmldom baselines cited for the respective experiments, ranging t'rom ca.

The most direct point of comparison is the method of Dagan and Itai (1994) whirl1 gives 91.4 % precision (92.7 % standardized) and 62.1% effectiveness (66.8 % standardized) on 103 test; examples for target word selection in the transfer of Hebrew to English.

Dagan and Itai's (1994) method is based on a large variety of gramnmtieal relations tbr verbal, nominal, and adjectival predicates, but no class-based infornmtion or slot-labeling is used.
