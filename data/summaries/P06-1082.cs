Use of roughly aligned corpora has also been proposed in (Dagan and Gale, 1993) for word alignment in bilingual corpora, where statistical techniques have been used as the underlying alignment scheme.
W93-0301
Several approaches including statistical techniques (Gale and Church, 1991; Brown et al., 1993), lexical techniques (Huang and Choi, 2000; Tiedemann, 2003) and hybrid techniques (Ahrenberg et al., 2000), have been pursued to design schemes for word alignment which aims at establishing links between words of a source language and a target language in a parallel corpus.

In this work, the sentence level alignment algorithm given in (Gale and Church, 1991) has been used for applying segment constraint.
H91-1026
Use of sententially aligned corpora for word alignment has already been recommended in (Brown et al., 1993).
