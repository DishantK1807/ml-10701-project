• POS tagger: The maximum entropy POS tagger developed by Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and the rule-based POS tagger developed by Brill (Brill, 1994) are trained with 1200 abstracts extracted from the GENIA corpus, which achieve accuracies of 97.97% and 98.06% respectively, when testing on the rest 800 abstract of the GENIA corpus.

2003). Purely statistical processing overgenerates the MWE candidates (Ga¨el Dias, 2002), and is not sensitive enough to the MWE candidates with low frequencies (Piao et al., 2003).

of Contiguous MWV Candidates A number of works about MWV extraction from corpora are based on the output of a POS tagger and a chunker (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Bannard et al., 2003), or the output of a parser (McCarthy et al., 2003).

Here we do not make differences between the more detailed classification of multiword verbs, especially the verbparticle constructions and verb-preposition constructions (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002).

In general, the methodologies for the extraction of multiword expressions (MWEs, including MWVs) can be classified into syntactic, statistical and hybrid syntactic-statistical (Dias, 2003).

Compared to recent other related works, we found that (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002) presented a F-measure of 0.896 by testing on WSJ.

As the particles in verb + particle MWVs are often intransitive (Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; McCarthy et al., 2003), which are different from the transitive prepositions followed by a noun chunk, we use this feature and a nearest assumption to extract non-contiguous MWV candidates.
