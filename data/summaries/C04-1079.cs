Hillard et al.(2003) have also produced a system which generates summaries of speech discussions supporting a decision-making process.

Secondly, we assume that a text segmentation algorithm (for examples see Hearst’s “Text-Tiling” algorithm 1997, Choi et al.2000) has already segmented the threads according to shifts in task.

For a more complete summary of our interpretation of the SVD analysis see Wan et al.(2003). To begin with, we construct the matrix A as in the Centroid Method.

An overview of the differences between asynchronous and synchronous modes of communication is provided by Clark (1991) and Simpson-Young et al.(2000). Alexandersson et al.(2000) note that in speech there is a tendency not to repeat shared conversation context.

In Wan et al.(2003) we showed that using a combination of traditional TF∗IDF approaches and SVD approaches was useful given that SVD provided additional information about word associations.

Rambow et al.(2004) apply sentence extraction techniques to the thread to construct a generic summary.
