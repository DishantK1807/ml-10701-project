Recently, Shriberg et al.1992 and Bear et al.1992 \[3, 9\] have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs that integrates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information, ha the first stage, lexical pattern matching rules are used to retrieve candidate repair utterances.

Our results are interpreted within a new "speech-first" framework for investigating repairs, the REPAIR INTERVAL MODEL, which builds upon Labov 1966 \[4\] and Hindle 1983 \[2\].

An exception to "text-first" approaches is Hindle 1983 \[2\].

The application of a correction routine is triggered by an hypothesized acoustic/phonetic EDIT SIGNAL, "a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal" (Hindle 1983 \[2, p.
P83-1019
RIM incorporates two main assumptions of Hindle 1983 \[2\]: 1) correction strategies are linguistically rule-governed, and 2) linguistic cues must be available to signal when a disfluency has occurred and to 'trigger' correction strategies.
