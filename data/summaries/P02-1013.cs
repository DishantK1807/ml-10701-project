(van Deemter, 2001) showed how to extend the basic Dale and Reiter Algorithm (Dale and Reiter, 1995) to generate plural definite descriptions using not just conjunctions of positive properties but also negative and disjunctive properties; (Stone, 1998) integrates the D&R algorithm into the surface realisation process and (Stone, 2000) extends it to deal with collective and distributive plural NPs.

It also differs from (Krahmer et al., 2001), who use graphs and graph algorithms for computing DDs – while graphs provides a transparent encoding of unary and binary relations, they lose much of their intuitive appeal when applied to relations of higher arity.

As (Krahmer et al., 2001) observed, “it is unlikely that someone would describe an object as “the dog next to the tree in front of the garage” in a situation where “the dog next to the tree” would suffice.

This is because, as the following example from (Stone and Webber, 1998) illustrates, the information used to uniquely identify some object need not be localised to a definite description.

While the task of constructing singular definite descriptions on the basis of positive properties has received much attention in the generation literature (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer et al., 2001), for a long time, a more general statement of the task at hand remained outstanding.

The solution proposed in (Stone and Webber, 1998) and implemented in the SPUD (Sentence Planning Using Descriptions) generator is to integrate surface realisation and DD computation.

and comparison with related work Integration with surface realisation As (Stone and Webber, 1998) clearly shows, the two-step strategy which consists in first computing a DD and second, generating a definite NP realising that DD, does not do language justice.
