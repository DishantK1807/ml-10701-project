In several focusing frameworks (Sidner 1979; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1995), some grammatical roles (e.g., surface subject and surface direct object) are considered indicative of what is in focus.
J95-2003 P83-1007
As explained in Suri (1993), our claim that aspectual classification might play a role in the interpretation of pronouns in a subsequent sentence is distinct from the hypotheses of other researchers about the role of tense and aspect (e.g., Nakhimovsky 1988; Reichman 1978) in pronoun interpretation.

While Strube (1998) is closer to a "focusing-based" algorithm, it considers very few of the focusing factors discussed in the previous section.
P98-2204
Strube (1998) introduced a novel pronoun resolution algorithm that handled intraand intersentential anaphora uniformly.

(See Suri \[1993\] or Suri and McCoy \[1994\] for a discussion of the implications of the Prefer-SX Hypothesis for a pronoun resolution algorithm 190 Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro Extending Focusing Frameworks such as Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard \[1987\] based on centering).
J94-2006 P87-1022
An exception to this rule is the work of Strube (1996) (which applies functionalinformation-structure-based criteria on a per-clause basis), Kameyama (1998), and Strube (1998).
P96-1057 P98-2204
Walker (1989) performed a corpus analysis on written and spoken English to compare centering with Hobbs's algorithm (Hobbs 1976) in terms of their accuracy and coverage for finding the cospecifiers of pronouns.
P89-1031
Strube, in very recent work (Strube 1998), handles arbitrary sentence complexity.
P98-2204
Some researchers (e.g., Hobbs 1978; Lappin and Leass 1994) have proposed pronoun resolution algorithms that do not involve focus tracking.
J94-4002
The appropriate movement and marking of local focus, and the appropriate choice of the form of a noun phrase (NP) based on local focus information, are considered to contribute to the local coherence exhibited by discourse (Sidner \[1979\], Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein \[1983, 1995\], Carter \[1987\], and others).
J95-2003 P83-1007
On the other hand, it may be the case that for this type of complex sentence, the sentence should be treated as a single unit of processing with elements of one of the clauses dominating the 2 Kameyama (1986) did address the issue of multiple subjects, but did not address the general problem of developing a methodology for determining how a focusing framework should handle complex sentences.
P86-1031
In addition, neither Hobbs (1978) nor Lappin and Leass (1994) tracked focusing information.

3. Processing Complex Sentences: A Reason for Extending Focusing Algorithms Although complex sentences are prevalent in written English, most other local focusing research (focusing: Sidner \[1979\] and Carter \[1987\]; centering: Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein \[1983, 1995\], Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard \[1987\], Walker \[1989, 1993\], Kameyama \[1986\] 2, Walker, Iida, and Cote \[1994\], Brennan \[1998\], Kameyama, Passonneau, and Poesio \[1993\], Linson \[1993\] and Hoffman \[1998\]; and PUNDIT: Dahl \[1986\], Palmer et al.\[1986\], and Dahl and Ball \[1990\]) did not explicitly and/or adequately address how to process complex sentences.

In short, we believe Reichman (1978) only intended that tense and aspect could signal discourse segment boundaries, and thus indirectly influence pronoun interpretation, while Nakhimovsky (1988) claims that a change in time scale, aspectual class, or other temporal characteristics could signal a new discourse segment, and thus, indirectly influence pronoun interpretation.
J88-2004
In fact, in exploring other aspects of local focusing frameworks, other literature appears to have tried to make use of semantically neutral texts in this fashion (e.g., Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994).
J94-2003 P87-1022
Lappin and Leass (1994) developed a pronoun resolution algorithm that chose a referent for a pronoun from a set of potential referents (which were filtered to assure their syntactic and morphological appropriateness) on the basis of a "salience factor" rating.

He was able to apply his algorithm to a corpus and showed that his algorithm outperforms that of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) using the definition of utterance given in Kameyama (1998).

Slanted Discourse (SSD) Methodology: The Motivation for the First Part In previous literature on local focusing (e.g., Sidner 1979; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1995; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), researchers used a small number of constructed texts to justify aspects of their focusing frameworks and to assess and compare focusing frameworks.
