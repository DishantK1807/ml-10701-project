When possible this tagset follows the MULTEXT (Ide and V6ronis 1994) morpho-syntactic description, modified within the GRACE action.

These results must be compared to (Chanod and Tapainen, 1995), who situate this number around 16, while about six words generate the same level of ambiguity in the medical corpus!

When the surface form is not found in the lexicon, it follows a two.step guessing process: the first level (oraclel) is a more complex morphological analyzer, based on the morphosemantemes, while the second level guesser (orcale2) attempts to provides a set of MS features looking at the longest ending (as described in Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995).

Although, the target of our work (Ruch and al., 1999, Bouillon and al., 2000) is a free-grained semantic disambiguation of medical texts for IR purposes, we believe that the POS disambiguation is an important preliminary step.

The first system is specialised for tagging medical texts (Ruch and al., 2000), while the second is a general parser (based on FIPS, cf.
