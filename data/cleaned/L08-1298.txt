For example, a Chinese metaphorical expression such as cheng2zhang3 ‘grow/growth’ (in jing1ji4 cheng2zhang3 ‘the economy grows’) has the following WordNet meanings (Fellbaum, 1998) in (1).

Figure 2: Measuring Conceptual Similarity between SUMO Nodes Since also we use a WordNet-SUMO interface provided by SinicaBow (Huang et al, 2004), we can measure concreteness of different WordNet senses based on their corresponding SUMO nodes. Before we can implement the formulas in (3) in SUMO, we need to provide a standard delimiting what i</context>

We also propose to extend this analysis of conceptual similarity to WordNet so as to compare whether or not mappings of WordNet and SUMO provided by interface such as SinicaBow (Huang et al. 2004) are reliable. If the mappings are consistent, the calculating of their conceptual similarity should also be similar. 5. Acknowledgements We would like to thank the Academia Sinica Fellowships for Do</context>
