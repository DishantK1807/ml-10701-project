Compared to previous results on fine-grained evaluation exercises (Edmonds and Kilgarriff, 2002; Snyder and Palmer, 2004), the systems??results are much higher.

This clustering was created automatically with the aid of a methodology described in (Navigli, 2006).

of 6.18. 2.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agreement when using the WordNet inventory report figures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation of the English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) and 67.3% on the Open Mind Word Expert annotation exercise (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).

Compared with WordNet (Miller et al., 1993)?? which has been used widely in QA?FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet are still relatively new, and therefore their usefulness for QA has still to be proven.

For instance, in the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) senses are grouped until a 90% inter-annotator agreement is achieved.

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Notice that our calculation of the MFS is based on the frequencies in the SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993), as we exploit WordNet sense rankings.

State-of-the-art systems attained a disambiguation accuracy around 65% in the Senseval-3 all-words task (Snyder and Palmer, 2004), where WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) was adopted as a reference sense inventory.

Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

In English, the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006) is combining sense tags with the Penn treebank.

of a Coarse-Grained Sense Inventory To tackle the granularity issue, we produced a coarser-grained version of the WordNet sense inventory3 based on the procedure described by Navigli (2006).

The texts come from the WallStreetJournalcorpus, andwerehand-annotated with OntoNotes senses (Hovy et al., 2006).
