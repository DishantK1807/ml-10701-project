MAGEAD System: Implementation We follow (Kiraz, 2000) in using a multitape representation.
J00-1006
Other autosegmental approaches (described in more details in Kiraz 2001 (Chapter 4)) include those of Kornai (1995), Bird and Ellison (1994), Pulman and Hepple (1993), whose formalism Kiraz adopts, and others.

Kataja and Koskenniemi (1988) present a system for handling Akkadian root-and-pattern morphology by adding an additional lexicon component to Koskenniemi’s two-level morphology (1983).
C88-1064
The first large scale implementation of Arabic morphology within the constraints of finite-state methods is that of Beesley et al.(1989) with a ‘detouring’ mechanism for access to multiple lexica, which gives rise to other works by Beesley (Beesley, 1998) and, independently, by Buckwalter (2004).
W98-1007
Kiraz (2000,2001) extends Kay’s 682 approach and implements a small working multitape system for MSA and Syriac.
J00-1006
Kay (1987) proposes a framework with which each of the autosegmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form.
E87-1002
Our implementation uses the multitape approach of Kiraz (2000).
