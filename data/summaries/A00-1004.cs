Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994).
P94-1012
A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).

For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence between certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994).

Brown et al.(1993) defined a series of probabilistic translation models for MT purposes.

They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel corpus.
P94-1012
Based on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown et al.(1993), the basic principle of our translation model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sentences, if two words often co-occur in the source and target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they are translations of each other.

For example, we can use such a translation model to help complete target text being drafted by a human translator (Langlais et al., 2000).
