At present, automatically acquired verb lexicons with SCF information have already proved accurate and useful enough for some NLP purposes (Korhonen, 2001; Han et al, 2004).

Since Brent (1993) a considerable amount of research focusing on large-scaled automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCF) has met with some success not only in English but also in many other languages, including German (Schulte im Walde, 2002), Spanish (Chrupala, 2003), Czech (Sarkar and Zeman, 2000), Portuguese (Gamallo et.
C00-2100 J93-2002
al, 2002), and Chinese (Han et al, 2004).

Large subcategorized verbal lexicons have proved to be crucially important for many tasks of natural language processing, such as probabilistic parsers (Korhonen, 2001, 2002) and verb classifications (Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen, 2003).

The data include 30 verbs, as shown in Table 1, and their unfiltered SCF hypotheses, which were automatically generated via Briscoe and Carrollâ€™s (1997) SCF acquisition system, and the manually established standard.
