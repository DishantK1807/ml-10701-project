4. CONCLUSION The PI approach to morphologically conditioned phonological and orthographic variation relates linguistically to word grammar (Hudson 1984), word syntax (Selkirk 1982) and to prosodic phonologies, and derives its computational features from DATR (Evans & Gazdar 1989); formally it relates closely to object-oriented morphology (Daelemans 1987), paradigmatic morphology (Calder 1989), and Bird's constraintbased phonology (1990).

These include two-level morphology with continuation lexica and two-level rules (Koskenniemi 1983), its derivates with feature-based lexicon and two-level rules (Karttunen 1987, Bear 1986, Trost 1990), and Cahill's DATR-driven morphology with phonological descriptions in MOLUSC (1990).

Other approaches rely on lists of stem variants, string permutations, or string position indices (Cahill 1990).

Evans & Gazdar 1989, 1990, 1989a, 1989b); DATR was chosen for its syntactic simplicity and its explicit formal semantics.

3.2. INTERCALATION IN ARABIC VERB MORPHOLOGY A number of linguistic descriptions and computational implementations have treated various aspects of Arabic verb conjugation (McCarthy 1982, Hudson 1984, Kay 1987, Calder 1989, Cahill 1990, Bird 1990, Gibbon 1990).

The only explicit computational treatment of association operations is by Kay (1987; but cf.
