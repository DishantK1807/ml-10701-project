This is a pipeline system mainly based on pattern matching implemented in local grammars and/or expert lexicons [Srihari et al 2003].

The shallow parser constructs Verb Groups (VGs) and basic Noun Phrases (NPs), also called BaseNPs [Church 1988].

Any natural language processing (NLP) system needs to address the issue of handling multiword expressions, including Phrasal Verbs (PV) [Sag et al.2002; Breidt et al.1996]. This paper presents a proven approach to identifying English PVs based on pattern matching using a formalism called Expert Lexicon.

The pattern matching time is therefore reduced dramatically compared to a sequential finite state device [Srihari et al.2003]. 5 The expert lexicon formalism is designed to enhance the lexicalization of our system, in accordance with the general trend of lexicalist approaches to NLP.
