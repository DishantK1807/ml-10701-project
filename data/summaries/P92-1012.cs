These classes have been discussed in \[Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987\], where the membership problem for the corresponding languages has been shown to be in P, for every fixed k and p.

The class of linear context-free rewriting systems (LCFRS) has been defined in \[Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987\] with the intention of capturing through a generalization common properties that are shared by all these formalisms.
P87-1015
From previous work (see \[Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987\]) we know that the recognition problem for LCFRS is in P when both dimensions are bounded.

The following definition is essentially the same as the one proposed in \[Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987\].
