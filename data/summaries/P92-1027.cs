We assume that our second level, which we leave for future research, will not be very different from the one in Hobbs & Shieber \[1987\] or Pereira &: Shieber \[1987\].

Moore \[1989\] predicts that a unification-based semantic interpretation for sentences which involve for example noun phrase coordination won't be possible without an explicit use of lambda expressions, though there are cases where some lambda expressions can be eliminated by directly assigning values to variables embedded in a logical-form expression.
P89-1005
Moore \[1989\] however has pointed out that coordination presents problems for firstorder unification-based semantic interpretation.
