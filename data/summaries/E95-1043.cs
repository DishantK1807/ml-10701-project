The original D-theory model (Marcus et al (1983)) is also more powerful, because it allows the right-most daughter of a node to be lowered under a sibling node.

This "core parser" has been the subject of a number of computational implementations, including Marcus's deterministic parser (1980), Description theory (henceforth, D-theory) (Marcus et al (1983)), and Abney's licensing based model (1987, 1989).

ZNote that in Marcus et al (1983), since precedence relations were not computed for non-terminals, lowering into a predecessor was possible, thus (11) would cause no processing difficulty.

Such models have also been explored computationally (Milward (1995), Crocker (1991)).
E95-1017
This model is interesting in that it does not allow the parser to employ delay tactics, such as using a lookahead buffer (Marcus (1980), Marcus et al (1983)), or waiting for the head of a phrase to appear in the input before constructing that phrase (Abney (1987, 1989), Pritehett (1992)).
