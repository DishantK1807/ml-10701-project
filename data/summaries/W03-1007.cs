G&J refers to the results of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).

The difference in the F-scores on the identification task alone and on the combined task are statistically significant at the (p<0.01) level 5 . The accuracy of the ME semantic classifier on the automatically identified frame elements is 81.5%, not a statistically significant difference from its performance on hand labeled elements, but a statistically significant difference from the classifier of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (p<0.01).
J02-3001
We compare the results of our classifier to that of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) on matched test sets of both human annotated and automatically identified frame elements.

In both phases Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) build a model of the conditional probabilities of the classification given a vector of syntactic features.

G&J represents results reported in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), ME results for the experiments reported here.

Results Table 5 compares the results of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and the ME frame element identifier on both the task of frame element identification alone, and the combined task of frame element identification and classification.

The first experiment uses only those feature combinations described in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (feature sets 0-7 from Table 1).

Role Classification Training (36,993 sentences / 75,548 frame elements), development (4,000 sentences / 8,167 frame elements), and held out test sets (3,865 sentences / 7,899 frame elements) were obtained in order to exactly match those used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) 1 . In the experiments presented below, features are extracted for each frame element in a sentence and used to classify that element into one of 120 semantic role categories.

Results Figure 2 shows the results of our experiments alongside those of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) on identical held out test sets.
J02-3001
We extend Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)â€™s initial effort in three ways.
J02-3001
Work To our knowledge, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) is the only work to use FrameNet to build a statistically based semantic classifier.

We use the YASMET MEtagger (Bender et al., 2003) to perform the Viterbi search.

Features For each frame element, features are extracted from the surface text of the sentence and from an automatically generated syntactic parse tree (Collins, 1997).

Entropy ME models implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constrains imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).
