Research on the automatic classification of movie or product reviews as positive or negative (e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Morinaga et al., 2002; Turney and Littman, 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Beineke et al., 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004)) is perhaps the most similar to our work.

We evaluated the subjectivity of each sentence using the automatic subjective sentence classifier from (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that 65.6% of Palestinian sentences and 66.2% of Israeli sentences are classified as subjective.

So far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (Wiebe et al., 2004; Riloff et al., 2003), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Pang et al., 2002; Morinaga et al., 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Wilson et al., 2005).
