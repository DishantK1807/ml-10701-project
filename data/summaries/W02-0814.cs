Recently (both SENSEVAL competitions), various machine learning (ML) approaches have been demonstrated to produce relatively successful WSD systems, e.g. memory-based learning (Ng and Lee, 1996; Veenstra et al., 2000), decision lists (Yarowsky, 2000), boosting (Escudero et al., 2000).

This is also shown by Stevenson and Wilks (2001), who used the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) as sense inventory.

So the creation of more annotated data is necesssary and will certainly cause major improvements of current WSD systems and NLP systems in general (see also (Banko and Brill, 2001)).

For the part of speech tagging, the memory-based tagger MBT (Daelemans et al., 1996), trained on the Wall Street Journal corpus2, was used.

See (Ide and VÂ´eronis, 1998) for an introduction to the area.

The method used to extract these keywords for each sense is based on the work of Ng and Lee (1996).

On the basis of word and POS information, lemmatization (van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999) was done.
