In practice, most commonly used algorithms solve the parsing problem for TAGs by computing a superset of a parse relation (defined as above) and by representing it in such a way that its instances can be tested in constant time; such a condition is satisfied by the methods reported in Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985), Schabes and Joshi (1988), Palis, Schende, and Wei (1990), Schabes (1991), Lavelli and Satta (1991), Lang (1992), and Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993).

2.2 Tree-Adjoining Grammars The definition of TAG and the associated notion of derivation are briefly introduced in the following; the reader is also referred to the standard literature (see, for instance, Vijay-Shanker and Joshi \[1985\] or Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir \[1991\]).
