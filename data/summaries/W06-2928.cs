The first stage identifies unlabeled directed dependencies using an extension of the parser described in (Corston-Oliver et al., 2006).
N06-1021
At both training and run time, edges are scored independently, and Eisner’s O(N3) decoder (Eisner, 1996) is used to find the optimal parse.
C96-1058
Additional features are created by combining these atomic features, as described in (McDonald et al., 2005).
P05-1012
Dependency Labeler 4.1 Classifier We used a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to assign labels to the unlabeled dependencies produced by the Bayes Point Machine.
J96-1002
As described in (Corston-Oliver et al., 2006), we reimplemented the parser described in (McDonald et al., 2005) and validated their results for Czech and English.
N06-1021 P05-1012
The system that we submitted for the CoNLL 2006 Shared Task, “Multingual Dependency Parsing,” (Buchholz et al., 2006) is a two stage pipeline.
