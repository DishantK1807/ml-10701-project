There is no direct connection between these different verbs in the ERG lexicon, even though they are intuitively related and are listed as belonging to the same or related word classes in semantic lexicons/ontologies such as VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

Our generic senses have been inspired by FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

increase [from $50] to $100) temporal topic 3 Semantic Parsing 3.1 Architecture and Classifier Following the architecture of earlier semantic parsers like Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), we treat the semantic parsing task as a 1-of-N classification problem.

It incorporates 168 SCF distinctions, a superset of those found in the COMLEX Syntax (Grishman et al., 1994) and ANLT (Boguraev et al., 1987) dictionaries.

Similarly, Chen and Rambow (2003) argue that the kind of deep linguistic features we harvest from FrameNet is beneficial for the successful assignment of PropBank roles to constituents, in this case using TAGs generated from PropBank to generate the relevant features.

Our syntax relies on a frame-based design in the LF ontology, a common representation in semantic lexicons (Baker et al., 1998, Kipper et al., 2000).

For example, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) found that identifying passives was important in training a semantic role classifier from FrameNet, using a parser trained on the Penn Treebank along with a set of templates to distinguish passive constructions from active ones.

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources ??FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) ??that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.

Syntactic lexicons have been derived from other resources ??the LinGO ERG lexicon (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000) contains entries extracted from ComLex (Grishman et al., 1994), and Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) acquire a CCG lexicon from the Penn Treebank.

In the original formulation for English in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), it answers the question: Is the NP governed by IP or VP?

"the international Olympic Conference held in Paris" Figure 1 Example of DE construction Since the governing category information is encoded in the path feature, it may be redundant; indeed this redundancy might explain why the governing category feature was used in Gildea & Jurafsky(2002) but not in Gildea and Palmer(2002).
