Representation For representing proper chunks, we employ IOB2 representation, one of those which have been studied well in various chunking tasks of natural language processing (Tjong Kim Sang, 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).

posed framework has advantages over an approach based on manually created rules such as the one in (Shudo et al., 2004), in that it requires human cost to manually create and maintain those rules.

In this paper, we use an SVMs-based chunking tool YamCha 8 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).

We employ the technique of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1998) as the machine learning technique, which has been successfully applied to various natural language processing tasks including chunking tasks such as phrase chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) and named entity chunking (Mayfield et al., 2003).
