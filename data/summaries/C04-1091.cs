(2) Even when the translation model Pr(f|e) is as simple as IBM Model 1 and the language model Pr(e) is a bigram language model, the decoding problem is NP-hard (Knight, 1999).

An optimal decoder based on the well-known A∗ heuristic was implemented and benchmarked in (Och et al., 2001).
W01-1408
An Oparenleftbigm6parenrightbig greedy search algorithm was developed (Germann et al., 2003) whose complexity was reduced further to Oparenleftbigm2parenrightbig (Germann, 2003).

Decoding is known to belong to a class of computational problems popularly known as NPhard problems (Knight, 1999).
J99-4005
In each iteration of local search, we look in the neighborhood of the current best alignment for a better alignment (Brown et al., 1993).

Since the Fundamental Equation of SMT does not yield an easy handle to design a solution (exact or even an approximate one) for the problem, most researchers have instead worked on solving the following relatively simpler problem (Germann et al., 2003): (ˆe,ˆa) = argmax(e,a) Pr(f,a|e)Pr(e).

This idea was further explored by Wang and Waibel (Wang and Waibel, 1997) who developed a faster stack-based search algorithm.
P97-1047
The decoding problem in SMT is one of finding the most probable translation ˆe in the target language of a given source language sentence f in accordance with the Fundamental Equation of SMT (Brown et al., 1993): ˆe = argmaxe Pr(f|e)Pr(e).
J93-2003
Decoding is one of the three fundamental problems in classical SMT (translation model and language model being the other two) as proposed by IBM in the early 1990’s (Brown et al., 1993).
