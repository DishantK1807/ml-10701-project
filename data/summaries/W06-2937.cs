Description 241 Over the past decades, many state-of-the-art parsing algorithm were proposed, such as head-word lexicalized PCFG (Collins, 1998), Maximum Entropy (Charniak, 2000), Maximum/Minimum spanning tree (MST) (McDonald et al., 2005), Bottom-up deterministic parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003), and Constant-time deterministic parsing (Nivre, 2003).

To go language-independent, we did not tune any parameter settings in our model and exclude most of the language-dependent feature set, which provided by the CoNLL (Buchholz et al., 2006).
