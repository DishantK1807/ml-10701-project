Schabes and Shieber (1994) characterise this as a function 7) from derivation trees to derived trees.

However, there is a regular form for TAGs (Rogers, 1994), such that the trees of TAGs in this regular form are local sets; that is, they are context free.

3 S-TAG and Paraphrase Syntactic paraphrase can also be described with S-TAG (Dras, 1997; Dras, forthcoming).
P97-1070
Once a grammar has been used to express structural relationships, in many applications there are operations which act at a 'meta level' on the structures expressed by the grammar: for example, lifting rules on a dependency grammar to achieve pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al, 1998), and mapping between synchronised Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber 1994) as in machine translation or syntax-to-semantics transfer.

2 S-TAG and Machine Translation Synchronous TAG, the mapping between two Tree Adjoining Grammars, was first proposed by Shieber and Schabes (1990).
C90-3045
The original definition of S-TAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), however, had a greater generative capacity than that of its component TAG grammars: even though each component grammar could only generate Tree Adjoining Languages (TALs), an S-TAG pairing two TAG grammars could generate non-TALs.
