Conceptual relations can be used to define measures of semantic distance (Sussna, 1993; Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Resnik, 1995), but topic relatedness is not well captured by wordnet relations, and this is a fundamental parameter to estimate sense similarity in many NLP applications (Gonzalo et al., 2000).

The issue of estimating semantic distance between senses of a polysemous word has been previously addressed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).

These matrices (especially the non-diagonal proximity values) can be used to re-score Senseval-2 systems applying the measures proposed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).

We have considered three types of semantic relation, previously introduced in (Gonzalo et al., 2000): a0 metonymy (semantic contiguity), for example, yew-tree and yew-wood or post-letters and postsystem.
W00-0802
As for metonymy, the distribution of proximity indexes indicates that this kind of relation seems to include different subpatterns (Gonzalo et al., 2000).
