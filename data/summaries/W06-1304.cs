In contrast to all the approaches mentioned above, our language generator uses overgeneration and ranking techniques (Langkilde, 2000; Varges and Mellish, 2001).
N01-1001
We follow the bottom-up generation approach for production systems described in (Varges, 2005) and perform mild overgeneration of candidate moves, followed by ranking.
W05-1626
One could handle much larger numbers of generation candidates either by using packing (Langkilde, 2000) or by interleaving rule-based generation with corpus-based pruning (Varges and Mellish, 2001) if complexity should become an issue when doing overgeneration.
N01-1001
Parse trees and topic labels are matched by the ‘dialogue move scripts’ of the dialogue manager (Mirkovic and Cavedon, 2005; Weng et al., 2005).
H05-2013
(Hardy et al., 2004) describe a dialogue system that uses an error-correcting database manager for matching caller-provided information to database entries.
P04-1010
This is in contrast to generation systems such as the ones described in (Langkilde, 2000) and (Varges and Mellish, 2001).
