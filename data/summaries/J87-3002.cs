In this paper we focus on the exploitation of the LDOCE grammar coding system; Alshawi et al.(1985) and Alshawi (1987) describe further research in Cambridge utilising different types of information available in LDOCE.

As Alshawi (1987) points out, given that no situations were envisaged where the information from the tape would be altered once installed in secondary storage, this simple and convenComputational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 205 Bran Boguraev and Ted Briscoe Large Lexicons for Natural Language Processing tional access strategy is perfectly adequate.

More recently, a dictionary server, of the kind described by Kay (1984b), was implemented and installed as a background process on a Xerox workstation networked together with the rest of the equipment dedicated to natural language processing applications (Boguraev et al., 1987).

No attempt has been made to map any closed class entries from LDOCE, as a 3,000 word lexicon containing most closed class items has been developed independently by one of the groups collaborating with us to develop the general purpose morphological and syntactic analyser (see the Introduction and Russell et al., 1986).

However, each of these fields requires further decoding and restructuring to provide client programs with easy access to the information they require (see Calzolari (1984) for further discussion).

To demonstrate that this is possible we have implemented a system which constructs dictionary entries for the PATR-II system (Shieber, 1984 and references therein).

The research described below is taking place in the context of three collaborative projects (Boguraev, 1987; Russell et al., 1986; Phillips and Thompson, 1986) to develop a general-purpose, wide coverage morphological and syntactic analyser for English.

Recent developments in linguistics, and especially on grammatical theory -for example, Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al., 1985), Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) -and on natural language parsing frameworks for example, Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) (Kay, 1984a), PATR-II (Shieber, 1984) -make it feasible to consider the implementation of efficient systems for the syntactic analysis of substantial fragments of natural language.

In addition, a fully flexible access system allows the retrieval of dictionary entries on the basis of constraints specifying any combination of phonetic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic information (Boguraev et al., 1987).
