We use the majority choice in case of disagreements (Tanaka et al., 2006).

Parse ranking is discussed in Fujita et al.(2007). 2 The Hinoki Corpus The Hinoki corpus consists of the Lexeed Semantic Database of Japanese (Kasahara et al., 2004) and corpora annotated with syntactic and semantic infor477 mation.

The current parse ranking model has an accuracy of 70%: the correct tree is ranked first 70% of the time (for Lexeed definition sentences) (Fujita et al., 2007).
W07-1204
Domain information is a simple and sometimes strong cue for disambiguating the target words (Gliozzo et al., 2005).

The grammar is an HPSG implementation (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002), which provides a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations.
W02-1210
The actual annotation process uses the same tools as the Redwoods treebank of English (Oepen et al., 2002).
C02-2025
In parsing, for example, symbolic grammars are being combined with stochastic models (Riezler et al., 2002; Oepen et al., 2002; Malouf and van Noord, 2004).

About 6,000 words are automatically classified into one of 12 domain categories by distributions in web sites (Hashimoto and Kurohashi, 2007) and 10% of them are manually checked.

McCarthy and Carroll (2003) have shown the effectiveness of the selectional preference information for WSD.

Klein and Manning (2003) show that much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words.
