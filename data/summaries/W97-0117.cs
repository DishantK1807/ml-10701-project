Some alternative possibilities of taking advantage of linguistic information in speech recognition are described by e.g., Kupiec (1992), Murveit and Moore (1990), Maltese and Mancini (1992), and Schwartz et al.(1994). The post-correction approach has been considered by Ringger and Allen (1996), for a different domain (trains scheduling dialog), and using a probabilistie modeling technique rather than correction rules.

Overall, the C-Box approach is partly related to error-driven learning techniques as used for partof-speech tagging (Bfill, 1992, 1995), and spelling correction (e.g., Golding & Schabes, 1996).

Other work with NLP-motivated re-ranking of N-best alternative transcription include Rayner et al.(1994), Ostendorf et al.(1991), Norton et al.(1992), among others, and see also (Hirsehman, 1994) and (Moore, 1994) for summary overview.

At this time, we made no attempt to address any of the problems related to spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies and self-repairs (e.g., Oviatt, 1994; Heeman & Allen, 1994).
