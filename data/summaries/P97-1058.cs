with previous work Rimon and Herz (1991; 1991) approximate the recognition capacity of a context-free grammar by extracting 'local syntactic constraints' in the form of the Left or Right Short Context of length n of a terminal.

Techniques such as restriction (Shieber, 1985) can be used to construct context-free approximations of many unification-based formalisms, so techniques for constructing finite-state approximations of context-free grammars can then be applied to these formalisms too.

It is essentially different from the algorithm introduced by Pereira and Wright (1991; 1996), is faster in some cases, and has the advantage of being open-ended and adaptable.
P91-1032
Finite-state calculus has been successfully applied both to morphology (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996) and to syntax (constraint grammar, finite-state syntax).
C96-2105 J94-3001
Both Pereira and Wright (1991; 1996) and Rood (1996) start with the LR(0) characteristic machine, which they first 'unfold' (with respect to 'stacks' or 'paths', respectively) and then 'flatten'.
