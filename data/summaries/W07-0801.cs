In Section 2, before we focus on the principles of ElixirFM, we briefly follow the characterization of morphological theories presented by Stump (2001) and extend the classification to the most prominent computational models of Arabic morphology (Beesley, 2001; Buckwalter, 2002; Habash et al., 2005; El Dada and Ranta, 2006).

The computational models in (Soudi et al., 2001) and (Habash et al., 2005) attempt the inferential?? realizational direction.

(Habash et al., 2005), and our model will encourage this.
