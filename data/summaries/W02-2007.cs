11. Conclusion This paper has presented and evaluated an extended bootstrapping model based on Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) that uses a unified framework of both entity internal and contextual evidence.

The core model utilized, extended and evaluated here is based on Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999).

Because the core model has been presented in detail in Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999), this paper focuses primarily on the modifications of the algorithm and its adaptation to the current task.

We use this property in conjunction with the one sense per discourse tendency noted by Gale et al.(1992). The later paradigm is not directly usable when analyzing a large corpus in which there are no document boundaries, like the one provided for Spanish.

We used the provided POS annotation in Dutch (Daelemans et al., 1996) and a minimally supervised tagger (Yarowsky and Cucerzan, 2002) for Spanish to restrict the space of words accepted by the discriminators (e.g.

The bootstrapping stage (5) uses the initial or current entity assignments to estimate the class conditional distributions for both entities and contexts along their trie paths, and then re-estimates the distributions of the contexts/entity-candidates to which they are linked, recursively, until all accessible nodes are reached, as presented in Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999).

This is viewed as an alternative to the classical topic segmentation approach and can be used in conjunction with a language-independent segmentation system (Figure 3) like the one presented by Richmond et al.(1997). After estimating the class probability distributions for all instances of entity candidates in the corpus, a re-estimation step is employed.
