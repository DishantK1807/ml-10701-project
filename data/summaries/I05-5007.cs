(Wu and Zhou, 2003) just extract the synonymy collocation, such as <turn on, OBJ, light> and <switch on, OBJ, light> using both monolingual corpora and bilingual corpora to get an optimal result, but do not generalize them.

There are many previous work on paraphrase examples extraction or combining them with some applications such as information retrieval and question answering (Agichtein et al., 2001; Florence et al., 2003; Rinaldi et al., 2003; Tomuro, 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001;), information extraction (Shinyama et al., 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), machine translation (Hiroshi et al., 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), multi-document (Barzilay et al., 2003).

The first method is using the Part-of-Speech (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Daum√© and Marcu, 2003; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2003), the second uses name entity as the variable (Shinyama et al., 2002; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003), the third method is similar to the second method which is called the inference rules extraction (Lin and Pantel, 2001).

Generation of paraphrase examples was also investigated (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).

Paraphrases are alternative ways to convey the same information (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) and they have been applied in many fields of natural language processing.
