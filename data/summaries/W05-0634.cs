As described in Pradhan et al.(2004), we post-process lattices of n-best decision using a trigram language model of argument sequences.

They are a combination of features introduced by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), ones proposed in Pradhan et al.(2004), Surdeanu et al.(2003) and the syntactic-frame feature proposed in (Xue and Palmer, 2004).

The task reported on here is to produce PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) labels, given the features provided for the CoNLL-2005 closed task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).
W05-0620
These are the same set of features that were used in the CoNLL-2004 semantic role labeling task by Hacioglu, et al.(2004) with the addition of the two semantic argument (IOB) features.

NULL). This is referred to as an IOB representation (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
TinySVM1 along with YamCha2 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) are used to implement the system.
N01-1025 W00-0730
In Pradhan et al.(2005), we reported on a first attempt to overcome this problem by combining semantic role labels produced from different syntactic parses.
P05-1072
Some of these systems use features based on syntactic constituents produced by a Charniak parser (Pradhan et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2004) and others use only a flat syntactic representation produced by a syntactic chunker (Hacioglu et al., 2003; Hacioglu and Ward, 2003; Hacioglu, 2004; Hacioglu et al., 2004).
