A sensible strategy (Brown et al., 1995; Wang and Waibel, 1997) is to examine a large subset of likely decodings and choose just from that.

If the source and target languages are constrained to have the same word order (by choice or through suitable pre-processing), then the linear Viterbi algorithm can be applied (Tillmann et al., 1997).
P97-1037
Brown et al.(1993) introduced a series of TMs based on word-for-word substitution and reordering, but did not include a decoding algorithm.
J93-2003
As Wang and Waibel (1997) remark, it is hard to know whether a search error has occurred—the only way to show that a decoding is sub-optimal is to actually produce a higherscoring one.
P97-1047
Partly because of the absence of left-to-right correspondence, MT heuristics are significantly more difficult to develop (Wang and Waibel, 1997).
P97-1047
For arbitrary word-reordering, the decoding problem is NP-complete (Knight, 1999).
J99-4005
Programming Decoding Knight (1999) likens MT decoding to finding optimal tours in the Traveling Salesman Problem (Garey and Johnson, 1979)—choosing a good word order for decoder output is similar to choosing a good TSP tour.

If re-ordering is limited to rotations around nodes in a binary tree, then optimal decoding can be carried out by a high-polynomial algorithm (Wu, 1996).
