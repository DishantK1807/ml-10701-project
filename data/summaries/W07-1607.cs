In brief, the abstracts of 16,609 articles curated by FlyBase were retrieved and tokenized by RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006).

The system tokenizes, tags, lemmatizes and parses input sentences using the recent (second) release of the RASP (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing) system (Briscoe et al., 2006) which parses arbitrary English text with state-of-the-art levels of accuracy.

Its main components are the Conditional Random Fields toolkit MALLET2 (McCallum, 2002) and the RASP syntactic parsing toolkit3 (Briscoe et al., 2006), which are both publicly available.

(Charniak, 2000; Briscoe et al., 2006), have wide coverage and yield grammatical representations capable of supporting various applications (e.g.

Chodorow and Leacock (2000) try to identify errors on the basis of context, as we do here, and more speci cally a 2 word window around the word of interest, from which they consider function words and POS tags.

According to (Briscoe and Carroll, 2006), the parser achieves fairly good accuracy around 80%.

Both corpora were lemmatised, tagged and parsed with RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006).

The evaluation in this paper was based solely on CCGbank, but we have shown in Clark and Curran (2007) that the CCG parser gives state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the RASP parser (Briscoe et al., 2006) by over 5% on DepBank.

To compare with, we used RASP 2 (Briscoe et al., 2006), a domain-independent robust parsing system for English.
