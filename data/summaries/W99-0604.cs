For our model, the probability of alignment aj for position j depends on the previous alignment position aj-1 (Vogel et al., 1996).

20 2 Single-Word Based Approach 2.1 Basic Approach In this section, we shortly review a translation approach based on the so-called monotonicity requirement (Tillmann et al., 1997).
P97-1037
We determine correlated bilingual classes by using the method described in (Och, 1999).
E99-1010
In section 2, we shortly review the single-word based approach described in (Tillmann et al., 1997) with some recently iraplemented extensions allowing for one-to-many alignments.
P97-1037
The described method is an improvement of (Och and Weber, 1998), resulting in an improved training and a faster search organization.
P98-2162
Many statistical translation models (Vogel et al., 1996; Tillmann et al., 1997; Niessen et al., 1998; Brown et al., 1993) try to model word-toword correspondences between source and target words.
C96-2141 J93-2003 P97-1037
The classes used in F and E are automatically trained bilingual classes using the method described in (Och, 1999) and constitute a partition of the vocabulary of source and target language.
E99-1010
This alignment representation is a generalization of the baseline alignments described in (Brown et al., 1993) and allows for many-to-many alignments.
J93-2003
Similar aims are pursued by (Alshawi et al., 1998; Wang and Waibel, 1998) but differently approached.
P98-1006 P98-2221
We train two HMM alignment models (Vogel et al., 1996) for the two translation directions f ~ e and e ~ f by applying the EM-algorithm.
