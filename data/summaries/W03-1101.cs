NeATS computes the likelihood ratio λ (Dunning, 1993) to identify key concepts in unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, and clusters these concepts in order to identify major subtopics within the main topic.

Co-Occurrence Metric In a recent study (Lin and Hovy, 2003a), we showed that the recall-based unigram cooccurrence automatic scoring metric correlates highly with human evaluation and has high recall and precision in predicting the statistical significance of results comparing with its human counterpart.

Other systems based on information extraction (McKeown et al., 2002; Radev and McKeown, 1998; White et al., 2001) and discourse analysis (Marcu, 1999; Strzalkowski et al., 1999) also exist but they are not yet usable for general-domain summarization.

– a Multi-Document Summarization System NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) is an extractionbased multi-document summarization system.

We provided more in-depth discussion of this issue in other papers (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Lin and Hovy 2003b).

These n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (Lin and Hovy 2000).

For example, Jing (2000) trained her system on a set of 500 sentences from the Benton Foundation (http://www.benton.org) and their reduced forms written by humans.
