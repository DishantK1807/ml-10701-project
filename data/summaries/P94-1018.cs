4In the case of Hepple's (1991) proposal, a leftbranching normal form is indeed computed.
P91-1011
There are many problems with the completeness and soundness Pareschi and Steedman's proposal (Hepple 1987; Niv 1993a).

(See Pareschi and Steedman 1987).
P87-1012
128 Pareschi and Steedman (1987) propose the following strategy: (which can be taken out of the chart-parsing context of their paper) construct only maximally left-branching derivations, but allow a limited form of backtracking when a locally non-left-branching derivation turns out to have been necessary.
P87-1012
Approaches Following up on the work of Lambek (1958) who proposed that the process of deriving the grammaticality of a string of categories be viewed as a proof, there have been quite a few proposals put forth for computing only normal forms of derivations or proofs (KSnig 1989; Hepple and Morrill 1989; Hepple 1991; inter alia).
