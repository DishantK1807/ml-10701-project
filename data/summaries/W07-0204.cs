Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) introduced TextRank for keyword and sentence extractions.

Mihalcea, Tarau and Figa (2004) later applied PageRank to word sense disambiguation.

Otterbacher et al.(2005) gives an equation for topicsensitive and weighted PageRank as: ∑ ∑∑ ∈ ∈∈ −+= )( )( )()1( ),( ),( )( uInv vOutx vx vu Sy vPR w w Qysim Qusim uPR αα (3) 29 where S is the set of all nodes in the graph, and sim(u, Q) is the similarity score between node u and the query Q.

Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) independently proposed another similar graph-based random walk model, TextRank.
