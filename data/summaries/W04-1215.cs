Efforts have been made (Hou and Chen, 2002, 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2003) to improve the performance.

Several works employing SVM classifier have been done (Kazama et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Takeuchi and Collier, 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003), and will be discussed further in the rest of this paper.

Previous approaches on biological named entity extraction can be classified into two types – rule based (Fukuda et al., 1998; Olsson et al., 2002; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) and corpus-based (Collier et al., 2000; Chang et al., 2004).

For contextual information extraction at word level (Hou and Chen, 2003), collocates along with 4 statistics including frequency, the average and standard error of distance between word and entity and t-test score, were extracted.

Yapex (Olsson et al., 2002) implemented some heuristic steps described by Fukuda, et al., and applied filters and knowledge bases to remove false alarms.
C02-1110
Kazama et al.(2002) addressed the data imbalance problem and sped up the training process by splitting the type ‘O’ instances into subclasses using part-of-speech information.
W02-0301
Hou and Chen (2003) showed that protein/gene collocates are capable of assisting existing protein/gene taggers.
