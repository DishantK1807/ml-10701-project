A small number of data sets for evaluating the performance of biomedical language processing (BLP) systems on a small number of task types have been made publicly available by their creators (Blaschke et al.19991, Craven and Kumlein 19992, Pustejovsky et al.20023, Franz´en et al.20024, Collier et al.19995, Tanabe et al.20056). From a biological perspective, a number of these corpora (PDG, GENIA, Medstract, Yapex, GENETAG) are exceptionally well curated.
