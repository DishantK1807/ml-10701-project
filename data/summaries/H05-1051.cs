At Senseval-3 (Mihalcea et al., 2004) the top systems were considered to have reached a ceiling, in terms of performance, at 72% for finegrained disambiguation and 80% for coarsegrained.

Gonzalo et al.(1998) cite this failure to model related senses in order to explain why their study into the effects of ambiguity showed radically different results to Sanderson (1994).

A final point of discussion is the way in which we simulate disambiguation both in this study and those previously (Sanderson, 1994; Gonzalo et al., 1998).

To date only Nakov and Hearst (2003) have looked into creating more plausible pseudowords.

There is growing evidence (Leacock et al., 1998; Agirre and Martinez, 2004) to suggest that simulating uniform rates of accuracy and error across both words and senses may not reflect the performance of modern disambiguation systems.
