Until recently, there has been only limited effort on modeling intonation for CTS (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988; Young and Fallside, 1979; Prevost, 1995).

Through content planning, sentence planning and lexical selection,,the NLG component is able to provide a concise, yet informative, briefing automatically through spoken and written language coordinated with graphics (McKeown et al., 1997). Integrating language generation with speech synthesis within a Concept-to-Speech (CTS) system not only brings the individual benefits of each; as an integrated system, CTS can take advantage of the availability of rich structural information constructed by the underlying NLG component to improve the quality of synthesized speech.

Then, after all words have been assigned an initial value, the final rules learned in Experiment 3 are applied and the refined results are used to generate an abstract intonation description represented in the Speech Integrating Markup Language(SIML) format (Pan and McKeown, 1997).

For example, in (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), a set of hand-crafted rules are used to determine discourse neutral prosodic phrasing, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%.
