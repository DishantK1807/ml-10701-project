In a companion paper (Talbot and Osborne, 2007) we have proposed a framework for deriving conventional smoothed n-gram models from the logfrequency BF scheme allowing us to do away entirely with the standard n-gram model in an SMT system.

In this paper, we show that a Bloom filter can be used effectively for language modelling within an SMT decoder and present the log-frequency Bloom filter, an extension of the standard Boolean BF that 1For extensions of the framework presented here to standalone smoothed Bloom filter language models, we refer the reader to a companion paper (Talbot and Osborne, 2007).

Decoding is carried-out using the Moses decoder (Koehn and Hoang, 2007).
