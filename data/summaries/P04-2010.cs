The final system outperformed that of (Soon et al., 2001), with F-scores of 69.1 and 63.4 for MUC-6 and MUC-7, respectively.

(Soon et al., 2001) use the C4.5 algorithm with a set of 12 domain-independent features, ten syntactic and two semantic.
J01-4004
As (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), (Soon et al., 2001) do not report separate results for pronouns.
J01-4004
Unlike the other systems presented in this section, (Morton, 2000) does not use a decision tree algorithm but opts instead for a maximum entropy model.

However, (Morton, 2000) only attempts to resolve singular pronouns, and there is no mention of what percentage of total pronouns are covered by this restriction.

Phrase Chunking, NER and POS-Tagging To identify markables automatically, the system uses the noun phrase chunker described in (Schmid and Schulte im Walde, 2000), which displays case information along with the chunks.

Before evaluating the actual system, we compared the performance of boosting to that of C4.5, as reported in (Strube et al., 2002).

The classification results of the gold standard data, which are much lower than the ones in Table 2 also PPER PPOS (Strube et al., 2002) 82.8 84.9 our system 87.4 86.9 Table 2: Comparison of classification performance (Fa0a2a1a4a3 ) with (Strube et al., 2002) demonstrate the importance of the semantic features.

Although boosting has not yet been applied to coreference resolution, it has outperformed stateof-the-art systems for NLP tasks such as partofspeech tagging and prepositional phrase attachment (Abney et al., 1999), word sense disambiguation (Escudero et al., 2000), and named entity recognition (Carreras et al., 2002).
W02-2004 W99-0606
Although, to our knowledge, there currently does not exist an off-the-shelf named entity recogniser for German, we were able to obtain the system submitted by (Curran and Clark, 2003) to the 2003 CoNLL competition.
W03-0424
(Ng and Cardie, 2002) expanded on the work of (Soon et al., 2001) by adding 41 lexical, semantic and grammatical features.
J01-4004 P02-1014
The experiment presented in (Strube et al., 2002) is one of the few dealing with the application of machine learning to German coreference resolution covering definite noun phrases, proper names and personal, possessive and demonstrative pronouns.
W02-1040
(Strube et al., 2002) used 15 features modeled after those used by state-of-the-art resolution systems for English.
W02-1040
Due to lack of resources, the semantic class attribute cannot be annotated automatically, and is therefore used only for comparison with (Strube et al., 2002).
