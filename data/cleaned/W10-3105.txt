1 Introduction
In information extraction, it is of key impor-
tance to distinguishbetween facts and uncertain
or negated information.In otherwords, IE appli-
cationshavetotreatsentences/ clausescontaining

2010 SharedTask was also to develop hedge de-
tectionsystems(Farkasetal.,2010).Forthetrain-

There exist some corpora that contain annota-
tion for speculation and/or negation. The GE-
NIA Event corpus (Kim et al., 2008) annotates
biologicalevents with negation and two types of
uncertainty. In the BioInfer corpus (Pyysalo et
al., 2007) biological relations are annotated for
negation. The systemdevelopedby Medlockand
Briscoe (2007) made use of a corpus consisting
of six papers from genomicsliterature in which
sentences were annotated for speculation. Set-
tles et al. (2008)constructeda corpuswheresen-
tences are classifiedas either speculative or defi-
nite,however, nokeywordsaremarked in thecor-
pus and Shatkayet al. (2008)describea database

otherfeatures. As a corpusspecificallyannotated
for weasel words, WikiWeasel should be men-
tioned, which was constructed for the CoNLL-
2010 Shared Task (Farkas et al., 2010) and con-
tains Wikipediaparagraphsannotatedfor weasel
words.
3 TheBioScopecorpus
The BioScopecorpus(Vinczeet al., 2008)is – to
our best knowledge– the largest corpusavailable
thatis annotatedforbothnegationandhedgekey-
words and the only one that containsannotation
for linguistic scopes. It includes three types of
textsfromthebiomedicaldomain–namely, radio-
logicalreports,biologicalfullpapersandabstracts
from the GENIA corpus. (15 new full biomedi-
calpaperswereannotatedforhedgecuesandtheir
scopes, which served as the evaluation database
of the CoNLL-2010Shared Task (Farkas et al.,
2010),andthisdatasetwillbe addedto BioScope
inthenearfuture.)Theannotationwascarriedout
by two studentsof linguisticssupervisedby a lin-
guist. Problematiccases were continuouslydis-
cussedamongtheannotatorsanddissimilaranno-
tationswerelaterresolvedbythelinguist.
3.1 Annotationprinciples
InBioScope,speculationisunderstoodasthepos-
sible existenceof a thing is claimed– neitherits
existencenor its non-existenceis known for sure.
Only one level of uncertainty is marked (as op-
posedto the GENIAcorpus(Kimet al., 2008)or
Shatkay et al. (2008)) and no weasels are anno-
tated. Negationis seenas the implicationof non-
existenceof something.
The annotationwas basedon four basicprinci-
ples:
28
• Eachkeywordhasa scope.
• Thescopemustincludeitskeyword.
• Min-maxstrategy:
– The minimal unit expressing
hedge/negationis markedas keyword.
– The scope is extended to the maximal
syntacticunit.
• Nointersectingscopesareallowed.
These principles were determinedat the very
beginningoftheannotationprocessandthey were
strictlyfollowedthroughoutthecorpusbuilding.
3.2 Problematiccases
However, in somecases,somelanguagephenom-
ena seemed to contradict the above principles.
Theseissuesrequireda thoroughconsiderationof
thepossiblesolutionsinaccordancewiththebasic
principlesin order to keep the annotationof the
corpusasconsistentaspossible.Themostnotable
examplesincludethefollowing:
• Negative keywordswithoutscope:
[Negative] chestradiograph.
In thiscase,the scopecontainsonlythe key-
word.
• Ellipticsentences
Moreover, ANG II stimulatedNF-
kappaBactivationinhumanmono-
cytes, but [not] in lymphocytes
fromthesamepreparation.
Withthepresentencodingschemeof scopes,
there is no way to signal that the negation
shouldbeextendedtotheverbandtheobject
as well.
• Nestedscopes
Onescopeincludesanotherone:
These observations (suggest that
TNFandPMAdo (notleadto NF-
kappa B activation throughinduc-
tion of changes in the cell redox
status)).
The semantic interpretationof such nested
scopes should be understoodas ”it is possi-
blethatthereis nosuchaneventthat...”.
• Elements in between keyword and target
word
Although however is not affected by the
hedgecue in the followingexample,it is in-
cluded in the scope since consecutive text
spansareannotatedas scopes:
(Atelectasisin the right mid zone
is, however,<possible>).
• Complex keywords
Sometimesa hedge / negation is expressed
via a phraseratherthan a singleword: these
aremarkedas complex keywords.
• Inclusionof modifiersandadjuncts
It is oftenhard to decidewhethera modifier
or adjunctbelongsto the scopeor not. In or-
dernottolosepotentiallyimportantinforma-
tion, the widestscope possibleis marked in
eachcase.
• Intersectingscopes
When two keywords occur within one sen-
tence, their scopes might intersect, yielding
oneapparentlyemptyscope(i.e. scopewith-
outkeyword)andascopewithtwokeywords:
(Repressiondid ([not]<seem> to
involve anotherfactorwhoseactiv-
ityis affectedbytheNSAIDs)).
In suchcases,one of the scopes(usuallythe
negative one)was extended:
((Repressiondid [not]<seem> to
involve anotherfactorwhoseactiv-
ityis affectedbytheNSAIDs)).
Ontheotherhand,thereweresomecaseswhere
thedifficultyofannotationcouldbetracedbackto
lexical issues. Some of the keyword candidates
have severalsenses(e.g. if) or canbe usedin dif-
ferentgrammaticalstructures(e.g. indicatevs. in-
dicatethat) and not all of them are to be marked
as a keyword in the corpus. Thus,senses/ usages
to be annotatedand thosenot to be annotatedhad
to bedeterminedprecisely.
Finally, sometimesan apparentlynegative key-
word formed part of a complex hedge keyword
(e.g. cannot be excluded), which refers to the
fact that speculationcan be expressed also by a
negated word, thus, the presence of a negative
word does not automaticallyentail that the sen-
tenceis negated.

4 Outlook:Comparisonwithother
corpora
BesidesBioScope,theGENIAEventcorpus(Kim
et al., 2008)alsocontainsannotationfor negation
andspeculation.Inordertoseewhatthemaindif-
ferencesare betweenthe corpora, the annotation
principleswerecontrasted:
• in GENIAEvent, no modifierkeywords are
marked,however, in BioScope,they are;
• the scope of speculationand negation is ex-
plicitly marked in BioScope and it can be
extended to various constituentswithin the
clause/ sentencethoughin GENIAEvent, it
is theeventitselfthatis withinthescope;
• twosubtypesofuncertaintyaredistinguished
in GENIA Event: doubtful and probable,
however, in BioScopethere is one umbrella
termforthem(speculation).
An essentialdifferencein annotationprinciples
betweenthetwo corporaisthatGENIAEventfol-
lows the principles of event-centeredannotation
while BioScope annotationdoes not put special
emphasis on events. Event-centeredannotation
means that annotatorsare requiredto identifyas
many events as possiblewithinthe sentencethen
labeleachseparatelyfornegation/ speculation.
The multiplicityof events in GENIA and the
maximumscope principleexploitedin BioScope
(see3.1)takentogetheroftenyieldsthata GENIA
event falls within the scope of a BioScopekey-
word, however, it shouldnot be seen as a specu-
latedornegatedeventonitsown. Hereweprovide
anillustrative example:
In summary, our data suggest that
changes in the composition of tran-
scriptionfactor AP-1 is a key molecu-
lar mechanismfor increasingIL-2tran-
scription and may underlie the phe-
nomenonof costimulationbyEC.
Accordingto the BioScopeanalysisof the sen-
tence, the scope of suggest extendsto the end of
the sentence. It entails that in GENIAit is only
the events is a key molecularmechanismand un-
derliethe phenomenonthat are marked as proba-
ble, nevertheless,the events changes, increasing,
transcriptionand costimulationare also included
in the BioScopespeculative scope. Thus, within
this sentence, there are six GENIAevents out of
which two are labeled as probable, however, in
BioScope,allsixarewithina speculative scope.
In somecases,thereis a differencein between
what is seen as speculative / negated in the cor-
pora. For instance,negated ”investigation”verbs
in Present Perfect are seen as doubtfulevents in
GENIAandas negative eventsin BioScope:
However, a role for NF-kappaBin hu-
manCD34(+)bonemarrowcellshasnot
beendescribed.
Accordingto GENIAannotationprinciples,the
role has not been described,thereforeit is doubt-
fulwhattheroleexactlyis. However,inBioScope,
the interpretationof the sentenceis that therehas
notbeensuchaneventthattheroleforNF-kappaB
inhumanCD34(+)bonemarrowcellshasbeende-
scribed.Thus,it is markedas negative.
Another difference between the annotation
schemesofBioScopeandGENIAisthatinstances
of weaselingare annotatedas probableevents in
GENIA,however, in BioScopethey are not. An
examplefora weaselsentenceis shownbelow:
Receptors for leukocyte chemoattrac-
tants, including chemokines,are tradi-
tionallyconsideredtoberesponsiblefor
theactivationof specialleukocytefunc-
tionssuchaschemotaxis,degranulation,
andthereleaseof superoxideanions.
5 Conclusions
Some interestingconclusionscan be drawn from
thedifficultiesencounteredduringannotationpro-
cess of the BioScope corpus. As for method-
ology, it is unquestionablethat preciselydefined
rules(onscopemarking,keywordmarkingandon
theinterpretationofspeculation/ negation)arees-
sentialforconsistentannotation,thus,pre-defined
guidelinescan help annotationwork a lot. How-
ever, difficulties or ambiguities not seen previ-
ously may emerge (and they really do) only dur-
ing the processof annotation. In this way, a con-
tinuousreformulationandextensionof annotation
rulesis requiredbasedon the corpusdata. On the
other hand, problematicissues sometimesmight
be solved in several differentways. Whendecid-
ing on their final treatment,an ideal balancebe-
tween gain and loss should be reached, in other
words,themin-maxstrategy as a basicannotation
30
principlecan also be applied here (minimizethe
loss and maximizethe gain that the solutioncan
provide).
