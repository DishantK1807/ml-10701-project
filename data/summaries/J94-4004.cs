notion of unification (as used in Definition 3) differs from that of the standard unification frameworks (see, for example, Shieber et al.1989, 1990; Kaplan and Bresnan 1982; Kaplan et al.1989; Kay 1984; etc).

Three examples of such systems are (1) GETA/ARIANE (Vauquois and Boitet 1985; Boitet 1987); (2) LMT (McCord 1989); and (3) METAL (Alonso 1990; Thurmair 1990).

One of the claims made by Lindop and Tsujii (1991) is that the non-Eurotra literature rarely goes into great detail when discussing how divergences are handled.

2. Classification of Machine Translation Divergences The divergence problem in machine translation has received increasingly greater attention in recent literature (see, for example, Barnett et al.1991a, 1991b; Beaven 1992a, 1992b; Dorr 1990a, 1990b; Kameyama et al.1991; Kinoshita, Phillips, and Tsujii 1992; Lindop and Tsujii 1991; Tsujii and Fujita 1991; Whitelock 1992; related discussion can also be found in work by Melby \[1986\] and Nirenburg and Nirenburg \[1988\]).

In particular, Barnett et al.(1991a) divide distinctions between the source language and the target language into two categories: translation divergences, in which the same information is conveyed in the source and target texts, but the structures of the sentences are different (as in previous work by Dorr \[1990a, 1990b\]); and translation mismatches, in which the information that is conveyed is different in the source and target languages (as described by Kameyama et al.\[1991\]). 3 Although translation mismatches are a major problem for translation systems that must be addressed, they are outside the scope of the model presented here.
P90-1017 P91-1025 W91-0109
In particular, there have been criticisms (see, for example, Lindop and Tsujii 1991) of systems that perform transfer on relatively shallow analyses (e.g., early METAL \[Alonso 1990, Thurmair 1990\] and LTAG \[AbeillG Schabes, and Joshi 1990\]) owing to the fact that such systems are not likely to be able to handle divergence interactions (although they may be able to handle each divergence type in isolation).

Currently, there is no preference assignment during lexical selection (as in Nirenburg and Nirenburg 1988; Wilks 1973); instead, the system requires an exact match of the CLCS to the target-language RLCS (or some combination of RLCSs).
C88-2100
The LCS has been studied as the basis of a representation for multiple languages (see, for example, Hale and Keyser 1986a, 1986b, 1989; Hale and Laughren 1983; Levin and Rappaport 1986; Zubizarreta 1982, 1987) and is discussed in the context of machine translation by Dorr (1992b).

Dorr Machine Translation Divergences of generation based on theories of tense by Allen (1983, 1984), Hornstein (1990), and Reichenbach (1947) is discussed in Dorr and Gaasterland (1992) and Dorr (1993b).

However, the LFG-MT system by .Kaplan et al.(1989) does, in fact, handle such cases by means of mappings between source and target functional structures (fstructures).

In particular, it has been argued convincingly by Farwell, Guthrie, and Wilks (1992) that resources such as the LDOCE are useful for constructing dictionary representations for languages other than English, thus paving the way for scaling up interlingual machine translations so that they have broader coverage.
