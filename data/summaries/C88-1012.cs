The overall objectives of tile combined effort arc described in a number of papers (see Russell et at., 1986; Phillips arid Thompson, 1987, and Briscoe et al., 1987).

Thus a number of matchine translation (MT) projects~ especially ones employing a ~ransfer strategy, make use of format systems for grammar specification, which, in addition to mapping surface strings into con~esponding language structures, identify operations to be associated with nodes and / or subtrees (Vauquois & Boitet, 1985; Nagao et al., 1985).

Particularly well known examples are reported in Kaplan (1983) (see also Kiparsky, 1985), Shieber (1984), Evans (1985), Phillips and Thompson (1985), Jensen et al.(1986) and Karttunen (1986).

A case ha point is the ARIANE system (Vauquois & Boitet, 1985): even though it was designed as a completely integrated programmaing environment, with the aim of enabling implementation of, and experimentation with, different linguistic theories, in reality the system has been unable to cope with radically new grammatical frameworks and computational strategies for text analysis.

In general, the effects of the temptation to allow, for example, the EVALuation of arbitrary LISP expressions on the ares of the ATN or the addition of "procedural programming facilities" to the rule-based skeleton of 1BM's PLNLP have been discussed at length in the recent literature addressing the issues of declarative formalisms from a theoretical perspective (see Shieber, 1986a, and references therein).

In particular, it is important to realise that software support tbr :inch a task does not imply, arm should not be reduced to, tile provision of' a set of computational tools for e.g. gtanlmar editing, inspocting th4; output from a parser, or comfortably interacting with the system..Ln effozt of this scale crucially requi~es critical evaluation of the u,deriylng lingntstle theory, so that the right combination o\[ pragmatically motivated and linguistically correct modifications and revisions is ~bund and implementexl, We are not alone in our findings; our approach to making computational sense of GPSG is similar to the (unimplemenled) plvposals of Shieber (1986b) and Ristad (1987).

()nly when theou and grammar are beiug developed in very close collaboration, or even wifltin the same group -as in, for example, the })ewlctt.-Packard NLP project, whose cornerstotm is the linguistic framewolk of Head-Driven t'hrase Structm'e Grannnar (Proudian and Pollard, 1985; PollaN aud Sag, 1987) -could such ~ul approach work.
