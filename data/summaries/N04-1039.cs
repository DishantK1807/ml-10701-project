Conditional Maximum Entropy (maxent) models have been widely used for a variety of tasks, including language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), word selection for machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), and finding sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
