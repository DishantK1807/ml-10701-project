The paper follows Fodor (1982), Fodor and Sag (1982), and Park (1995, 1996) in viewing many apparent scope ambiguities as arising from referential categories rather than true generalized quantitiers.

It follows that the observation of Park (1995, 1996) that only quantified arguments of a single (possibly composed) function can freely alternate scope places an upper bound on the number of readings.
P95-1028
The notion of syntactic derivation embodied in CCG is the most powerful limitation on the number of available readings, and allows all logical-form level constraints on scope orderings to be dispensed with, a result related to, but more powerful than, that of Pereira (1990).

For example, in processing (22) (adapted from Hobbs and Shieber 1987), which Park 1995 claims to have only four readings, rather than the five predicted by their account, such a system can build both readings for the S/NP every representative of three companies saw and decide which is more likely, before building both compatible readings of the whole sentence and similarly resolving with respect to statistical or contextual support: (22) Every representative of three companies saw some sample.

It is interesting to speculate finally on the relation of the above account of the available scope readings with proposals to minimize search during processing by building "underspecified" logical forms by Reyle (1992), and others cited in Willis and Manandhar (1999).

The present paper follows Fodor (1982), Fodor and Sag (1982), and Park (1995, 1996) in explaining scope ambiguities in terms of a distinction between true generalized quantifiers and other purely referential categories.
