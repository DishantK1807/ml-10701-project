Then, the most likely token sequence is selected according to a statistical model, such as Markov model (Bikel, 1997; Yu, 1998) or maximum entropy model (Borthwick, 1999).

There are two major approaches to NE recognition: the handcrafted approach (Grishman, 1995) and the statistical approach (Bikel, 1997; Chen, 1998; Yu, 1998).

In the following section, we propose an EM-style bootstrapping procedure (Cucerzan, 1999) for annotating the training data automatically.

methods that can be bootstrapped from a little seed data or a few seed rules (Collins, 1999; Cucerzan, 1999) are highly demanded to automatically annotate the training data.
