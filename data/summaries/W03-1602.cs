4.3 Three-layered representation Previous work on transfer-based MT systems (Lavoie et al., 2000; Dorna et al., 1998) and alignment-based transfer knowledge acquisition (Meyers et al., 1996; Richardson et al., 2001) have proven that transfer knowledge can be best represented by declarative structure mapping (transforming) rules each of which typically consists of a pair of source and target partial structures as in the middle of Figure 2.

trees (MDSs) Previous work on transfer-based machine translation (MT) suggests that the dependency-based representation has the advantage of facilitating syntactic transforming operations (Meyers et al., 1996; Lavoie et al., 2000).

Therefore, such an approach as semantic transfer, where morphosyntactic information is highly abstracted away as in (Dorna et al., 1998; Richardson et al., 2001), does not suit this task.

assessment To the best of our knowledge, there have never been no reports on research to build a computational model of the language proficiency of deaf people, except for the remarkable reports by Michaud and McCoy (2001).

As a subpart of their research aimed at developing the ICICLE system (McCoy and Masterman, 1997), a language-tutoring application for deaf learners of written English, Michaud and McCoy developed an architecture for modeling the writing proficiency of a user called SLALOM.
