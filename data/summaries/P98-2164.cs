Although (Church, 1992) questions the concept of correct analysis, (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997) establish that there exists a -statistically significantabsolute correct disambiguation, respect to which the error rates of either the tagger or the test corpus can be computed.

Factors affecting the evaluation process are: (1) Training and test experiments are usually performed over noisy corpora which distorts the obtained results, (2) performance figures are too often calculated from only a single or very small number of trials, though average results from multiple trials are crucial to obtain reliable estimations of accuracy (Mooney, 1996), (3) testing experiments are usually done on corpora with the same characteristics as the training data -usually a small fresh portion of the training corpusbut no serious attempts have been done in order to determine the reliability of the results when moving from one domain to another (Krovetz, 1997), and (4) no figures about computational effort -space/time complexityare usually reported, even from an empirical perspective.

We I One of the exceptions is the work by (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997), in which a very strict comparison between taggers is performed.
