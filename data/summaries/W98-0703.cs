WSD that use information gathered from training on a corpus that has already been semantically disambiguated (supervised training methods) (Gale, Church et al., 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996}; 3.

We also make use of these properties in formulating the empirical classifiers as described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994).
P94-1020
There are also hybrid methods that combine several sources of knowledge such as lexicon information, heuristics, collocations and others (McRoy, 1992) (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) (Ng and Lee, 1996) (Rigau, Asterias et al., 1997).

WSD that make use of the information provided by machine readable dictionaries (Cowie et a1.1992), (Miller et a1.1994), (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), (Li et a1.1995), (McRoy, 1992); 2.

WSD that use information gathered from raw corpora (unsupervised training methods) (Yarowsky 1995) (Resnik 1997).
P95-1026 W97-0209 W97-0213
An example of the type of feature used is the part-of-speech of the word to the right; see (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) for the other ones we use.

Cowie et al.(1992) extend the idea by using simulated annealing to optimize a configuration of word senses simultaneously in terms of degree of word overlap.
C92-1056
In order to determine the sub-hierarchies that should be used for vl and nj, we used statistics provided by SemCor, a sense tagged version of the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1967) (Miller, Leacock et al., 1993), containing 250,000 words.
