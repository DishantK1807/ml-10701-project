Inflectional morphology is implemented with finite-state transducers on the model used for Spanish (Tzoukermann and Liberman, 1990).

A list of terms is associated with each corpus: the terms corresponding to \[ECI\] were automatically extracted by LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993) and the terms corresponding to \[AGR\] were extracted from the AGROVOC term list owned by INIST/CNRS.

We also thank the Institut de l'Information Scientifique et Technique (INIST-CNRS) for providing us with the agricultural corpus and the associated term list, and Didier Bourigault for providing us with terms extracted from the newspaper corpus through LEXTER (Bourigault, 1993).

and Introduction NLP techniques have been applied to extraction of information from corpora for tasks such as free indexing (extraction of descriptors from corpora), (Metzler and Haas, 1989; Schwarz, 1990; Sheridan and Smeaton, 1992; Strzalkowski, 1996), term acquisition (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Dallle, 1996), or extraction of lin9uistic information e.g. support verbs (Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995), and event structure of verbs (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).

Second, a finite-state part of speech tagger (Tzoukermann, Radev, and Gale, 1995; Tzoukermann and Radev, 1996) performs the morphosyntactic disambiguation of words.
