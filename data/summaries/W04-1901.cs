More feature-rich models using parent and grandparent nodes along with models trained on the MRS representations have been proposed and implemented with an English grammar and the Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2002).

Hinoki Treebank The structure of our treebank is inspired by the Redwoods treebank of English in which utterances are parsed and the annotator selects the best parse from the full analyses derived by the grammar (Oepen et al., 2002).

We extended JACY by adding the de ning vocabulary, and added some new rules and lexicaltypes (more detail is given in Bond et al.(2004a)).1 Almost none of the rules are speci c to the dictionary domain.

The motivation and initial construction was described in detail in Bond et al.(2004a). The ultimate goal of our research is natural language understanding | we aim to create a system that can parse text into some useful semantic representation.

By using a Japanese grammar (JACY: Siegel and Bender (2002)) based on a monostratal theory of grammar (HPSG: Pollard and Sag (1994)) we could simultaneously annotate syntactic and semantic structure without overburdening the annotator.

Our approach is described in more detail in Bond et al.(2004b). The main di erence between our research and earlier approaches, such as Tsurumaru et al.(1991), is that we are fully parsing the input, not just using regular expressions.

Currently 58.5% of the pairs extracted for nouns are linked to nodes in the Goi-Taikei ontology (Bond et al., 2004b).
