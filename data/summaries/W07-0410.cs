On the other hand, both BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington 2002) scores are higher for the baseline system (mteval-v11b.pl).

Actually, now that SMT has reached some maturity, we see several attempts to integrate more structure into these systems, ranging from simple hierarchical alignment models (Wu 1997, Chiang 2005) to syntax-based statistical systems (Yamada and Knight 2001, Zollmann and Venugopal 2006).

Different optimization techniques are available, like the Simplex algorithm or the special Minimum Error Training as described in (Och 2003).

For our experiments, a suffix array language model based on the SALM toolkit (Zhang & Vogel, 2006) is used.
