To enforce selectional constraints in the context of incomplete semantic knowledge, we use a scheme of preference semantics, as introduced by Wilks (1975): we seek the parse violating the 1 For a discussion of essential roles, see (Palmer 1986).

In order to analyze the telegraphic text, the English grammar is extended to include a variety of fragmentary constructions, but with a penalty so that full sentence analyses are preferred (Grishman 1989).

This conference involved the development of a system for processing Navy OPREP (OPerational REPort) messages; these messages are reports of sightings and engagements at sea (Sundheim 1989b).

3. Application and Evaluation This approach has been implemented as part of the PROTEUS message understanding system, and evaluated as part of the recent MUCK-II conference (Sundheim 1989a).

Our semantic model was constructed entirely by hand; for future evaluations, we hope that larger text samples coupled with more automated procedures for model acquisition (as described, for example, in (Gfishman 1986) and (Lang 1988)) will allow us to provide broader model coverage within similar time constraints.
