For that purpose, most past work (Appelt, 1985; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van Deemter, 2002; Krahmer et al., 2003) makes use of attributes of an intended object (the target) and binary relations between the target and others (distractors) to distinguish the target from distractors.

Krahmer et al.claim that their method can handle n-ary relations (Krahmer et al., 2003), they provide no details.

A possible direction would be to enhance the algorithm proposed by Krahmer et al.(Krahmer et al., 2003).
