Recent work on the generation ofquantifiers (Gailly, 1988; Creaney, 1996; Creaney, 1999) follows the analysis viewpoint, discussing scope anabiguities extensively.

1998). Since natural language understanding systems need to obtain as few interpretations as possible from text, researchers have studied quantifier scope ambiguity extensively (Woods~ 1978;-Grosz et al., 1987; Hobbs and Shieber, 1987: Pereira, 1990; Moran and Pereira, 1992: Park, 1995).

To convey information concisely and fluently, text generation systems often perform opportunistic text planning (Robin, 1995; Mellish et al., 1998) and employ advanced linguistic constructions such as ellipsis (Shaw, 1998).

Application Domain We implemented our quantification algorithm as part of MAGIC (Dalai et al., 1996: McKeown et al., 1997).

The sentence planner's responsibilities include referring expression generation, clause aggregation, and lexical choice (Wanner and How, 1996).

Work Because a quantified expression refers to multiple entities in a domain, our work can be categorized as referring expression generation (Dale, 1992; Reiter and Dale, 1992; Horacek, 1997).
