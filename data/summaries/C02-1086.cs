Mutual information MI(x,y) is defined as following (Church and Hanks, 1990): )()( ),( log )()( ),( log),( 22 yfxf yxfN ypxp yxp yxMI â‹… == (4) where f(x) and f(y) are frequency of term x and term y, respectively.

One way of resolving query ambiguities is to use the statistics, such as mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990), to measure associations of query terms, on the basis of existing corpora (Jang et al, 1999).

Query translation methods (Hull and Grefenstette, 1996; Davis, 1996; Eichmann et al, 1998; Yang et al, 1998; Jang et al, 1999; Chun, 2000) based on bilingual dictionaries, multilingual ontology or thesaurus are much more practical.
