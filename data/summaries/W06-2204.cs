TPLEX is most closely related to the NOMEN algorithm (Yangarber et al., 2002).

In response to this challenge, many researchers have investigated semi-supervised learning algorithms that learn from a (relatively small) set of labelled texts in conjunction with a (relatively large) set of unlabelled texts (e.g., (Riloff, 1996; Brin, 1998; Yangarber et al., 2002)).

In (Collins and Singer, 1999) Collins and Singer show that unlabeled data can be used to reduce the level of supervision required for named entity classification.

This strategy has previously been employed successfully (Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000; Ciravegna, 2001; Yangarber et al., 2002; Finn and Kushmerick, 2004).
C02-1154
Several approaches for learning from both labeled and unlabeled data have been proposed (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999) where the unlabeled data is utilised to boost the performance of the algorithm.

A number of researchers have previously developed bootstrapping or semi-supervised approaches to information extraction, named entity recognition, and related tasks (Riloff, 1996; Brin, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Agichtein et al., 2001; Yangarber et al., 2002; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Etzioni et al., 2005).
