dealing with the performance of NLP systems in terms of their ability to generate semantic/conceptual structures), the semantic interpretation (SI) task has to be clearly distinguished from the information extraction (IE) task and its standard evaluation settings (Chinchor et al., 1993).

Work After a period of active research within the logicbased paradigm (e.g., Charniak and Goldman (1988), Moore (1989), Pereira and Pollack (1991)), work on semantic interpretation has almost ceased with the emergence of the empiricist movement in NLP (cf.

Bos et al.(1996) for one of the more recent studies dealing with logic-based semantic interpretation in the framework of the VERBMOBIL project).

Bonnema et al.(1997)). Several guidelines were defined for the evaluation procedure.

A recent study by Bonnema et al.(1997) comes closest to a serious confrontation with a wide range of real-world data (Dutch dialogues on a train travel domain).
P97-1021
Only few methodological proposals for semantic computations were made since then (e.g., higherorder colored unification as a mechanism to avoid over-generation inherent to unconstrained higherorder unification (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996)).

Bonnema et al.(1997) and Bean et al.(1998)). Though similarities exist (viz.

Though the MUC evaluation rounds (Chinchor et al., 1993) yield the flavor of an empirical assessment of semantic structures, their scope is far too limited to count as an adequate evaluation platform for semantic interpretation.

One might be tempted to argue that recent evaluation efforts within the field of information extraction (IE) systems (Chinchor et al., 1993) are going to remedy this shortcoming.
J93-3001
Semantic interpretation has been an actively investigated issue on the research agenda of the logic-based paradigm of NLP in the late eighties (e.g., Charniak and Goldman (1988), Moore (1989), Pereira and Pollack (1991)).

in terms of the resolution of lexico-semantie ambiguities (e.g., Schfitze (1998), Pedersen and Bruce (1998)) and the generation of lexical hierarchies from large text corpora (e.g., Li and Abe (1996), Hirakawa et al.(1996)) massively using statistical techniques.

Nirenburg et al.(1996) already criticize the 'black-box' architecture underlying MUC-style evaluations, which precludes to draw serious conclusions from the shortcomings of MUC-style systems as far as single linguistic modules are concerned.
