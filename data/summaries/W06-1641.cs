Amongst the participants in the TREC Novelty Track, only (Kim et al., 2004) proposed a method specialized to opinion-bearing sentence retrieval, by making use of lists of words with positive or negative polarities.

Although some of the topics used in the Novelty Track in 2003 and 2004 (Soboroff and Harman, 2003; Soboroff, 2004) were related to opinions, most of the efforts were focused on topic, such as studies using term distribution within each sentence, e.g., (Allan et al., 2003; Losada, 2005; Murdock and Croft, 2005).

For example, the adjective ‘unpredictable’ may have a negative orientation in an automotive review, in a phrase such as ‘unpredictable steering’, but it could have a positive orientation in a movie review, in a phrase such as ‘unpredictable plot’, as mentioned in (Turney, 2002) in the context of his sentiment word detection.

(Wilson et al., 2005) investigated how context influences sentiment polarity at the phrase level in a corpus, beginning with a predefined list of words with polarities.

This negation handling is similar to that used in (Das and Chen, 2001; Pang et al., 2002).

5.1 Data set and evaluation measure We used the MPQA Opinion Corpus version 1.2 (Wilson et al., 2005; Wiebe et al., 2005) to measure the effectiveness of our sentiment re349 trieval models.

We used Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown’s sentiment word list (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), which consists of 657 positive and 679 negative adjectives, and The General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), which contains 1621 positive and 1989 negative words.7 By merging these lists, we obtained 1947 positive and 2348 negative words.

A number of studies have investigated sentiment classification at document level, e.g., (Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003), and at sentence level, e.g., (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Nigam and Hurst, 2005); however, the accuracy is still less than desirable.
