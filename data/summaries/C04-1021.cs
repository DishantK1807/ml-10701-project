We introduce a theoretical framework for discriminating between Semantically Tractable (ST) questions and difficult ones, and we show that ST questions are prevalent in the well-studied ATIS data set (Price, 1990).
H90-1020
Evaluation Semantic Tractability (ST) theory and PRECISEâ€™s architecture raise a four empirical questions that we now address via experiments on the ATIS data set (Price, 1990): how prevalent are ST questions?
H90-1020
Enhancements We used the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) for the experiments reported in this paper.
