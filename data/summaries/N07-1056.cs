As an alternative to heuristic search algorithms, researchers also employ exact methods from combinatorial optimization, in particular integer linear programming (Germann et al., 2001; Roth and Yih, 2004).

In applications where beam decoding does not yield suf cient accuracy, researchers employ an alternative heuristic search, A* (Jelinek, 1969; Germann et al., 2001).

This task has been extensively studied over the last six years (Banko et al., 2000; Jin and Hauptmann, 2001).
H01-1011 P00-1041
Work Decoding for selection-and-ordering problems is commonly implemented using beam search (Banko et al., 2000; Corston-Oliver et al., 2002; Jin and Hauptmann, 2001).
H01-1011 P00-1041
Our method for estimation of selection-andordering preferences is based on the technique described in (Banko et al., 2000).
P00-1041
This feature distinguishes our task from other decoding problems, such as decoding in machine translation (Germann et al., 2001), that are modeled using a standard TSP formulation.
P01-1030
Even a larger beam size such as 80 (as used by Banko et al.(2000)) does not match the title quality of the optimal decoder.
