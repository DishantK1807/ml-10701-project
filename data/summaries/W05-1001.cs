Role Labelling The automatic labelling was based on the statistical approach in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002).

The complex examples were taken from a subset of the LIVAC synchronous corpus 1 (Tsou et al., 2000; Kwong and Tsou, 2003).

In practice, for example, the semantic roles in the Sinica Treebank mark not only verbal arguments but also modifier-head relations (You and Chen, 2004).

In Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), the features studied include phrase type (pt), governing category (gov), parse tree path (path), position of constituent with respect to the target predicate (position), voice (voice), and headword (h).

In their seminal proposal, Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) approached the task using various features such as headword, phrase type, and parse tree path.

Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), for instance, used a set of roles defined according to the FrameNet model (Baker et al., 1998), thus corresponding to the frame elements in individual frames under a particular domain to which a given verb belongs.

Swier and Stevenson (2004) innovated with an unsupervised approach to the problem, using a bootstrapping algorithm, and achieved 87% accuracy.

Sun and Jurafsky (2004) also reported a drop in F-score with automatic syntactic parses compared to perfect parses for role labelling in Chinese, despite the comparatively good results of their parser (i.e.

To date PropBank and FrameNet are the two main resources in English for training semantic role labelling systems, as in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (Carreras and MÃ rquez, 2004) and SENSEVAL-3 (Litkowski, 2004).

Xue and Palmer (2004), for instance, looked into new features such as syntactic frame, lexicalized constituent type, etc., and found that enriching the feature set improved the labelling performance.

Gildea and Palmer (2002) defined roles with respect to individual predicates in the PropBank, without explicit naming.

The parse information is deemed important for the performance of role labelling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003).

Such results are in line with and comparable to those reported for the unknown boundary condition with automatic parses in Gildea and Palmer (2002), for instance.
J02-3001 P02-1031
Gildea and Palmer (2002) compared the effects of full parsing and shallow chunking; and found that when constituent boundaries are known, both automatic parses and gold standard parses resulted in about 80% accuracy for subsequent automatic role tagging, but when boundaries are unknown, results with automatic parses dropped to 57% precision and 50% recall.
