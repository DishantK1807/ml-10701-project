Berger et al.1996 presented a way of computing conditional maximum entropy models directly by modifying equation 6 as follows (now instead of w we will explicitly use (x, y) ): i ~Cx~) = ~ f~(~, y) * ~(~, y) ~ ~ .~(~, y) * ~(~) * pCy I ~) = p(xk) (9) x6X yEY xEX yEY where ~(x, y) is an empirical probability of a joint configuration (w) of certain instantiated factor I variables with certain instantiated behavior variables.

For the evaluation we usecl the same 27,294 sentences as in PaimerSzHearst 1994 and Palmer&Hearst 1997 IÂ° which were also used by Reynar&Ratnaparkhi 1997 in the evaluation of their system.

Our method uses assumptions similar to Berger et al.1996 but is naturally suitable for distributed parallel computations.

First as the configuration space we can use only the reference nodes (w) from the lattice which makes it similar to the method of Berger et al.1996 described in section 2.1.

We adopted the stop condition suggested in Berger et al.1996 the maximization of the likelihood on a cross-validation set of samples which is unseen at the parameter esti~_tion.

To make feature ranking computationally tractable in Della Pietra et al.1995 and Berger et al.1996 a simplified process proposed: at the feature ranking stage when adding a new feature to the model all previously computed parameters are kept fixed and, thus, we have to fit only one new constraint imposed by a candidate feature.
