DESCRIPTIONAL ANAPHORA IN DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY Michael Hess Department of Computer Sciences.
University of Zurich WinterthuPerstp.
190 CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland ABSTRACT Standard Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) was designed mainly to explain the so-called donkey-sentences.
The pronouns plaYing such a prominent role in all these sentences belong, however, exclusively to one (partlculaPly simple) type of pronoun.
We try to extend DRT in order to cover an equally Important type of pronoun, the so-called etdes0rIptlonal,* pronoun.
Discourse referents ape now used Eo carry information on the intenslon of their referents as well as on the extenslon.
This allows, at the same time.
to suggest accessibility rules for Pronouns which are more appropriate than those suggested by traditional DRT.
These new rules ape based on the generlcness of the sentences involved.
1. PRONOMINAL REFERENCE AS STARTING POINT fOR DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY One of the starting points fop the development of DRT in Kamp*s orlglnal paper (Kemp 1981) was the seemingly erratic behaviour shown by indefinite noun phrases under a traditional logical analysis, and the equally erratic interactions that seem to obtain between Indeflnire noun phrases and inter-sententlal and intPa-sententlal PPonomlnal references to them.
Of PartlculaP Interes~ was the behaviour of indefinite noun phrases in the so-called donkey-sentences.
1.1 Definiteness
and Indefiniteness in Traditional Linguistic Theory The traditional, and intuitively quite convincing, view has it that definite noun phrases refer to an object that is already familiar to the speaker (and possibly also to the listener), whereas indefinite noun phrases introduce new objects.
This theory looks convincing as lone as we consider explicit deflnites, as in 1) John owns a donkey.
John beats the Oonkey where the donkey is introduced as exlstln s by the indefinite noun phrase and referred to as familiar by the following definite noun phrase.
Personal pronouns are, under the accepted Interpretation, contracted forms of definite noun phrases, and the familiarity hypothesis often works reasonably well fop them.
too: In the following paraphrase of i: 2) John owns a donkey.
He beats it the definite pronoun refers to the donkey which is familiar after it has been Introduced by an indefinite noun phrase, and the definite pronoun is.
in other words.
co-referentlal with the pPecedlng Indeflnire noun Phrase.
For this reason the traditional interpretation of noun phrases and pronouns is called "referential".
But problems surface if we consider sentences such as 3) John doesn't own a donkey 4) Every boy likes his mother Neither does the indefinite noun phrase in 3 assert that there is a donkey that John owns, nor can we really say that the pronoun "his" in ~ refers to something familiar.
Indeed. we can hardly se.v that it refers to anything at all: If we stick to the traditional view of what reference is, viz.
a relationship between an expression of language and a real object, then there can be no reference at all in ~, since no existence of any boys was ever asserted.
It was examples such as those that brought the whole familiarity theory into disrepute (of.
the short historical outline given by Helm 1983).
1.2 Definiteness
and Indefiniteness in Logicall 7 Oriented Linguistics One radical solution to the problem of non-referring noun phrases was suggested by Russell in his classical Theory of Descriptions.
Zn it.
both definite and indefinite articles are interpreted as existential quantlflers (with the addl148 tional constraint of uniqueness in the case of the definite article).
Noun phrases do not refer at all.
they all assert existence (with the exception of "logica~ly proper names*', whose existence Russell could never prove).
Example 3 would become "I¢ is not the case that there is a donRey and John owns it".
and would become "For every boy there is exactly one mother such that he loves her*'.
Now the truth values for these senfences come out right.
This interpretation is, accordingly, called the "quantiflcational theory of noun phrases".
Under ¢hls analysis pronouns correspond ¢o the variables bound by quantlflers in First Order Predicate Calculus.
Until recently most linguists and logicians saw no other solution to the problems exemplified by sentences 3 and ~ than ¢o adopt Russell's theory.
But the quantlflcational theory of noun phrases does not seem to help in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2.
Here the traditional referential theory still seemed to have much more explanatory power.
But this meant, unfortunately, that noun phrases.
inclusive pronouns, must be interpreted in (at least) two fundamentally different ways: In sinEle sentences such as 3 and as quantifiers and bound variables.
respectively, without any referring function, and in multi-sentence discourses such as 1 and 2 as referring expressions.
But far worse, there are certain cases where neither of these interpretations seems possible.
The best-known examples are the so-called donkey-sentences: 5) If John owns a donkey he is happy 6) If John owns a donkey he beats it The most natural translation of 5 is 7) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -> happy(john) where the indefinite article can be represented as an existential quantifier.
and thls is in Keeping wlth our intuition: A valid paraphrase of this sentence is "If there is some donkey that John owns he is happy'*.
Example 6, on the other hand.
must get.
as the only intuitively convincIng representation, 8) ALL X: ((donkey(X) AND owns(john,X)) -> beats(john,X)) where the indefinite article has to be translated as a universal quantifier ("For any donRey that John owns it will be the case that he beats it").
The only syntactic difference between the two sentences is the pronominal reference to the noun phrase "a donkey", made in 6 but misslnE in 5.
The manner in which an arbitrarily (in principle) far removed pronoun in the surface sentence can turn an existential quantifier into a universal one has been puzzlinE logicians and linguists for a lone time.
The referential theory of noun phrases does not help, either, in these cases.
We really are at a loss ¢o explain donRey sentences.
But there are yet more functions of noun phrases, and in particular of pronouns, which seem to resist any straightforward logical or "traditional'* interpretation: The Bach-Peters sentences, where pronouns point crosswise forward and bacRward ("The pilot who shot at i_~ hit the MIE that chased him"), and the so-called E-type pronouns, which point from outside into quantified statements ('*Few M.P.s came to the party but the~ had a good time** (Evans 1980:338).
One particular Rind of the Etype pronouns will be given a lot of attention below.
1.3 Pronominal
Reference in Discourse Representation Theory Kamp*s DRT and Helm's File Change Semantics are two (very similar) attempts ¢o unify the familiarity/novelty theory and the quantlficational theory of noun phrases and, as special cases, the referential theory and the bound-varlable theory of pronouns.
Both authors took up an idea of Karttunen's (e.g.
Karttunen 1976).
viz. that we have to dlstinEuish between "normal" referents, i.e. real objects in the world (or a model of it).
and special discourse referents whose existence in the discourse does not in itself say anything about the existence of any objects in the world (or the model).
Indefinite noun phrases and proper names introduce (i.e.
assert the existence of) new discourse referents.
These discourse referents constitute the universe of discourse.
The remaining information conrained in the sentence defines the conditions on the discourse referents.
Now the conflict between the two interpretations of noun phrases can be resolved: We can "refer*' (by means of definite noun phrases or definite pronouns) to discourse referents (this is the referencefamiliarity component) bur these entities are not real world objects but something functionally similar to the variables used in quantified statements (this is the quantification component).
Thls solution works for anaphoric linRs from inside a sentence (such as 6) as well as for those from outside (e.g.
2). i.e. we have a way to treat both isolated sentences and discourses.
Notatlonally0 discourse referents and conditions are arranged,in Discourse Representation Structures (DRSs).
Following Guenthner 1986.
we llst on the left 149 hand side of a DRS The membePs of The univePse of discouPse, on the PiEht hand side ~he conditions on Them.
PPopeP names ape not used as individual constants; difrepent individuals can have the same name.
and pPopeP names ape ThePefoPe tPanslated as noPmal pPedlcaTes.
ConTPaPy To Kampts oPiEinal notation° but in aEPeement with The pPac~ice now EenePally adopted0 we do not PecoPd the whole analysis pPocess of each sentence in The DRS.
The fiPst senPence of example 2 would cPeate an initial DRS 9) \[ul.
u2: ~ohn(ul).
donkey(u2). owns(ul,u2)\] whePeas the second sentence would ex~end this DRS To become 10) \[ul, u2: John(u1).
donkey(u2), owns(ul,u2)0 beats(ul.u2)\] Sentences 5 and 6.
on The otheP would become hand, 11) \[ul: 3ohn(ul), \[u2: donkey(u2).
owns(ul.u2)\] --> happy(u1)\] 12) \[ul: \[u2: John(u1).
donkey(u2). owns(ul,u2)\] --> \[beaTs(ul,u2)\]\] Finally.
a sentence such as "If a man loves a woman he will Eive heP a PinE" would be PepPesenTed as 13) \[\[ul,u2: man(u1), woman(u2).
loves(ul.u2)\] --> \[u3: PlnE(u3).
Eives(ul,u3,u2)\]\] 2.
RESTRICTIONS ON PRONOMINAL REFERENCE IN DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY 2.1 The Classical Examples Zt is claimed in The litePatuPe on DRT That The constPuc~ion pPinciples of DRSs also explain cePtain Pes~Pictions on pPonominal PefePence.
PPime examples ape discouPses with quantified sentences such as 14) Every man who owns a donkey beats it.
* It has a white patch on its forehead whePe the PPonoun Ititw' in the second senfence cannot be linked anaphoPically to The noun phPase in ~he fIPs~ sentence.
althouEh the "it" in The fiPst sentence (a donkey-sentence) can.
The same ~hinE holds fop conditional sentences and ne~atlons.
DRT in its pPesent foPm models the accessibility PestPictions encountePed in these examples by embeddln~ DRSs inside each orheP, and by postulaTinE appPopPiaEe accesslbillZ~ Pules fop anaphomlc links (see Pinkal (1986) fop a Eood ovemvlew, and extensions concePnlnE definite noun phPases).
While the discouPse PefePents of pPopeP names ape "pushed up" to Zhe pPincipal DRS, even when embedded, the othePs ape left "buPiedt' inside the embedded DRSs.
Accessibility Pules make suPe that anaphoPic links cannot Peach down into embedded DRSs, and only "backwaPds" in embedded DRSs.
We want to show in this papeP that the examples noPmally used to show accessibility PesTPictlons.
e.E. I~, ape unacceptable not fop The Peasons Eiven in DRT, but fop entiPely diffePent Peasons.
We will fuPthePmoPe show that otheP phenomena of anaphoPa cannot be explained by DRT in its pPesent foPm.
We will then suEEesT appPopPiaTe modifications To DRT To compensate fop these deficiencies.
2.2 Counterexamples
IT is cePTalnlv TPue That dlscouPse fPaEmenTs such as i~ ape unacceptable, but not because pPonouns cannot anaphoPically Point into quantlfled (conditional, neEated) statements.
The followinE counTePexamples show That They can, undeP cePrain ciPcumsTances: 15) Every man who truly loves a woman respects her.
He treats her as his equal and expects the same thing of her 16) Whenever a hunter spots a deer he will kill it.
He will cut it up and carry it home The pPonouns "heP" and "lit* in The second sentence of each example PefeP to discouPse PefePents which should be inaccessible, accoPdlnE to DRT.
The accessibility Pules fop embedded DRSs.
as used in tPadltlonal DRT.
ape too PestPic~ive.
3. THE FUNCTION OF DISCOURSE REFERENTS IN TRADITIONAL DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY If we wan~ ~o cover cases such as 15 and 16 we not only have to modify the accesslblll~y restrlc~lon Pules but also modify cup idea of what dlscouPse PefePents s~and fop.
We said that DRT tries to unify the PefePential and the quan~ificational intePpPetatlon of noun phrases.
If we use HoPn Clause Logic (HCL) as the taPEeT lanEuaEe fop the intePpPetaTlon of senfences we Eet a paPticulaPly simple co~Pespondence.
In an exsunple such as 2 ('3ohn owns a donkey.
He beats It') the "It" in the second sentence ultimately PefePs ro the same individual as the noun phPase "a donkey", and The discouPse PefePent intPoduced by "a donkey" stands fop the individual constan~ PepPesenTinE this individual in HCL (in standaPd FiPsT OPdeP PPedlcate Calculus we would, of couPse, haveto use a vaPiable).
In senTences such i~ ~'EvePy man who owns a donkey beats it', howeveP, the pPonoun plays The Pole of an individual vaPiable in HCL 150 (and in standard First Order Predicate Calculus).
Discourse referents now Turn out to be an abstraction of the concept of Indlvldual variable and individual constant in HCL.
In other words, a discourse ~eferent stands for an individual variable if the sentence in which it OCCURS is ~eneric, and for a constant if it is non~enerlc ~.
as the translation of examples 2 (first sentence) and 15 shows: \[ul,u2: john(u1), donkey(u1), own(ul,u2)\] becomes own(john,donkey1).
inst(donkeyl,donkeys).
and \[ul, u2: man(u1), woman(u2), loves(ul,u2) --> respects(ul,u2)\] becomes respects(M,W) :man(M), woman(W), loves(M,W).
In addition, discourse referents have to "draE alonE" all the conditional expressions in which they occur in the DRS ("loves(M,W)" etc).
from there tO the loEical representation.
This concept of what discourse referents stand for has ~o be modified if we want to cover cases such as 15 and 16.
4. Types of Anaphoric Reference to Noun Phrases 4.1 Denotational Anaphora In both of the two types of pronominal anaphora considered so far, reference and bound variable anaphora, there is a direct mapplnE from pronouns To discourse referents, and another one from discourse referent to individual constant or varlable in the loEical representation.
A consTant stands for a real object in the world, and a variable will stand for one at evaluation time; This object is the denotation of the pronoun.
For this reason both types of anaphora considered so far are usually called "denotatlonal anaphora".
This name is unfortunate as it blurs the main idea behind this type of anaphora, viz.
The fact that "denotaTional anaphora" is an abstraction of referential (or: denotatlonal) and non-referentlal (or: bound variable) uses of pronouns and other noun phrases.
It would be much better to speak of extensional anaphora instead.
i. We treat truly Eenerlc sentences, such as 15, and ~eneral sentences, such as 16, on a par.
This is, of course, a Eross simplification.
Furthermore, it would be more precise to say, instead of "variable", "an expression containinE variables" (to include SkolemFunctions).
In Ereater detail: cf.
Hess 1985.
4.2 Descriptional
Anaphora ~owever, there is an Important type of anaphora that does not fall into this caTeEory.
15 and 16 are two examples, but we will first consider a few simpler cases, namely anaphora with indefinite pronouns, i.e. the pronoun "one(s)".
4.2.1 Indefinite
Descriptional Anaphora In both of the followinE examples, variants of the classical "paycheck-example", the first one non-Eenerlc and the second one Eenerlc, 17) John published a paper in "Nature" in 1986.
Peter published one in "Science" 18) A person who published a paper in "Nature" does not write one for the "New Scientist" the indefinite pronoun "one" does not have the same denotation, or extension, as the noun phrase it is anaphorically linked To.
We clearly speak about two different papers (whether they be individually known, as in 17, or taken Eenerally, as in 18).
In DRT in its present form, a slnEle discourse referent would be created for "a paper", and if we made the "one" point to it we would Eet the wronE loEical interpretation (namely the one we would leEitlmately Eet if the pronoun were "it" ).
We can get the correct interpretation if we treat the indefinite pronoun as a "macro", i.e. as an abbreviation for part of the precedlnE sentence.
Before we actually interpret the sentence, this abbreviation must be "macro-expanded" (Hirst's expression: Hirst 1981:31).
i.e replaced by a copy of the construction it anaphorically Points to.
In The simple examples above we can actually copy the surface structure from the antecedent into the place of the pronoun.
This was the explanation oriEinally used in TPansformatlonal Grammar for all types of pronominal reference, but it soon became clear that this view was too simple.
It is sufficient To consider cases where the antecedent contains indexical expressions such as "my", as in "I tot my paper accepted by 'Nature' Peter manaEed to Eet one accepted by 'Science'".
It is not synTactic expressions which Eet copied but some kind of "loElcal form", and the Theory that puts this view forward is accordlnEly known as "idenTity-of-loEical-form theory", or "ILFT" for short.
In DRT, The loEical form we use are DRSs, end it will consequently be discourse referents that must be copied.
DurlnE the analysis of a sentence, a "one"-pronoun must first be macro-expanded to an "empty shell" of the discourse referent it anaphoricelly points 151 to, and the normal rules of CranslaTinE DRSs into loEic must then be applied to This expanded form of the sentence.
If we expand, for instance, the second sentence of 17 we Eet a representation correspondinE to the discourse "John published a paper in 'Nature' in 1986.
Peter published a paper in 'Science'".
The normal Pules for TranslaTinE discourse referents would now automatically create two differen~ loEical representation constants for The two discourse referents ("paperl", "paper2").
Here The pronoun "one" does not (necessarily) refer To The same denotation as the noun phrase it anaphorlcally points to but rather to a "description" of i¢.
This type of anaphora is Therefore often called "descrip¢ional" anaphora.
There is, however, a problem To consider that did not arise with denotational anaphora.
If The sentence had been "John published a paper in 'Nature' in 1986.
Peter published one.
too" we would have To create a discourse referent correspondinE either to The sentence "Peter published a paper in 'Nature' in 1986, Too".
or to "... a paper in 1985.
Too" or, finally.
"... a paper in 'NaTure'.
tOO". The problem is.
of course.
¢o determine what exactly a Eiven pronoun should expand to.
This question will not be considered here.
The only thine we want to do is to show that a very common Type of anaphora.
descriptional anaphora, calls for an extension of DRT which must mare sure that all the parts of a sentence That can be used for expansion are represented as individually accessible bits of Information in the DRS.
4.2.2 Definite
Descriptional Anaphora The Two examples we started with, 15 and 16.
are acceptable because they, too, are descriptlonal.
But They are definite, as They use both the definite pronoun "it".
Furthermore. both of Them are ~enerlc, and so we consider this Type of sentence first.
AEain, we have To expand pronouns into newly created discourse referents, and aEain we must determine what information has to be packed into these new discourse referents.
But now it is a bit clearer than with indefinite descripTional anaphora how This can be accomplished.
Intuitively it is clear That in sentence 18, for instance, the two instances of "he" (plus one which was elliptically deleted: "... and he will carry ")... must be expanded into three different discourse referents, correspondinE ¢o "any hunter who has spotted a deer", "any hunter who has spotted and killed a deer", and "any hunter who has spotted, killed and cut up a deer", respectively.
Why do we have to use these successively more complicated expressions?
Because of the definiteness of the pronoun.
The function of the definite pronoun, as opposed to the indefinite one, becomes clear if we compare example 16 with 18.
In 18 we talked about different (at least, potentially different) papers.
In 16.
however, we speak about one single hunter, althouEh in different sTaEes of his deerkillinE activities.
In other words, definite pronouns require uniqueness of their ultimate referent in the same way that definite noun phrases do.
In the case of denotaTional pronouns in non-~eneric senTences the uniqueness of the constants.
used in HCL to encode existential quantification, itself enforces uniqueness of The ultimate referents.
But in The case of descripTional anaphora in ~enerlc sentences it is not Trivial to enforce this referential uniqueness.
As each Eeneric sentence ultimately Translates into an independent rule in The loEical representation we cannot establish uniqueness of a referent named in different rules by simply usinE the same variable name.
This becomes quite obvious if we remember That any implementation of a HCL prover, such as ProloE, must create a new internal representation for the same variable name, when This name is used in different clauses.
We can nevertheless enforce uniqueness of reference, even across Eeneric sentences which map into separate clauses, by addinE The consequences of each precedlnE clause to The conditions of The followinE one: kills(H.D) :hunter(H), deer(D), spoCs(H.D).
cuts_up(H.D) :hunter(H), deer(D), sPoCs(H.D), kills(H,D).
carries_home(H,D):hunter(H), deer(D), spots(H,D), kills(H,D), cuts_up(H,D).
Thus we not only see why examples 15 and 16 are possible but also how the pronouns have to be expanded.
Definite descriptional anaphora can also occur with non-~eneric sentences.
In 19) Here are the results of the analyses for samples 101 to 105.
The result of the analysis for sample 101 for oxygen is negative.
20) It was positive last time 21) It is positive for nitrogen 22) It is positive for sample 102 the pronoun "it" clearly means "the result of the analysis for sample i01 for oxyEen" • in 20, but "the result of the analysis for 152 sample i01" in 21 and "The result of The analysis for oxyEen"in 22.
If we concatenate all four sentences into one discourse we have to Eenerate Three different discourse referents for these noun phrases.
As The sentence is non-Eeneric They would Eive rise to Three different constants in The loEical representation ("resulTl" To "result3").
That These se~fences really are the definite version of descrlptlonal anaphoPa can also be seen from The fact That a valid paraphrase of 21 is "The one for niTroEen is positive".
5. AN EXTENSION OF DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY If DRT is To cover descrlptlonal anaphora (both definite and indefinite, in Eeneric as well as in non-Eenerlc sentences) we have To pack more information into discourse referents than in standard DRT.
In addition, we will have To explain how Those Types of anaphora That really are impossible (such as i~) are blocked while Those that are possible are not.
First we want to desiEn discourse referents which contain all The information necessary for the different Types of pronominal anaphora, and Then we will sketch some accessibility restrictions on This backEround.
5.1 The
Functions of Discourse Referents in Revised Discourse Representation Theory What klnd of information must be available in a discourse referent To allow The mesoluTlon of both denoTaTional and descrlpTional anaphora9 Consider example 17 with indefinite descrlpTional anaphora.
We want a loEical representation of this discourse To look like 2 evenT(c(1),publish).
aEenT(John,c(1)).
inst(c(2),papers).
obJecT(c(2),c(1)).
locaTion('NaTure',c(2)).
evenT(c(3),publish).
aEent(peter,c(3)).
InsT(c(a),papers).
obJecT(c(~),c(3)).
locatlon('Sclence',c(~)).
The discourse referent we introduce, for instance, for The noun phrase "a paper )' must allow the system to later access the constant which was created in The loEical representation To stand for this particular paper ("c(2)"), in The case we have To resolve a denotational anaphora.
But it must also permit that, in the case of descriptlonal anaphora, a copy of itself is made to serve as new discourse referent, used subsequently To create a new entry in the loEical representation (e.E.
"inst(c(h),papers)").
The discourse referent should furthermore carry informaTion about The Erammatlcal Eender and number of The underlyinE word, To further facilitate pronoun resolution (e.g.
"m*s" for "male and singular").
A discourse referent wlth sufficient information could have a Eeneral structure lime that: "dr(U,V,X,I,G÷N)".
"U" is The unique identifier of This discourse referent.
"V" is %he discourse variable created for each newly introduced discourse referent, which will Eet bound To the extension as soon as the entire sentence is Translated into HCL.
This term, which is common to discourse refemenrs and Horn Clauses created by Them, is directly accessible for denotational anaphora; it is, so to speak, The llnk from The discourse level into the lo~ical representation.
"G÷N" stand for tender and number.
In "I" we have To list Those elements of a sententlal component which are minimally required for denotaTional anaphora.
It turns out that These elements are all Those of the conditions on a discourse referent That can be represented as unary predicates (i.e.
mainly nouns, adjectives, and some intransitive verbs).
They form, ToEeTher, the intension of The phenomenon ~epresented by the discourse referent.
This woula suEEest The term "intensional anaphora" for what has been called "denorational anaphora" so far.
The "X", finally, Tells us which variable in the inTension corresponds to the discourse variable "V", and Thus The "X" and "I" toEether correspond To "lambda X.
(1)", applicable To "V".
For The noun phrase "a paper" this would Eive "dP(3,V,X, \[insT(X,papers)\],n÷s)".
The DRS for the entire example 17 Then looks llke That: \[\[dr(l,john,S,\[inst(S,humans)\],m+s), dr(2,nature,T,£inst(T,journals)\],n+s), dr(3,c(1),U,\[inst(U,papers)\],n+s)) dr(4,c(2),V,\[event(V,publish), agent(S,V),ob3ect(U,V), place(T,V),time(198&,V)\],n+s)\] dr(5, peter,W,\[inst(W,humans)\],m+s), dr(&,science, X,\[inst(X,3ournals)\],n+s), dr(7)c(3),Y,\[inst(Y,papers)\],n+s), dr(8,c(4),Z,\[event(Z,publish), agent(S,Z),object(Y,Z), place(X,Z),time(198&,Z)\],n+s)\] : 1,2,3,4,5,b,7,8 \] 2.
In The implementation we use constants such as 'tc(1)t' rather ~han "papeml", and expressions llke "Inst(_,papers)" rather Than )'paper(_)" The last llne Elves the overall loEical structure of the entire DRS and states here That all The conditions in the named discourse referents have to be entered 153 conjunctively into the loEical representation, as shown above.
This overall loEical structure is all that is left of the "condltlons"-part of traditional discourse referents, and most information oriEinally encoded in this "condltions"-part has been moved into the discourse referents.
This is closer to Helm's notation (for "file cards") than ¢o Kamp's.
A Kenerlc sentence will be translated into HCL rules, with variables.
"If a hunter spots a deer he will kill it" will become event(c(1, (H,D,W)),kill):inst (H, hunters), inst (D, deer ), event (W, spot), agent(H,W), object(D,W).
agent (H, c (1, (H,D,W)) ) :inst (H, hunters), inst (D, deer), event (W, spot), agent (H, W), object (D, W).
ob3ect (D, c (1, (H,D,W)) ) :inst (H, hunters), inst (D,deer), event (W, spot) v agent (H, W) ob3ect (D, W).
where the expression event "c(1.(H.D.W))" is a Skolem function (more commonly written as "sRI(H.D.W)").
In order ¢o Eet ¢hls lo¢ical representation we will have to Kenerate dlscou~se referents such as "dr(l.v(2).X.
\[InsZ(X. hunters)\]._+s)" for "a hunter*', where the discourse variable is bound ¢o "v(2)", the discourse level representation of an object level variable ("H".
"D". etc.).
The DRS for the entire sentence will be \[\[dr(1,v(1),R,\[inst(R,hunters)\], +s), dr(2, v(2), S, \[inst (S, deer) \], n+s ), dr(3, v(3),T, \[event (T, spot ), aEent(R,T),obSect(SoT)\],n+s), dr(~,v(~),U, \[event (U, Rill), obJect (v(2),v(~) ) \], n÷s) \] : 1.2,3 ---> #.
\] AEain the last llne outlines the loEical structure which is used to create the entries in the loEical representation.
5.2 Accessibility
Restrictions in Revised D_!scourse Representation Theory We noted above that classical DRT defines accessibility restrictions which rule out some perfectly leEitlmate examples, such as 15.
We think that the accessibility restrictions that really hold, are the result of interactions between the EenerIcness of the sentences involved, and the generlcness of a sentence is reflected (amonE other thlnEs) in the type of discourse referents it Eenerates.
Example i~ starts out with a ~eneric statement and suddenly switches over to a non-~enerlc statement whereas the acceptable examples 15 and 16 consist of two Eenerlc senfences.
It seems ¢o be this switch of Eenerlcness which makes the pronominal reference impossible in example la, and not the fact that we point into a quantified sentence, s But it is not necessary that the sentences concerned belonE to the same Eenericness cazeEorY.
The first of the followinE examples is unacceptable but the second and third examples are acceptable, despite mixed Eenerlcness: 23) * Whenever a farmer spots a donke~ he abuses it.
He is beating and kicking it right noN.
24) Whenever Pedro spots a donkey he abuses it.
He is beating and kicking one right noN.
25) There is a farmer beating and kicking a donkey.
I've seen him before.
Whenever he spots it he abuses it.
This asymmetry finds an explanation in the fact that non-Eenerlc sentences, such as the second sentence of example 23, (almost always) speak about individuals.
A pronoun in such a sentehce is therefore (in almost all cases) a denotational pronoun, trylnE to find an extensional value in an antecedent which could be used as its own denotation.
Hence we will have to make sure that a denotatlonal pronoun accepts only representations of individuals (of the form "c(X)") in the precedlnE sentence(s), and that a failure to find them must result in the entire discourse becomlnE unacceptable.
Thus the "he" and "it" in the second sentence of example 23 will try to find ~epresentations of individuals in the first sentence, but there are only representations of "stereotypes", i.e. meta-level names for object level variables (of the form "v(X)").
This makes denotatlonal anaphora impossible in this case.
3. Basically the same idea was developed by Bartsch 1979.
¢houEh not in the framework of DRT.
She says that pronouns such as those in 15 and 16 refer to stereotypes of objects rather than to the objects themselves.
However, we think she overstretches this idea by claimlnE that ordinary donkeysentences must be explained by means of stereotypes, also.
There are, after all, perfectly non-Eenerlc donkey-sentences, SUCh as "Every farmer who bOUEh¢ a donkey slauEhtered 154 The same Problem does not arise in example 2~.
Here we have an explicitly descrlptlonal pronoun ("one"), and it will not care about the type of value ~hat its antecedent has (i.e.
whether it is "c(X)" oP "v(X)'), as it will only use the antecedentts intension anyway.
Example 25, finally, is acceptable because Eenerlc sentences can talk about either individuals o__rr "stemeotypes".
AlthoUEh the third sentence ("Whenever he spots It he abuses it").
is Eeneric, the Pmonouns in it will first try to find denotations in their antecedents.
In this case, they will succeed: The first sentence of 25 is nonEenerlc and has, of course, created repPesentatlons of individuals (i.e.
"c(X)t'). Zf there had been no suitable extensional antecedents, the Pronouns would have started looklnE for intensional ones.
This was the case in examples 15 and 16.
In examples 19 to 22, finally, theme were actually extensional antecedent values, but praEmatlc considerations (i.e.
world knowledEe) forces the hearer in these cases to drop the (formally possible) denotatlonal anaphora in favour of (definite) descrlptional anaphora.
Just flndlnE intensional antecedents of descrlptlonal pronouns is, however, not enouEh: You have then to decide how much of the intension (often scattered over several discourse referents) has to be copied in the place of the pronoun.
But this is an other question altogether, often involvlnE inferences over world knowledEe, plausible reasoninE etc., which cannot be dealt with heme.
