This paper proposes an approximation, similar to the empirical approaches to PP attachment decision (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos, 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995).

The model below is similar to that in iCollins and Brooks, 1995).
W95-0103
Work In (Collins and Brooks, 1995) the back-off model is used to decide PP attachment given a tuple (v, nl,p, n2), where v is a verb, nl and n2 are nouns, and p a preposition such that the PP headed by p may be attached either to the verb phrase headed by v or to the NP headed by nx, and n: is the head of the NP governed by p.

The model presented in section 3.2 is similar to that in (Collins and Brooks, 1995), however, unlike (Collins and Brooks, 1995), who use examples from a treebank to train their model, the procedure described in this paper uses training data automatically obtained from sample text.

Its generality makes it applicable to other areas; the method has been used, for instance, to solve prepositional phrase attachment in (Collins and Brooks, 1995).
