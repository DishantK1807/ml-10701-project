For example, the memorybased learning algorithm ml-IG (Daelemans and Van den Bosch, 1992; Daclemans, Van den Bosch, and We~jters, 1997b), which extends the well-known ml algorithm (Aha, Kibler, and Albert, 1991) with an information-gain weighted similaxity mettic, has been demonstrated to perform adequately and, moreover, consistently and significantly better than eager-lea~'ning algorithms which do invest effort in abstraction during learning (e.g., decisiontree learning (Daelemans, Van den Bosch, and Weijters, 1997b; Quinlan, 1993), and connectionist learning (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams, 1986)) when trained and tested on a range of morphophonological tasks (e.g., morphological segmentation, grapheme-phoneme conversion, syllabitlcation, and word stress assignment) (Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux, 1994; Van den Bosch, Daelemans, and We~jters, 1996; Van den Bosch, 1997).
