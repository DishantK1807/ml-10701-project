Although the fact that the scoring algorithm is capable of assigning undeserved credit due to overly optimistic alignments is not unknown to the MUC community (see, for instance, Aberdeen et al.\[1995, 153, Table 4\] for a reference to "enthusiastic scoring mapping" for the Template Element task of MUC-6), we are unaware of any previous acknowledgement of, or similar example which demonstrates, the potential severity of the problem to the extent that Figure 4 does.

Definition The MUC-6 task was, roughly speaking, to identify information in business news that describes executives moving in and out of high-level positions within companies (Grishman and Sundheim 1995).

(Grishman and Sundheim 1995, 1-2) There have been seven MUCs, starting with MUC-1 in 1987, and ending with MUC-7 in 1997.

The results of an IE system (in this case, a slightly modified version of what SRI's FASTUS \[Appelt et al.1995\] extracted for this example) are shown in the righthand column.

These roles are well summarized by Chinchor and Dungca (1995), who refer specifically to the methods used for the U.S.-government-sponsored Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations of information extraction (IE) technology: The resulting scores \[assigned by the MUC evaluation process\] are used for decision-making over the entire evaluation cycle, including refinement of the task definition based on interannotator comparisons, technology development using training data, validating answer keys, and benchrnarking both system and human capabilities on the test data.

The metrics used--precision, recall, and F-score--are probably the most exhaustively used metrics for any natural language understanding application; precision and recall have been in use since MUC-2 in 1989 (Grishman and Sundheim 1995), and F-score since MUC-4 in 1992 (Hirschman 1998).
