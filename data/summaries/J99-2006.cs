This would force the f-structures of the surface realizations of a semantic representation ~' given by {q~ I ~' G ~ A 3w(Ac(w, ~))} to be included in a finite and computable set of structurally related f-structures {q~ I ~' _G q~ A I~I < kI~'I}Since the generation problem is decidable (Wedekind 1995), i.e., {w I At(w, ~)} = 0 is decidable for any given f-structure {b, and only a finite number of structurally related f-structures q~ has to be tested for {w I At(w, ~)} ---0, semantic-driven generation must be decidable.

We give a much simpler undecidability proof of the emptiness problem using a reduction to the emptiness problem of the intersection of arbitrary context-free languages, a reduction that Wedekind and Kaplan (1996) used to show the undecidability of ambiguity-preserving generation.

The undecidability of the generation problem in (3) was shown for definite clause grammars by Dymetman (1991), who reduced the problem to Hilbert's Tenth Prob* Institute for Natural Language Processing, University of Stuttgart, Azenbergstr.

Acknowledgments Ron Kaplan had the idea that the proof construction which we used in Wedekind and Kaplan (1996) might be useful for other purposes.
