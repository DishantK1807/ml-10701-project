113 advantages when compared to other lexical alignment methods found in the literature, such as: it does not need to be trained for a new pair of languages (as in Och and Ney (2000)) and neither does it require pre-processing steps to handle texts (as in G´omez Guinovart and Sacau Fontenla (2004)).

Alignment of words and multiword units plays an important role in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as example-based machine translation (EBMT) (Somers, 1999) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Ayan et al., 2004; Och and Ney, 2000), transfer rule learning (Carl, 2001; Menezes and Richardson, 2001), bilingual lexicography (G´omez Guinovart and Sacau Fontenla, 2004), and word sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992), among others.

The evaluation was run with respect to precision, recall, F-measure, and alignment error rate (AER) considering sure and probable alignments but not NULL ones (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
