Baldwin and Bond (2003) apply sophisticated preprocessing to derive a variety of countability clues, such as grammatical number of modifiers, co-occurrence of specific types of determiners and pronouns, and specific types of prepositions.

There has been clustering-based work in part-of-speech induction, but these tend to target idiosyncratic classes, such as capitalized words and words ending in ‘-ed’ (Clark, 2003).

work There has not been much work in the automatic determination of the preferred lexicalization part of speech, outside of work related to part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995), which concentrates on the Dataset Characteristics OpenCyc Cyc Instances 2607 30676 Classes 2 2 Entropy 0.76 0.90 Accuracy Figures OpenCyc Cyc Baseline 78.3 68.6 Just-headwords 87.5 89.3 Just-suﬃxes 78.3 71.9 Just-corpus 78.2 68.6 Just-terms 87.4 90.5 Combination 88.4 93.0 Table 4: Mass-count classification over Cyc lexical mappings.

Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2002) infer five types of countability distinctions using NT&T’s Japanese to English transfer dictionary, including the categories strongly countable, weakly countable, and plural only.

Toole (2000) applies decision trees to a similar problem, distinguishing common nouns, pronouns, and various types of names, using a framework analogous to that commonly applied in named-entity recognition.

In work closer to ours, Woods (2000) describes an approach to this problem using manually constructed rules incorporating syntactic, morphological, and semantic tests (via an ontology).
