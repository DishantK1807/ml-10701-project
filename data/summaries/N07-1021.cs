The first was an experiment with 9 subjects experienced in reading marine forecasts (Belz and Reiter, 2006), the second is a new experiment with 14 similarly experienced subjects3.

2 pCRU language generation pCRU (Belz, 2006) is a probabilistic language generation framework that was developed with the aim of providing the formal underpinnings for creating NLG systems that are driven by comprehensive probabilistic models of the entire generation space (including deep generation).

BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is a precision metric that assesses the quality of a translation in terms of the proportion of its word n-grams (n ≤ 4 has become standard) that it shares with several reference translations.

There is evidence that NIST correlates better with human judgments than BLEU (Doddington, 2002; Belz and Reiter, 2006).

There has also been a rethinking of the traditional modular NLG architecture (Reiter, 1994).

First, a simple chunker was run over the corpus to split wind statements 2For a fragment of the rule set, see Belz (2006).

Existing statistical NLG (i) uses corpus statistics to inform heuristic decisions in what is otherwise symbolic generation (Varges and Mellish, 2001; White, 2004; Paiva and Evans, 2005); (ii) applies n-gram models to select the overall most likely realisation after generation (HALOGEN family); or (iii) reuses an existing parsing grammar or treebank for surface realisation (Velldal et al., 2004; Cahill and van Genabith, 2006).

The base generator that was used in previous experiments (Belz, 2005) encoded a less structured generation space and the set of concepts it used were less fine-grained (e.g.

pCRU uses existing techniques (Belz, 2005), but extends these substantially.

3.4.1 Evaluation methods The two automatic metrics used in the evaluations, NIST and BLEU have been shown to correlate highly with expert judgments (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.82 and 0.79 respectively) in this domain (Belz and Reiter, 2006).

Precursors to current approaches were Hovy’s PAULINE which kept track of the satisfaction status of global ‘rhetorical goals’ (Hovy, 1988), and Power et al.’s ICONOCLAST which allowed users to fine-tune different combinations of global constraints (Power, 2000).
