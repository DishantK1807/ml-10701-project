Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.

A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).
