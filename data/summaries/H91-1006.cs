(Kay, 1984:75) is, in my view, correct.

also Carlson & Vilkuna, 1990 and Zajac, 1989); its advantages are the well understood formal aspects and the declarative nature of the rule schema for a given implementation.

examples of basing MT on state of the art CL methods and theories include the use of situation schemata as the basis for translation Rupp (1989), defining transfer over 'quasi logical forms' developed at SRI, Cambridge (Alshawi et al., 1991) and derivation trees of a Montague style (Landsbergen, 1987 & Appelo, et al., 1989).
E89-1041
The interest in developing authoring systems (i.e., systems where an individual writes a text in the source language with a 'guarantee' that the translation will be correct) is an attempt to assure that the analysis of the text is not ambiguous and does have a translation (McGee Wood & Chandler, 1988).

One proposal addressing (4) explicitly is to include expert system modules in addition to linguistic rules (Boitet & Gerber, 1984) or to divide the system into expert tasks (Johnson & Whitelock, 1985).
P84-1100
One exception is the DLT project which uses Esperanto as a pseudo interlingua (Witkam, 1988); a choice of representation which has "aroused a lot of skepticism" in the community (op cit., p.756).
C88-2154
Current work concentrates on constraining the transfer mechanism within a well defined computational model, e.g., transfer rules are defined between feature structures and the mechanism is based on unification (cL van Noord, et al., 1990, Russell et al., 1991 and Wedekind, 1988).

A somewhat related project, which plans to make use of structured texts and their translations is the BSO Bilingual Knowledge Bank system (Sadler & Vendelrnans, 1990).
C90-3101
Interaction may be limited to the monolingual component where questions are only asked about the source text (Whitelock et al., 1986).
C86-1077
Though numerous individual efforts have been undertaken (King & Falkedal, 1990), the results of this work often remain private.

These are explicit levels and a transfer mechanism allows a mapping between them (Arnold, 1987, Bech& Nygaard, 1988).
C88-1008
One project in Stuttgart has been exploring the use of an extended LFG representation as the basis for translation (of, Kaplan et al.(1989), also Sadler et al., 1990) whereas a project in Berlin, has taken GPSG syntactic representations as the starting point for adding additional levels (Busemarm & Hauenschild, 1988).
C90-3101 E89-1037
Instead of building an MT system based solely on a corpus and its translation, as reported on in Brown, et al.(1988), 4 emphasis in Europe has been on developing tools to navigate through texts as an aid for the linguist or lexicographer working on the problem of characterizing the context for the translation of words (cf.
