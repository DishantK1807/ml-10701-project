Previous work has identified the breaks between concatenated texts to evaluate the performance of text segmentation algorithms (Reynar, 1994; Stairmand, 1997).
P94-1050
It was reported that the lexical chains closely correlated to the intentional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the texts, where the start and end of chains coincided with the intention ranges.
J86-3001
An error margin of two sentences either side of a segmentation point was used by Hearst (1993) and Reynar (1994) allowed three sentences.
P94-1050
Lexical cohesion relations (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) between words were identified in RT and used to construct lexical chains of related words in five texts (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
J91-1002
Reynar (1994) compared all words across a text rather than the more usual nearest neighbours.
P94-1050
Related words have been located using spreading activation on a semantic network (Kozima, 1993), although only one text was segmented.
P93-1041
These metrics have tended to be adopted for the assessment of text segmentation algorithms, but they do not provide a scale of correctness (Beeferman et al., 1997).

Collocation: Collocations were extracted from a seven million word sample of the Longman English Language Corpus using the association ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990) and outputted to a lexicon.
