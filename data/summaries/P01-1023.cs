Pattern discovery techniques are often used for information extraction (e.g., (Riloff, 1993; Fisher et al., 1995)), but most work uses data that contains patterns labelled with the semantic slot the pattern fills.

Some researchers rely on generic planners (e.g., (Dale, 1988)) for this task, while others use plans based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (e.g., (Bouayad-Aga et al., 2000; Moore and Paris, 1993; Hovy, 1993)) or schemas (e.g., (McKeown, 1985; McKeown et al., 1997)).

Alignments are widely used in MT, for example (Melamed, 1997), but the crossing problem is a phenomenon that occurs repeatedly and at many levels in our task and thus, this is not a suitable approach for us.

Other stochastic approaches to NLG normally focus on the problem of sentence generation, including syntactic and lexical realization (e.g., (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995)).

Concurrent work analyzing constraints on ordering of sentences in summarization found that a coherence constraint that ensures that blocks of sentences on the same topic tend to occur together (Barzilay et al., 2001).
