We integrated ChaSen (Asahara & Matsumoto 2000), a tool that provides word segmentation as well as POS tags and morphological information such as verbal inflection.

While couched within the same general framework (HPSG), our approach differs from that of Kanayama et al (2000).

3 3 Kanayama et al.(2000) use a similar mechanism for most words.

We also use the ChaSen tokenizer and POS tagger (Asahara & Matsumoto 2000).

Stochastic disambiguation methods being developed for the ERG by the Redwoods project at Stanford University (Oepen et al.2002) should be applicable to this grammar as well.

The grammar is couched in the theoretical framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard & Sag 1994), with semantic representations in Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al.2001). HPSG is well suited to the task of multilingual development of broad coverage grammars: It is flexible enough (analyses can be shared across languages but also tailored as necessary), and has a rich theoretical literature from which to draw analyzes and inspiration.
