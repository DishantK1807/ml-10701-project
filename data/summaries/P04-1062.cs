Brown et al.(1990) gradually increased learning difficulty using a series of increasingly complex models for machine translation.

6Similar results were found by Elworthy (1994).

But for other tasks, such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), the chief merit of unlabeled data is simply that nothing else is available; unsupervised parameter estimation is notorious for achieving mediocre results.

The third line corresponds to the setup reported by Klein and Manning (2002).

DA provides a very natural way to gradually introduce complexity to clustering models (Rose et al., 1990; Pereira et al., 1993).

Some tasks can thrive on a nearly pure diet of unlabeled data (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2003).

The authors thank Shankar Kumar, Charles Schafer, David Smith, and Roy Tromble for helpful comments and discussions; three ACL reviewers for advice that improved the paper; Eric Goldlust for keeping the Dyna compiler (Eisner et al., 2004) up to date with the demands made by this work; and Dan Klein for sharing details of his CCM implementation.

An excellent recent result is by Klein and Manning (2002).

7). Moreover, maximizing likelihood is not equivalent to maximizing task-defined accuracy (e.g., Merialdo, 1994).

This experiment is inspired by the experiments in Merialdo (1994).

Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) used DA for soft hierarchical clustering of English nouns, based on the verbs that select them as direct objects.
