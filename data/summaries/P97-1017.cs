However, very little computational work has been done in this area; (Yamron et al., 1994) briefly mentions a patternmatching approach, while (Arbabi et al., 1994) discuss a hybrid neural-net/expert-system approach to (forward) transliteration.

P(olk) Following (Pereira et al., 1994; Pereira and Riley, I996), we implement P(w) in a weighted finite-state aceeptor (WFSA) and we implement the other distributions in weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs).
