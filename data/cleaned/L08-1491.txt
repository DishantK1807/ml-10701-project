These terms degrade the performance of NLP applications based on UMLS (Aronson, 2005). We filter out such terms, prior to importing into Termino. For example, we reject long terms (&gt; 5 words) and terms containing certain constructs that mark them as class names. The full set of rejec</context>

<context>estion is, however, pertinent to any technical domain. Dictionary lookup in the biomedical domain is especially prone to problems of ambiguity. This has been noted for gene names (Proux et al., 1998; Hirschman et al., 2002), but is also true for clinical text. Large numbers of abbreviations are used, and these are often ambiguous with short words in general language. For example, many one and two character words are ab</context>

It is equivalent to scoring one annotator against the other using the F1 metric (Hripcsak and Rothschild, 2005). Note that the measure compares two human annotators. As the system is trained on a third consensus annotation, the IAA does not give an upper bound on performance. It is possible for the system to </context>
