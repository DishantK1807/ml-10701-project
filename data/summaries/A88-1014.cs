used for baptism (baptistery PART church) agglutinate 2 1 vt to cause to adhere (agglutinate v-v-CAUSE adhere) Computational study of dictionary definitions has focused heavily on taxonomy because it can often be identified fairly reliably without parsing the definitions (Amsler 1980, Chodorow et al.1985). Our emphasis in identifying relations, whether for information retrieval or for other purposes, has been on relations other than taxonomy (Evens et al.1987). An important tool for identifying relations is the phrase count.

4. Constructing the semantic network The SNePS semantic network system (Shapiro 1979b) is one of relatively few knowledge representation schemes that permit a unified representation of associative information and predicate-logic-style inference (for details on the logic, see Shapiro 1979a and Hull 1986) enhanced with default reasoning capability (Nutter 1983).

Thus the first step in adding relations to out lexical database was to extract the 45,910 synonymy relationships marked explicitly in this way using the UNIX awk utility and insert them in a table of word-relation-word triples (Ahlswede 1985).
