Despite this simplification, Na¨ıve Bayes classifiers were shown to perform surprisingly well on text classification (Joachims, 1997), (Schneider, 2004).

In order to model this recursive relation we use a graph-based ranking algorithm, namely the PageRank randomwalk algorithms (Brin and Page, 1998), and its TextRank adaption to text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

While there are several graph-based ranking algorithms previously proposed in the literature (Herings et al., 2001), we focus on only one such algorithm, namely PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), as it was previously found successful in a number of applications, including Web link analysis (Brin and Page, 1998), social networks (Dom et al., 2003), citation analysis, and more recently in several text processing applications (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), (Erkan and Radev, 2004).
