A simple linear backward search of all preceding centering structures, e.g., may not only turn out to establish illegal references but also contradicts the cognitive principles underlying the limited attention constraint (Walker, 1996b).

Note that common centering algorithms (e.g., the one by Brennan et al.(1987)) are specified only for the resolution of anaphors in Ui-1.

Hence block (1) applies (the occurrence of "1260" in CI(U5 ) is due to the assumptions specified by Strube & Hahn (1996)).
P96-1036
Passonneau (1996) proposes an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions and Walker (1996a) integrates centering into a cache model of attentional state.

The centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) has evolved as a major methodology for computational discourse analysis.

the discussion in Grosz et al.(1995)). However, work establishing an explicit account of how both can be joined in a computational model has not been done so far.

The proposed extension of the centering model builds on the methodological framework of functional centering (Strube & Hahn, 1996).
P96-1036
Suri & McCoy (1994)) mirrors an increase in explanatory constructs that we consider a methodological drawback to this approach because they can hardly be kept control of.

The vast majority of these phenomena can be considered informationally redundant utterances in the terminology of Walker (1996b) for which we currently have no solution at all.

technical product reviews, newspaper articles and literary narratives), we currently do not account for spoken monologues as modelled, e.g., by Passonneau & Litman (1993) or even the intricacies of dyadic conversations Ros6 et al.(1995) deal with.

The categories Cy(s, Ui-1) in Tables 12 and 13 contain more elements than the categories Ui-1 in Tables 10 and 11, respectively, due to the mediating property of textual ellipses in functional centering (Strube & Hahn, 1996).

Table h Transition Types As a working hypothesis, for the purposes of anaphora resolution we subscribe to Walker's model, in particular to that part which casts doubt on the hypothesized dependency of the attentional from the intentional structure of discourse (Grosz & Sidner, 1986, p.

The methodological basis of these studies are lexical cohesion indicators (Morris & Hirst, 1991) combined with word-level co-occurrence statistics.

This finding precludes a reliable prediction of segment boundaries based on the occurrence of 1 Our notion of referential discourse segment should not be confounded with the intentional one originating from Grosz & Sidner (1986), for reasons discussed in Section 2.
J86-3001
The relation between our centered segmentation algorithm and Walker's (1996a) integration of centering into the cache model can be viewed from two different angles.
J96-2005
Strube & Hahn (1996) use the centering data structures to redefine Dane~'s trichotomy between given information, theme and rheme in terms of the centering model.
P96-1036
Text segmentation procedures (more with an information retrieval motivation, rather than being related to reference resolution tasks) have also been proposed for a coarse-grained partitioning of texts into contiguous, nonoverlapping blocks and assigning content labels to these blocks (Hearst, 1994).
P94-1002
A recent attempt at introducing global discourse notions into the centering framework considers the use of a cache model (Walker, 1996b).

180). We diverge from Walker (1996a), however, in that we propose an alternative to the caching mechanism, which we consider to be methodologically more parsimonious and, at least, to be equally effective (for an elaboration of this claim, cf.

The second column contains the centering data as computed by functional centering (Strube & Hahn, 1996).
P96-1036
Finally, many studies on discourse segmentation highlight the role of cue words for signaling segment boundaries (cf., e.g., the discussion in Passonneau & Litman (1993)).
P93-1020
Both studies, among other things, deal with the supposition whether a correlation exists between particular centering transitions (which were first introduced by Brennan et al.(1987); cf.
