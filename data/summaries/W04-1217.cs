We fully parsed the training and testing data using the Stanford Parser of (Klein and Manning, 2003) operating on the TnT part-of-speech tagging â€“ we believe that the unlexicalized nature of this parser makes it a particularly suitable statistical parser to use when there is a large domain mismatch between the training material (Wall Street Journal text) and the target domain, but have not yet carefully evaluated this.

A number of NER systems have made effective use of how the same token was tagged in different parts of the same document (see (Curran and Clark, 2003) and (Mikheev et al., 1999)).

We also incorporated part-ofspeech tagging, using the TnT tagger(Brants, 2000) retrained on the GENIA corpus gold standard partof-speech tagging.

Description Our system is a Maximum Entropy Markov Model, which further develops a system earlier used for the CoNLL 2003 shared task (Klein et al., 2003) and the 2004 BioCreative critical assessment of information extraction systems, a task that involved identifying gene and protein name mentions but not distinguishing between them (Dingare et al., 2004).
