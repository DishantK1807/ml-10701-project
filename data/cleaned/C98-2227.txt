1 Introduction

In natural language processing, many methods 
hay(" been proposed to solw~ the alnbiguity prob
lems(Nagao and Maruyama, 1992). One of those 
technique uses interactions with users, because it. is 
dilticult to make all the knowledge for disambigua
lion beforehand. That technique is classitied into 
two l.ypes according to i.he conditkm of executing 
user interaction. One type(TypeA) is that the dis
anfl)iguation system executes interactions{ Hlanchon 
et al., 1995), (1Vla.rttyanm and V~Zatanabe, 1990), 
(Yamaguehi et al., 1995). Another type(TypeB) is 
that users executes interactiolls(D.Brawn and Niren
burg, 1990), (Muraki et al., 1994). In this paper, Ty
l)eA will be adopted 1.inca.use Typel3 gives users more 
trouble than TypeA does. For example, in TypeB, 
a user may have to find where is wrongly analyzed 
in inl)ut sentences. 
In TypeA, the two following conditions must be 
determined: (1) when should interactive disam
biguation be executed? (2) which aml.)iguous words 
should be disalnbigual.ed when more than one a.lll
biguous word exist in a. sentence? Considering the 
accuracy of the analyzed result, they should be de
cided by both the accuracy of the interactive dis
ambiguation and that of the autonlatic ¢lisambigua
tion. The traditional methods did not considered 
the accuracy of the interactive disambiguation. For 
instance, the accuracy of the analyzed result may 
decrease in spite of execuling lhe user interaction 
if the accuracy of the interactive disalnbiguation is 
lOW. 
In this l)al)er, we l)ropose lhe method to com
bine the intera('liw~ disalnbigualion and the aulo
marie one, considering each accuracy. The melhod 
allows the disambiguation system to maximize Iho 
accuracy of the analyzed resull. This paper focuses 
on the ambiguity caused by ambiguous words that

precondilions for disambiguation. In Section 3, we 
describe 1,he condition of executing the inleracl.ive 
disambiguation. Section .t shows the procedure thai 
decides the order of disaluhiguation. The lwrfor 
mance of the method is discussed by the resull of 
the simulation under assmuing the both accuracy 
of the interactive disambigual.ion and lhe aulomatic 
Olle. 
2 Preconditions
for Disambiguatlon 
This section describes preconditions for disatnbigua
tion and methods of the disaml)iguation. 
In this lm.l)er, the disamlIiguation for ambiguous 
words llleans that all ambiguous ones in an illpU1 
sentence are disambiguated, l)escribing il. fornlally, 
the disambiguation is to decide one elemenl of the 
following kl S. 
\]ll,S" = \]lit x \]ll~ x ... x kit, 
where an input sentence conl.ains / ambiguous 
words. Mi means the set of meanings in the alll
biguous word wi. 
Each disambiguation method has preconditions as 
\[bllows: 
Interactive Disambiguation 
• In the interaction, the sysl.em shows explana
tions for each meaning of an ambiguous word to 
a ilser, who selects o11o exl)lallal.iol\] fi'om them. 
1423 
• 'File system can calculate the prol)ability where 
a user selects the right explanation. 
Automatic Disambiguation 
• Tile occurrence probabilities for each candidate 
can be calculated for preference. 
• Tile result is the candidate with the nm.ximum 
occurrence probability. 
To show the information mentioned above, candi
dates are expressed by the tree in Figure 1. This tree 
is an example ill tile cane that an input sentence is "\] 
saw a star.", which contains two ambiguous words 
'see' and 'star' and each word has two nleanings.

Figure 1: An example of the tree of candidates 
The depth of the tree exl)resses the order of din
ambiguation. In Figure 1, the ambiguities are re
solw~d in the order fl'om 'see' t.o 'star'. The occur
rence probability is calculated at. each leaf node by 
lhe automatic disambigual.ion method. For exam
ple, Ptl expresses the probability for lhe candidate 
{see_l, star_l}. Furthermore, the accuracy of in
teraction is also calculated at the leaf node by the 
interactive disanlbiguation method. Paul is the prob
ability where the meaning of 'star' is 'star_l' and 
the system shows explanations of 'star_l', 'star_2' 
for 'star' to a user and (s)he selects the explanation 
of 'star_2'. At Nodes besides leaf ones, only the 
accuracy of interaction is calculated. 
3 The
Condition of Executing the 
Interactive Disambiguation 
a.1 Basic Idea 
At each node besides leaf ones, the disambigua
tion system decides which disambiguation method 
is used. Basically, tile interactive disambiguation is 
executed when its accuracy is higher than the ac
curacy of the automatic disambiguation. First of 
all, let us consider the case where an input sentence 
contains one ambiguous word that has n meanings. 
Figure 2 shows the tree of candidates for this case. 
Phm" "~ E PdiPi 
i 
I 
Tlle interactive disambiguation is executed, when 
the following condition is satisfied. 
Pml,. > t{,mo 
C, onsidering the condition more carefully, the ac
curacy of the interactive disand)iguation is influ
enced by the explanations that are shown to users. 
Thus the accuracy may be improved l)y lilniting to 
show SO, lie explanations to users. For ('xaml)h', thin 
may be caused when the accuracy of roll is very low 
and a user may select rail wrongly I:)y the higher 
similarity of the explanation ff/r roll to olher expla
nations. Tile a,,tOlilatic disambigualion ('orresl)Ol, tls 
to showing only one explanation Io users in the in
teractive disamlliguation. Therefore lhe condi|ion 
of executing the interactive disambiguation can be 
defined as the exceptional case of the limilai.ion. 
3.2 The
A('('uracy at a Node 
hi the case that the number of ambiguous words is 
one as f'igure 2, the accuracy of the deeper nodes be
low the root node needs not to be decided because 
they are leaf nodes. When more than two ambiguous 
words exist in an input sentence, a ,,ode may ofl.en 
have one that is ,lot. a leaf one. To calculate the ac
curacy of such a node, it is necessary to deternline 
what kind of disambiguation will be executed at the 
deeper nodes. For instance, the disambiguation sys
tem has to fix each accuracy of node 'see_l' and 
'see_2' in Figure 1 to calculate the accuracy of the 
root node. Therefore, tile definition of the accuracy 
at ally node i is tile recursive one. 'file accuracy of 
the interactive disambiguation Pint,-(/) and that of 
the automatic disambiguation P~uto(i) at node i is 
defined as follows: 
1424 
/ant,,(/) = ~ pd(mlM ) x P,.(m) (1) 
m E M 
P,.~o(i) = m~x(p,.(.~)) (2) 
m E lilt 
where M is the set of tile node directly under node 
i, Patrol214 ) is the accuracy of the interactive disam
biguation at. node m, that is, the probability that a 
user selects m provided that the system shows ex
plana.tions for all the elements of 21I to hina(her). 
f\].(m.) is the accuracy at node m and the definition 
is as follows: 
l',.m.( ,,,, ) 
(if the interactive disambiguation is 
executed at node m) 
l;.(m) = I~mo(m) 
(if the automatic disambigua.tion is ex
ecuted at. node m) 
poc~u,.(m) (if m is a leaf node) 
where Poc~m.(m) is the occurrence l)rol)ability of 
the candidate that includes nodes between the root. 
node and llodc' N'I. 
When the following condition is sat islied, the in
teractive disambiguation is executed at. node i. 
Pintr(i) > /~,ut.o(i) (3) 
3.3 The
Limitation of Explanations 
In user interaction, the presentation of many expla~ 
nations gives users trouMe t.o select one explanation. 
So it, is desirable that the disalnbiguation system 
shows fewer explanation to users, if possible. In this 
sect.ion, we describe the condition where the number 
of explanations is limited without losing the accu
racy of the analyzed result. 
hly formula (1), the accuracy of the interactiw" 
disambiguation t int~.r in the case of lirniting the set 
of explanations M' is detined as follows: 
{ max E pd(m\[M M')P,,(m) M' 
mEM-M' 
P,'ntr(i) = if IM M' I > 1 
P,.(t) if la.t m'l -:~ 
If formula (4) is satistied, the set. of the explana
tion M' is not shown to users in the interaction at. 
node i. 
P~,,~,.(O < P,',,,,.(O (4) 
Furthermore, if IMM'I = 1, then the atfl.omatic 
disambiguation is execut.ed at. node i. Therefore, 
formula (4) ilnplies formula (.3). 
4 Determination
of the Order of 
Disambiguation 
4.1 Procedure

Up to here, we \[lave discussed Pintr and Pat, to under 
a. certain order of disambiguation. In this section, 
we describe a procedure to decide the order of dis
ambiguation where the accuracy is maxinmnl. 
The accuracy of the analyzed result, may be differ
ent ill each order of disalnbiguation. This is tile rea
son that the disambiguation of one alnbiguous word 
leads t,o constrain the nleaning of other a.nfl)iguous 
ones. Therefore, the contents of the interaction may 
differ fi'om each order of disambiguation. The of 
der with the maximum accuracy is obtained in the 
following procedure: 
1. (!alculating each occurrence probability of can
didate for the analyzed result by the automatic 
disambiguatioll method. 
2. Obtaining the accuracy in each order of disam
biguat.ion based on the method described in t.ho 
previous sections. 
3. l)isambiguating by the order with t.he lnaxinml-n 
accuracy. 
4.2 Example

In this section, we illustrale the del.ermination of ex
ecuting l he int.eraclive disambigualioll and the order 
of disambiguation. The values at. leaf nodes are the 
occurrence probabilities. The accuracy of the inter
active disambiguation is 0.9 at. the any nodes. Since 
the number of alnhiguous words is two, the 1111111
bet of the order of disambiguation is 2! as shown in 
Figure 3, ,'t.

Figure 3: An example of tile order of disambigua
tiou(l) 
To begin with, we intend to calculate what kind 
of disamlfiguation is executed at, node 'staLl' 
and 'star_T, m Figure 3. By fornnfla (1), (2), 
P,:,,t,.(see_t) and P,,,,to(see-1) are as follows (since 
both ambiguous words haw' two meanings, Pi',,,.(i) 
= 1'..,,o(i)): 
1425 
root

Figure 4: An example of the order of disambigua

Pi,m.(see_l) = 0.9 x (0.75 -40.05) 
= 0.72 
Pauto(see-1) = max(0.75,0.05) 
= 0.75 
Because of t}.t,.(see_l) < Pa.to(see-1), the au
tomatic disambiguation is executed at node see_l. 
On the other hand, at node see_2, P/,,~,.(see_2) and 
P(,..,(see_2) are as follows: 
l~i,,..(see_2) = 0.18 
Pa.~o(see-2) = 0.10 
/~.¢,.(see_2) > /)a,,..(see_2) is satisfied. .%) the 
system interacts with users at this node. 
By tho resull of the above, Pi,~r,,(rool) and 
tX,,,to(rool) are as follows: 
t'i,,..(root) = 0.9(1),,(see_l) + P,.(see_2)) 
= 0.9(l~,,to(see_l) + Pi,,t,.(see_2)) 
= 0.9(0.75 + 0.18) = 0.837 
l~,,o(rool) = max(P,.(see_l), P,.(see_2)) 
= max(0.75,0.18) = 0.75 
Therefore, tile interactive disambiguat.ion is ex
ecuted at. the root. node because of t{.,t,.(rool) > 
l~,,o(rOol), and P,.(rool) = 0.837. 
Next, let. us explain the case of Figure 4. Cal
culatillg the same way as Figure 3, the interactive 
disambiguation is executed in any node besides leaf 
ones, and 1},t,.(root), P~,ao(rOot) are as follows: 
Pi,,t,,(root) = 0.9(P~.(sl;ar_l) + P,,(star_2)) 
= 0.9(Pi,~t,,(sta:r_l) + Ph, t,.(star-2)) 
= 0.9(0.765 + 0.135) = 0.81 
P~u¢o(,'ool) = max(P,.(star_l), P,,(star_2)) 
= max(0.10,0.75) = 0.75 
Therefore, Pi,~t,.(root) > P~,,,¢o(root), and 
P,.(root) becomes 0.81. Comparing with P,.(root) 
of each order, P,.(root) of Figure 3 is greater than 
that of Figure 4. Thus the system interacts with 
users against 'see' in the tirst place. 
5 Experiments

We applied the proposed method(al)breviated as 
MP) to tile disambiguation of trees of candidates 
that are made for experiments, and compared it with 
the method (abbreviated as MA) that executes in
teraction in all uodes. 
We set the following l)roperties to the tree of can
didates. 
• the number of ambiguous words included in an 
input Selltellce 
• the number of nwanings in an ambiguous word 
• the occurrenco l)robal)ility of candidates 
To assign an occurrence probability t.o each can
didate, a random value is given to each candidate 
abow~ all, and each value is divided by the SUln of 
values given to all candidates. 
Figure 5, 6 show the accuracy at the roo! node 
aud th(" number of int(q:acl.ion, resl)ectively. In lhes(' 
figllres, a mark "+' indicates rosulls of MP. Each of 
them is the aw'rage of 300 trees. A mark '*'indicates 
resulls of MA. Because MA does not pres('rilw the 
ordor of disambigualion, the rosult of each tree is 
the average of all the orders.

6.2 The. Number of hiteraction 
The number of ilatera.ction may increase on the con
dition that the accuracy of the analyzed result is 
maxirriized, In this section, the degree of the in
crease will be estimated by coml)aring the number 
of interaction of MP with that of MA. For this 
l)urpose, 'RII' is defined as follows: 
1HI= ~b' n~ 
"l I Iv 
where lip, na is the number of interaction by MP 
and MA resl)ectively, n~,, is the nunlber of ambigu
otis words in an input sentence. RIl represents the 
ratio of the increase in the number of interaction por 
alnbiguous word. 'Fable l(the line of qnt, eraction') 
shows the lnininnun, lllaxillltllll, and average of RII. 
To reduce the lnunl)er of ini.(,racl.ion, t.he auto
