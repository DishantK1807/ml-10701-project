Up to the present, studies on natural language interaction with computers generally highlight the frequency of this phenomenon, (see, for example, \[Eastman and McLean, 1981\]).

For this reason, ellipsis has received much attention and different solutions have been proposed based on the mechanism used to analyze the sentence: semantic grammars (the LIFER/LADDER system \[Hendrix, 1977\]), ATN \[Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981, Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1982\], or caseframe instantiation (the XCALIBUR system \[Carbonell et al., 1983\]).

t For both problems the solution is based on a strategy that uses the information contained in the structures produced by the parser (as is the case in almost all the work mentioned in this introduction; for a pragmatics-based approach to ellipsis, see \[Carberry, 1989\]).

The 80's have seen renewed computational interest in coordination that has brought new efforts (see \[Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981\], \[Dahl and McCord, 1983\], \[Fong and Berwick, 1985\], \[Lesmo and Torasso, 1985\], \[Kosy, 1986\] and \[Proudian and Goddeau, 1987\]).

Substitution of some constituents of the preceding sentence is foreseen with the recognized constituents 1 Always in the area of chart-based parsin 8 see \[Mellish, 1989\], who, however, deals with other problems of illformedness, i.e. the presence of unknown words and of spurious constituents.

Even in the most purely linguistic area, coordination has not received in-depth treatment, if not recently (for example, see \[Sag et al., 1984\] and \[Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988\]).

Both the solutions proposed have been inserted into WEDNESDAY 2 \[Stock, 1989\], a chart-based parser used in a dialogue system for Italian; attention has been paid to distinctive aspects of this language (for example, the relative liberty of order inside a single constituent).
