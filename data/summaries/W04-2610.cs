We have compared the performance of SVM with three other learning algorithms: (1) semantic scattering (Moldovan et al.2004), (2) decision trees (a C4.5 implementation), and (3) Naive Bayes.

The list of 35 semantic relations was presented in (Moldovan et al.2004). The percentages represent the number of examples that encode a semantic relation for a particular pattern.

work on the discovery of semantic relations The development of large semantically annotated corpora, such as Penn Treebank2 and, more recently, PropBank (Kingsbury, et al.2002), as well as semantic knowledge bases, such as FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), have stimulated a high interest in the automatic acquisition of semantic relations, and especially of semantic roles.

The annotation of each example consisted of specifying its feature vector and the most appropriate semantic relation as defined in (Moldovan et al.2004). Inter-annotator Agreement The annotators, four PhD students in Computational Semantics worked in groups of two, each group focusing on one half of the corpus to annotate.

We considered as baseline semantic scattering which is a new learning model (Moldovan et al.2004) developed in-house for the semantic classification of nounnoun pairs in NP constructions.

Prior to the discovery of semantic relations, the text is syntactically parsed with Charniakâ€™s parser (Charniak 2001) and words are semantically disambiguated and mapped into their appropriate WordNet senses.

In the last few years, many researchers (Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), (Gildea and Palmer 2002), (Pradhan et al.2003) have focused on the automatic prediction of semantic roles using statistical techniques.

It also provides a mapping from the FrameNet deep semantic roles to general thematic roles (list defined in (Moldovan et al.2004)), and use cases for VerbNet.

ComLex (Grishman et al.1994) is a computational lexicon providing syntactic information for more than 38,000 English headwords.
