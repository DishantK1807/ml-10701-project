A year later (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) published a supervised approach to the PP attachment problem.

The difference in noun attachments between these two sets is striking, but (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) do not discuss this (and we also do not have an explanation for this).

And (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) reported on 80% attachment accuracy, an improvement of 13% over the baseline (i.e.
J93-1005
Neither (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) with 67% nor (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) with 59% noun attachment were anywhere close to this figure.
H94-1048 J93-1005
But it makes obvious that (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) were tackling a problem different from (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) given the fact that their baseline was at 59% guessing noun attachment (rather than 67% in the Hindle and Rooth experiments).3 Of course, the baseline is not a direct indicator of the difficulty of the disambiguation task.
H94-1048 J93-1005
(Ratnaparkhi, 1998) first assumes noun attachment for all of-PPs and then applies his disambiguation methods to all remaining PPs.

The seminal paper by (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) started a sequence of studies for English.

We investigated similar methods for German (Volk, 2001; Volk, 2002).

But have they solved the same problem as (Hindle and Rooth, 1993)?

5See (Merlo et al., 1997) for a discussion of these cases and an approach in automatically disambiguating them.

(Hindle and Rooth, 1993) did not have access to a large treebank.
J93-1005
for English We used sections 0 to 12 of the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) with a total of 24,618 sentences for our experiments.
J93-2004
The latter tuple set has been reused by subsequent research, so let us focus on this one.2 (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) used 20,801 tuples for training and 3097 tuples for evaluation.

3It should be noted that important subsequent research, e.g. by (Collins and Brooks, 1995; Stetina and Nagao, 1997), used the Ratnaparkhi data sets and thus allowed for good comparability.
