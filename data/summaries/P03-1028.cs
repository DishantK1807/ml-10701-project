They include sentence segmentation (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), part-ofspeech tagging (Charniak et al., 1993), named entity recognition (Chieu and Ng, 2002b), full parsing (Collins, 1999), and coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001).

The one notable exception is the work of UMass at MUC-6 (Fisher et al., 1995).

They are automatically derived based on the correlation metric value used in (Chieu and Ng, 2002a).

Several benchmark data sets have been used to evaluate IE approaches on semistructured texts (Soderland, 1999; Ciravegna, 2001; Chieu and Ng, 2002a).

To give an idea of the informative features used in the classifier of a slot, we rank the features used for a slot classifier according to their correlation metric values (Chieu and Ng, 2002a), where informative features are ranked higher.

More recently, machine learning approaches have been used for IE from semi-structured texts (Califf and Mooney, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Roth and Yih, 2001; Ciravegna, 2001; Chieu and Ng, 2002a), named entity extraction (Chieu and Ng, 2002b), template element extraction, and template relation extraction (Miller et al., 1998).

Soderland (1999) and Chieu and Ng (2002a) attempted machine learning approaches for a scaled-down version of the ST task, where it was assumed that the information needed to fill one template came from one sentence only.

Although the best MUC-4 participating systems, GE/GE-CMU, still outperform ALICE-ME, it must be noted that for GE, “10 1/2 person months” were spent on MUC-4 using the GE NLTOOLSET, after spending “15 person months” on MUC-3 (Rau et al., 1992).
M92-1008
The task we tackle is considerably more complex than that of (Soderland, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002a), since we need to deal with merging information from multiple sentences to fill one template.

In particular, we traverse the full parse tree to determine the verbs, agents, patients, and indirect objects related to a noun phrase candidate a0a5a1 . While a machine learning approach is used in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) to determine general semantic roles, we used a simple rule-based traversal of the parse tree instead, which could also reliably determine the generic agent and patient role of a sentence, and this suffices for our current purpose.
