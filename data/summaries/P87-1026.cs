Knowledge representation in FLUSH is uses Ace \[Jacobs and Rau, 1984, Jacobs, 1985a\], a hierarchical knowledge representation framework based on structured inheritance.

The idea of a linguistic hierarchy is not novel, having roots in both linguistics \[Lockwood, 1972, Halliday, 1978\] and Artificial Intelligence \[Sondheimer et al., 1984\].

FLUSH is the lexical component of a system called TRUMP (TRansportable Understanding Mechanism Package) \[Jacobs, 1986b\], used for language analysis in multiple domains.

Some of the conceptual reference pointers for compound lexemes are more complicated than simple lexical access because often there are several components that need to be mapped, but they are still defined in terms of the ref association \[Jacobs, 1986a\].
C86-1130
Incorporating phrasal knowledge into such a hierarchy was suggested in some AI work \[Wilensky and Arena, 1980a\], but the actual implementation of a hier186 archical phrasal lexicon requires substantial extensions to the phrasal representation of such work.

While FLUSH has the capability, like PHRAN \[Wilensky and Arens, 1980b\], to constrain this category with the semantic constraint that the first noun must describe a bureaucratic unit, it is at present left to the semantic interpreter to determine whether the preceding noun can play such an organizational role.

To handle these constructs, some systems use a phrasal lexicon \[Becket, 1975, Wilensky and Arena, 1980b, Jacobs,.1985b, Steinacker and Buchberger, 1983, Dyer and Zernik, 1986\], a dictionary designed to make the representation of these specialized constructs easier.
