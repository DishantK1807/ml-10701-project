The algorithms presented are implemented in the DELPIM system (Bobrow et a1,1991), which has been ported to that domain and formally evaluated in it.

For example, Fass (1991) speaks of what he calls the "source" or the "target" of a metonymy being alternatively substituted for.

Hobbs (1987,1988), for instance, discusses metonymy along with a number of other "local pragmatic" issues (nominal compounds, etc.), but this work is done in the context of a message-processing and not a questionanwering system, so many of the issues we have discussed (wh-questions, etc).
P88-1012
The first stage of semantic interpretation has been described elsewhere in (Bobrow et al,1991), and we do not discuss it here except to describe its output, which forms the input to the quantification stage.

Closer to our work is that of Pustejovsky (1991).
