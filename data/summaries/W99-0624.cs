IR-SEMCOR test collection The best-known publicly available corpus handtagged with WordNet senses is SEMCOR (Miller et al., 1993), a subset of the Brown Corpus of about 100 documents that occupies about 2.4 Mb.
H93-1061
This collection was first introduced in (Gonzalo et al., 1998) and it is described in Section 2.

2. In (Krovetz, 1997), discriminating word senses with differefit Part-Of-Speech (as annotated by the Church :POS tagger) also harmed retrieval efficiency.

We previously showed (Gonzalo et al., 1998) that WordNet synsets seem better indexing terms than senses.

In (Gonzalo et al., 1998), we used the manual annotations in the IR-Semcor collection to show that indexing with WordNet synsets can give significant improvements to Text Retrieval, even for large queries.

In our first experiments (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Gonzalo et al., 1999), the summaries were used as queries, and every query was expected to retrieve exactly one document (the one summarized by the query).

In (Krovetz, 1997), it is shown that the detection of phrases can be useful for retrieval, although it is crucial to assign partial credit also to the components of the collocation.

In this paper we use a variant of the IR-Semcor collection to revise the results of the experiments by Sanderson (Sanderson, 1994) and Krovetz (Krovetz, 1997) cited above.
