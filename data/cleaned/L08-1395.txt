The base grammar for the GLM consists of the general feature grammar for English described in Chapter 9 of (Rayner et al 2006), together with an application-specific lexicon currently containing about 50 lemmas. In addition to this, there is a lexicon of names which is automatically created from the calendar database. The g</context>
