Speech Recognition System The CLT uses the SONIC speech recognition system as a basis for providing real-time recognition of children’s speech (Pellom, 2001; Pellom and Hacioglu, 2003; Hagen et al.2004) 4 . The recognizer implements an efficient timesynchronous, beam-pruned Viterbi token-passing search through a static re-entrant lexical prefix tree while utilizing continuous density mixture Gaussian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

Hagen et al.(2004) describes more recent advances made to both acoustic and language modeling for oral-reading recognition of children’s speech.

5 Event-based Word Error Analysis While our earlier work in Hagen et al.(2003) and Hagen et al.(2004) described consistent improvements in speech recognition accuracy on children’s speech, the use of raw word error rate does not reveal much information in terms of where future improvements in system performance may be obtained.

This work was later extended by Hagen et al.(2004) to incorporate improved acoustic and language modeling strategies.
