Language Gap Problem Upon a close examination of empirical data, it is often difficult to classify a translation pair as a syntactic divergence (e.g., Dorr, 1990; Levin and Nirenburg, 1993), as in he limped up the stairs ~ il monta les marches en boitant (French) (he went up the stairs limping) or a semantic mismatch (e.g., Palmer and Zhibiao, 1995; Kameyama et al., 1991), as in lie, stand ~ se tenir (French).

works which have dealt with mismatches, e.g., (Dorr and Voss, 1998) with their interlingua and knowledge representations, (S~rasset, 1994) with his "interlingua acceptations", or (Kameyama, et al, 1991) with their infons, cannot account for cases which lie in between clear-cut cases of divergences and mismatches such as the example "se tenir" discussed in this paper.

224). LRs and their application time in NLP have received a lot of attention (e.g., Copestake and Briscoe, 1996; Viegas et al., 1996), therefore, I will not develop them further in this paper, as the rules themselves activated by the lexical processor produce different entries, with neither type/sub-type relations nor disjunction between the semantic types of the old and new entries.

Formally, generalisation and specialisation can be done in various ways, as specified for instance in (Kameyama et al., 1991), (Poesio, 1996), (Mahesh et al., 1997).
