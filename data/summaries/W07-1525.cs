The Core Scheme is comparable to MUC by Hirschman, 1997; DRAMA by Passonneau, 1996; MATE by Poesio, 2004.

Its specific instantiations formalized in a family of Extended Scheme(s) are comparable to Rocha, 1997, GNOME by Poesio, 2004.

So, for example, Ge et al.(1998) and, MUC (Hirschman, 1997) propose a minimal string constraint motivated by evaluation considerations.

and evaluation The original annotation guidelines were drafted in 2004 by the authors for the annotation of the Potsdam Commentary Corpus of German newspaper commentaries (PCC) (Stede, 2004) and the RST Discourse Treebank of Wall Street Journal articles (WSJ) (Carlson et al., 2003).

One of the most wellknown later approaches is MATE/GNOME (Poesio, 2004).
W04-2327
MATE was an attempt to extend annotation to other languages than English (Poesio, 2004).
W04-2327
Differently from MUC, we do not consider predicative nominals as coreferential with the subject in the sense of textual coreference defined above (for similar view, see van Deemter and Kibble, 1999), as the relationship with the hypothetical antecedent is expressed by syntactic means.
