Simple but powerful models to predict part of speech can be derived using a corpus that has been tagged (or labelled) as to part of speech [Church 1988; de Marken 19901.

We replicated the result [Church 19881 that this process is able to predict the parts of speech with only a 3-5% error rate when the possible parts of speech of the words are known.

Research efforts at IBM \[Chodorow, et al.1988; Neff, et al.1989\], Bell Labs \[Church, et al.1989\], New Mexico State University \[Wilks 1987\], and elsewhere have used mechanical processing of on-line dictionaries to infer at least minimal syntactic and semantic information from dictionary definitions.

In these experiments, we used the grammar of the Delphi component from BBN's HARC system \[Stallard 1989\], which combines syntax and semantics in a unification formalism.

We will explore the use of the Common Facts Database (CFDB) \[Crowther 1989\], which was derived from an on-line dictionary with a base vocabulary of 65K words.

(\[Chitrao & Grishman 1990\] used a similar context-free model).
