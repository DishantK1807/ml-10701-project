In particular, Merlo and Stevenson (2001) present a classification experiment which bears similarities to ours.

This result confirms the suspicion that frequent predicative use is associated with participial, but not with other kinds of deverbal adjectives, as stated in Section 4.4. 6 Related work In recent years much research (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003) has aimed at exploiting the syntax-semantics interface for classification tasks, mostly based on verbs.

This result backs up previous experimentation with clustering (Boleda et al., 2004), where half of the event adjectives were systematically clustered together with basic adjectives.11 Pol10Note, however, that in 6 other cases with the same polysemy, syntax does tell them apart from typical object adjectives, and are classified as basic (such as the puntual case discussed above; see discussion in next Section).

The judges had an acceptable 0.74 mean Îº agreement (Carletta, 1996) for the assignment of the primary class, but a meaningless 0.21 for the secondary class (they did not even agree on which lemmata were polysemous).
J96-2004
In previous research (Boleda et al., 2004), we developed a three-way classification according to generally accepted adjective properties (see Section 2), and applied a cluster analysis to further examine the classes.

Early efforts include Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993), a cluster analysis directed to the automatic identification of adjectives belonging to the same scale (such as cold-temperedhot).
