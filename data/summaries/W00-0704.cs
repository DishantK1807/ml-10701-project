van Halteren et al.(1998)). Even though overall tagging accuracy of both learning algorithms turns out to be very similar, differences can be observed in terms of accuracy on known and unknown words separately, but also in the differences in the (erroneous) tagging behaviour the two learning algorithms exhibit.

A word is considered to be known when it has an ambiguous tag (henceforth ambitag) attributed to it in the LEXICON, which is compiled in the same way as for the MBT-tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996).

This paper expands on an empirical comparison (van Halteren et al., 1998) in which TRIGRAM tagging, BRILL tagging, MAXIMUM ENTROPY and MEMORY BASED tagging were compared on the LOB corpus.
P98-1081
The comparison was done in both directions: we compared both systems using information sources as described in Daelemans et al.(1996) as well as those described in Ratnaparkhi (1996).

Also note that the results report in Table 5 differ significantly from those reported for MXPOST in (van Halteren et al., 1998).

A memory-based (case-based) approach to tagging has been investigated in Cardie (1994) and Daelemans et al.(1996). Implementation For our experiments we have used TIMBL 2 (Daelemans et al., 1999a).

MBT-type features This section describes tagging experiments for both algorithms using features as described in Daelemans et al.(1996). A large number of experiments were done to find the most suitable feature selection for each algorithm, the most relevant results of which axe presented here.

A good introduction to the paradigm of maximum entropy can be found in Berger et al.(1996). MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) applied maximum Entropy learning to the tagging problem.

We will provide a more detailed and systematic comparison between MAXIMUM ENTROPY MODELING (aatnaparkhi, 1996) and MEMORY BASED LEARNING (Daelemans et al., 1996) for morpho-syntactic disambiguation and we investigate whether earlier observed differences in tagging accuracy can be attributed to algorithm bias, information source issues or both.
