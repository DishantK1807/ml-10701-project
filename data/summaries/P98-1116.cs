This distinguishes it from both unification grammar (Elhadad, 1993a; Shieber et al., 1989) and systemicnetwork grammar (Penman, 1989).

Recently, (Kay, 1996) has explored a bottom-up approach to generation as well, using a chart rather than a word lattice.

Nitrogen has been used extensively as part of a semantics-based Japanese-English MT system (Knight et al., 1995).

However, we plan to remedy these problems by using statistical information extracted from the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1994) to rank tagged lattices and parse forests.

However, "plugin" generators available today, such as FUF/SURGE (Elhadad and Robin, 1998), MUMBLE (Meteer et al., 1987), KPML (Bateman, 1996), and CoGenTex's RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), require inputs with a daunting amount of linguistic detail.
