Hermjakob & Mooney (1997) describe a semi-automatic procedure for learning a deterministic parser from a treebank, which requires the intervention of a human expert in the loop to determine appropriate derivation order, to resolve parsing conflicts between certain actions such as “merge” and “add-into”, and to identify specific features for disambiguating actions.

But unlike our present work, the decision algorithms in both Hermjakob & Mooney (1997) and Wong & Wu (1999) are procedural; there is no explicit representation of the grammar that can be meaningfully inspected.

Finally, we observe that there are also trainable stochastic shift-reduce parser models (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993), which are theoretically related to shift-reduce parsing, but operate in a highly nondeterministic fashion during parsing.

Since Marcus’ work, a significant body of work on incremental parsing has developed in the sentence processing community, but much of this work has actually suggested models with an increased amount of nondeterminism, often with probabilistic weights (e.g., Narayanan & Jurafsky (1998); Hale (2001)).
