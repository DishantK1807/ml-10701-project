Settings We applied the instance-based methodology to evaluate two state-of-the-art unsupervised acquisition algorithms, DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004), whose output is publicly available.

Some existing entailment acquisition algorithms can add contextual constraints to the learned rules (Sekine, 2005), but most donâ€™t.

of Acquisition Algorithms Many methods for automatic acquisition of rules have been suggested in recent years, ranging from distributional similarity to finding shared contexts (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).

Yet the current precision of acquisition algorithms is typically still mediocre, as illustrated in Table 1 for DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004), two prominent acquisition algorithms whose outputs are publicly available.

Accordingly, previous works (except (Szpektor et al., 2004)) evaluated the learned rules under the paraphrase criterion, which underestimates the practical utility of the learned rules (see Section 2.1).

Indeed, only few earlier works reported inter-judge agreement level, and those that did reported rather low Kappa values, such as 0.54 (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) and 0.55 0.63 (Szpektor et al., 2004).
N03-1003 W04-3206
Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).

One approach which was used for evaluating automatically acquired rules is to measure their contribution to the performance of specific systems, such as QA (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or IE (Sudo et al., 2003; Romano et al., 2006).
