EVALUATION OF NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERFACES TO DATA BASE SYSTEMS Bozena Henisz Thompson California Institute of Technology INTEODUCT~ON Is evaluation, like beauty, in the eye of the beholder?
The answer is far from simple because it depends on who is considered to be the proper beholder.
Evaluacors may range from casual users to society as a whole, with system builders, sophisticated users, linguists, grant providers, system buyers, and others in between.
The members of thls panel are system builders and linguists -or rather the t~ao fused into one -but, I believe, interested in all or almost all actual or potential bodies of evaluators.
One of our colleagues expressed a forceful opinion while being a member of a similar panel at last year's ACL conference: "Those of us on this panel and other researchers in the field simply don't have the right to determine whether a system is practical.
Only the users of such a system can make Chat determination.
Only a user can decide whether the hi.
\[natural language\] capability constitutes sufficient added value to be deemed practical Only a user can decide if the system's frequency of inappropriate response is sufficiently low to be deemed practical.
Only a user can decide whether the overall NL interaction, taken in toto, offers enough benefits over alternative formal interactions to be deemed practical" Ill.
It is hard for me co disagree, since I argued as forcefully on the basis of my study of users* evaluation of machine translation \[2\] -a study which was prompted by the evaluations of the quality of machine translation as viewed by linguists and users, ranging from 35Z acceptable for the former to 90Z for the latter.
Whet the study also showed was chat the practicality of the output could indeed only be judged by the users, since even incomplete and stylistically very inelegant translations were found quite useful in practice because they, on the one hand, provided, however crudely, the information sought by the users, and, on the other hand, the users themselves brought knowledge chat made the texts far more understandable and useful then might appear co a nonspecialist linguist.
But this endorsement on mY pert of the user a~ the ultimate judge in evaluations does not preclude my fully subscribing co Norm Sondheimer's \[3\] introductory co~ents co this panel stating that to "make progress as a field, we need to be able Co evaluate".
We are now less likely co confuse the issue of the evaluation by people like ourselves and the judgment of the users, less likely to be surprised at the discrepancies, and less likely to be surprised at the users" acceptance of the limitations of our NL interfaces.
Also, we are far more aware of the fact chac evaluations of '~orth" or "quality" have Co be conducted in the contexts of the actual, perceived needs.
Zn extensive studies on evaluation of innovations, Mosteller \[4\], the recently retired president of AAAS, found that "successful innovators better understand user needs; \[and\] pay more attention to marketing....
" The same source, however, leads me co the notorious difficulties of evaluation given the vide range of evaluaCors and their purposes.
We are all undoubtedly convinced of the value of NLI for the society as a whole, but the evaluation of experiments with these interfaces is another matter.
Mosceller was faced with social, sociomedical, and medical fields.
Let me recount some of the studies he and his team made for reasons which will soon become obvious.
His teem scored a given program on a scale from plus ~wo Co minus ~wo with zero meaning there was essentially uo gain.
Accordingly, a study of delinquent girls that identified th ~buc failed to prevent them from delinquency received a zero.
Likewise, a zero was assigned Co a probation experiment for conviction for public drunkenness in which three methods were used: (I) no treatment, (2) an alcoholic clinic, and (3) Alcoholics Anonymous.
Since the "no treatment" group performed somewhat better, short-term referrals were considered of no value.
A minus one was given to a study whose results were opposite co those hoped for: a major insurance cOmpany increased outpatient benefits in the hope of decreasing hospital costs, but the outpatient group's hospital stays increased.
Finally, a double plus was swarded to an experiment involving the Salk vaccine, which was, predictably, very successful.
Now this kind of evaluation may be justified when the needs of the society are at stake.
I have gone into these details, however, for the purpose of expressing the opinion, in which I know I'm not alone, that nelative results are as important as positive ones, that evaluation in our case is almost equivalent to the amount of information obtained in an experiment.
An experiment whose results would be totally predictable would be almost useless, but one with results different frOm those hoped for might be embarrassing but very valuable.
Another c~ent prompted by those evaluations is chat the application of any rigid, fine scale is totally inappropriate in the case of NLI evaluations.
NLI EVALUATIONS A.
METHODOLOGY AND SOME RESULTS It had been widely taken for granted some time ago Chat l~LI is as good as is its gr-~-r, and a grammar is as good as it is extensive.
The specific needs of users, the requirements of special tasks and the like cook a back seat.
The nature of ht--an discourse was yet to be explored.
Happily, we have been in a different situation for some time.
When the REL \[5, 5, 7\] system was getting into • reasonably sturdy shape with respect to speed and buss, I started planning experiments to test it.
There yes important literature about discourse, especially in sociology, such as the work of Schegloff.
It was thus clear that successful NLI experiments had Co be based on knowledge of hi, an discourse.
St was also clear chat that was the way Co make the interface more natural.
This ass~ption has already been fruitful: the NL interface in POL \[9\], a successor Co REL, has already been extensively improved as a result of the EEL-related experiments.
Experiments were made in three modes: in addition to face-to-face and human-to-co~puter, cerainal-co-terminal communication was examined, since at present chat is the only practical mode of accessing the computer.
Through early 1980, Over 80 subjects, 80,000 words, and over 50 hours were analyzed in great detail.
In the fall of 1980, another 13 subjects were tested in the computational mode only, adding approximately 20 hours.
From the start, the experiments were encouraging, although limited to ~wo modes: F-F and T-T.
Interactions not only showed a great deal of structure but extensive similarities in both modes, the most important being the constancy of the nt=aber of words in sentences (about 70Z); the length of sentences (about 7 words); the existence of fragments (70Z of messages in F-F and 50Z in T-T containing them); and phatics (10Z of total for F-F and 5Z for T-T).
Thus similarities between the =odes were a candidate for consideration in experiments in the computational mode, the T-T mode being seemingly quite far removed from natural F-F.
The sentence having historically been the unit of analysis (and since phatits were considered of lesser Lmportance from the computational vi~, although of great interest in general), m 7 attention turned Co fragments.
REL allowed for three non-sentence type structures: "NP"?
(including number parsed into NP); "all/none or uomber" answers; and 39 definitions introducible by the user which make ic possible to include individual knowledge and terminology.
The analysis of F-F and T-T protocols, however, showed the existence of other fragment categories, finally analyzed ~nco a dozen categories (see \[8\]).
Since they constitute a considerable amount of F-F conversations and even T-T protocols, they clearly had co be watched for in computational experiments.
The experiments for actually observin~ user-system interaction were conducted in the winter Cem of 1979/80 and produced 21 protocols, the analysis of which was compared with results of eight F-F and fou~ T-T experiments.
Another 13 computational experiments done in the fall coufimed the results of the earlier ones.
The Cask in all three =odes was a real one: loading cargo onto a ship, the data coming from the actual envirooment of loading U.S. navy ships by a group in San Diego, California.
In the F-F and T-T experiments, ~n,~o persons were involved -one given cargo item~ Co be loaded, the other infot~nation about decks (details in \[8\]).
In the computational mode (H-C) the ship data was in ~he computer and the list of cargo to be loaded was handed Co the subjects, all with Caltech background.
Details being available elsewhere andspace limited here, only some major results are given here.
Table 1 shows the comparison of the three modes.

The closeness of the average of messages in T-T and parsed and uonparsed inputs in H--C is striking.
Table 2 (the meaning of abbreviations is given below the cable) deals with fragments.
Zt is mostly selfexplanatory, as is the absence of dsfiniclons from ¥-F and T-T (although some abbreviations used there fall in this category) and the absence of some other categories from T-T and K-C.
At lease ~wo comaents, however, are necessary.
The surprisingly low use of terse questions £n H-C may be accounted for by the tendency toward a formal style in compuCacionnl interaction.
The definitions used were often of quite complex character, although far fever than could be hoped for due apparently to lack of familiarity with this capability.
The complex character of definitions undoubtedly had some effect on the length of sentences in the H-C mode.

SYST~4 PERFORMANCE, sYNTAX USED, SPECIAL STRATEGIES, AND ERROR ANALYSIS System performance can obviously be evaluated in a number of ways, but without good response time meaningful experiments are impossible.
When much data is involved in processing a delay of a few minutes can probably be tolerated, but the vast majority of requests should be responded to within seconds.
The latter was the case in my experiments.
Fairly complex messages of about 12 words were responded to in about l0 seconds.
The system clearly has to be reasonably free of bugs -in my case, 12 bugs were hit in the total of 1615 parsed and nonparsed messages.
The adequate extent of natural language syntax is impossible to determine.
Table 3 shows the syntax used by my subjects.
sentences; or possibly just "baby talk" due to the suspicion of the computer's limitations.
An interesting fact to note is that similar results with respect to syntax were obtained in the exper~nents with USL, the "sister system" of REL developed by IBM Heidelberg \[10\] -with German used as gLl in two studies of high school students: predominance of wh-questions (317 in total of 451); not many relative clauses (66); commands (35); conjunctions (26); quantifiers (15); definitions (ii); comparisons (2); yes/no questions (i).
An evaluation which would not include an analysis of unparsed input would at best be of limited value.
It was shown in Table i that i093 out of 1515 or about ~o thirds were parsed in my experiments.
TABLE 3 SENTENCE TYPES Tot~l 882 651 All sentences Simple sentences, e.g., "List the decks of the Alamo".
73.8 Sentences with pronouns, e.g., '~/hat is its length?", "what is in its pyrotechnic looker"? 30 3.A Sentences with quantifier(s), e.g., "List the class of each cargo".
71 8.0 Sentences with conjunctions, e.g.
"What is the maxim,-stow height and bale cube of the pyrotechnic locker of the AL"? 88 I0.0 Sentences with quantifier and conjunction(s), e.g., "List hatch width and hatch length of each deck of the Alamo".
13 2.6 Sentences with relative clause, e.g., "List the ships that have water".
6 .7 Sentences with relative clause (or related construction) and cemparator, e.g., "List the ships with a beam less than lO00".
6 .7 Sentences with quantifier and relative clause, e.g., "List height of each content whose class is class IV".
2 .23 Sentences with quantifier, conjunction and relative clause, e.g., "List length, width and height of each content whose class is a--nunicion".
2 .23 Sentences with quantifiers and comparator, e.g., '~Iow many ships have a beam greater than 10007'* 3 .34 Wh-questions 75.0 Yes/no questions 1.0 Con=sands 19.0 Statements (data addition) 5.0 Considering the wide range of R k'rsyntax \[7\], the paucity of complex sentences is surprising.
The use of definitions which often involved complex constructions (relative clauses, conjunctions, even quantifiers) had a definite influence.
So did, undoubtedly, the task situation causing optimization of work methods.
The influence of the specific nature of the task would require additional studies, but the special device provided by the system (a loading prompt sequence -which was not analyzed) was employed by every subject.
Dewices such as these obviously are a great aid in accomplishin 8 tasks.
They should be tested extensively to determine how they can augment the uaturalness of NLIs.
Other reasons for the relatively simple syntax used were special strategies: paraphrasing into simpler syntax even though a sentence did not parse for other reasons; "SUCCesS strategy" resulting in repetitious simple TABLE 4 Total % Vocabulary 161 36.1 Punctuation 72 16.1 Syntax 62 13.9 Spelling 61 13.6 Transmission 32 7.2 Definition format 30 6.7 Lack of response 16 3.6 Bus 12 2.7 Table 4 st~_erizes the categories of errors.
The predominance of vocabulary is not surprising, but relatively few syntactic errors are.
In part this may be due to the method of scoring in which errors were counted only once, so if a sentence contained an unknown vocabulary item (e.g.
"On what decks of the Alamo cargo be stored")? but would have failed on syatactic grounds as well, it would fall in the vocabulary category.
A comparison can be made here with Damerau's study Ill\] of the use of the ll~A system by the city plannin S department in White Plains, at least with regard to the total of queries to those completed: 788 to 513.
So, again, roughly t~ao thirds were parsed.
In other categories "parsin S failure" is 147, "lookup failures" 119, "nothing in data base" 61, "program error" 39, but this only points to the general difficulties of comparisons of system performance.
SOME CONCLUSIONS Norm Sondheimer suggested some questions we might try to answer.
What has been learned about user needs?
What most important linguistic phenomena to allOW for?
What other kinds of interactions?
Error analysis points in the obvious directions of user needs, and so do the types of sentences employed.
While it is justified to quit the search for an almost perfect grnmm,r, it would be a mistake to constrain it to the constructions used.
Improved naturalness can be achieved with diagnostics, definitions, and devices geared to specific tasks such as special prompting sequences.
Some tasks clearly require math in the NLI.
How good are systems?
An objective measurement is probably impossible, but the percentage of requests processed might give some idea.
In the case of a task situation such as loading cargo items, the percentage of task completion may signal both system performance and user satisfaction.
System response times are a very important measure.
The questionnaire method can and has been used (in the case of MT and USL), but as yet there is too little experience to measure user satisfaction.
Users seem very good at adapting to systems.
They paraphrase, use success strategy, simplify syntax, use special devices -what they really do is maximize their performance with respect Co a given task.
41 What have we learned about running evaluations7 It is important Co know what to look for, therefore the need for good knowledge of human to hmnan discourse.
Good system response times are a sine qua non.
Controlled experiments have the advantage of being replicable, a crucial factor in arriving ac evaluation criteria.
Determining user bias and experience nay be important, but even more so £s user training.
Controlled experiments can show what methods are ~ost effective (e.g.
a manual or study of proCocols~).
Study of user commence -phacic material -gives some measure of user (dis)satisfaction (I have seen '"/ou lie," buc I have yeC to see "Good boy, youZ").
Clearly, the best indication of user satisfaction is whether he or she uses the system again.
Extensive IonS-term studies are needed for that.
What should the future look like?
Task oriented situations seem to be a promising envirooment for ~LZ.
The standards of NL systems performance will be set by the users.
Future evaluations?
As Antoine de Sainc-Zxup&r7 wrote, "As for the Future, your task is not to foresee, but to enable it".
