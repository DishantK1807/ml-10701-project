4. Experiments We have conducted a series of lexical acquisition experiments with the above algorithm on largescale English corpora, e.g., the Brown corpus \[Francis and Kucera 1982\] and the PTB WSJ corpus \[Marcus et al.1993\]. Below is the segmentation result on the first few sentences in the Brown corpus: \[the\] \[_fulton_county\] \[_grand_jury\] \[_said_\] \[friday_\] \[an\] \[_investigation_of\] \[_atlanta\] \[_'s_\] \[recent\] \[_primary_\] \[election\] \[_produced\] \[_' '_no\] \[_evidence\] \[_' '_\] \[that_any\] \[_irregularities\] \[_took_place_\] \[@\] \[_the_jury\] \[_further\] \[_said_\] \[in_term\] I-el \[nd_\] \[present\] \[ments\] \[_that_\] \[the_city_\] \[executive\] \[_committee\] \[_,_which_had\] \[_over-all_\] \[charge_of\] \[_the_election\] \[_, _' ' _\] \[deserves\] \[_the_\] \[praise\] \[_and_\] \[thanks\] \[_of_the_c\] \[ity_of_\] \[atlanta\] \[_''_\] \[for\] \[_the_manner_in_which\] \[_the_election\] \[_was\] \[_conducted_\] \[@\] \[_the\] \[_september\] \[-\] \[october_\] \[term\] \[_jury\] \[_had_been_\] \[charge\] \[d_by_\] \[fulton_\] \[superior_court\] \[_judge\] \[_dur\] \[wood_\] \[py\] \[e_to\] \[_investigat\] \[e\] \[_reports_of_\] \[possible\] \[_" _\] \[irregularities\] \[_ ' ' _\] \[in_the\] \[_hard-\] \[fought_\] \[primary\] \[_which_was_\] \[w\] \[on_by_\] \[mayor\] \[-\] \[nominat\] \[e_\] \[iv\] Jan_allen_\] \[jr\] \[_..\] \[_' '_\] \[only_a\] \[_relative\] \[_handful_of\] \[_such_\] \[reports\] \[_,as\] \[_received\] \[_' '_, _\] \[the_jury\] \[_said_,_" _\] \[considering_the\] \[_widespread\] \[_interest_in_\] \[the_election\] \[_,_\] \[the_number_of_\] \[vo\] \[ters_and_\] \[the_size_of\] \[_this_c\] \[ity_' '_\] \[@\] \[_the_jury_said\] \[_it_did\] \[_find\] \[_that_many_of\] \[_georgia_' s\] \[_registration\] \[_and_\] \[election\] \[_laws\] \[_"_\] \[are_\] \[out\] \[mode\] \[d_\] \[or\] \[_inadequate\] \[_and_often_\] \[ambiguous\] \[.
