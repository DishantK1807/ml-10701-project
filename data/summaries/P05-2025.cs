Another means of improving the clustering labeling will be using WordNet::Similarity to nd the relatedness amongst the words from the cluster using the knowledge of WordNet as is also proposed by (McCarthy et.al., 2004).
P04-1036
(Bagga and Baldwin, 1998) proposed a method using the vector space model to disambiguate references to a person, place, or event across multiple documents.
P98-1012
(Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004) have proposed an algorithm for labeling semantic classes, which can be viewed as a form of cluster.
N04-1041
Our approach is based on unsupervised learning from raw text, adapting methods originally proposed by (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).
W04-2406
(Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) take an approach to 145 name discrimination that incorporates information from the World Wide Web.
