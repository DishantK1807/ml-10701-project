Best results were obtained when using a variant of Modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing2 (Chen and Goodman, 1996).

In very recent work, (Demberg, 2007) developed an unsupervised algorithm (f-meas: 68%; an extension of RePortS) whose segmentations improve g2p when using a the decision tree (PER: 3.45%). decision tree joint n-gram PER WER-ss PER WER-ss+ RePortS 3.83% 28.3% 15.1% no morph.

Preprocessing It has been argued that using morphological information is important for languages where morphology has an important influence on pronunciation, syllabification and word stress such as German, Dutch, Swedish or, to a smaller extent, also English (Sproat, 1996; MÂ¨obius, 2001; Pounder and Kommenda, 1986; Black et al., 1998; Taylor, 2005).

Vowel length and quality has been argued to also depend on morphological structure (Pounder and Kommenda, 1986).
