We refer the reader to Abeill6 (1988) and to Schabes, Abeill6 and 3oshi (1988) for further explanation of the use of unification equations and substitution in TAGs.

Although a CKYtype parser for TAGs has been developed earlier (Vijay-Shanker and :Icshi, 1985), this is the first practical parser for TAGs because as is well known for CFGs, the average behavior of Earley-type parsers is superior to that of CKY-type parsers.

It has also been shown to be useful for lexical insertion (Schabes, Abeind and Joshi, 1988).

We introduce in a TAG framework a language similar to PATR-II which was investigated by Shieber (Shieber, 1984 and 1986).

feature structures for TAGs The definition of feature structures for TAGs and their semantics was proposed by Vijay-Shanker (1987) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1988).

More details of the actual implementation can be found in Schabes mad Joshi (1988).

This work has led us to a new general parsing strategy (Schabes, Abeill~ and Joshi, 1988) which allows us to construct a two-stage parser.

Although formal properties of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) have been investigated (VijayShanker, 1987)--for example, there is an O(ns)time CKY-like algorithm for TAGs (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985)--so far there has been no attempt to develop an Earley-type parser for TAGs.
