Collins parser for Chinese The Collins parser is a state-of-the-art statistical parser that has high performance on English (Collins, 1999) and Czech(Collins et al.1999). There have been attempts in applying other algorithms in Chinese parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel 2002; Levy and Manning 2003), but there has been no report on applying the Collins parser on Chinese.

It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.
