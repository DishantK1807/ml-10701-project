The system of Mani and Wilson (2000) goes further in using separate sets of hand-crafted rules for recognition and normalization and in separating out several disambiguation tasks.

A: Recognizing timexes Systems that perform both recognition and normalization tend to take a rule-based approach to recognition (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Saquete et al., 2002; Schilder, 2004; Negri and Marseglia, 2004).

Recognition-only systems are often based on machine learned classifiers (Hacioglu et al., 2005; Bethard and Martin, 2006), although some do use finite-state methods (Boguraev and Ando, 2005).

(Mani and Wilson, 2000) use a heuristic method for this task, while (Ahn et al., 2005b) use a machine learned classifier.
