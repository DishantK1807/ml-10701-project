Recent studies into the use of supervised learningbased modeels for the NE task in the molecularbiology domain have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Collier et al., 2000) and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999) are not only adaptable to this highly technical domain, but are also much more generalizable to new classes of words than systems based on traditional hand-built heuristic rules such as (Fukuda et al., 1998).

We use a tagger based on Adwait Ratnaparkhi's method (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

Much of this work has taken advantage of smoothing techniques to overcome problems associated with data sparseness (Chen and Goodman, 1996).

In the following model, summarized here from the full description given in (Collier et al., 2000), we consider words to be ordered pairs consisting of a surface word, W, and a word feature, F, given as < W, F >.

Recently IE systems based on supervised learning paradigms such as hidden Markov models (Bikel et al., 1997), maximum entropy (Borthwick et al., 1998) and decision trees (Sekine et al., 1998) have emerged that should be easier to adapt to new domains than the dictionary-based systems of the past.
