This algorithm is described in detail in (Moran, 1988).

This formalism is related directly to the Core Language Engine, but more conceptually it is closely related to that of other unification-based grammar formalisms with a context-free skeleton, such as PATR-II (Shieber et al., 1983), Categorial Unification Grammar (Uszkoreit, 1986), Generalized Phrase-Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1982), and Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 1982).

In future work, we hope to improve the performance of our repair correction component by incorporating acoustic/prosodic techniques for repair detection (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992) (Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993) (O'Shaughnessy, 1992).

In earlier work (Moore and Dowding, 1991), we showed that approximately 80% of the edges built in an allpaths bottom-up parser contained gaps, and that it is possible to use prediction in a bottom-up parser only to constrain the gap categories, without requiring prediction for nongapped categories.
H91-1036
In this respect, our approach differs from many other approaches to the problem of parse preferences, which make their preference decisions as parsing progresses, pruning subsequent parsing paths (Frazier and Fodor, 1978), (Hobbs and Bear, 1990), (Marcus 1980).
C90-3029
Many systems (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983), (Hobbs et al., 1992), (Seneff, 1992), (Stallard and Bobrow, 1992) have added robustness with a similar postprocessing phase.

After penalizing such dispreferred parses, the preference 58 mechanism applies attachment heuristics based on the work by Pereira (1985) and Shieber (1983) Pereira's paper shows how the heuristics of Minimal Attachment and Right Association (Kimball, 1973) can both be implemented using a bottom-up shift-reduce parser.

Sorts are located in a conceptual hierarchy and are implemented as Prolog terms such that more general sorts subsume more specific sorts (Mellish, 1988).

This approach is presented in detail in (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992).
