Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Since previous work indicated the usefulness of word sense disambiguation systems in lexical substitution (Dagan et al., 2006), we use the SenseLearner word sense disambiguation tool (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005) to disambiguate the target word and, accordingly, to propose its synonyms as candidates.
