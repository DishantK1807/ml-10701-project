4.2 Term-list Translation using Target Language Corpus The termlist translation algorithm(Kikui, 1998) aims at translating a list of words that characterize a consistent text or a concept.

Among them, the unsupervised algorithm using decisiontrees (Yarowsky, 1995) has achieved promising performance.

It combines two unsupervised disambiguation algorithms: one is the word sense disambiguation algorithm based on distributional clustering(Schuetze, 1997) and the other is the translation disambiguation algorithm using target language corpora(Kikui, 1998).

Work Since we have referred to previous work in the area of statistical target word selection in Section 1 ((Brown et hi., 1990), (Brown et al., 1991), (Brown, 1997), (Yamabana et hi., 1998), (Dagan and Itai, 1994), (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), (Kikui, 1998)), this section focuses on other related research.

Fung et al.((Fung and K., 1997),(Fung and Yee, 1998)) presented interesting results on bilingual lexicon construction from "comparable corpora", which is non-parallel bilingual corpora in the same domain.

Applying the termlist translation (disambiguation) algorithm(Kikui, 1998) to the list of words consisting of these characteristic words and the given word, w.

Due to the recent availability of large text corpora, various statistical approaches have been tried including using 1) parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1990), (Brown et al., 1991), (Brown, 1997), 2) non-parallel bilingual corpora tagged with topic area (Yamabana et al., 1998) and 3) un-tagged mono-language corpora in the target language (Dagan and Itai, 1994), (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), (Kikui, 1998).

The results of the proposed algorithm were compared against those of the previous algorithm which relies solely on target language corpora(Kikui, 1998).
