intuitions Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) is a new grammar formalism generalizing Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).

For a thorough discussion about word order in XDG, we refer to (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001) and (Debusmann, 2001).

Multi-dimensional principles include climbing (as in (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001); one dimension must be a flattening of another) and linking (e.g.

Another issue is that of the relation between groups and the meta-grammatical functionality of the XDG lexicon, offering lexical inheritance, templates and also disjunction in the sense of crossings (Candito, 1996) to lexically state linguistic generalizations.

This renewed interest in DG has also given rise to new grammar formalisms based directly on DG (Nasr, 1995; Heinecke et al., 1998; BrÂ¨oker, 1999; Gerdes and Kahane, 2001; Kruijff, 2001; Joshi and Rambow, 2003).

For this dimension, we use the same theory as for TDG (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).

Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) is a new grammar formalism based on Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).
