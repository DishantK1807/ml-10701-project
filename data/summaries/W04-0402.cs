2 Motivation, target, and related work 2.1 Motivation One of the critical issues that we face in paraphrase generation is how to develop and maintain knowledge resources that covers a sufficiently wide range of paraphrasing patterns such as those indicating that “to make an attempt” can be paraphrased into “to attempt,” and that “potential” can be paraphrased into “possibility.” Several attempts have been made to develop such resources manually (Sato, 1999; Dras, 1999; Inui and Nogami, 2001); those work have, however, tended to restrict their scope to specific classes of paraphrases, and cannot be used to construct a sufficiently comprehensive resource for practical applications.

There is another trend in the research in this field, namely, the automatic acquisition of paraphrase patterns from parallel or comparable corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003, etc.).

For example, a system that is capable of simplifying a given text, or showing the user several alternative expressions conveying the same content, would be useful for assisting a reader (Carroll et al., 1999; Inui et al., 2003).
