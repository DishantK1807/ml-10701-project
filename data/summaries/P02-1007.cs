C00-1062
For computational OT syntax, an interleaving of candidate generation and constraint checking has been proposed (Kuhn, 2000).
P00-1046
The comparison-based setup of OT learning is closely related to discriminative learning approaches in probabilistic parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2002),1 however the comparison of generation alternatives rather than parsing alternatives adds the possibility of systematically learning the basic language-specific grammatical principles (which in probabilistic parsing are typically fixed a priori, using either a treebankderived or a manually written grammar for the given a14 This work was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

The proof builds on Kaplan and Wedekindâ€™s (2000) construction showing that LFG generation produces contextfree languages.
C00-1062
(Kuhn, 2000) excludes the application of such recursions by a similar condition as offline parsability (which excludes vacuous recursions over a string in parsing), but with the a1a3a2 construction, this condition is not necessary for decidability of the generation-based optimization task.

3 OT-LFG Following (Bresnan, 2000; Kuhn, 2000; Kuhn, 2001), we define a restricted OT system based on Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) representations: c(ategory) structure/f(unctional) structure 2Most computational OT work so far focuses on candidates and constraints expressible as regular languages/rational relations, based on (Frank and Satta, 1998) (e.g., (Eisner, 1997; Karttunen, 1998; Gerdemann and van Noord, 2000)).
