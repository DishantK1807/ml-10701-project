The recent flurry of work on semantic analysis, based on resources such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002), provide the substrate for reasoning engines.

This idea of employing n-gram co-occurrence statistics to score the output of a computer system against one or more desired reference outputs has its roots in the BLEU metric for machine translation (Papineni et al., 2002) and the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) metric for summarization.

As it currently stands, the vital/okay dichotomy is troublesome because there is no way to operationalize such a classification scheme within a system; see Hildebrandt et al.(2004) for more discussion.

As an example, the Pyramid Method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), represents a good first attempt at a realistic model of human variations.

Already, there are hybrid approaches to multi-document summarization that employ natural language generation techniques (McKeown et al., 1999; Elson, 2004), and researchers have experimented with sentential operations to improve the discourse structure of summaries (Otterbacher et al., 2002).

Another promising direction of research in definition question answering involves applying the Pyramid Method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) to better model the vital/okay nuggets distinction.

Computational linguistics research generally attaches great value to high kappa measures (Carletta, 1996), which indicate high human agreement on a particular task.

Since 1999, the NIST-organized question answering tracks at TREC (see, for example, Voorhees 2003a) have served as a focal point of research in the field, providing an annual forum for evaluating systems developed by teams from all over the world.

We believe that there exist many more opportunities for future exploration; as an example, there are remarkable similarities between information nuggets in definition question answering and recently-proposed methods for assessing summaries basedon fine-grainedsemantic units(Teufel andvan Halteren, 2004; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).

Using answer length as a proxy to precision appears to be a reasonable compromise because a pilot study demonstrated that it was impossible for humans to consistently enumerate the total number of nuggets in a response, a necessary step in calculating nugget precision (Voorhees, 2003b).
