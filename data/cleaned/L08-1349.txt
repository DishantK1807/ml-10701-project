As results of existing NLP tools, we added the results of the Japanese parser KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994). In the conversion process, the Japanese web pages are organized into 10,000 page sets (i.e., one page set consists of 10,000 web pages.) The page sets were processed by 162 cluster machines in para</context>
