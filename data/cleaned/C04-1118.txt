The paper provides a detailed evaluation of the editor.
1 Introduction
Times of feminist (language) revolution are gone, but marks are left behind in the form of a changed society with a changed consciousness and changed gender roles.
Nevertheless language use seems to oppose changes much stronger than society does.
As the use of nondiscriminatory language is nowadays compulsory in administration and o cial documents, a number of guidelines and recommendations exist, which help to avoid gender imbalance and stereotypes in language use.
Although in some cases men may be concerned (as for example most terms referring to criminals are masculine nouns) the main concern is about adequate representation of women in language, especially in a professional context.
Psychological tests demonstrate that persons reading or hearing masculine job titles (so-called generic terms allegedly meaning both women and men) do not visualize women working in this eld.
In order to avoid this kind of discrimination two main principles are often suggested (e.g.
as in (Ges, 1999; Uni, 2000)): 1.
use of gender-neutral language, which rather "disguises" the acting person by using impersonal phrases.
2. explicit naming of women and men as equally represented acting persons.
Using and applying these guidelines in a faithful manner is time-consuming and requires a great amount of practice, which can not always be provided, particularly by unexperienced writer.
Moreover these guidelines are often completely unknown in non-feminist circles.
A tool which checks texts for discriminatory use of language is thus mandatory to promote written gender equality, educate and remind writer of unacceptable forms to avoid.
In this paper we describe the project \Gendercheck" which uses a controlled-language authoring tool (CLAT) as a platform and editor to check German texts for discriminatory language.
In section 2 we introduce three categories of gender discrimination in German texts and provide possibilities for their reformulation.
Section 3 introduces the technology on which the Gendercheck editor is based.
The linguistic engine proceeds in two steps, a marking and ltering phase where gender discriminatory formulations are automatically detected.
A graphical interface plots the detected formulations and prompts the according messages for correction. Section 4 then goes into the detail of the marking and ltering technique.
We use the shallow pattern formalism kurd (Carl and Schmidt-Wigger, 1998; Ins, 2004) rst to mark possible erroneous formulations and the to lter out those which occur in \gendered" context.
Section 5 evaluates the Gendercheck editor on two texts.
2 Gender
Inequality in German Texts Most prominent to achieve gender equality on a linguistic level in German texts is to nd solutions and alternatives for the so-called generic masculine: the masculine form is taken as the generic form to designate all persons of any sex.
The major problem is to gure out whether or not a given person denotation refers to a particular person.
For instance, in example (1a) \Beamter" (o cer) is most likely used in its generic reading and refers to female o cers (Beamtinnen) and masculine o cers (Beamten).
To achieve gender equality an appropriate reformulation is required as shown in example (1b).
(1a) Der Beamte muss den Anforderungen Gen uge leisten.
(1b) Alle Beamten und Beamtinnen m ussen den Anforderungen Gen uge leisten.
Since we tackle texts from administrative and legal domains we principally assume unspecied references.
That is, a masculine (or feminine)! noun will not denote a concrete person but rather refers to all persons, irrespectively of their sex.
A second class of errors are masculine relative, possessive and personal pronouns which refer to a generic masculine or an inde nite masculine pronoun.
(2a) Der Beamte muss seine Wohnung in der N ahe des Arbeitsplatzes suchen.
(2b) Jeder muss seinen Beitrag dazu leisten.
(2c) Wer Rechte hat, der hat auch P ichten.
The possessive pronoun \seine" (his) in example (2a) refers to the preceeding \Beamte" (ofcer).
The generic masculine use of \Beamte" and the referring pronoun will be marked.
The same holds for sentence (2b) where the possessive pronoun refers to the inde nite pronoun \jeder" (everymasc).
The inde nite pronouns \jemand" (someone) and \wer" (who) count as acceptable.
However, masculine pronouns referring to it will be marked.
In example (2c), the masculin relative pronoun \der" can be omitted.
A third class of gender inequality is lack of agreement between the subject and the predicative noun.
Example (3a) gives an example where the masculine subject \Ansprechpartner" (partnermasc) occurs with the a female object \Frau M uller" (Mrs.
M uller).
(3a) Ihr Ansprechpartner ist Frau M uller.
(3b) Ihre Ansprechpartnerin ist Frau M uller.
A solution for this class of errors is shown in example (3b) where the subject (Ansprechpartnerin) is adapted to the female gender of the predicate.
Suggestions to reformulate gender imbalances as shown in examples (1) and (2) can be classied in two main categories: 1.
Whenever possible, use gender neutral formulations.
These include collectiva (e.g.
Lehrk orper (teaching sta ) or Arbeitnehmerschaft (collective of employees)) as well as nominalized participles (Studierende (scholar)) or nominalized adjectives (Berechtigte).
2. Use both forms if gender neutral formulations cannot be found.
That is, the feminine and the masculine form are to be coordinated with \und", \oder" or \bzw.".
A coordination with slash \/" will also be suggested but should only be used in forms, ordinance and regulations.
Amendments should accord to general German writing rules.
The so called \Binnen-I", an upper case \I" as in \StudentInnen" will not be suggested and also naming of the female su x in parenthesis should be avoided.
The same holds for the inde nite pronoun \frau" (woman) which was occasionally suggested to complement the pronoun \man".
3 The
Gendercheck Editor Controlled-Language Authoring Technology (CLAT) CLAT has been developed to suit the need of some companies to automatically check their technical texts for general language and company speci c language conventions.
Within CLAT, texts are checked with respect to: orthographic correctness company speci c terminology and abbreviations general and company speci c grammatical correctness stylistic correctness according to general and company speci c requirements The orthographic control examines texts for orthographic errors and proposes alternative writings.
The terminology component matches the text against a terminology and abbreviation database where also term variants are detected Figure 1: The Gendercheck Editor (Carl et al., 2004).
Grammar control checks the text for grammatical correctness and disambiguates multiple readings.
Stylistic control detects stylistic inconsistencies.
The components build up on each otherâ€™s output.
Besides the described control mechanisms, CLAT also has a graphical front-end which makes possible to mark segments in the texts with di erent colors.
Single error codes can be switched o or on and segments of text can be edited or ignored according to the authors need.
CLAT also allows batch processing where XML-annotated text output is generated.
Figure 1 shows the graphical interface of the editor.
The lower part of the editor plots an input sentence.
The highlighted SGML codes are manually annotated gender \mistakes".
The upper part plots the automatically annotated sentence with underlined gender mistakes.
As we shall discuss in section 5, gender imbalances are manually annotated to make easier automatic evaluation.
In this example, the highlighted words \Deutscher" (German) and \EG-B urger" (EU-citizen) are identical in the manually annotated text and in the automatically annotated text.
The user can click on one of the highlighted words in the upper window to display the explanatory message in the middle part of the screen.
Further information and correction or reformulation hints can also be obtained by an additional window as shown on the right side of the gure.
The messages are designed according to main classes of gender discriminatory formulations as previously discussed.
4 Gender
Checking Strategy Gendercheck uses a marking and ltering strategy: rst all possible occurrences of words in an error class are marked.
In a second step \gendered" formulations are ltered out.
The remaining marked words are assigned an error code which is plotted in the Gendercheck editor.
According to the classi cation in section 2, this section examines the marking and ltering strategy for generic masculine agents in section 4.1, pronouns which refer to generic masculine agents (section )?? and errors in agreement of predicative nouns (section ??).
Marking and ltering is realized with kurd a pattern matching formalism as described in (Carl and Schmidt-Wigger, 1998; Ins, 2004).
Input for kurd are morphologically analyzed and semantically tagged texts.
4.1 Class
1: Agents 4.1.1 Marking Agents Two mechanisms are used to mark denotations of persons: a) The morphological analysis of mpro (Maas, 1996) generates not only derivational and in ectional information for German words, but also assigns a small set of semantic values.
Male and female human agents such as \Soldat" (soldier), \B urgermeister" (mayormasc), \Beamte" (o cermasc), \Krankenschwester" (nursefem) etc.
are assigned a semantic feature s=agent.
Words that carry this feature will be marked style=agent.
b) Problems occur for nouns if the base word is a nominalized verb.
For instance \Gewichtheber" (weightlifter) und \Busfahrer" (bus driver) will not be assigned the feature s=agent by mpro since a \lifter" and a \driver" can be a thing or a human.
Gender inequalities, however, only apply to humans.
Given that the tool is used in a restricted domain, a special list of lexemes can be used to assign these words the style feature style=agent.
The kurd rule Include shows some of the lexemes from this list.
The list contains lexemes to cover a maximum number of words.
For instance the lexeme absolvieren (graduate) will match \Absolvent" (alumnusmasc), \Absolventin" (alumnusfem), \Absolventen" (alumniplu;masc) and \Absolventinnen" (alumniplu;fem).
1 Include
= 2 Aec=noun, 3 ls:absolvieren$; 4 dezernieren$; 5 richten$; 6 fahren$; 7 administrieren$; 8 vorstand$} 9 : Agstyle=agent}.
Lines 3 to 8 enumerate a list of lexemes separated by a semicolon.
The column in line 3 following the attribute name ls tells kurd to interpret the values as regular expressions.
Since the dollar sign $ matches the end of the value in the input object, each lexeme in the list can also be the head of a compound word.
Thus, the test ls:fahren$ matches all lexemes that have fahren as their head words, such as \Fahrer" (driver), \Busfahrer" (bus driver), etc.
The action Agstyle=agent} marks the matched words as an agent.
4.1.2 Filtering
\gendered" Agents The text then undergoes several lters to delete marks in words if the appear within gendered formulations.
a) Excluded are marked agents which preceed a family name.
The marking of \Beamte" in example (4) will be erased since it is followed by the family name \Meier".
\Beamte Meier" is likely to have a speci c reference.
(4) Der Beamte Meier hat gegen die Vorschrift versto en.
In terms of kurd this can be achieved with the rule AgentMitFname: if a family name (s=fname) follows a sequence of marked agents (style=agent) the marks in the agent nodes are removed (rstyle=nil}).
1 AgentMitFname
= 2 +Aestyle=agent}, 3 Aec=noun,s=fname} 4 : Arstyle=nil}.
b) Also excluded are nominalized plural adjectives and participles since they are well suited for gender neutral formulations.
In example (5), the nominalized plural adjective \Sachverst andige" (experts) is ambiguous with respect to gender.
The mark will thus be removed.
(5) Sind bereits Sachverst andige bestellt? c) Marked words in already gendered formulations are also erased.
Pairing female and male forms by conjunction is a recommended way to produce gender equality.
In example (6) the subject \Die Beamtin oder der Beamte" (the o cerfem or the o cermasc) as well as the pronouns which refer to it \sie oder er" (she or he) and \ihrer oder seiner" (her or his) are gender equal formulations.
(6) Die Beamtin oder der Beamte auf Lebenszeit oder auf Zeit ist in den Ruhestand zu versetzen, wenn sie oder er infolge eines k orperlichen Gebrechens oder wegen Schw ache ihrer oder seiner k orperlichen oder geistigen Kr afte zur Erf ullung ihrer oder seiner Dienstp ichten dauernd unf ahig (dienstunf ahig) ist.
The kurd rule gegendert removes these marks.
The description in lines 2 to 5 matches a conjunction of two marked agents (style=agent) which share the same lexeme ls=_L but which are di erent in gender.
This latter constraint is expressed in two variables ehead={g=_G} and ehead={g~=_G} which only unify if the gender features \g" have nonidentical sets of values.
1 gegendert = 2 Aestyle=agent,ls=_L,ehead={g=_G}}, 3 elu=oder;und;bzw./}, 4 *astyle~=agent}ec=w}, 5 Aestyle=agent,ls=_L,ehead={g~=_G}} 6 : Arstyle=nil}.
The rule allows the conjunctions \und", \oder", \bzw".
and \/".
d) Some nouns are erroneously marked even if no gender equal formulation is possible.
For instance words such as \Mensch" (human being),a \Gast" (guest), \Fl uchtling" (refugee) are masculine in gender, yet there is no corresponding female form in German.
These words are included in an exclude list which works similar to the include list previously discussed.
1 exclude = 2 Aastyle=agent, 3 lu:mensch$; 4 fl uchtling$; 5 s augling$; 6 gast$; 7 rat$} 8 : Arstyle=nil}.
4.1.3 Non
marked Expressions a) Currently, we do not mark compound nouns which have an agent as their modi er and a non-agent as their head.
However, also words such as \Rednerpult" (talker desk = lectern) and \Teilnehmerliste" (participants list = list of participants) are suitable for gender mainstreaming and should be spelled as \Redepult" (talk desk) and \Teilnehmendeliste" (participating list).
b) We do not mark articles and adjectives which preceed the marked noun.
This would be troublesome in constructions like example (7) where the article \der" (the) and the corresponding noun \Dezernent" (head of department) are separated by an intervening adjectival phrase.
(7) Den Vorsitz f uhrt der jeweils f ur die Aufgaben zust andige Dezernent.
c) It is currently impossible to look beyond the sentence boundary.
As a consequence, the reference of a agent cannot be detected if it occurs in the preceeding sentence.
For instance \Herr M uller" is the reference of \Beamte" in the second sentence in example (8).
(8) Herr M uller hat die Dienstvorschrift verletzt.
Der Beamte ist somit zu entlassen.
The word \Beamte" will be erroneously marked because information of the preceeding sentence is not available to resolve the reference.
4.2 Class
2: Pronouns Also personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, relative pronouns and inde nite pronouns are marked.
The strategy is similar to the one for agents above: rst all pronouns are marked and in a second step markings in correct formulations are erased.
With the exception of inde nite pronouns (\Mancher", \Jemand", \Niemand" etc.), a marked referent agent must be available in the same sentence.
Three di erent rules are used to mark relative pronouns, personal pronouns and possessive pronouns.
1 MarkRelativPronomen
= 2 estyle=agent,ehead={g=_G}}, 3 *alu~=&cm}, 4 elu=&cm}, 5 Aelu=d_rel,ehead={g=_G}} 6 : Agstyle=agent}.
a) The rule MarkRelativPronomen detects a marked agent in line 2.
Lines 3 and 4 search the next comma1 that follows the marked agent and line 5 matches the relative pronoun2 that immediately follows the comma.
The relative 1commas are coded as \&cm" in the formalism.
2relative pronouns are assigned the lexeme \d rel".
Size of Test Classes of errors Text #sent.
#words Errors/sent.
Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 P ET1 95 1062 1,83 97 62 15 174 TT2 251 6473 0,46 95 21 | 116 pronoun must agree in gender with the agent (ehead={g=_G}).
As we shall see in section 5, this is an error prone approximation to reference solution.
b) Personal and possessive pronouns are only marked if they refer to a male agent.
The two rules MarkPersonalPronomen and MarkPossesivPronomen work in a similar fashion: in line 2 the marked masculine reference is matched.
Lines 3 and 4 match the following personal pronoun (c=w,sc=pers) and possessive pronoun (c=w,sc=poss).
In lines 5, the pronouns are marked.
1 MarkPersonalPronomen
= 2 estyle=agent,ehead={g=m}}, 3 1Aelu=er;er_es,c=w,sc=pers} 4 |es~=agent,sc~=punct} 5 : Arstyle=agent}.
1 MarkPossesivPronomen
= 2 estyle=agent,ehead={g=m}}, 3 1Aelu=sein,c=w,sc=poss} 4 |es~=agent,sc~=punct} 5 : Arstyle=agent}.
After the marking step, pronoun marks are ltered.
Filtering of pronouns is similar to the previously discussed rule gegendert.
4.3 Class
3: Predicative Noun Missing agreement between subject and predicative noun is detected with the following kurd rule: 1 Praedikatsnomen = 2 +Aemark=np,style=agent,ehead={g=_G}}, 3 *Aemark=np}, 4 els=sein,c=verb}, 5 *Aestyle~=agent}, 6 Aemark=np,style=agent,ehead={g~=_G}}, 7 *Aemark=np} 8 : Arbstyle=Gen3,estyle=Gen3}.
Lines 2 and 3 detect the marked subject.
Notice that noun groups are marked with the feature mark=np by a previous chunking module.
Lines 5 to 7 match the predicative noun.
Both parts of the sentence are connected by the copula \sein" (be).
Similar to the rule gegendert, the rule only applies if both parts are di erent in gender.
5 Evaluation
of Gendercheck We evaluated the Gendercheck editor based on two texts: ET1 A collection of unconnected negative examples taken from the (Ges, 1999) and (Sch, 1996).
TT2 The deputy law of the German Bundestag Gender imbalances were manually annotated with a SGML code, where each di erent code refers to a di erent rewrite proposal to be plotted in the editor as in the lower part in gure 1.
Table 4.1.3 shows the distribution of error classes in the two texts.
Each error class had several subtypes which are omitted here for sake of simplicity.
In ET1 every sentence has at least one error; on average one word out of six is marked as \ungendered".
Since ET1 is a set of negative examples, errors are uniformly distributed.
Distribution of errors in text TT2 is di erent from ET1.
TT2 does not contain a single occurrence of a class 3 error.
On average, only one word out of 60 is manually marked and | due to the long size of sentences | there are 0.46 errors per sentence on average.
Text ET1 was used to develop and adjust the kurd rule system for marking, ltering and error code assignment.
We iteratively compared the automatically annotated text with the manually annotated text and computed precision and recall.
Based on the misses and the noise, we adapted the style module as well as the error annotation schema.
Thus, in a rst annotation schema we assigned more than 30 di erent error codes literally taken from (Ges, 1999) and (Uni, 2000).
However, it turned out that this was too ne a granularity to be automatically reproduced and values for precision and recall were very low.
We than assigned only one error class and achieved very good values for precision of over 95% and recall over more than 89%.
Based on these results we carefully rened a number of subtypes of the three error classes.
Final results are shown in table 5.
Results for the test text TT2 are slightly inferior to those of Text ET1 Error hit misses noise precision recall Class 1 85 12 1 0.988 0.876 Class 2 55 7 5 0.917 0.887 Class 3 15 0 1 0.937 1.000P 155 19 7 0.957 0.891 Text TT2 Class 1 86 9 5 0.945 0.905 Class 2 14 7 4 0.778 0.667P 100 16 9 0.917 0.862 the development text ET1.
We brie y discuss typical instances of misses and noise.
a) Noise in class 1 (generic use of masculine) are mainly due to \-ling" derivations such as \Abk ommling" (descendant) which are masculine in German and for which no female equivalent forms exist.
These words could be included in the exclude lexicon (see section 4).
b) In some cases nominalized participles such as \Angestellte" (employee) and \Hinterbliebene" (surviving dependant), which are usually very well suited for gendered formulations due to their ambiguity in gender, were erroneously disambiguated.
These instances produced noise because lters did not apply.
c) Misses in class 1 can be traced back to some words which have not been detected as human agents such as \Schriftf uhrer" (recording clerk) and \Ehegatte" (spouse).
These words could be entered into the include lexicon.
Both lexicon should be made user-adaptable and user extendible in future versions of the system.
d) Many of the misses in class 2 are due to a reference in the preceeding sentence.
Since the system is currently sentence based, there is no easy solution in enhancing this type of errors.
The possessive pronoun \seiner" in the second sentence of example (9) refers to \Bewerber" (applicant) in the rst sentence.
This connection cannot be reproduced if the system works on a sentence basis.
(9) Einem Bewerber um einen Sitz im Bundestag ist zur Vorbereitung seiner Wahl innerhalb der letzten zwei Monate vor dem Wahltag auf Antrag Urlaub von bis zu zwei Monaten zu gew ahren.
Ein Anspruch auf Fortzahlung seiner Bez uge besteht f ur die Dauer der Beurlaubung nicht.
e) An example for noise in class 2 is shown in example (10).
The relative pronoun \der" (who,which) was detected by Gendercheck but erroneously been linked to \Beamte" instead of \Antrag" (application) which are both masculin in German.
(10) Der Beamte ist auf seinen Antrag, der binnen drei Monaten seit der Beendigung der Mitgliedschaft zu stellen ist, . ..
Much more powerful mechanisms are required to achieve a breakthrough for this kind of errors.
6 Conclusion
This paper describes and evaluates the \Gendercheck Editor" a tool to check German administrative and legal texts for gender equal formulations.
The tool is based on the Controlled Language Authoring Technology (CLAT), a software package to control and check technical documents for orthographical, grammatical and styptic correctness.
A part of the Style component has been modi ed and adapted to the requirements of linguistic gender main-streaming.
The paper outlines a shallow technique to discover gender-imbalance and evaluates the technique with two texts.
Values for precision and recall of more than 90% and 85% respectively are reported.
