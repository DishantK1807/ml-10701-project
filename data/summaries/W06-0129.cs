This approach reduces to the cross-entropy/compression-based approach of (Teahan et al.2000). Experiments showed that skewing these space-insertion/matching probabilities reduces decoding accuracy.

The refinement both introduces context and greatly simplifies confidence estimation over the approach using standard BIO coding in (Culotta and McCallum 2004).
