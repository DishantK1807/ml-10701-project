This process has been named sentence planning (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992).
A92-1006
Recent work on generating definite referring NPs (Reiter, 1991 ; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Reiter and Dale, 1992; Horacek, 1995) has emphasized how circumscribed instantiations of this procedure can exploit linguistic context and convention to arrive quickly at short, unambiguous descriptions.
C92-1038
First, we adopt an ONTOLOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS representation (Hobbs, 1985) that includes a wide variety of types of entities.
P85-1008
Previous authors (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987) have noted that TAG has many advantages for generation as a syntactic formalism, because of its localization of argument structure.
P85-1012
In (Stone and Doran, 1996) we explore the use of additional factors, such as attentional state and lexical preferences, in this step.

Most generation systems pipeline pragmatic, semantic, lexical and syntactic decisions (Reiter, 1994).
W94-0319
For example, (Reiter and Dale, 1992) apply generalizations about the salience of properties of objects and conventions about what words make baselevel attributions to incrementally select words for inclusion in a description.
C92-1038
Pragmatic analyses of referring expressions model speakers as PLANNING those expressions to achieve several different kinds of intentions (Donellan, 1966; Appelt, 198 1985; Kronfeld, 1986).
P86-1029
We tackle additional examples in (Stone and Doran, 1996).
W96-0410
For example, in (Stone and Doran, 1996), we use reference to properties, actions and belief contexts (Ballim et al., 1991) to describe semantic collocations (Pustejovsky, 1991) and idiomatic composition (Nunberg et al., 1994).
J91-4003 W96-0410
(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) represent syntax, semantics and pragmatics in a lexicalized framework, but concentrate on information structure rather than the pragmatics of particular constructions.
E93-1039 W94-0314
These aspects of TAGs are crucial to SPUD, as they are to (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987; Yang et al., 1991; Nicolov et al., 1995; Wahlster et al., 1991; Danlos, 1996).
J91-4003 P85-1012
As in centering (Grosz et al., 1995), the subject is taken to be the most salient entity.
J95-2003
Moreover, selecting alternatives on the basis of their syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic contributions to the sentence using TAG allows the sentence planner to choose words in tandem with appropriate syntax (Yang et al., 1991), in a flexible order (Elhadad and Robin, 1992), and, if necessary, in conventional combinations (Smadja and McKeown, 1991; Wanner, 1994).
W94-0316
Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995).
J86-3001 J95-2003
Although most generation systems pipeline decisions (Reiter, 1994), we believe the most efficient and flexible way to integrate constraints in sentence planning is to synchronize the decisions.
W94-0319
(Shieber et al., 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1991) construct a simultaneous derivation of syntax and semantics but they do not construct the semantics--it is an input to their system.
