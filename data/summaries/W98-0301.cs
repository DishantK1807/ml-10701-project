The action DUAL is usually associated with cue phrases that can introduce some expectations about the discourse (Cristea and Webber, 1997).

Most of the algorithmic research in discourse segmentation focused on segments of coarse granularity (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hearst, 1997; Yaari, 1997).

The algorithm found 80.8% of the discourse markers with a precision of 89.5% (see Marcu (1997b) for details), a result that outperforms Hirschberg and Litman's (1993) and its subsequent improvements (Litman, 1996; Siegel and McKeown, 1994).

Marcu (1997b) provides a full description of the algorithm.

Marcu (1997b) lists all cue phrases that were used to extract text fragments from the Brown corpus, the number of occurrences of each cue phrase in the corpus, and the number of text fragments that were randomly extracted for each cue phrase.

Also, if we want to select the most important parts of a text, sentences might prove again to be too large segments (Marcu, 1997a; Teufel and Moens, 1998): in some cases, only one of the clauses that make up a sentence should be selected for summarization.

3. The I Marcu (1997b)studies the other two functions as well.

These segments were defined intentionally in terms of Grosz and Sidner's theory (1986) or in terms of an intuitive notion of "topic".
