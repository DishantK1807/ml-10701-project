The early work presented in Emele and Zajac (1989a) was an attempt to directly implement the ideas presented in Ait-Kaci (1984, 1986); Emele and Zajac (1989b) was already a departure from Ait-Kaci's KBL language, implementing a different evaluation strategy that allowed the use of cyclic feature structures.

An interpreter for the TFS rewrite machine has been implemented at the University of Stuttgart by Martin Emele and the author and has been used to test several linguistic models such as DCG, LFG, HPSG, and SFG \[Emele and Zajac 1990b; Emele et al.1990; Zajac 1990a; Bateman and Momma 1991\].

The idea is rather simple: assume we are working with linguistic structures similar to LFG's functional structures for English and French as proposed in Kaplan et al.(1989). We define a translation relation as a type TAU-LEX with two features, eng for the English structure and fr for the French structure.

In Saint-Dizier (1991), linear precedence rules are defined as constraints in a language based on typed feature structures and SLD-resolution, which is used to experiment with GB theory.

The presentation is nevertheless rather informal, and a more technical account can be found in Emele and Zajac (1990a) and Zajac (1990b).

A more general approach is described in Dymetman, Isabelle, and Perrault (1990), who define sufficient termination properties for parsing and generation for the class of "Lexical Grammars".

The actual algorithm used in the system is optimized using several different techniques to minimize copying and to behave as efficiently as a pattern-matcher in cases when one of the feature structures subsumes the other (Emele 1991).

A constraint-based grammar does not need a context-free mechanism to build up constituent structures for parsing or generation: Dymetman, Isabelle, and Perrault (1990) describe a class of reversible grammars ("Lexical Grammars") based on a few composition rules that are very reminiscent of categorial grammars.
C90-3017
We apply a similar technique for specifying transfer rules for machine translation, which we prefer to call "contrastive rules" since there is no directionality involved (Zajac 1989; 1990a).

These theories are usually directly implemented in object-oriented programming languages (e.g., LOOM in the case of the PENMAN system \[Mann and Matthiessen 1985\]), but there is a growing number of linguistic formalisms used for specific purposes, e.g., DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1989) for the lexicon.

Another example is the use of nonmonotonic inheritance, which is advocated in computational linguistics by, for example, Evans and Gazdar 1989; Bouma 1990; De Smedt and de Graaf 1990; and Fraser and Hudson 1990.

Since conceptual structures are used for example in text generation (Bourbeau et al.1990) or knowledge-based machine translation (Nirenburg et al.1992), typed feature structures provide an attractive alternative to current procedural implementations.
C90-1021
The Typed Feature Structure language (TFS) is an attempt to provide a synthesis of several key concepts stemming from unification-based grammar formalisms (feature structure: Kay 1984) knowledge representation languages (inheritance), and logic programming (narrowing).

175 Computational Linguistics Volume 18, Number 2 For HPSG-style grammars, completeness and coherence as defined for LFG, and extended to the general case by Wedekind (1988), are implemented in HPSG using the "subcategorization feature principle" (Johnson 1987): for the TFS implementation of HPSG, termination is guaranteed, at least for the simplified version containing only head-complement structures, described in Section 3.2.
C88-2150
example, the use in the current implementation of several techniques adapted from PROLOG implementations such as structure sharing, chronological dereferencing (Emele 1991) and last call optimization, have improved efficiency by several orders of magnitude over previous "naive" implementations.
P91-1042
However, properties similar to the "conservative guides" of Dymetman, Isabelle, and Perrault (1990) have to hold in order to ensure termination.
