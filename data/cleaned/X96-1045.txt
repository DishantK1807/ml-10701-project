1:238	TIPSTER Text Phase II Configuration Management Plan Version 1.2p 3June 1996 Architecture Committee tipster@tipster.org 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This document presents the TIPSTER Text Phase II Configuration Management (CM) Plan for identifying, controlling, and auditing the TIPSTER Architecture status and configuration definition.
2:238	1.1 Configuration Management Goals The CM process will support the following TIPSTER goals: use of API's, modular substitution, and conformance to applicable standards.
3:238	The CM process will document the conformance of each TIPSTER application to the Architecture Design Document and with any applicable APIs.
4:238	The most important affect of the CM process will be to promote modular substitution, software re-use, and reduced risk of project planning.
5:238	This will allow for the orderly upgrading of installed systems as technology improves in the future.
6:238	It will also facilitate the sharing of developed software between Government agencies and offices.
7:238	1.2 TIPSTER Application Conformance Assessment Document The CM review process, described in detail below, will result in a document which details the ways in which an application or vendor product conforms to the Architecture Design Document and is in agreement with the TIPSTER Architecture design.
8:238	This document is a TIPSTER Application Conformance Assessment Document (TACAD).
9:238	In order for an application or vendor product to successfully acquire a TACAD, the following conditions must be met: For TIPSTER Application development:  The TIPSTER Application development complies with the TIPSTER CM process, the details which are contained in this document.
10:238	In short, the TIPSTER Application must undergo a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and a Final Operating Capability (FOC) review.
11:238	At these reviews, any discrepancy or deviation from the TIPSTER Architecture must be documented and justified/explained.
12:238	 Any new code or capabilities for the TIPSTER Application must be developed in accordance with the TIPSTER Architecture.
13:238	Failure to do so will be documented and justified in the TACAD.
14:238	 To the extent possible and in the Government's best interest, existing code and capability to be incorporated into the TIPSTER Application will be re-engineered in accordance with the TIPSTER Architecture.
15:238	Failure to do so will be documented and justified in the TACAD.
16:238	For Vendor Products:  If the vendor's product is used in a TIPSTER Application, the criteria stated above in "For TIPSTER Application development" will apply.
17:238	 A vendor's product may be determined to be TIPSTER compliant with the use of a TACAD independent of actually being part of a TIPSTER Application.
18:238	To support the development of this TACAD, the vendor will demonstrate, by inspection, module-by-module compliance with the TIPSTER Architecture.
19:238	On the basis of the TACAD, the Configurations Control Board (CCB) will determine that a TIPSTER Application is conformant or non-conformant, if it exhibits sufficient overlap with the Architecture Design Document.
20:238	The extent of TIPSTER Conformance will be determined on a "per module" basis and documented in the TACAD.
21:238	As a result of the TIPSTER Application reviews (described in section 1.2, below) a summary matrix will be available as shown in Appendix A, Figure A-I, below.
22:238	345 The TACAD may be used by Vendors to facilitate teaming with other Vendors or insertions of new capability into existing TIPSTER systems.
23:238	1.3 Configuration Management in a TIPSTER Application LifeCycle The TIPSTER CM process imposes two control gates, PDR and FOC, on the TIPSTER Application development lifecycle, as shown in Figure 1-2.
24:238	In preparation for these control gates, it is expected that the developing contractor and the SE/CM will work together to prepare the documentation and to identify any discrepancies between the Architecture Design and the TIPSTER Application's design.
25:238	This cooperation will be in the form of an Engineering Review Board (ERB).
26:238	At the PDR control gate, the following TIPSTER Application documentation is expected to be put in the TACAD and under TIPSTER CM control:  1.
27:238	TIPSTER Application Design Documentation.
28:238	 2.
29:238	Documentation detailing any design discrepancy or deviations from the TIPSTER Architecture on a per-module basis.
30:238	This document will also justify or explain the discrepancy or deviations found.
31:238	 3.
32:238	Any Requests For Change (RFC) to the TIPSTER Architecture to cover the discrepancy or deviations in the TACAD.
33:238	At the FOC control gate, the following are expected to be put in the TACAD and under TIPSTER CM control:  1.
34:238	TIPSTER Application As-Built Documentation.
35:238	 2.
36:238	Documentation detailing any as-built discrepancy or deviations from the TIPSTER Architecture.
37:238	This document will also explain the discrepancy or deviations.
38:238	 3.
39:238	Any Requests For Change (RFC) to the TIPSTER Architecture to cover the discrepancy or deviations.
40:238	It is expected that TIPSTER Applications will require control gates at the time of design and at the time of final delivery.
41:238	The TIPSTER PDR and FOC control gates will 'piggy-back' on the projects control gates, to the maximum extent possible.
42:238	346 Fee \] AC B System i System t System System l lnitiation Design Implementation O & M Preliminary Final Design Operating Review Capability Review TIPSTER Program Can Provide Architecture Design and Specifications TIPSTER Program Can Support the Integration of New Technology and Algorithms Figure 1-2 TIPSTER Application LifeCycle with Configuration Management Gates The Architecture Committee will determine whether a TIPSTER Application has successfully passed a PDR and FOC control gate ERBs.
43:238	In practice, the Architecture Committee will appoint a small group of people to sit on the Configuration Control Board (CCB) to examine, in detail, the documentation and justifications provided at the PDR and FOC control gates.
44:238	The CCB will then make a recommendation to the Architecture Committee as to whether or not the control gate has been satisfied.
45:238	The specifics of how to run the CCB and the control gates are given in Section 3.0, below.
46:238	The CCB will assign and use an Engineering Review Board (ERB) to compile the documentation necessary for the CCB's review.
47:238	The ERB will be comprised of the SE/CM and the developing contractor's representatives.
48:238	The specifics of how to run the ERB are given in Section 3.0, below.
49:238	Discrepancies will originate from the ERB and will primarily be presented by the developing contractor's representatives.
50:238	The discrepancies will be submitted to the CCB for disposition, which can be one of the following:  An RFC can be initiated to incorporate the discrepancy as a change to the Architecture Design Document.
51:238	 The discrepancy can be "Noted and Documented".
52:238	This would assume that it is in the best interest of the Government to deviate from the Architecture in this particular case.
53:238	347  The discrepancy can be sent back to the developing contractor and the Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) with a request that the discrepancy be cleared up.
54:238	348 2.0 BACKGROUND 2.1 Need for TIPSTER Configuration Management Phase I of the TIPSTER Text Program, including the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Message Understanding Conference (MUC) activities, produced a variety of advanced methods for text handling.
55:238	However, incorporating the various algorithms and methods into usable applications under one TIPSTER Architecture requires close control and documentation of the constituent parts that comprise the TIPSTER II Architecture.
56:238	This assumption is based on the following points:  The detection and extraction systems were not developed to work together, although many important text processing tasks require interaction between detection and extraction technologies.
57:238	 Applications produced under Phase I have not been tested against the variety of tasks and natural languages that must be handled.
58:238	The Government cannot treat every application requirement for natural language processing as a separate system; deployable systems must be flexible enough to handle a variety of tasks and languages with only minor modifications.
59:238	 Existing systems at both a component and module level implement similar functionality very differently.
60:238	Standardizing on the Architecture and interfaces of a core set of such components and modules, so that they can be reused in many applications on many platforms, is the purpose of the TIPSTER Text Phase II Program.
61:238	Specialized functions can have standard interfaces to operate with these core functions.
62:238	This functional modularization will support the interoperability and flexibility that the Government believes is necessary to handle the variety and breadth of its text processing tasks.
63:238	It will also reduce acquisition and maintenance costs and allow for the orderly expansion of an application's capability once deployed.
64:238	Finally, functional modularization will support and advance the research community by making available a standardized, basic text handling architecture; no longer will an architecture have to be invented for every new experiment.
65:238	2,2 SE/CM Role Within the Overall TIPSTER Framework The TIPSTER II SE/CM effort involves supporting the Government in overseeing the development of an open architecture and integration of components and modules for comprehensive text handling capabilities.
66:238	This will allow processing of character streams and text databases from many disparate sources through content detection and data base or knowledge base update.
67:238	In addition, tools and interfaces for configuring architecture components to particular applications must be integrated and managed.
68:238	Key issues in the development of the architecture requirements are defining the functions to be performed, the specific requirements of components and modules to perform each such function, particularly their input, output, and interface specifications, and also specifying an open architecture for integrating all components and modules.
69:238	Key issues in the development of the Architecture itself are standardizing, documenting, and disseminating the module functional and interface specifications.
70:238	The role of the SE/CM contractor is best understood within the context of the overall TIPSTER framework.
71:238	This framework includes three separate but interrelated set of activities: the SE/CM effort; the Architecture efforts; and the Demonstration Activities.
72:238	Figure 2-1 depicts the respective functions of each activity set, and their interrelationships.
73:238	The figure highlights the communications between SE/CM and the other activities, which will typically be in the form of architecture component requirements or description documents, and completed software modules.

75:238	J _ Demonstration Demonstration Prototype Implementation,)-Activities Figure 2-1 SE/CM Activities Related to Overall TIPSTER Framework Initially, the architecture requirements will be defined from the existing TIPSTER I requirements, with the addition of requirements for integrating the most promising algorithms from that effort.
76:238	The SE/CM will assist the Government in evaluating architectures proposed by TIPSTER II contractors.
77:238	Later, as demonstration prototypes are initiated, their requirements must be analyzed to determine the adequacy of the existing architecture, and to define necessary or desirable enhancements.
78:238	Throughout this iterative process, the SE/CM will perform configuration identification activities including configuration definition, establishment of the Architecture baseline, review of applicable documentation and processing of Architectural changes.
79:238	These activities will occur throughout the refinement effort and life of the Architecture.
80:238	The SE/CM will work with the senior technical designers and engineers from all of the TIPSTER II teams to identify the Configuration Items (CIs).
81:238	CM is responsible for gathering, storing, and presenting the current status of each configuration item.
82:238	2.3 Purpose of the CM Plan The purpose of this plan is to establish guidelines, responsibilities, methods and procedures for CM for the TIPSTER Text Phase II Architecture.
83:238	Specific procedures for CM are in related Configuration Management Procedures (CMPs).
84:238	CM is intended to provide a stable and consistent definition of the TIPSTER Architecture.
85:238	2.4 Scope of the CM Plan The scope of this plan encompasses anything related to the TIPSTER Architecture.
86:238	As such, CM will be in effect during the life of the Architecture and will be primarily concerned with the documentation which describes the Architecture.
87:238	It will not be applied to the software produced by the developers; CM for that software is the responsibility of the individual contractor.
88:238	The CM process is expected to become active at such time as the first Architecture baseline is established and CM will remain active throughout the life of the Architecture.
89:238	The CM process will monitor and control changes to the Architecture.
90:238	Normally, changes to the baseline will be initiated when an TIPSTER Application has been designed and the PDR identifies potential deficiencies in the Architecture.
91:238	350 Request For Changes (RFC) will go through the CM process and ultimately be approved by the Architecture Committee.
92:238	It is expected that the TIPSTER Architecture will continuously be undergoing growth and change.
93:238	It is therefore vital that the CM process be able to reconstruct the exact state of the TIPSTER Architecture at any given date in the past.
94:238	Changes are categorized as either Class I, which is a change to the current Architecture baseline, or Class II, which is all other changes, such as correction of document typographical errors, resolution of ambiguities, and changes that clearly do not qualify as a Class I. Deviations are defined as discrepancies wherein an application does not conform to the particular Architectural standard.
95:238	2.5 CM Plan Synopsis In addition to what was already noted in Section 1.2, this CM Plan defines the configuration management activities and philosophy required to support the TIPSTER Text Phase II Architecture throughout its entire life cycle.
96:238	CM provides a means to identify, control, audit, and report on the configuration and status of the TIPSTER Architecture.
97:238	The remaining sections of this document provide information to effect quality change and release controls for TIPSTER II:  Section 2.0 lists the referenced documents and the documents under CM which in turn define the Architecture at any time.
98:238	 Section 3.0 describes the relevant SE/CM configuration organizations for TIPSTER II.
99:238	It also describes the CM roles and responsibilities of other program entities.
100:238	 Section 4.0 describes the general approach to CM, CM responsibilities, and CM Phasing and Milestones.
101:238	 Section 5.0 has a glossary of all acronyms and abbreviations used in this CM Plan.

132:238	These tasks consist of reviewing/analyzing problem reports and change requests, and preparing recommendations to effect proposed changes or preparing a statement why the proposed change should not be made to the Architecture.
133:238	3.2.4 Verification and Validation Testing Engineer The Verification and Validation (V&V) Testing Engineer will develop and implement tests to determine if modules in TIPSTER Applications are consistent with the Architecture Design Document by ensuring that they conform to the specifics in the Architecture Design Document.
134:238	Additionally, if necessary, the V&V Test Engineer will determine that shared components and modules interface as required, both in isolation and in combination with the other components and modules.
135:238	Specifically, the interfaces must be as described in the TIPSTER Interface Control Document.
136:238	Internal component processing capabilities do not come under the scope of V& V Testing.
137:238	(See V&V Test Plan).
138:238	The V&V Testing Engineer controls formal CSCI test procedure development prior to those components being placed under formal CM control, reports problems identified during formal CSCI testing to CM, and actively participates in ERB and CCB meetings.
139:238	3.2.5 Configuration Control Board (CCB) The CCB is the Government review and action board comprised of key personnel from the Architecture Committee, SE/CM, and the appropriate contractors.
140:238	The CCB provides a central point of coordination of changes to the 356 baseline Architecture.
141:238	The CCB is the focal point and the source of direction for implementation of Class I changes to the TIPSTER II Architecture.
142:238	The CCB reviews each Class I change and makes a decision as to the disposition with the options of (a) approve the change, (b) disapprove the change, or (c) defer the proposed change.
143:238	Each board member is allowed to state his/her official position on the proposed change.
144:238	However, the CCB is a non-voting board.
145:238	Thus, the CCB Chairman shall render the final decision as to the course of action to the taken.
146:238	The CCB's decision is recorded as a Change Directive.
147:238	The CCB's major responsibilities are:  Review all proposed change requests.
148:238	 Assess change impacts.
149:238	 Provide a statement that the application development which initiated a change is in compliance with the Architecture or represents a deviation from the Architecture.
150:238	 Review modifications to all documentation.
151:238	 The results of any actions taken by the CCB are reported to the Architecture Committee.

154:238	The above members form the core of the CCB.
155:238	If a member is unable to attend a meeting, he/she must designate a representative to attend in his/her place.
156:238	The representative must have full authority to act on behalf of the missing member.
157:238	Additional individuals are invited to participate, as appropriate, when their technical expertise is required.
158:238	3.2.6 Engineering Review Board (ERB) The ERB is an internal TIPSTER II Architecture review and action panel comprised of personnel from all project groups.
159:238	Membership of the ERB is:  SE/CM Program Manager (Chair)  The TIPSTER Application Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR)  Supporting Agency-Specific Representative (TIPSTER expertise)  CM Manager (Secretary)  Contractor Group Representative(s) (Member)  Software Architecture Engineer (Member) The objectives of the ERB are disposition of problems, classification of proposed changes, and disposition of Class II changes.
160:238	Upon receipt and disposition of a problem, the ERB will analyze it for type of problem, priority, and verification of the proposed solution.
161:238	When the problem is fixed, the ERB will determine the implementation 357 schedule of the fix into the affected baselines.
162:238	Upon review of a change request, the ERB first determines the classification as either a Class I or Class II type of change.
163:238	For Class I changes, the ERB assigns preparation of a Request For Change (RFC) to the responsible groups for submittal to the CCB for their review and disposition.
164:238	Class II changes are within the scope of authority of the ERB for disposition.
165:238	The ERB reviews each Class II change and then takes appropriate action for its disposition.
166:238	Each panel member is allowed to state his/her position on the change.
167:238	However, the ERB is a non-voting board.
168:238	Thus, the ERB chairman shall render final decision as to the course of action to be taken.
169:238	ERB decisions are recorded on Change Directives, a copy of which is sent to the CCB for information only.
170:238	3.2.7 Architecture Committee The Architecture Committee has final authority over the TIPSTER Architecture and in this role can accept or reject any Change Directive reported by the CCB.
171:238	The Architecture Committee appoints the members of the CCB.
172:238	Architecture Committee Architecture Working Group Configuration Control Board Engineering \[ Review Board I Project I Control Panel Figure 3-4 CM Organization 3.2.8 Architecture Working Group (AWG) Since the CM function does not start until the Architecture baseline has been released by the Architecture Working Group (AWG), it will have no CM responsibility.
173:238	3.2.9 Evaluation Working Group The TIPSTER Phase II evaluation working group (EWG) is tasked with designing, implementing, and coordinating evaluations intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of TIPSTER architectural approaches; thus, the EWG will be a user of the results of the CM process by using the appropriate Architectural version in their evaluations.
174:238	The membership of the EWG is composed of the following core personnel:  Chairperson  SE/CM Representative  2 NSA Representatives 358  2 CIA Representatives  1 BBN/UMass Representative  1 MMC/GE Representative  Representatives from the other contractors The membership of the EWG is composed of the following adjunct participants:  Evaluation Representatives (TREC, MUC)  Demonstration Representatives (Sponsor/Contractor 2 persons) 359 4.0 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 4.1 TIPSTER CM Approach The CM organization is responsible for identifying the specific items that define the Architecture and will be configuration controlled, as well as when and how they are to be controlled.
175:238	CM conducts audits of the Architecture baseline to ensure conformance with the TIPSTER concept and to verify that the configuration management library system is functioning adequately.
176:238	4.2 Configuration Management Responsibilities TIPSTER's CM responsibilities comprise baseline management, interface control, and the CM aspects of quality control in each of the following six areas which operate throughout the Architecture's life cycle:  Item and baseline identification and management  Configuration control  Configuration status accounting (CSA)  Configuration audits  Architecture file maintenance  Architecture delivery In the area of item and baseline identification and management, configuration management is responsible for baseline traceability and integrity by retention of all versions and releases of Architecture elements.
177:238	As stated in Section 1, once an element is part of the baseline, it is placed under change control.
178:238	In this area, configuration management has many responsibilities.
179:238	These include administrative handling of all changes, from initial receipt and logging of Change Requests through issuance of Change Directives indicating final disposition.
180:238	Configuration management prepares, publishes, and incorporates the change pages in the defining documentation.
181:238	Configuration management personnel also act as the recording secretary for the two project change review organizations: the Engineering Review Board (ERB) and the Configuration Control Board (CCB).
182:238	Configuration management has this status accounting responsibility where in monthly status reports for changes, problems, and action items are reported.
183:238	Architecture files contain all written materials and documentation on the TIPSTER II Architecture.
184:238	This critical area is the responsibility of configuration management.
185:238	Finally, configuration management is responsible for formal delivery of all TIPSTER II Architecture defining documents to the Government.
186:238	4.3 Configuration Management Phasing and Milestones The CM activities described in this CM Plan are initiated and completed in accordance with the Program Master Schedule.
187:238	Table 4-1 is a list of major events/milestones and specifies the CM activities conducted and the planned dates for initiation and completion of each event/milestone.

190:238	developers, the CAWG, or the SE/CM.
191:238	4.4.2.1 Application Developer Submission Submissions from applications developers will be They are as Provide for consistency in the development of the Architecture.
192:238	Allow for changes, proposed on the basis of different versions of the Architecture, to be combined into a single change.
193:238	Provide for consideration of changes proposed by any interested party.
194:238	Encourage changes to the Architecture from anyone who has done an implementation.
195:238	Provide for independent submission and review of proposed changes.
196:238	It is expected that submissions will be made by application reviewed by the SE/CM and approved/disapproved by the Architecture Committee.
197:238	As reviewer, the SE/CM will recommend minor modifications to the RFC to maintain a level of consistency in names and methods.
198:238	If major modifications are necessary, the SE/CM may submit an entirely new RFC.
199:238	The Architecture Committee will then have both RFCs to approve/disapprove.
200:238	The CAWG will be able to evaluate the proposed changes and make suggestions to the SE/CM or the Architecture Committee.
201:238	Any comments/recommendations by the CAWG will be an addendum to the formal RFC.
202:238	362 As a minimum, the CAWG will receive the RFC when it is formally submitted to the SE/CM.
203:238	Under normal circumstances, however, the SE/CM will be aware that changes are likely to be forthcoming from an application under development.
204:238	In such cases, the SE/CM will keep the CAWG informed of the issue under discussion.
205:238	In this way, the CAWG may be able to provide timely input to the application developer as to previously debated issues or 'known' work-arounds for the difficulty encountered.
206:238	4.4.2.2 CAWG Submission Submissions from the CAWG will be reviewed by the SE/CM and approved/disapproved by the Architecture Committee.
207:238	As reviewer, the SE/CM may recommend minor modifications to the RFC to maintain a level of consistency in names and methods.
208:238	4.4.2.3 SE/CM Submission On rare occasions, submissions may come from the SE/CM and will be reviewed by the CAWG or other person(s) as designated by the Architecture Committee and approved/disapproved by the Architecture Committee.
209:238	The reviewer may recommend minor modifications to the RFC to maintain a level of consistency in names and methods.
210:238	If the reviewer is not the CAWG, the SE/CM will keep the CAWG informed of the issue under discussion.
211:238	In this way, the CAWG will be able to provide comments and recommendations to the Architecture Committee.
212:238	4.4.3 Tracking of RFCs RFCs will be formally tracked by their RFC number.
213:238	The RFC will contain the following:  Status/Routing Sheet  Submission Form  Review Sheet  CAWG Comments or Recommendations  Any Relevant Material Such as Email Traffic The RFCs will be available on the internet on the TIPSTER web page 363 5.0 GLOSSARY AND LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS The terms and abbreviations listed below are used within this CM Plan.
