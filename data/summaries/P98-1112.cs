Finally, we would like to combine our techniques with other indicators to form a more robust system, such as that envisioned in Biber (1989) or suggested in Kessler et al.(1997). Conclusion.

For example, in summarization, Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) and Lin and Hovy (1997) focus on multiword noun phrases.

Identification of such sequences will enable us to assign functions to particular sections of contiguous text in an article, in much the same way that text segmentation program seeks identify topics from distributional vocabulary (Hearst, 1994; Kan et al., 1998).

Karlgren and Cutting (1994) take a computationally tractable set of these properties and use them to compute a score to recognize text genre using discriminant analysis.

We developed two algorithms to: (1) explore WordNet (WN-Verber) to cluster related verbs and build a set of verb chains in a document, much as Morris and Hirst (1991) used Roget's Thesaurus or like Hirst and St.

Wacholder et al.1997, Palmer and Day 1997, Neumann et al.1997). Although rich information on nominal participants, actors, and other entities is provided, the named entity task provides no information on what happened in the document, i.e. the event or action.

Kessler et al.(1997) discuss some of the complexities in automatic detection of genre using a set of computationally efficient cues, such as punctuation, abbreviations, or presence of Latinate suffixes.
