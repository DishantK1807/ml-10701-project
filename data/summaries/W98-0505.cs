also (Bateman, 1991: Bateman et al., 1992; Henschel, 1995; Teich, in press)): the grammatical types in SI:G, however, are functionally rather than surface-syntactically motivated.

as an example of constituency-only approaches, works quite well with information structure (Section 3.2), and â€¢ why HPSG, a hybrid model, works well for agreement (Section 3.3). 3.1 Coordinate structure: the limit of dependency in WG Word grammar (Hudson, 1984; Fraser and Hudson, 1992) strives to account for all grammatical relations by head-dependent relations.

Here, the following are considered in particular as representatives of these three types: Word Grammar (Hudson, 1984) (henceforth w(;) as an example of dependency approaches, Categorial Grammar (co) (e.g., (Steedman, 1985; Steedman, 1987; Uszkoreit, 1986) as an example of constituency approaches, and Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HI'SO) (Pollard and Sag, 1987; Pollard and Sag, 1994) as an example of hybrid approaches.
