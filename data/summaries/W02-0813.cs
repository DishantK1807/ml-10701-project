Previous experiments (Ng and Lee, 1996) have explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources to WSD and have concluded that collocational information is more important than syntactic information.

Methods of evaluation that automatically back off from synset to hypernyms (Lin, 1997) would fail to credit the system for “mistagging” an instance with a closely related sense.
P97-1009
This may be a language-dependent feature, as other experiments indicate that additional linguistic pre-processing does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy for languages like Chinese (Dang et al., 2002).
C02-1143
In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
In addition, an automatic named entity tagger (Bikel et al., 1997) was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes.

Additionally, Pedersen (Pedersen, 2001; Pedersen, 2000) has pursued the approach of using simple word bigrams and other linguistically impoverished feature sets for sense tagging, to establish upper bounds on the accuracy of feature sets that do not impose substantial pre-processing requirements.

Under the maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996), evidence from different features can be combined with no assumptions of feature independence.
