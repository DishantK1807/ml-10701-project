A proposal in \[Magerman and Marcus, 1991\] relates to probabilistie parsing.
E91-1004
In this section I briefly discuss two proposals that could be considered "hybrid" approaches, making use of both grammatical structure and lexical co-occurrence, The first of these, \[Hindle, 1990\], continues in the direction suggested at the end of the previous section: rather than using "informants" to approximate structural relationships, lexical eo-oecnrrenee is calculated over structures.

I propose what appears to me to be the most direct probabilistic generalization of lexiealized TAG; a different treatment can be found in \[Schabes, 1992\].
