lexical units which can be terms if a domain expert validates them) are first automatically extracted from the technical document with a Terminology Extraction Software (LEXTER) (Bourigault, 1992).

However, dealing with already linguistic filtered data, (Assadi, 1997) aims at statistically build rough clusters supposing that similar candidate terms have similar expansions.

Works on word similarity and word sense disambiguation are generally based on statistical methods designed for large or even very large corpora (Hindle, 1990; Agirre and Rigau, 1996).
C96-1005 P90-1034
Wrong links due to the polysemy can be easily eliminated with exception rules by comparing selectional patterns and generalized contexts (Basili et al., 1993; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).

figure 1) providing : • terms of a domain, i.e. simple or complex lexical units pointing out accurate concepts in a technical document, (Bourigault, 1992); • semantic links such as the see-also relation.

In (Basili et al., 1997), the lexical knowledge base WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) is used as a bootstrap for verb disambiguation.

Also, the use of other knowledge sources or different methods (Habert et al., 1996) is necessary to increase precision rate and find links between more technical candidate terms.
C96-1083
Dealing with syntactic paraphrase in the general language, (Dras, 1997) propose a similar representation by using the STAG formalism to detect syntactic related sentences.

We are planning to compare the clusters found by our method with the clustering one of (Assadi, 1997) to study how the results overlap and are complementary.
