WordNet in the system described in (Harabagiu et al.2001). a0 the vision of a Web populated by “ontologically” tagged documents which the semantic Web initiative has promoted; in case this vision becomes a reality, it will require a world-wide collaborative work for building interrelated “conceptualisations” of domain specific knowledge a0 the trend in building shallow, modular, and robust natural language processing systems (Abney 1996, Hobbs et al.1996, Ait-Moktar&Chanod 1997, Basili&Zanzotto 2002) which is making them appealing in the context of ontological QA systems, both for text interpretation (Andreasen et al.2002) and for database access (Popescu et al.2003). Given this background, we are investigating a new approach to ontology-based QA in which users ask questions in natural language to knowledge bases of facts extracted from a federation of Web sites and organised in topic map repositories (Garshol 2003).
