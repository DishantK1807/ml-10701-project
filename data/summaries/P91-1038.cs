293 In this paper a new language processor based on a recently proposed augmented chart parsing algorithm (Chien, 1990a) is presented, in which the grammatical approach of unification grammar (Sheiber, 1986) and the statistical approach of Markov language model (Jelinek, 1976) are properly integrated in a preference-first word lattice parsing algorithm.

The proposed language model is composed of a PATR-II-like unification grammar (Sheiber, 1986; Chien, 1990a) and a first-order Markov language model (Jelinek, 1976) and thus, combines many features of the grammatical and statistical language modeling approaches.
C90-2011
The concept of the augmented chart has recently been successfully developed such that it can be used to represent and parse a word lattice (Chien, 1990b).
C90-2011
The purpose of a language processor is then, for an input word lattice, to find the most promising word sequence or sentence hypothesis as the output (Hayes, 1986; Tomita, 1986; O'Shaughnessy, 1989).

The augmented chart (Chien, 1990b) was extended from the conventional chart.
