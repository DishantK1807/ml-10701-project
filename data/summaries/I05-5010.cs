Elsewhere, we have described a text-structuring method in which the options for organising propositions in a text are laid out as a set of constraints, so that acceptable solutions can be enumerated using constraint satisfaction and evaluated using a cost metric (Power et al., 2003).

For instance, a preference to avoid the passive conflicts with the preference to preserve topical coherence, which is expressed by penalizing a ‘salience violation’ — that is, a failure to equate the backward-looking center in a clause with the most salient forward-looking center (i.e., Cb with Cp) (Kibble and Power, 2004).

Much work on paraphrase generation has focussed on lexical variation and syntactic transformation within individual sentences (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Carroll et al., 1999; Dras, 1999; Inui and Nogami, 2001; Kozlowski et al., 2003; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Takahashi et al., 2001; Stede, 1999).

• Avoid discontinuity of reference As Kibble and Power (2004) have shown, centering criteria can be used to penalize solutions with relatively many topic shifts.

This is in contrast to most existing paraphrase generators, which are constrained to vary only the first or second of these levels (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Carroll et al., 1999; Dras, 1999; Inui and Nogami, 2001; Kozlowski et al., 2003; Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Takahashi et al., 2001; Stede, 1999).

First, since centering information is now available (the Cb and Cp of each proposition can be computed), the evaluation of solutions can take account of the centering preferences proposed by Kibble and Power (2004).

Our paraphrase generator links an existing general-purpose discourse parser — DAS (Le Thanh et al., 2004)2 — which builds a discourse tree automatically from an input text, to an existing NLG system —ICONOCLAST (Power et al., 2003) — which generates a wide range of 2Similar parsers have been developed by Marcu (2000) and Corston-Oliver (1998) 78 formulations for a given discourse structure.

To support constraints of this kind one would need a user interface in which the user can select part of the semantic input, perhaps by clicking on the corresponding part of the text, as in a WYSIWYM interface (Power and Scott, 1998); a dialogue box would then appear allowing a range of constraints specifically directed to the selected fragment.

the rhetorical-semantic input We have shown that by defining text-structuring as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, our method allows considerable flexibility and precision in controlling the generation of paraphrases (Power et al., 2003).
