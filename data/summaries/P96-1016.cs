These devices have been popular in computational morphology and computational phonology since the early eighties (Koskenniemi, 1983; Kaplan and Kay, 1994), and more recently in parsing as well (see, e.g., (Gross, 1989; Pereira, 1991; Roche, 1993)).

Synchronization of tree adjoining grammars (TAGs) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber, 1994) are even more powerful than the previous formalisms, and have been applied in machine translation (Abeill6, Schabes, and Joshi, 1990; Egedi and Palmer, 1994; Harbusch and Poller, 1994; Prigent, 1994), natural language generation (Shieber and Schabes, 1991), and theoretical syntax (Abeilld, 1994).

In addition, SynchUVG-DL can be used for modeling the syntax of languages with syntactic constructions which have been argued to be beyond the formal power of TAG, such as scrambling in German and many other languages (Rainbow, 1994) or wh-movement in Kashmiri (Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1995).

Following (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) we will refer to the general approach as synchronous rewriting.

In this respect, the vector derivation tree of UVG-DL is like the derivation tree of tree adjoining grammar and of D-tree grammars (DTG) (Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1995), which is not surprising, since all three formalisms share the same extended domain of locality.

Local Synchronization In this section, we propose a new synchronous system, which is based on local synchronization of unordered vector grammars with dominance links (UVG-DL) (Rambow, 1994).

Recently, variants of SDTS have been proposed as models for simultaneously bracketing parallel corpora (Wu, 1995).
