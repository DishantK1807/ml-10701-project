) and the lexicons handled by MORPHO-2 system are rootor lemma-oriented.
By. lexicon we don't mean only a collection of roots and associated features.
At lexicon level we also encounter the control structures needed for morphological prow.ssi~, morpho-lexical acquisition menus, root modification rules, word-forms synthesis rules, etc.
The services provided by the system may be ch¢.~ified according to the follox;vhag, g o,o,~: morphological model .design, lexi.cal st6ck building and morpho-lexicfil pro6essing(Dumitrescu, 1991).
2 Morphological
Model Design In order to build the mo.rphological model, an inte~ated environment which allows edi'-tmg, viewing and comping the morpholoffical model descrioti6n, is available to the De-fining the morp.ho\].ogical model takes place m several steps, during " .whiCh the lin~afist hfis to specify the following; a) the categories, subcategories, features and their values, in a hierarchical manner b) the paradigmatic descriptions c) the default feature specifications associated to each paradigmatic description d) the lemma entry correspondence, for each paradigmatic description e) the inflectional paradigms and root detection rules.
. The hierarchical de~crip0.'on of features is achieved by correlating several feature sp&ifications.+A feature s pe:#fication is given re, the fo .rna of a,(fe~ture: v~lu 9 ) pair..

In the figure, a V'OREACH node is outlined by a curve drawn over the emerging edges: By trave~ the tree across the longest path_ which starts trom the root node, thru CHOOSE nodes only, th6 selector of a paradigmatic description is obtained (e.g.

Thks way, the lexical level required by the lexical transfer is ensured.
The .last step in.
the morphologi.'cal model description is to inform, me s3~stem about how to buTdd inflexional p~adigms and root detection rules.
For each paradigma_ tic desci-iption the lint~st~ may specify more paradiginatic encfing " families from which t e system then builds the inflectional paradigms.
For the Rom/mian hnguage, there have been identified 136 inflectional paradigtns.
). Bas~l o(n ~'I~e 1.mf198~onal pgradign~ the system will determine the rules for root detection and word-lorm generation.
Such a rule has the follpwing form: < inflexion >: = (< inflectional-paradigm > < slot-number >) with the followin~ meani~_.: a) if a word ends in < inflexion > then 247 ~dae root is what rernaim from the word after dropping the < inflexion > ~dae root belongs to the < inltectional-Lgaradig m > othe contextual-information corresponding to the current word is ~'en by < slot-number > b) g a root belongs to the < inflectional-paradigm > and it is used in the context given by < slot -numlSer > then othe word is obtained-by concatenating the given root with the < inflexion >.
The lexicographer's interface is stric0y deoendent on the Sofpeo-fim~ejCatiomfrom the linguist's interface sifice a'lar~e part of the ormer is built automatically from the spedfications o-f tile latter.
3 Lexical
Stock Building MORPHO-2 lets the lexi.cog~apher define new entries in the lexicon by means of a user-frien ..dly window oriented interface.
Alexicon entry, has the foll6wing formal structure: < entry> :: = (< lemma > (< par a .digm,atic-description-selector > < inflexional-paradigni > ..
< root > < morpho\].ogic-description >),,, (<syntactic-des~ption> < senianfic-description> ) ) ) The fields < lemma >, < _p,gradigmafi'c-deslaJption-selector > and < inflexional-paradigm > have 0ae obvious meaning.
The field < root > may contain one or more roots~Inserting r .oots in the lexicon takes place in such a way that these should inherit the morphologicaI descriptions bel6nging to the slots where they occur.
By < syntactic-description > ~ refer to restrictions on cooccurrence with other words .(or phrases).
In order to slxcify such restrictions for the Roman~ ~6 we have perfor/ned subeategorization of verbs based on their valency, object categories which .they govern(ea,~ a direct object may be an accu~.a.
-tive noun without pre0osition, a reflexive pronoun or a nonfinite form of a verb) and semantic features.The latter allow a noncontextual subcatego.rizati.on (for exarn ple of nouns_) and a contexual one ~ sel~tional resfrictions (ih the case of ve.rbs).
Typically, verb~ have a valency between 1 and 3 (th.
otigh imp&sonaI verbs may have valen .cy 0).
The inlransitive verbs.are claksified accor .ding to semantic criteria (verbs of motion~ state) or by their syntactic usa~ (like predicativi~ auxiliaries, urgpers6nal verbs with dative ).
W'e should-notice that the same verb maybe transitiv 9 or intransitive, accor "ding to its m e.,~fin~; for example a ajuq.
~ (to get to) with the meaniffg a pt/nde (to catch) is trangitive and ~tli th~ mefining aft su~ (tobe enofigh) is h/transitive.
Trivalent.verbs "m.iSlude verbs tgking: ~wo direct., objects which have different meanings and are not coordinated (the first one is doubled by an accusative, personal pronotai).

For each syntactic .des~i.
"ption, the lexicographer ma.y provide one or more semantic degcril~ion~ The <semanti6-clesc0" pfion > field contaim the name oT a case-frame structure placed m a generic-specific hierarchy.
The actual semantic descriI~tious are stored in a separate data area, than the rest of the leficon, and they are managed independently of MORPHO-2.
A lexicon e21itor offers the lekicographer commands for delet~g.
modifying a lexicon entry and ~aen" listing according t 9 different requests with respect to entry fields (Dtffnilxescu,1991).
4 Morpho-Lexical Processing The target natural l,~mguage processing system is the beneficiary of the morpho-lexical processes execut~ byMORPHO-2.
_Wordforms ~ and synf.hesis are mediated b~ a proce.ss interlace.
In the case of 1.~c~..
analysis, if the interface is giyen a sequence_of words, it will return a sequence of morpho-lexical atoms.
"lhe stru~ure of these atoms is presented belo~ (<root> (<lemma> (< para~cMesc0"pfi'on-sclector > < fiaorph~logic .-~:xi.
"l~tion> ....
(< synt~_~c-t~escriptioh> <semandcMgscfi'ption> ) ) ) ) A morphological descriodon contaM~ both contextual and context-free inf6i'mafion.
The former is oOained from en "ding and the latter from the lexicon en_tly corresponding to th~ root.
The information for the other fields from the atom stru~ure is ~ taken from the lexicon entw_ correslx)nding, to the root.
With respect to the result of morphoqogi _c91 congruence and root relxievfl within the lexico~ we may daTsfifv the moroho-lexical atoms as unambiguous, am _b~ru_ous ~ind undetermined.
The unambiguous morlaho-lexical atoms assodate the analyzed word with a single \[emma.
Inthe case of a root which .corr~po.nds to one lemma and ~ more poss~.qgle morpholegi.cal descriflions, for the same para.digmatic description selector, the system will attempt to compact them.
The ambiguous morpfio-lexical atoms come from words to which severaHemmae .may be attached.
The association of a root with several lemmae is possible either due to ambiguity ot category (e.g.
noun vs.
verb) or to apparent homography, gene~at&1193/ the absence of prosodic ma?rkers in the R0hmifi~n Kangt~.
(m6dele, mod6le, ac61e, ficele, modfil, m6dtfl, etc.).
The lX~O_~ iriterpretafions are ordered in such way that those Which come from shorter roots (that means longer ending) have prio.rity.
The undetermined morpho-lexical atoms correspond to words which have no entry in the lexicon.
The atoms generated in this situation have the foll6wing structure: (UNKNOWN < unknown-word> ( < ixm~'ble-root > < morphologicMe.scri'pdon >'~*) The unknown word is associated with aql legal segmentations and for each of them the morphological inf6i'rnation deduced from the identified en "dings is prOcidex\[ Lexical synthesis is the reverse of lexical analysk The process interface ensures conversion of a morpho-lexical atom sefluence into a word _Sg:luence.
The morpho-lekical, synthe.sis requi/es the descri'ption of niorpho-lexical atoms accordifig to the pattern: I.
< entry-identifier > < morpholoKjc .Mesc~.p0.'on > <svntachc-de =riiXion>) .whe~ < entry-identifier > maybe a lemma, a root or a semantic descri~on.
We have to point out that previous to morpho-lexical analysis and svnthe.~" tile target pr~r may co n0g~re the structureot morpho-.lexical atoms according to tlie desired application, by means ot a communication protocol.
5 Implementation
The MORPHO project, started in 1986, has achieved as a first result, a prototype version now available on a PDP-11 compatible computer.
The second version of the system, the one presented in this_~aper, is ing.plemented in C on a IBM-PC.
compah'ble. The network re~ntafion of data and techrfiques used for, implementation, lille lexicon in d_e "_rag using prefixekt virtual B . trees _(b,xsed on which, for 20000 i~seud'o:random generated words, of variable length, retrieval r&l .uires 2 external acxx.sses only), have led to an ave.rage response time of lexical processes, qutte independent of the leficons ~ (for more.details on performance an$1ysis see (Tufts and Dumitrescu,19~)).
