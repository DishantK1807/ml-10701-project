A word-to-word correspondence is often assumed in the pioneering works, and recently Melamed argues that one-toone assumption is not restrictive as it may appear in (Melamed, 2000).

Acuracy and coverage roughly correspond to Melamedâ€™s precision and percent correct respectively (Melamed, 1995).

Pair Extraction We use the same algorithm as (Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000) for acquiring translation pairs.

First, (Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000) also uses dependency relations in the generation of translation units.

Moreover, (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996) extracts an arbitrary length of word correspondences and (Haruno et al., 1996) identifies collocations through word-level sorting.

However, a more fundamental solution may lie in the partial structural matching of parallel sentences (Watanabe et al., 2000).

Three models including a previously proposed one in (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996) are compared in this paper.
