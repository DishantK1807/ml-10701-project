On the other hand, cohesion can also provide context to aid in the resolution of ambiguity as well as in text summarization (Halliday and Hasan 1976; Morris and Hirst 1991; Hearst 1997).

Discourse Markers Among all kinds of information that may be found in a piece of discourse, discourse markers (also known as discourse connectives, clue words (Reichman 1978; Siegel et al.1994) or cue phrases (Grosz et al.1986; Litman 1996) are regarded as the major linguistic deviceavailable for a writer to structure a discourse.

In our experiment, most errors come from tagging non-discourse markers as discourse markers (T'sou et al.1999). This is due to the fact that, similar to the question of cue phrase polysemy (Hirschberg and Litman 1993), many Chinese discourse markers have both discourse senses and alternate sentential senses in different ;utterances.

System Architecture From the perspective of discourse analysis, the study of discourse markers basically involves four distinct but fundamental issues: 1) the occurrence and the frequency of occurrence of discourse markers (Moser and Moore 1995), 2) determining whether a candidate linguistic item is a discourse marker (identification / disambiguation) (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Siegel and McKeown 1994), 3) determination or selection of the discourse function of an identified discourse marker (Moser and Moore 1995), and 4) the coverage capabilities (in terms of levels of embedding) among rhetorical relations, as well as among individual discourse markers.

Results of discourse analysis can be used to solve many important NLP problems such as anaphoric reference (Hirst 1981), tense and aspect analysis (Hwang and Schubert 1992), intention recognition (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Litman and Allen 1990), or'can be directly applied to computational NLP applications such as text abstraction (Ono et al.1994; T'sou et al.1996) and text generation (McKeown 1985; Lin et al.1991). Automatic text abstraction has received considerable attention (see Paice (1990) for a comprehensive review).

Ono et al.(1994), T'sou et al.(1992) and Marcu (1997) focus on discourse structure in summarization using the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST).
