PMI++ is an extended version of (Turney, 2002)’s method for finding the SO label of a phrase (as an attempt to deal with context-sensitive words).

Recognizing the subjective character and polarity of words, phrases or sentences has been addressed by many authors, including (Turney, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003; Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).
P97-1023 W03-0404
Subjective phrases are used by (Turney, 2002; Pang and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Kushal et al., 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004) and others in order to classify reviews or sentences as positive or negative.

As a result, the problem of “opinion mining” has seen increasing attention over the last three years from (Turney, 2002; Hu and Liu, 2004) and many others.

OPINE’s use of meronymy lexico-syntactic patterns is similar to that of many others, from (Berland and Charniak, 1999) to (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004).

Most recently, (Takamura et al., 2005) reports on the use of spin models to infer the semantic orientation of words.
P05-1017
In each case, OPINE makes use of local constraints on label assignments (e.g., conjunctions and disjunctions constraining the assignment of SO labels to words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997)).
P97-1023
While other systems, such as (Hu and Liu, 2004; Turney, 2002), have addressed these tasks to some degree, OPINE is the first to report results.

This idea is similar to that of (Kim and Hovy, 2004) and (Hu and Liu, 2004), but instead of using a window of size k or the output of a noun phrase chunker, OPINE takes advantage of the syntactic dependencies computed by the MINIPAR parser.
