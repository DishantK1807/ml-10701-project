A distinct line of research has explored methods for automatically generating language that varies along personality dimensions, targeting applications such as computer gaming and educational virtual worlds (Andr´e et al., 2000; Isard et al., 2006; Loyall and Bates, 1997; Piwek, 2003; Walker et al., 1997) inter alia.

Research by Andr´e et al.(2000); Piwek (2003) uses personality variables to affect the linguistic behaviour of conversational agents, but they did not systematically manipulate parameters, and their generators were not evaluated.

Additionally, the position of the claim affects the persuasiveness of an argument (Carenini and Moore, 2000): starting with the claim facilitates the hearer’s understanding, while finishing with the claim is more effective if the hearer disagrees.

Paiva and Evans’ trainable generator (2005) produces outputs that correspond to a set of linguistic variables measured in a corpus of target texts.

The closest work to ours is probably Isard et al.’s CRAG2 system (2006), which overgenerates and ranks using ngram language models trained on a corpus labelled for all Big Five personality dimensions.

operations SPaRKy aggregation operations are used (See Stent et al.(2004)), with additional operations for concessions and restatements.

Findings and PERSONAGE Parameters We hypothesize that personality can be made manifest in evaluative speech acts in any dialogue domain, i.e. utterances responding to requests to RECOMMEND or COMPARE domain entities, such as restaurants or movies (Isard et al., 2006; Stent et al., 2004).

Realization is achieved with the RealPro surface realizer (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).
