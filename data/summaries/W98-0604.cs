extraction systems use either parsing combined with some form of syntactic regularization, or a meta-rule mechanism to automatically match variants of clausal syntactic structures (active main clause, passive, relative clause etc.), e.g., FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1995) and the Proteus Extraction System (Grishman, 1995).
