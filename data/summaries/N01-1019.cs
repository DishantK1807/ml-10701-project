2.2. Linguistic Transfer The linguistic transfer procedure is implemented as a rewrite-grammar using the special-purpose Grammar Programming Language (GPL) (Duan, et al.2000, Franz, et al.2000a). The general role of the transfer grammar is to operate on the input feature structure in a recursive manner, and to perform source-to-target transfer by invoking the example matching procedure, and by using the translation examples to construct a target-language feature structure.
