The corpus was split into training and test data as described in Charniak and Johnson (2001).

corpus construction We tried to incorporate the binned prosodic information described in the previous subsection in a manner that corresponds as closely as possible to the way that punctuation is represented in this corpus, because previous experiments have shown that punctuation improves parser performance (Charniak and Johnson, 2001; Engel et al., 2002).
N01-1016 W02-1007
We evaluated parser performance using the methodology described in Engel et al.(2002), which is a simple adaptation of the well-known PARSEVAL measures in which punctuation and prosody preterminals are ignored.

Even though this seems linguistically highly unnatural (e.g., punctuation might indicate suprasegmental prosodic properties), statistical parsers generally perform signi cantly better when their training and test data contains punctuation represented in this way than if the punctuation is stripped out of the training and test data (Charniak, 2000; Engel et al., 2002; Johnson, 1998).
