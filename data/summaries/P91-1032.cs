Augmented phrase structure grammar (APSG) formalisms, such as unification-based grammars (Shieber, 1985a), can express many of those regularities, but they are computationally less suitable for language modeling, because of the inherent cost of computing state transitions in APSG parsers.

Analysis In addition to the cases of left-linear and rightlinear grammars discussed in Section 3, our algorithm is exact in a variety of interesting cases, including the examples of Church and Patil (1982), which illustrate how typical attachment ambiguities arise as structural ambiguities on regular string sets.

Work and Conclusions Our work can be seen as an algorithmic realization of suggestions of Church and Patil (1980; 1982) on algebraic simplifications of CFGs of regular languages.

2Unification-based grammars not in this class would have to be weakened first, using techniques akin to those of Sato and Tamaki (1984), Shieber (1985b) and Haas (1989).

In contrast, our method will produce an exact FSA for many interesting grammars generating regular languages, such as those arising from systematic attachment ambiguities (Church and Patil, 1982).

246 2 The Algorithm Our approximation method applies to any context-free grammar (CFG), or any unificationbased grammar (Shieber, 1985a) that can be fully expanded into a context-free grammar.
