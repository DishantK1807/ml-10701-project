4:31	Her research in recent years has focused on the application of lexical  semantic  knowledge  in  such  areas  of NLP  as  spoken  dialogue  summarization, information retrieval, and question answering for educational purposes, e.g. electronic career guidance, or question answering based on question-answer repositories in Web 2.0 applied to e-Learning.
5:31	Her areas of expertise include algorithms for computational lexical semantics and user-generated discourse processing.
6:31	She guided the development of the high-performance  Java-based  Wikipedia  and  Wiktionary  APIs  as  well  as  projects  in collaborative annotation, information filtering and sentiment analysis for eLearning.
7:31	Delphine Bernhard(delphine@tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de) Delphine Bernhard is a senior researcher in the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab at the  University  of  Darmstadt.
8:31	She  obtained  her  PhD  in  2006  from  the  Universit  de Grenoble I, where she worked on terminology extraction from domain specific texts and unsupervised morphological analysis.
9:31	Her current work focuses on the improvement of question answering to meet the specific needs of learners.
10:31	Her further research projects include NLP for user generated discourse and quality assessment of social media contents.
11:31	iii Outline Typical  Web  2.0  tools  such  as  wikis,  blogs,  and  podcasts  have  recently  entered  the classroom and foster interactions between learners and tutors, within the new eLearning 2.0 paradigm.
12:31	As a result, eLearning 2.0 makes large amounts of eLearning discourse available for NLP within the field of research that we call "Educational Natural Language Processing" (e-NLP).
13:31	Research on e-NLP has existed for a long time and has focused on e.g. automatic dialogue-based tutoring systems (Litman & Forbes-Riley, 2006), or essay scoring (Attali & Burstein, 2006).
14:31	Moreover, several workshops on "Building Educational Applications  Using  NLP"  and  related  topics  have  already  taken  place  at  major  NLP conferences, such as HLT-NAACL 2003, COLING 2004, ACL 2005 and ACL 2008.
15:31	Educational  applications  are  particularly  challenging  for  NLP  since  they  require  an adaptation and practical application of NLP techniques to various types of discourse, e.g. tutoring dialogues which are different from typical task-oriented spoken dialogue systems.
16:31	Moreover, educational applications place strong requirements  on NLP systems, which have to be robust yet accurate.
17:31	Therefore, this is an important application domain and a source of innovation for NLP as a field, as shown by recent works from Feng et al.18:31	(2006), Kim et al.19:31	(2006), Malioutov & Barzilay (2006), Mihalcea & Csomai (2007), to name just a few.
20:31	In this tutorial, we will review a variety of uses of NLP in the educational domain and point to emerging trends which call for new types of applications.
21:31	The tutorial will be relevant to a  broad  audience  of  NLP  researchers  interested  in  applying  NLP  techniques  to  new challenging domains, such as eLearning.
