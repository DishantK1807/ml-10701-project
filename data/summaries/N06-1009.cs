To create a hypothesis about the entity type of a word, SNoW first takes advantage of “words, tags, conjunctions of words and tags, bigram and trigram of words and tags”, number of words in the entity, bigrams of words in the entity, and some attributes such as the prefix and suffix, as well as information about the presence of the word in a dictionary of people, organization, and location names (Roth and Yih, 2002).

Roth and Yih (2002) present results that support this hypothesis.

In the biomedical domain, NER has focused on identification of biological entities such as genes and proteins (Collier et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2002).

Work In the literature, named entities such as people, places, and organizations mentioned in news articles have been successfully identified by various approaches (Bikel et al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Riloff and Jones, 1996; Collins and Singer, 1999; Hobbs et al., 1996).

We compare this approach with three others: a heuristic rule-based approach (Douglass, 2005), the SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) system’s NER component (Roth and Yih, 2002), and IdentiFinder (Bikel et al., 1999).

Various statistical approaches, e.g., a maximum entropy model (Finkel et al., 2004), HMMs and SVMs (GuoDong et al., 2005), have been used with various feature sets including surface and syntactic features, word formation patterns, morphological patterns, part-of-speech tags, head noun triggers, and coreferences.
