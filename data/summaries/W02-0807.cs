(For bar, in NODE, there were 13 entries where bar was the first word in an MWU and 50 entries where it was the head noun; for begin, there was only one entry.) The NODE dictionaries were then mapped into the WordNet dictionaries (see Litkowski, 1999), using overlap among words and semantic relations.
