The remainder of the research has been seeking to develop praodeal large-scale methods to extract syntactic information from MRD entries (e.g., Boguraev and Briscoe 1987) and transform that information into a format suitable for other users.

"llle semantic information is extracted from LDOCE dictionary entries using a large-scale parser that isolates the genus mad differentia terms in each entry, expanding upon other similar work (e.g., Chodorow, Heidom, and Byrd 1985; Alshawi, Boguraev, and Briscoe 1985; Boguraev and Briscoe 1987; Binot and Jensen 1987).

This difference in attitudes regarding the knowledge acquisition bottleneck is reflected in a lnng-standing difference between two alternative methods of lexicon building: the demo approach and the book approach (Miller 1985; a similar distinction appears in Amsler 1982).

Some of the above research has been into the underlying semantic structure of dictionaries (e.g., Amsler and White 1979; Arnsler 1980, 1981; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985).

Recently, interest in the book approach has greatly expanded because a number of MRDs have become available, each causing a flurry of research interest, e.g., The Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dict/onary (Amsler and White 1979; Amsler 1980, 1981), Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary (Evens and Smith 1983; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens 1986; Binot and lensen 1987), and The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Michiels, Mullenders, and Noel 1980; Michiels and Noel 1982; Walker and Amsler 1986; Boguraev,.Briscoe, Carroll, Carter, and Grover 1987; Boguraev and Briscoe 1987; Wilks, Fass, Guo, McDonald, Plate, and Slator 1987).
