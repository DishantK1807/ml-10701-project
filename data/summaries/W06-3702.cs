Even though statistical systems exhibit many desirable properties (purely datadriven, domain independence), grammar-based systems utilizing probabilistic context-free grammar tuning appear to deliver better results when training data is sparse (Rayner et al., 2005a).

In previous studies (Rayner et al., 2005a; Starlander et al., 2005), we showed that the grammar-based recognizer performs much better than the statistical one on in-coverage utterances, and rather worse on out-of-coverage ones.

Regulus supports rapid construction of complex grammar-based language models using an example-based method (Rayner et al., 2003; Rayner et al., 2006), which extracts most of the structure of the model from a general linguistically motivated resource grammar.

Resource grammars are now available for several languages, including English, Japanese (Rayner et al., 2005b), French (Bouillon et al., 2006) and Spanish.

We have focused on performance metrics defined in terms of recognition and translation quality, and tested the system on na√Øve users without any medical background (Bouillon et al., 2005; Rayner et al., 2005a; Starlander et al., 2005).
