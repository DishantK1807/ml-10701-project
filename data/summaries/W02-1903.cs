Some QA systems participating in TREC use a shallow linguistic knowledge and start from similar approaches as used in MURAX (Vicedo and Ferrándex (2000)).

works The current QA approaches can be classified into two groups; text-snippet extraction methods and noun-phrase extraction methods (also called closed-class QA) (Vicedo and Ferrándex (2000)).

However, it is difficult for the system to be converted into other domains because the system uses syntactic and semantic information that only covers a very limited domain (Vicedo and Ferrándex (2000)).
