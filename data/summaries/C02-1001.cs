This problem is usually handled by adding special symbols to the dictionary to remove the ambiguity in order to be able to apply the determinization algorithm (Koskenniemi, 1990).

fnsmaili, pcardinal, gboulian, Pierre.Dumouchelg@crim.ca Abstract The objective of this work is to disambiguate transducers which have the following form: T = R D and to be able to apply the determinization algorithm described in (Mohri, 1997).

and future work We have been able to disambiguate an important class of cyclic and ambiguous transducers, which allows us to apply the determinization algorithm (Mohri, 1997); and then to reduce the size of those transducers.
