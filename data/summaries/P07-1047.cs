This situation is very similar to the training process of translation models in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where parallel corpus is used to find the mappings between words from different languages by exploiting their co-occurrence patterns.

Finally, the translation model can be formalized as the following optimization problem argmaxΘ logPr(D;Θ) s.t. mwsummationdisplay j=1 Pr(wj|ok) = 1,∀k This optimization problem can be solved by the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993).
