Using the FST notation of Eisner (1997a), the implementation for this constraint would be the following FST: \[/0 N/0 X/0 where X represents ".E*-((in or begin all 7k) (in all 7k))," N represents "((in all 7k) A -~(in all ai) A -~(in some/3j))," B represents "((in all 9,k) A (in some/3j))," A represents "((in all 7k) A (in all cq) A -~(in some/3j))," \[ represents "((in or begin all 9,k) (in all 9,k))," and \] represents "((in or end all 9,k) (in all 9,k))".

However, for certain types of constraints, translation into the primitives of OTP (Eisner (1997b)) can only be accomplished by adding to the grammar a number of ad hoc phonological tiers.

edu Abstract This paper proposes an expansion of set of primitive constraints available within the Primitive Optimality Theory framework (Eisner, 1997a).

Implication 2.1 Motivation OWP as described in Eisner (1997a) provides some support for correspondence constraints (input-output only).

primitives of OTP without reference to ad hoc tiers, and proposes a formalization of these constraints that is compatible with the finite state model described in Eisner (1997a) and Albro (1998).

The same is true for the implementation described in Eisner (1997a), although a proposal is given there for a method that might improve the situation.
P97-1040
Primitive Optimality Theory (OTP) (Eisner, 1997a), and extensions to it (e.g., Albro (1998)), can be useful as a formal system in which phonological analyses can be implemented and evaluated.
