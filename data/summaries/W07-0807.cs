Words From an information retrieval (IR) perspective, foreign words in Arabic can be classi ed into two general categories: translated and transliterated (Nwesri et al., 2006).
W06-1631
Finally, we incorporated these transliterations into a list with 35 949 unique Arabic native words prepared by Nwesri et al.(2006). 5 Algorithms We propose three algorithms to identify foreign words in Arabic text.

A change in character sets compounds the problem: for instance, there are at least 32 English forms for the Arabic name of the Libyan leader Kadda,1 and Nwesri et al.(2006) have identied 28 different spellings for the name of the former Serbian president Milosevic in the eleventh Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Arabic newswire collection.

Similarity is normalised by dividing the length of the common subsequence by the length of the longer string (Melamed, 1995).
