In the Knowledge Delivery System (KDS) Mann & Moore (1981) use a hillclimbing algorithm to determine which propositions should be combined into complex sentences.

5. RELATED WORK IN GENERATION Derr & McKeown (1984) directly address the generation of complex sentences; however, they restrict the criteria for combining propositions to focus and shared arguments.

Davey (1974) and Kukich (1985) both simplify their approach to the problem by completely predetermining how propositions may be combined into complex sentences.

We further show that many earlier approaches to generating complex sentences (Derr & McKeown, 1984; Davey, 1974; Kukich, 1985; Mann & Moore, 1981) have architectural limitations that would keep them from handling these types of constructions with any generality.
