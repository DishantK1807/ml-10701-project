Then the correspondent structures in different languages are aligned (e.g., Kaji, Kida & Morimoto 1992; Matsumoto et al.1993; Grishman 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000).

Crossing Constraint According to (Wu, 1997), crossing constraint can be defined in the following.

Works Most of the previous works conduct structure alignment with complex, hierarchical structures, such as phrase structures (e.g., Kaji, Kida & Morimoto, 1992), or dependency structures (e.g., Matsumoto et al.1993; Grishman, 1994; Meyers, Yanharber & Grishman 1996; Watanabe, Kurohashi & Aramaki 2000).

To deal with the difficulties in parse-to-parse matching, Wu (1997) utilizes inversion transduction grammar (ITG) for bilingual parsing.
