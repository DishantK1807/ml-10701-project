strong and that weakening them results in better models of language (Johnson, 1998; Gildea, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2003).

This is similar to the latent nonterminals used in Matsuzaki et al.(2005), but because the latent variable we use is global, our approach is more oriented toward learning non-local structure.

Compared to a basic treebank grammar (Charniak, 1996), the grammars of highaccuracy parsers weaken independence assumptions by splitting grammar symbols and rules with either lexical (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999) or nonlexical (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005) conditioning information.

Klein and Manning (2003) refer to this grammar as a markovized grammar of vertical order = 2 and horizontal order = 1.

We follow Gildea (2001) in using the ninth and tenth sentences of every block of ten as validation and test data, respectively, because a contiguous test section might not be representative due to the genre variation.

Correlations at short distances have been captured effectively in previous work (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003); vertical markovization (annotating nonterminals with their ancestor symbols) does this by simply producing a different distribution for each set of ancestors.

As is true for many other grammar formalisms in which there is a derivation / parse distinction, an alternative to finding the most probable parse is to find the most probable derivation (Vijay-Shankar and Joshi, 1985; Bod, 1992; Steedman, 2000).
