For example, the English verb classification has been used for applications such as machine translation (Dorr, 1997), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998).

Clustering is applicable to a variety of areas in Natural Language Processing, e.g. by utilising class type descriptions such as in machine translation (Dorr, 1997), word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), and document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), or by applying clusters for smoothing such as in machine translation (Prescher et al., 2000), or probabilistic grammars (Riezler et al., 2000).

Various attempts have been made to infer conveniently observable morpho-syntactic and semantic properties for English verb classes (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata, 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999; Schulte im Walde, 2000; McCarthy, 2001).

Related work on English verb classification or clustering utilised supervised learning by decision trees (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), or a method related to hierarchical clustering (Schulte im Walde, 2000).

This is similar to the perspective of (Vilain et al., 1995), who present, in the context of the MUC co-reference evaluation scheme, a model-theoretic measure of the similarity between equivalence classes.
