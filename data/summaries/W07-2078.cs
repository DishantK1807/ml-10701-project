arg max Sj = k?? i=1 { 1 i if Ci = Sj0 otherwise (1) The UBC group used a combination of kNN classiers trained over a large set of features, and enhanced this method using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for their supervised submission (UBCALM) to the lexical-sample and all-words subtasks (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2007).

The goal for SemEval-2007 task 2 (Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems)(Agirre and Soroa, 2007) is to automatically discriminate the senses of English target words by the use of only untagged data.

Sections 3 and 4 presents in more detail the implementation of the framework for the Semeval2007 WEPS task (Artiles et al., 2007) and Semeval2007 sense induction task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), respectively.

In order to obtain the vector representation for each of the word contexts (documents, cases) given by the organizers of the SemEval-2007 task, we used the features extracted by the UBC-ALM participating group (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle, 2007).

number of classifiers (TDi) Based on previous experiments carried out for document categorization (Zelaia et al., 2006), we decided to create 30 classifiers for some words and 50 for others, i.e. 30 or 50 individual k-NN algorithms will be used by the multiclassifier in order to combine opinions by Bayesian voting.
