c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Answering questions of Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task using ellipsis handling of follow-up questions Junichi Fukumoto Department of Media Technology Ritsumeikan University 1-1-1 Nojihigashi, Kusatsu, Shiga 525-8577 Japan fukumoto@media.ritsumei.ac.jp Abstract In this paper, we propose ellipsis handling method for follow-up questions in Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task of NTCIR QAC3.
In this method, our system classi es ellipsis patterns of question sentences into three types and recognizes elliptical elements using ellipsis handling algorithm for each type.
In the evaluation using Formal Run and Reference Run data, there were several cases which our algorithm could not handle ellipsis correctly.
According to the analysis of evaluation results, the main reason of low performance was lack of word information for recognition of referential elements.
If our system can recognize word meanings correctly, some errors will not occur and ellipsis handling works well.
1 Introduction
In question answering task QAC of NTCIR (Kato et al., 2005)(Kato et al., 2004), interactive use of question answering is proposed as one of evaluation task called Information Access Dialogue (IAD) task, which was called subtask3 in QAC1,2.
In IAD task, a set of question consists of one rst question and several follow-up questions.
These series of questions and answers comprise an information access dialogue.
In QAC1, there was only one follow-up question in a series of questions, but in QAC2 and 3 there were several follow-up questions.
All follow-up questions have anaphoric expressions including zero anaphora which is frequently occurs in Japanese.
There were several approaches to answer follow-up questions.
One approach was to extract answers of follow-up questions from documents which were retrieved using clue words of the rst question (Sasaki et al., 2002).
In the other approach, they added clue words extracted from the previous questions to clue words of follow-up question for document retrieval (Murata et al., 2002).
However, when topic was changed in a series of questions, these approaches did not work well because clue words of the previous questions were not always effective to extract answer of the current question.
Our approach is to handle ellipses of follow-up questions and apply the processed questions to ordinary question answering system which extracts answers of a question (Fukumoto et al., 2002)(Fukumoto et al., 2004)(Matsuda and Fukumoto, 2005).
For QAC3, we have improved our previous approach to handle follow-up questions, that is, we have expanded ellipsis handling rules more precisely.
Based on the analysis of evaluation results of QAC2, we have classi ed ellipsis pattern of question sentences into three types.
The rst type is ellipsis using pronoun.
This is the case that a word used in previous questions is replaced with pronoun.
The second type is ellipsis of word in verb’s obligatory case elements in the follow-up question.
Some obligatory case elements of a verb of a follow-up question will be omitted and such elements also used in the previous question.
The last type is ellipsis of a modi er or modi cand in a follow-up question.
Such an ele41 ment appears in the previous question and has modi cation relationship with some word in the followup question sentence.
In order to handle the above three ellipsis types, we utilized case information of main verb of a question and co-occurrence of nouns to recognize which case information is omitted.
We used co-occurrence dictionary which was developed by Japan Electric Dictionary Research Inc.
(EDR) (EDR, ).
As for core QA system which is our main question answering system, we have integrated previous systems modules which are developed for QAC2.
One module is to handle numeric type questions.
It analyzes co-occurrence data of unit expression and their object names and detects an appropriate numeric type.
Another module uses detailed classi cation of Named Entity for non numerical type questions such as person name, organization name and so on to extract an answer element of a given question.
In the following sections, we will show the details of analysis of elliptical question sentences and our new method of ellipsis handling.
We will also discuss our system evaluation on ellipsis handling.
2 Ellipsis
handling In this section, we explain what kinds of ellipsis patterns exist in the follow-up questions of a series of questions and how to resolve each ellipsis to apply them to core QA system.
2.1 Ellipsis
in questions We have analyzed 319 questions (46sets) which were used in subtask3 of QAC1 and QAC2 and then, classi ed ellipsis patterns into 3 types as follows: Replacing with pronoun In this pattern, pronoun is used in a follow-up question and this pronoun refers an element or answer of the previous question.
Ex1-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex1-2 a24a26a25a28a27a17a29a31a30a33a32a35a34 a7a12a14a12a36a38a37a8a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (When did it become independent?) In the above example, pronoun a24a4a25 (it) of question Ex1-2 refers a word a0a31a1a15a3a6a5 (America) of question Ex1-1.
The question Ex1-2 should be a0a12a1a41a3a42a5 a27a43a29a38a30a44a32a45a34 a7a23a14a40a36a40a37a12a18a38a20a31a21a46a22 (When does America become independent)? in a completed form.
Ex2-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex2-2 a47 a7a39a48a35a49a12a50a41a14a52a51 a25 a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Where is his birth place?) In the above example, pronoun a47 (his) of question Ex2-2 refers an answer word a53a55a54a17a56a31a57 (J.
Bush) of question Ex2-1.
The question Ex2-2 should be a53a40a54a58a56a35a57 a7a23a48a59a49a43a50a26a14a55a51 a25 a18a17a20a38a21a43a22 (Where is J.
Bush’s birth place)? in a completed form.
Ellipsis of an obligatory case element of verb In this pattern, an obligatory case element verb in follow-up question is omitted, and the omitted element refers an element or answer of the previous question.
An example of this pattern is as follows: Ex3-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex3-2 a36a38a37a46a60a31a61 a32a43a62a63a32a28a34 a21a23a22 (When did φ inaugurate?) In the above example, the verb a60a63a61a41a20a4a64 (inaugurate) has two obligatory case frames agent and goal, and the elements of each case frame are omitted.
The element of agent is the answer of Ex3-1, and the element of goal is a9a19a11a19a13 (the President) of Ex3-1.
Therefore, Ex3-2 should be (the answer of Ex3-1) a14a38a36a40a37a46a9a23a11a23a13a15a65a35a60a12a61 a32a28a62a55a32 a34 a21a46a22 (When did (the answer of Ex3-1) inaugurated as the President)?
. Ellipsis of a modi er or modi cand This pattern is the case of ellipsis of modi er.
When there is modi cation relation between two words of a question, either of them (modifying element or the modi ed element) modi es an element of the next question but is omitted.
We call the modifying element modi er and we call the modi ed element modi cand.
The following example shows ellipsis of modi er.
Ex4-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex4-2 a66a10a67a2a68a15a69 a14a28a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is a minister of state?) In the above example, the word a0a23a1a55a3a58a5 (America) is modi er of a9a39a11a8a13 (the president) in the question Ex4-1.
Then, the word a0a19a1a4a3a70a5 (America) also modi es a66a43a67a2a68a52a69 (a minister of state) 42 of Ex4-2 and is also omitted.
The question Ex4-2 should be a0a12a1a15a3a58a5a23a7 a66a45a67a38a68a26a69 a14a71a16a8a18a46a20a23a21a72a22 (Who is a minister of state of America)?
. The following example shows ellipsis of modi cand.
Ex5-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex5-2 a73a12a74a63a75a45a76 a14a28a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is φ of France?) In this example, the word a9a40a11a46a13 (the president) is modi cand of the word a0a39a1a77a3a59a5 (America) in the question Ex5-1.
In the question Ex5-2, the word a73a8a74a55a75a35a76 (France) should modi es the word a9 a11a2a13 (the president) which is omitted in the question Ex5-2.
Then the question Ex5-2 should be a73 a74a39a75a35a76 a7a35a9a23a11a23a13a15a14a28a16a39a18a40a20a2a21a46a22 (Who is the president of France)?
. 2.2 How to resolve ellipsis 2.2.1 Overview of the method We will show ellipsis resolution method of these three patterns.
For the rst pattern, we replace the pronoun with a word which referred by it.
For the second pattern, we try to ll up obligatory case frames of the verb.
For the third pattern, we take a word from the previous question based on cooccurrence frequency.
We assumed that the antecedent of an elliptical question exists in a question which appears just before, so the previous question indicates immediately previous question in our method.
We show the process as follows: Step1 Estimate the pattern of ellipsis: When a follow-up question has pronoun, this is the case of the rst pattern.
When a follow-up question has some verb which has an omitted case element, this is the case of the second pattern.
When a follow-up question has no pronoun and such a verb, this is the case of the third pattern.
Step2 Estimate kinds of the omitted word: Step2a When the ellipsis pattern is the rst pattern: Estimate the kind of word which the pronoun refers.
When the pronoun directly indicates kinds of word (ex: a47 : he), depend on it.
If the pronoun does not directly indicate kinds of word (ex: a24 a7 :its +noun), use the kind of the word which exists just behind the pronoun.
Step2b When the ellipsis pattern is the second pattern: Estimate obligatory case frame of the verb of the follow-up question.
Then, estimate omitted element of the case frame and the type of the element.
Step2c When the ellipsis pattern is the third pattern: Get a noun X which appears with Japanese particle a14 (ha) 1 in the follow-up question.
When compound noun appears with a14 (ha), the last word is assumed to be X.
Then, collect words which are modi er or modi cand of X from corpus.
If the same word as collected words is in the previous question, take over the word and skip step3.
Otherwise, estimate the kind of word which is suitable to modi er (or modi cand) of X.
Estimate the kind of collected modi ers and modi cands, and adopt one which has the highest frequency.
Step3 Decide the succeeded word of the previous question: Estimate type of answer of previous question 2 and kind of each word used in previous question from rear to front.
When a word has a kind t for the estimate in step2, take the word to follow-up question.
2.2.2 EDR
thesauruses dictionary We have used thesauruses of EDR dictionary to estimate the kind of words, obligatory case frame of verbs, omitted element of case frame, and to collect modi er and modi cand of a word.
Details are as follows: Estimation of word type We used EDR Japanese Word Dictionary and EDR Concept Dictionary.
Japanese Word Dictionary records Japanese words and its detailed concept as Concept Code, and Concept Dictionary records each Concept Code and its upper concept.
We check a target word using Japanese Word Dictionary and 1This particle is used as topic marker in Japanese.
2Use core QA’s module 43 get its detailed concept code.
Then, we generalize type of the word using concept code of Concept Dictionary.
For example, concept code of a word a78a12a79 (company) is 3ce735 which means a group of people combined together for business or trade. We will check its upper concept using Concept Dictionary, for example, upper concept of 3ce735 is 4449f5, upper concept of 4449f5 is 30f74c, and so on.
Finally, we can get word type of 3ce735 as 3aa912 which means agent (self-functioning entity) . Therefore, we can estimate that type of word a78a23a79 (company) is an agent.
Estimation of obligatory case frame of verb and omitted element We will use EDR Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary for estimation of omitted case element.
Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary contains information of verb case frame and concept code with Japanese particle for each case.
We will check obligatory case frame and omitted element.
Firstly, we check a verb with Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary and get its case frame, concept code and particle information.
Then we can recognize omitted case element by particle information and estimate word type of omitted element.
For example, according to the Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary, a verb a60a15a61a4a20a80a64 (inaugurate) has two case frames, agent (30f6b0) and goal (3f98cb or 3aa938), and agent is used with particle a27 (ga), goal is used with particle a65 (ni) . If question doesn’t have any a27 (ga) or a65 (ni) (ex: a36 a37a10a60a23a61 a32a45a62a39a32a59a34 a21a72a22 (When did φ inaugurate)?
), we estimate that agent and goal are omitted.
Then, we estimate kind of the omitted element same as Estimation of kind of words . Collection of modi er and modi cand Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary contains Japanese co-occurrence data of various modi cations.
We will use the co-occurrence data to collect modi er or modi cand of word X.
Details as follows: 1.
Search X a7 (no) noun (noun of X) and noun a7 (no) X (X of noun) pattern from Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary 2.
When Y appears in the Y a7 (no) X (X of Y) pattern, we can estimate Y as modi er of X.
3. When Y appears in the X a7 (no) Y (Y of X) pattern, we can estimate Y as modi cand of X.
2.2.3 Examples
of ellipsis handling We will show above examples of ellipsis handling in the following.
Example of ellipsis handling of rst pattern3 Ex1-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a2a11a12a13a52a14a28a16a63a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex1-2 a24a26a25a28a27a17a29a31a30a33a32a28a34 a7a2a14a38a36a12a37a31a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (When did it become independent?) Ex1-2’ a0a2a1a4a3a6a5 a27a17a29a31a30a33a32a28a34 a7a2a14a38a36a12a37a31a18a12a20a2a21a40a22 (When did America become independent?) In the above example, Ex1-2 has a pronoun a24a39a25 (it), so we classi ed ellipsis pattern of Ex1-2 into the rst pattern.
Pronoun a24a55a25 (it) refers organization or location by information of pronoun.
The word a0a19a1a4a3a59a5 (America) has information of location but the word a9a31a11a31a13 (the president) are not organization or location.
Then we can estimate that pronoun a24a26a25 (it) of Ex1-2 refers the word a0a8a1 a3a59a5 (America) of Ex1-1.
Question Ex1-2 should be a0a63a1a81a3a28a5a26a7a46a9a19a11a19a13a82a14a40a16a41a18a39a20a55a21a2a22 (Who is the president of America)?
. Example of ellipsis handling of second pattern Ex3-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a2a11a12a13a52a14a28a16a63a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex3-2 a36a38a37a46a60a31a61 a32a43a62a15a32a35a34 a21a40a22 (When did he inaugurated?) Ex3-2’ (answer of Ex3-1) a14a23a36a23a37a46a9a31a11a31a13a52a65 a60a31a61 a32a43a62a15a32a35a34 a21a40a22 (When did (answer of Ex3-1) inaugurated?) In the above example, Ex3-2 has a verb a60a39a61a63a20 a64 (inaugurate), so we classi ed ellipsis pattern of Ex3-2 into the second pattern.
The word a60a19a61a26a20 a64 (inaugurate) has two obligatory case: agent (human) and goal (managerial position).
Ex3-2 doesn’t have word which is suitable for obligatory cases of a60a31a61a26a20a41a64 (inaugurate) . Therefore we estimate that the agent and the goal are omitted.
Then, we estimate answer type of Ex3-1 and kind of each word of Ex3-1.
The answer type of Ex3-1 is human, so it 3Exm-n’ indicates complemented question of Exm-n 44 is suitable for the agent.
The kind of a9a39a11a2a13 (the president) is managerial position, so it is suitable for the goal.
Finally, we take the answer of Ex31 and a9a31a11a8a13 (the president) to Ex3-2 and Ex3-2 becomes (answer of Ex3-1) a14a2a36a31a37a38a9a2a11a8a13a4a65a28a60a39a61 a32a28a62a55a32a35a34 a21a38a22 (When did (answer of Ex3-1) inaugurated)?
. Example of ellipsis handling of third pattern Ex4-1 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a2a11a12a13a52a14a28a16a63a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (Who is the president of America?) Ex4-2 a66a10a67a2a68a15a69 a14a28a16a63a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (Who is a minister of state?) Ex4-2’ a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7 a66a43a67a12a68a52a69 a14a17a16a19a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who is a minister of state of America?) In the above example, Ex4-2 doesn’t have any pronoun and verb, so we classi ed ellipsis pattern of Ex4-2 into the third pattern.
Then we search noun a7 a66a43a67a2a68a41a69 (a minister of noun) and a66a43a67a31a68a41a69 a7 noun (noun of a minister) pattern from the Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary.
In the Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary, we can nd a0a12a1a41a3a42a5a23a7 a66a45a67a23a68a63a69 (a minister of America) pattern.
a0a8a1a41a3a6a5 (America) is used in Ex4-1, so we take over a0a26a1a83a3a45a5 (America) to Ex4-2 and Ex4-2 becomes a0a39a1a82a3 a5a8a7 a66a17a67a8a68a77a69 a14a17a16a55a18a31a20a19a21a38a22 (Who is a minister of state of America)?
. 3 Evaluation 3.1 Evaluation method We have evaluated our QA system only on ellipses handling.
The following example shows question sets of the Formal Run and Reference Run.
In Qmn, m and n indicates series ID and its question number which we gave and Rm-n indicates a question which correspond to Qm-n.

Fuji radar get?) (QAC3-31270-01) In IAD task, one series of questions consists of the rst question and several follow-up questions which contain ellipsis.
In our current implementation, we assumed that antecedent of an elliptical question exists in its just before question.
For example, the antecedent of Q1-2 is a84a8a85a108a86a80a87a10a88a15a89a8a88 (Mt.Fuji radar) of Q1-1.
The antecedent of Q1-4 is a84a31a85 a86a77a87a71a88a39a89a40a88 (Mt.Fuji radar) of Q1-1 actually, however, if Q1-3 is completed correctly (as R1-3), a84a72a85 a86a77a87a71a88a26a89a40a88 (Mt.Fuji radar) exists in Q1-3.
Therefore, we prepared evaluation data from QAC test set, 310 pairs of questions.
One pair consists of a question of Reference Run and a question of Formal Run.
For example, R1-1 and Q1-2 is one pair of the evaluation data, R1-3 and Q1-4 is other one.
We have evaluated our method using this data.
Correctness has been judged by human.
When the system must take an answer of previous question, we have used 45 <ANS> which indicates the answer of previous question.
4 3.2 Results Our system could complete 52 of 310 questions correctly as results.
28 among 52 success cases are done by ellipsis handling method proposed in the previous QAC evaluation.
Our previous approach is based on topic presentation in question sentences.
If there is an ellipsis in a question, we will use information of topic information in the previous question.
Topic presentation is detected by Japanese particle a14 (ha) . The other cases of 24 were succeeded by the approach described above.
We will show the details as follows: • Replacing with pronoun: System classi ed 88 of 310 questions in this pattern.
The all of 88 classi cations were correct.
12 of 88 questions were completed correctly.
• Ellipsis of an obligatory case element of verb: System classi ed 158 of 310 questions as this pattern.
105 of 158 classi cations were correct.
8 of 105 questions were completed correctly.
• Ellipsis of a modi er or modi cand: System classi ed 64 of 310 questions as this pattern.
44 of 64 classi cations were correct.
4 of 44 questions were completed correctly.
Major failure cases and their numbers which are indicated with dots are as follows: Failure of classi cation of ellipsis pattern • System uses wrong verbs...29 • All obligatory cases of verb is lled and other element is omitted...22 • Failure of morphological analysis...8 • An adjective phrase is omitted...1 4In the Formal Run, we have replace <ANS> with the 1st answer of core QA.
In the evaluation, considering core QA’s failure, we have left <ANS> and considered as correct.
Failure of estimation of omitted element of follow-up question • Verb isn’t recorded in Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary...35 • Shortage of rules for pronoun...17 • System lls up to case already lled up...15 • Any modi er or modi cand doesn’t exist in Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary...10 • Case frame element is omitted but system fails to nd it...7 • Verb is passive voice...6 • System fails to select the element of modi cation relation...6 • Question doesn’t have element of case frame and it is unnecessary...2 Failure of decision of which word should be taken • System fails to estimate word type of answer in the previous question...79 • System fails to decide to scope of target word...21 • A modi er or modi cand which has lower cooccurrence frequency should be taken...7 • System takes inappropriate word from an interrogative phrase...6 • Answer type of the previous question has same kind with a word should be taken...3 4 Discussion Our system could work well for some elliptical questions as described in the previous section.
We will show some examples and detail of major failure analysis results in the following.
1. Verb case elements: There was a Japanese delexical verb5 a36a39a64 in a follow-up question, then our system could not 5Delexical verb is a functional verb which has speci c meaning in it.
46 ll up its obligatory cases because every obligatory cases of this verb had already lled up.
It is necessary to handle these delexical verbs such as a36a15a64, a102a15a64, a36a108a94 and so on as stop words.
Otherwise, there were several questions in which all obligatory cases of verb has already lled up.
In this case, it is necessary to apply the other approach.
In the example a109 a88a55a110a52a75a71a111a113a112 a7 a73a8a114a35a115a15a116 a5 a54a4a117a119a118 a65a26a48a43a120 a32 a34a23a121a15a122 a14a12a16a4a18 a32a38a34 a21a19a22 (What is the actor’s name who attended opening event in the rst dday)?, some additional information for opening event is omitted.
Moreover, there were some verbs which had no case information in EDR dictionary.
It would be helpful to check co-occurrence with this word in the previous question.
2. Morphological analysis failure: The expression a24a15a25 a18 (sokode) in question sentence was recognized as one conjunction a24a55a25 a18 (then) although it should be analyzed in a24a55a25 (soko: there) + a18 (de: at) . If morphological analyzer works well, our algorithm could handle ellipsis correctly.
3. Lack of rules for pronoun: In the expression a25 a7a35a123a63a124 a76a40a125a8a88a12a56a15a126a71a75 (this space station) of question sentence, ellipsis handling rule for pronoun a25 a7 (this) was not implemented, then our method could not handle this case.
It is necessary to expand our algorithm for this case.
4. case information handling error: q1 a127a38a128a12a129a2a130a23a131a15a27a19a132a8a133a17a76a55a134a40a88 a105 a32a71a135 a36 a34 a7a2a14a52a51 a25 a7 a125a108a87a17a136a6a137 a18a23a20a8a21a38a22 (Which TV station is Ms.
Sawako Agawa working as TV caster)?
(QAC3-31206-01) q2 a111a15a138a23a135a72a139 a36 a34a35a68a2a140a31a141a2a142 a14a28a97a63a18a23a20a8a21a38a22 (What is the title of long novel which φ rstly wrote)?
(QAC3-30029-05) In the above example (q1 is the rst question and q2 is follow-up question), system checks obligatory case elements of verb a139a144a143 (write) of question q1.
The verb a139a145a143 has three obligatory cases: agent, object and goal according to EDR dictionary.
System estimated that every obligatory case element were omitted, and checks a127a2a128a26a129a26a130a19a131 (Ms.
Sawako Agawa), a132a8a133a17a76a41a134a23a88 (TV caster), a132a39a133a72a76 a134a23a88 (TV caster) respectively.
However, object case of verb a139a146a143 was a68a39a140a8a141a8a142 (long novel) of question q2 actually.
In this question, this element was modi ed by verb a139a147a143 (write), then system failed to estimate that the object was already lled.
So, our algorithm tried to ll this object case up as a132a39a133a17a76a15a134a23a88 (TV caster) . It is necessary to improve patterns of estimation of omitted case element.
5. lack of co-occurrence information: q3 a112a58a148a12a149a8a150a63a151 a7a10a152a2a9a23a153a77a14a35a154a2a155a55a36a12a37a72a156a26a157 a93a41a64a40a7a23a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (When is Reitaisai of Nikko Toshogu held in every year?) (QAC3-31235-01) q4 a158a55a159a39a74a38a159a160a117 a14a10a97a55a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (What is the highlight?)(QAC3-30033-06) q4’ a112a58a148a12a149a8a150a63a151 a7 a158a55a159a39a74a38a159a160a117 a14a10a97a55a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (What is the highlight of Nikko Toshogu?) In the above example, q3 is the rst question and q4 is the follow-up question.
The question q4 is replaced with q4’ using ellipsis handling.
In this case, system took wrong modi er a112a70a148a63a149a63a150a4a151 (Nikko Toshogu) for a158 a159a41a74a2a159a161a117 (highlight) . It is caused by lack of co-occurrence information in EDR Japanese Cooccurrence Dictionary because these words are proper nouns which are not frequently used.
In order to handle such cases, it is necessary to use co-occurrence information using large corpus.
6. Passive verb expression: In our current implementation, our system has no rule to handle passive verb.
In case of passive voice, it is necessary to check other case element for ellipsis handling.
7. Multiple candidates: 47 q5 a162 a3 a75a164a163a166a165a81a167a35a168a23a115 a14a17a16a15a65 a66a10a67a2a68a15a69 a65 a169a63a170 a92a10a93 a34 a7a40a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (Who appointed Mr.
Collin Powell as a minister of state?) (QAC3-31087-01) q6 a47 a7a35a171a8a172a52a96a38a102 a30a2a173 a14a4a51a45a7a15a101a19a94a71a102a15a174a72a7 a18a12a20a2a21a23a22 (What is his political situation?) (QAC3-30013-03) q6’ <ANS> a7a10a171a2a172a77a96a40a102 a30a12a173 a14a52a51a10a7a63a101a63a94 a102a52a174a43a7a23a18a38a20a39a21a40a22 (What is <ANS>’s political situation?) In the above example, q5 is the rst question and q6 is the follow-up question.
The question q6 is replaced with q6’ using ellipsis handling rules.
System replaced a47 (his) of q6 with the answer of q5.
Because a47 (his) refers human and the answer type of q5 is human, and the answer of q5 was the nearest word which suitable to a47 (his) . But, a47 (his) referred a162 a3 a75a41a163 a165a82a167a10a168a23a115 (Mr.
Colin Powell) actually.
In this case, a162 a3 a75a164a163a166a165a81a167a10a168a23a115 (Mr.
Colin Powell) was the topic of q5, so a162 a3 a75a55a163a175a165a77a167a35a168a72a115 (Mr.
Colin Powell) would be better one than the answer of q5.
Topic information handling would be implemented in our algorithm.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented ellipsis handling method for follow-up questions in IAD task.
We have classi ed ellipsis pattern of question sentences into three types and proposed ellipsis handling algorithm for each type.
In the evaluation using Formal Run and Reference Run data, there were several cases which our algorithm could not handle ellipsis correctly.
According to the analysis of evaluation results, the main reason of low performance was lack of word information for recognition of referential elements.
If our system can recognize word meanings correctly, some errors will not occur and ellipsis handling works well.
We have already improved our ellipsis handling method with recognition of target question.
In the evaluation of QAC3, our system searches elliptical element in the previous question.
However, we have not tested this new algorithm using test correction.
In the future work, we will test this algorithm and apply it for other QA application.
