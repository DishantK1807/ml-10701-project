The first one, implemented in the TextTning algorithm (Hearst, 1997), counts the f~lUencies of term repetitions and is an ideal, lightweight tool for segmenting texts.

The same claim is made in (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996) and (Kameyama, 1997), where algorithm~ approximating RAP for poorer syntactic input obtain precision of 75% and 71%, respectively, a surprising small precision decay from RAP's 86%.

Specificity principles apply also to HSNom, where hyponymy is promoted, similarly to (Poesio and Vieirs, 1998).

Recently, a probabilistic approach to pronominal coreference resolution was also devised (Ge et al., 1998), using the parsed data available from Treebank.

We use the finite-state parses of FaSTU$ (Appelt et al., 1993) for recognizing these entities, but the method extends to any basic phrasal parser 4.

For example, the Resolution of Anaphor~ Procedure (RAP) i~itroduced in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) combines syntactic information with agreement and salience constraints.

Other pronominal resolution approaches promote knowledge-poor methods (Mitkov, 1998), either by using an ordered set of general heuristics or by combining scores assigned to candidate antecedents.
P98-2143
The CogNIAC algorithm (Baldwin, 1997) uses six heuristic rules to resolve coreference, whereas the algorithm presented in (Mitkov, 1998) is based on a limited set of preferences (e.g.
