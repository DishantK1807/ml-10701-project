But at the same time,each concept in it is 'known to Penman', in the sense that it is possible to state for each concept in the UM the fragments of gran~matical or lexical realization that will be used to realize it (Bateman et al.1990:5). However, the section of the UM corresponding to noun senses seems surprisingly small for this task at least, as described in Bateman et al 1990.

We shall focusparticularly on the types of relations that need to be recogmsed as holding between the 'concepts' in an ontology or rather, between the gene,ric, objects (in contrast with specific objects), such as dog, realized as dogs, as in I like dogs.2 2 Why the discussion remains open Hovy and Nirenburg (1992), in clearing the ground for their discussion of the principles that should guide the construction of an ontology, suggest that most ontologies and domain models to date have been assembled based primarily on introspection, and often reflect the idiosyncrasies of the builders more than the requirements of the application (such as MT).

This is: if there, is to be this strong connection to the linguistic system (Bateman 1990:57), what part of it should that connection be to?

This seems to be the case with the Pangloss project (Hovy and Nirenburg 1992, Hovy and Knight 1993, Knight 1993), whose explicit goal is to combine the best features of these sources.

In Bateman's words (1990:56) 'the Upper Model represents the speaker's,e, xpenence in terms of,generalized lingu!sfically-motivated ontological" categories.

The main, function of the UMis to serve as an abstraction hierarchy (Bateman 1990:57), and so to provide the usual functions of an ontology for property inheritance, etc.
