For example, in the WSJ corpus, part of the Penn Treebank 3 release (Marcus et al., 1993), the string in (1) is a variation 12-gram since off is a variation nucleus that in one corpus occurrence is tagged as a preposition (IN), while in another it is tagged as a particle (RP).

complex ambiguity tags In the tagging literature (e.g., Cutting et al (1992)) an ambiguity class is often composed of the set of every possible tag for a word.

We use two off-the-shelf taggers for correction, the Markov model tagger TnT (Brants, 2000) and the Decision Tree Tagger (Schmid, 1997), which we will abbreviate as DTT.

In Dickinson and Meurers (2003), contexts are composed of words, and identity of the context is required.

Although there are POS error detection approaches, using, e.g., anomaly detection (Eskin, 2000), our approach builds on the variation n-gram algorithm introduced in Dickinson and Meurers (2003) and Dickinson (2005).

Research has gone into automatically detecting annotation errors for part-of-speech annotation (van Halteren, 2000; Kvˇetˇon and Oliva, 2002; Dickinson and Meurers, 2003), yet there has been virtually no work on automatically or semiautomatically correcting such annotation errors.1 1Oliva (2001) specifies hand-written rules to detect and Automatic correction can speed up corpus improvement efforts and provide new data for NLP technology training on the corpus.
