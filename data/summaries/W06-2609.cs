WordNet-based attributes are also excluded, given that coverage for Dutch (using EuroWordNet) tends tobeless good than forEnglish, andeven for English their contribution is sometimes insignificant (Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos, 2004).

Hildebrandt et al.(2004) exploit surface patterns to extract as many relevant ”nuggets” of information of a concept as possible.
N04-1007
Features for lexical patterns, as used in (Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2005), e.g. qn which (is|was|are|were) dp, are not added because in this experiment we investigate only a copular pattern.
H05-1041
The use of machine learning techniques can be found in Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004) and Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) They use similar patterns as (Joho and Sanderson, 2000) to construct training attributes.
C04-1199 H05-1041
Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004) use a SVM with simple inner product (polynomial of first degree) kernel because higher degree polynomial kernels were reported as giving no improvement.
C04-1199
Joho and Sanderson (2000) use the position of the sentences as one of their ranking criteria, while Miliaraki and Androutsopoulos (2004), Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) and BlairGoldensohn et al.(2004) apply it as one of their learning attributes.
C04-1199 H05-1041
Patterns such as ‘dp especially qn’, as utilized by Hearst (1992), are used to extract names and their descriptions.
C92-2082
A different use ofn-grams has been explored by Androutsopoulos and Galanis (2005) who add only n-grams (n ∈ {1,2,3}) occurring frequently either directly before or after a target term.
