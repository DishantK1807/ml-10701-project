However, a number of researchers (Fillmore, 1968; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Guthrie et al., 1991; Hearst, 1991; Jackendoff, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Pinker, 1989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons.

The work of Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) is more closely related to our approach in that it attempts to recover a syntactic-semantic relation from machine-readable dictionaries.

Previous research in automatic acquisition focuses primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1996; Wu and Xia, 1995), or extraction of syntactic constructions from online dictionaries and corpora (Brent, 1993; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995).
