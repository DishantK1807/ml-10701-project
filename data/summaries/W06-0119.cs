In (Tsai, 2006), we propose a new language model named word support model (WSM) and shown it can effectively perform homophone selection and word-syllable segmentation to improve Chinese input system.

In this Bakeoff, we use context-based Chinese unknown word identification (CCUWI) (Tsai, 2005) to resolve unknown word problem.

It is because Chinese is written without any separation between words and more than 50% words of the Chinese texts in web corpus are out-of-vocabulary (Tsai et al.2003). In our report for the SIGHAN Bakeoff 2005 (Tsai, 2005), we have shown that a highly performance of 99.1% F-measure can be achieved while a BMM-based CWS using a perfect system dictionary (Tsai, 2005).

The details of the CCUWI can be found in (Tsai, 2005).

Conventionally, there are four approaches to develop a CWS: (1) Dictionary-based approach (Cheng et al.1999), especial forward and backward maximum matching (Wong and Chan, 1996); (2) Linguistic approach based on syntax-semantic knowledge (Chen et al.2002); (3) Statistical approach based on statistical language model (SLM) (Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al.2000; Gao et al.2003); and (4) Hybrid approach trying to combine the benefits of dictionary-based, linguistic and statistical approaches (Tsai et al.2003; Ma and Chen, 2003).

Statistical approaches are simple and efficient whereas linguistic approaches are effective in identifying low frequency unknown words (Chen et al.2002). To develop WSD, there are two major types of word segmentation ambiguities while there are no unknown word problems with them: (1) Overlap Ambiguity (OA).

As per (Lin et al.1993; Tsai et al.2003; Tsai, 2005), the bottleneck for developing a highperformance CWS is to comprise of high performance Chinese unknown word identification (UWI).
I05-6003
To develop UWI, there are three approaches: (1) Statistical approach, researchers use common statistical features, such as maximum entropy (Chieu et al.2002), association strength, mutual information, ambiguous matching, and multi-statistical features for unknown word detection and extraction; (2) Linguistic approach, three major types of linguistic rules (knowledge): morphology, syntax, and semantics, are used to identify unknown words; and (3) Hybrid approach, recently, one important trend of UWI follows a hybrid approach so as to take advantage of both merits of statistical and linguistic approaches.
C02-1025
In (Tsai, 2006), WSM has been shown effectively to improve Chinese input system.
P06-2108
The result also supports that a high performance CWS is relied on a high performance Chinese UWI (Tsai, 2005).
