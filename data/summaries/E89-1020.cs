1. INTRODUCTION For highly Inflexlonal languages, encoding all word forms Into a word lexicon (declarative morphology approach) appears to be a poor solution not only due to a great redundancy (which for some languages is prohibitive (Japplnen,t983)) but also with respect to some theoretical aspects (as for Instance descriptional adequacy (Wehrli,1985)).

Recent work reported in (Goertz, 1988), (Wothks', 1986), (Zock, 1988) share some points with our approach.

A similar point of view, that is attaching exception lists to general rules, may be found in (Bear,1988).

Related work is reported in (Wohtke, t986), (Trost,1986) but they are either concerned with English (not a very exciting language from the morphological point of view) or address generation or analysis only.
