</unit> <ante current="ne549" rel="ident"> <anchor ID="ne547"> </ante> Work such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999), as well as our own preliminary analysis, suggested that indirect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the CB.

Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and definites in general (Poesio, 2004a).

The agreement on identifying the boundaries of units, using the κ statistic discussed in (Carletta, 1996), was κ =.9 (for two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features (2 annotators and at least 200 units) was as follows: UTYPE: κ=.76; VERBED: κ=.9; FINITE: κ=.81.

These results, and the annotated corpus, were used in the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms for sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001), aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Karamanis, 2003).

fairly easy to achieve, marking bridging references is hard; this was confirmed by Poesio and Vieira (1998).
J98-2001
LOEB Poesio and Vieira (1998) found that of the 1,400 definite descriptions in their corpus, only about 50% were subsequent mention or bridging references, whereas 50% were first mentions.
J98-2001
In order to test Loebner’s theory and compare it with one based on familiarity, we annotated the NPs referring to discourse entities according to whether they were functional, relational, or sortal (Poesio, 2004a).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
We started doing this for the annotation of modifiers (Cheng et al., 2001), and developed an interface to WordNet, but too late to redo the whole corpus.
N01-1002
The GNOME corpus was created to study the aspects of discourse that appear to affect generation, especially salience (Pearson et al., 2000; Poesio and Di Eugenio, 2001; Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio et al., 2004b).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
This approach, however, precludes using the corpus to compare possible definitions of utterance, one of the goals of the GNOME annotation (Poesio et al., 2004b).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
GF This attribute was used to annotate the grammatical function of the NP, a property generally taken to play an important role in determining the salience of the discourse entity it realizes (Grosz et al., 1995).
J95-2003
ing theory (Grosz et al., 1995) are called UTTERANCES, i.e., the units of text after which the local focus is updated.
J95-2003
More recently, the corpus has also been used to develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004a) Although the results of the studies using the GNOME corpus mentioned above have been published in a number of papers, and although a detailed annotation manual was written and has been available on the Web for a few years (Poesio, 2000b), none of the previously published papers discusses in detail the goals of the annotation and the methodology that was followed, especially for the non-anaphoric aspects.
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
Proposals for annotating ‘coreference’ such as (Hirschman, 1998) have been motivated by work on Information Extraction, hence the notion of ‘coreference’ used is very difficult to relate to traditional ideas about anaphora (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).
J00-4005
Discourse Models Anaphoric annotation raises a number of difficult and, sometimes, unresolved semantic issues (Poesio, 2004b).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
The GNOME instructions for identifying NPs derive from those proposed in MATE (Poesio et al., 1999), in turn derived from DRAMA (Passonneau, 1997) and MUC-7 (Hirschman, 1998).

2The leaflets in the pharmaceutical subcorpus are a subset of the collection of all patient leaflets in the UK which was digitized to support the ICONOCLAST project at the University of Brighton (Scott et al., 1998).
W98-1427
A distinctive feature of the GNOME annotation (and the MATE proposals from which they derive (Poesio, 2004b)) are explicitly based on the DISCOURSE MODEL assumption adopted almost universally by linguists (computational and not) working on anaphora resolution and generation (Webber, 1979; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Gundel et al., 1993).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
We achieved good reliability on this attribute (κ = .82), and the results do suggest a much greater correlation between functionality and definiteness than between familiarity and definiteness (Poesio, 2004a).
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
There are two advantages to this approach: first of all, agreement on the ‘building blocks’ is much easier to reach than agreement on the CB–in our preliminary experiments we didn’t go beyond κ = .6 when trying to directly identify the CB using the definitions from (Brennan et al., 1987).
P87-1022
In most annotations concerned with salience, a predefined notion of utterance was adopted, typically sentences (Miltsakaki, 2002) or (finite) clauses (Kameyama, 1998).
J02-3003
This includes, most obviously, the identification of sentences and NPs, already done automatically in the VENEX corpus (Poesio, 2004b); and at least grammatical function, animacy, and countability could be automatically annotated in preliminary form with existing techniques, and then corrected by hand.
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
The one aspect of the GNOME annotation that has been extensively discussed in previous papers is anaphoric annotation (Poesio, 2004b; Poesio et al., 2004b); we only discuss this aspect briefly here.
J04-3003 P04-1019 W04-2327
(See also (Quirk and Greenbaum, 1973).) Utterances and Propositions The annotation of units has been shown useful to identify many of the atomic propositions expressed by a text, and was therefore used as a basis for studying text planning (Karamanis, 2003) and aggregation (Cheng, 2001).

Our instructions for this attribute are derived from those used in the FRAMENET project ((Baker et al., 1998); see also http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/˜framenet/).

We developed such scripts for the work discussed in (Poesio et al., 2004b); they can be tested on the web site associated with that paper, http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/poesio/ cbc/.

</p> Problems with Attributes The most difficult attribute to mark was UTYPE, and our main problem was to distinguish between relative clauses and parentheticals, since it’s not always easy to tell whether a relative clause is restrictive or non-restrictive (see also (Cheng et al., 2001)).
N01-1002
Other groups however have shown that this can be done, e.g., in Framenet (Baker et al., 1998) and more recently in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
