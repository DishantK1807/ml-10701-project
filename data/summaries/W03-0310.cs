This cost can often be substantial, as with the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
J93-2004
Statistical translation models (such as those formulated in Brown et al.(1993)) are trained from bilingual sentencealigned texts.

The table further indicates that co-training for machine translation suffers the same problem reported in Pierce and Cardie (2001): gains above the accuracy of the initial corpus are achieved, but decline as after a certain number of machine translations are added to the training set.

Further checks verify the plausibility of its being a translation (Smith, 2002).
W02-1013
The software that we used to train the statistical models and to produce the translations was GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000), the CMU-Cambridge Language Modeling Toolkit (Clarkson and Rosenfeld, 1997), and the ISI ReWrite Decoder.
P00-1056
For example, the Candide system (Berger et al., 1994) was trained on ten years’ worth of Canadian Parliament proceedings, which consists of 2.87 million parallel sentences in French and English.
H94-1028
To perform the retraining we use co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Abney, 2002) which is a weakly supervised learning technique that relies on having distinct views of the items being classified.
P02-1046
• improved word order – A significant source of errors in statistical machine translation is the word reordering problem (Och et al., 1999).
