and Smoothing Algorithm We apply the trigram model to the word segmentation task (Jiang 2005A), and make use of Absolute Smoothing algorithm to overcome the sparse data problem.

In trigram model, only the previous two words are considered as context features, while in disambiguation processing, we can use the Maximum Entropy model fused more features (Jiang 2005B) or rule based method.
