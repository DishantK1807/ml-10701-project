This property led Resnik (1992) to propose left-corner processing as a plausible mechanism for human sentence processing, since it is precisely these center-embedded structures, and not the leftor right-branching structures, that are problematic for humans to process.

For automatic parsing, we made use of the wellknownCharniakparser(Charniak,2000).

Stack size has been related by some (Resnik, 1992) to working memory demands, although it most directly measures deviation from right-branching trees.

Although the CHILDES annotation scheme proposed by Sagae et al.(2004) has been used in practice for automatic parsing of child language transcripts (Sagae et al., 2004; Sagae et al., 2005), such work relied mainly on a statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank, since a large enough corpus of annotated CHILDES data was not available to train a domain-specific parser.

Syntactic analysis of child language transcripts using a GR scheme of this kind has already been shown to be effective in a practical setting, namely in automatic measurement of syntactic development in children (Sagae et al., 2005).

Following best practices (Charniak and Johnson, 2001), we removed sequences covered by EDITED nodes in the tree from the strings prior to parsing.

Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).

Despite the obvious disadvantage of using a parser trained on a completely different language genre, Sagae et al.(2005) demonstrated how current natural language processing techniques can be used effectively in child language work, achieving results that are close to those obtained by manual computation of syntactic development scores for child transcripts.

tributed to Magerman (1995), to percolate lexical heads up the tree.

Generally, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented as a tree, and parsing is carried out by maximizing the likelihood of the tree (Charniak, 2000; Uchimoto et al., 1999).

In recent years, many accurate phrase-structure parsers have been developed (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000)).

Examples of this sort of complexity measure are: mean length of utterance (MLU), which is typically measured in morphemes (Miller and Chapman, 1981); the Index of Productive Syntax (Scarborough, 1990), a multi-point scale which has recently been automated for child-language transcript analysis (Sagae et al., 2005); and Developmental Level (Rosenberg and Abbeduto, 1987), a 7-point scale of complexity based on the presence of specific grammatical constructions.

Yet Sagae et al.(2005) have recently demonstrated that existing statistical parsing techniques can be usefully modified to analyse CHILDES 33 with promising accuracy.

That work relied on a phrase-structure statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank, and the output of that parser had to be converted into CHILDES grammatical relations.

Another potential clinical use of NLP is for processing patient language samples, which can be used to assess language development (Sagae et al., 2005) or the impact of neurodegenerative impairments on speech and language (Roark et al., 2007).

For comparison, Sagae et al.(2005) report 86.9% LAS on about 2,000 words of Eve data, using the Charniak (2000) parser with a separate dependency-labeling step.
