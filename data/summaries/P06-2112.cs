For the subtask of unlimited resources, Aswani and Gaizauskas (2005) used a multi-feature approach for many-to-many word alignment on English-Hindi parallel corpora.

Wu et al.(2005) used a large-scale bilingual corpus in general domain to improve domain-specific word alignment when only a small-scale domainspecific bilingual corpus is available.

Lopez and Resnik (2005) extended the HMM model by integrating a tree distortion model based on a dependency parser built on the English side of the parallel corpus.

Work A shared task on word alignment was organized as part of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (Martin et al., 2005).

This idea is similar to translation lexicon extraction via a bridge language (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002).

In order to obtain fine-grained interpolation models, we interpolate the three kinds of parameters using different weights, which are obtained in the same way as described in Wu et al.(2005). t λ represents the weights for translation probability.

Based on the two results, we get a result using "refined" combination as described in (Och and Ney, 2000).

Word alignment was first proposed as an intermediate result of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003
When the large-scale bilingual corpus is unavailable, some researchers acquired class-based alignment rules with existing dictionaries to improve word alignment (Ker and Chang, 1997).
J97-2004
The difference lies in that Wu et al.(2005) took all alignment links as sure links.

Many researchers build alignment links with bilingual corpora (Wu, 1997; Och and Ney, 2003; Cherry and Lin, 2003; Zhang and Gildea, 2005).

Word Alignment According to the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), the statistical word alignment model can be generally represented as in equation (1).

Testing data includes 4,926 alignment links 2 . 6.2 Evaluation Metrics We use the same metrics as described in Wu et al.(2005), which is similar to those in (Och and Ney, 2000).

Martin et al.(2005) reported that this method resulted in absolute improvements of up to 20% as compared with the case of only using limited resources.
