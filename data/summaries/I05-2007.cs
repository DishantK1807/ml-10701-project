The second step involves frequency-based learning from a tagged corpus with statistical models such as hidden Markov models, and sometimes also with error-driven learning of symbolic transformation rules (Brill, 1995; Lee et al., 1997a; Lee et al., 2002).

In Kim et al.(1994) and in the Klex system of Han Na-rae, these constraints are represented in the two-level formalism, which is equivalent to regular expressions, which are in turn equivalent to finite-state automata.

Such simplifications make it possible to encode morphemes on the Korean syllable-based alphabet, and are compatible with syllable-based models (Kang and Kim, 1994).

They convey more information than adjacency symbols, but they are less numerous: 59 to be compared to 300 (Lee et al., 2002).

A training process with a tagged corpus gives much better performance than unsupervised training (Merialdo, 1994).

Our tag set is more fine-grained than stateof-the-art: it comprises 173 tags for stems [to be compared to 18 in Lee et al.(2002) and 14 in Han and Palmer (2005)], and 84 tags for functional morphemes [15 in Lee et al.(2002) and in Han and Palmer (2005)].

Other fairly representative examples are described in (Shin et al., 1995; Park et al., 1998) and in (Lee et al., 1997a; Cha et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2002).

For ex5 3 http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/manuelunitex.pdf ample, Lee et al.(2002) use a table that encodes connectivity between morphemes with the aid of morpheme tags and adjacency symbols.

Some systems are based on two-level models, such as (Kim et al., 1994) and the Klex system of Han Na-rae 2. (Choi, 1999) combines a lexicon of stems with a lexicon of endings with the aid of a connectivity table.

Tag sets in previous Korean morphological analysers were unstructured or hierarchical (Lee et al., 2002), not feature-based.

A thorough removal of ambiguity requires a syntactic process (Voutilainen, 1995; Laporte, 2001).
