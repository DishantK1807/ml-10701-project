It is shown that unification in the sense of Kay as used in unification grammars, and tl m~.sda,:t\[oa, a p~o~;ess deriving from automata theory, {~ ~-~ both valuable tools for use in computational pb,.m,.,k~gy. By way of illustration, a brief outline of the allophsni.c parser described by Church is given.

A fundamental d b%inct ion is made between two domains: the. representations at the phonetic and phonological levels, and the proc~.ssing of these representations.
On this basis, a d\[~itinctisn is made between networks of tran~.di~ction relations <e.g.
between allophones and phonemes), and a .%et of possible processors (i.e.
parsers and transducers) for the interpretation of such networks.
1. 'F~e~ne~du~tion and Unification in Phonology The proposal to use finlte-state transducers in morphology and phonology has been advocated in recent years by Kaplan and Kay /1981/, Koskenniemi /1983/ and others, It has been suggested /Gibbon 1987! that finlte-state transducers are the most appropriate devices for use in other areas of computational phonology.
In Koskennlemi's system, single finite-state transducers act as parallel fllters in the analysis of Finnish morphology.
However, in his morphophsnological analysis Koskennleml has been critlcised for uslng monadlc segments rather than the feature bundles which play such an important role in phonology /Gazdar 1985:601/.
In the proposal presentcxl below, segments regarded as feature bundle~ are essential components in the model.
The quesLion as to whether it is better to represent the phonological rules as a cascade of transducers or to incorporate them into a single transducer will not be considered here.
Kaplan and Kay /1981/ have already put fowar'd a method of compiling the series uf transducers into a sing\].(-: transducer (described by Kay /1982/)), Below, for discussion purposes, a single transducer is assumed.
Furthermore 1 would llke to stress that on the phonological level I will discuss network \['epresen tahions of phonotact ic and allophonic cons'traln ts.
The transitions in these networks consist of transduction relations.
In the proce.~s domain a finite-state transducer will be used to interpret the networks.
This is a distinction which is not always made but is beneficial for abstracting the attributes of the model from the processing of the model.
Below more emphasis will be placed on the representation domain as it is this whlch is most interesting for" discussion purposes.
The actual implementation of the processing domain as a program is regarded, theoretically, as a secondary but by no m~ns a minor issue.
Unification is a concept which has become common in linguistics in recent years due to the important role it plays in current syntactic theories such as FUG, LFG and GPSG.
However, it has not as yet played an explicit part in phonological analysis.
Below I propose that, by employing elementary unification mechanisms, assimilation and dis~imllation can be dea\].h wlth in a most satisfactory way.
The unification used in this connection is based on the functional description unification described by Kay I1984/.
Here I will give an informal definition of unification based on contradiction and set union and in terms of feature bundles, since this is the representation which will be used below.
Two feature.
bundles composed of attribute-value pairs may be said to unify if for each attribute in their union there does not exist an attribute of the same name with a 106 contradicting vahJe.
Where a variable, .,lay X, is found in place of a value in ~I~e featnre bundle~ this variable wilt be.
assigned permanently the va\].ue from the corresponding attribute--value pair in the nther bundle if this exists.
This definition of unificati.en, and its implements lion, differs from Prolog term unification.

Therefore when a particular transition in the network is responsible for remevin 5 this allophonic information the input transition specification is {\[cent\], \[voice\], \[s~bn\], \[strid\], \[+ asp\]), and the output transition specification is {\[cent\], \[~voice\], \[son\], \[strid\]} (see Fig.l).
When this phonotactic net is interpreted by a particular parser the phonetic input is generally a string ef fu\]ly specifl~xl feature bundles *~nd in order to u'~e the output for recognition purposes the phonemic output will also be fully specified.
It i.% here that unification plays an important role.
indeed the features themselves may not be recosnisable.
This facility is advantageous for workin~ with feature detectors at the front end as it is still possible to analyse what is known.
Thls, of course, leads to underspecifk~l output which may be used in connection with a lexicon for recolnltlon hypothesisin 5 . In such cases the underspecified output, althoush representin~ classes of phonemes in the various positions, will only allow those combinations of such classes which actually exist, thus llmltJng' possibilities available for hypothesis.
Thus it is not necessary to check the lexicon for forms which accordln 5 to the rules of the language cannot exist.

If unification succeeds, the fully specific4 output bundle must contain the output transition specifications together with all those features from the fully specified input bundle not contained in the input transition specification.
In set the\[~retic terms, let us call the fully specified input feature bundle lnFB, the input and output transition specifications ITS and OTS respectively; if unification of InFB with ITS succeeds, the fully specified output bundle OutFB is OTS ~ (InFB / ITS).
The phonetic input feature bundles may be also underspecified however.
This allows for circumstances where the values of some features may not be known or 4.
Gonstr'ainin~ Principles Church discusses a number of factors, most of which date back to work by Morris Halle and are discussed by Chomsky and Halle /1960/, which must be taken into consideration when desl6ning the model I1983:1281 length, idiosyncratic systematic gaps, voicing assimilation, place assimi\].atien and dissimilation, sonority.
These can all be incorporated very easily into the network.
The fact that languages restrict sound combinations (Jdiosyncratlc gaps) and the length of initlal/flnal consonant clusters is in any case the basis on which this network is constructed.
Decreasing sonority from the nucleus of the syllable towards the margins would seem to be a matter of having \[son\] as a C-feature and adjusting the value at the appropriate transition.
With re~ard to phonotactic constraints, the C-.
features on the transition labels may have variable values.
In other words we may cater for the fact that all initial /s/ in Bn~lish may not be followed by voiced plosives by havin 5 as input specifications for one of its followln~ transitions the C-features {\[voc\], \[~ cent\], \[~ voice\], \[o son\], \[strid\]) (see Fig.2).
~ here must have the same value in the three cases, this value bein~ assigned durin}~ unification.
Unification would fall in this case for voiced plosives as they would be specified for the feature~ {\[reel, \[-cont\], \[+ voice\], \[son\], \[strld\]}.
A further convention is Introduced, *tamely that once a feature has been specified on a particular transition it remains until it is eKplicitly altered, ell a subsequent transition.
In this way vowel harmony may be incorporated into such a network whereby the vowel sDeeificatlons would remain for subsequent transitions since they would not be relevant for intervenin~ consonants.

(1;I and /~/ ~tv(~ abbrevl~ltlrm~; ftlr fully specified fetltuie bund I ~t;) It shoal(l be clear also that feature bundle representation together with unification is an elegant way of dealing with assimilation, dissimilation and neutrallsation.
Assimilation and dissimilation are dealt with by Chomsky and laile /1968/ in terms of variables a.
~\] feature cfK~.fficients and it is this, method which has been incorporated into the network here.
So for example, in eases of voice assimilation, the fe/Iture \[voice\] may be checked using a variable, say \[a volc~\].
Therefore, where the particular input segment ha~ the feature \[+ voice\], unification assigns the value + to the undefin£Rl variable ¢~ permanently, and slmilaFly in the case of a negative value.
This newly found value together with the attribute will then be a (k-feature in the input specification for the following I ransltion unless exp\]icltly changed on that transition.
This is a type of feature-passlng technique :~imilar to that employed in unificationbased syn'i;actlc theories, but essentially simpler, slnce it is nsn-recurslve.
Transltion weighting is also very important in this model, St\]kirk /1980/ emphasil~es that it is all very well to cater for collocational restrictions but other constraining principles such as maxlmising snoots should also) be incorporated into a syllable parser.
Thus ironed\]ions are weighted in such a way that the most preferred path out of the network is sought.
'Early closure' /Kimball 1973/ :for example, which seeks the shorte~;t path out of the network, is equivalent to the maxima\[ onset principle.
Str~s re~yllablflcatlon is simllar\]y dealt with using weighting.
Thus, such constraints are incorporated into the network in a simple and principled fashitm.
5. Gyllable Parsing Up to now we have \]men discussing the representation level, namely the phons\]attic net envisaged as a syllable template.
The phonotacU.c net in hhls case was for English but it should be.
clear that this representation may he used for other languages, dialects sr codes.
Since the phenol~ctic net is a network of transduction relations between allophone and phoneme it should be both apeech analysia and synthesis.
to note at this stage however, that level we are not re'~;tricte~ to what we employ.
The phonotactic net may a usefu\[ tool for It is important on the processing parsing algorithm be interpretu~:l by any one of a number ~ff par,'~ing procedure.%.
The .~;trategy emphJyed (i.e.
depth-first, breadth first, hast fir.~t, ioskahead etc).
is~ a\].so totally independent of the repve~.~entation.
In the mode\], deacrib(M here the aim wa~ to use the simplest formalism pcJssible.
Thus the parsing and translation processes are undertaken by a deptl>first nondeterministi.c finite state transducer.
That is to say, the phonotacUc nets of ti-ansducti~n re\[atitms are interpreted by a fin~te,-state machine.
Giwm the phonetic input in the form of feature bundles, the tram~ducer msve~; from,,~tate to state in line ~ith the unification procedure de~;cr ilxM in s6x:tion '3 above.
l':very time the tran,%duce.v reaches its fins},';tote gi "p¢~sible" sytlable ha,% been found.
Therefore,in order to find more than one syllable the transducer iterates so that phonological units and syllable boundaries are output until the input,qtring is empty.
Thu~; we have a single iterative finite .%Late precooks.
The parsing and canonicalisation pt-t~:e.~ses referred to in f;ection 2 abtwe are in(:orpora ted into a single proceduJ e.
%that is interesting to note in this esnnection isl that since the l~Irsing proc+.~ture i.~; uondetermini~4tic in fact all "p(easible" syllables from the beginning of the input are checked internally (i.e.
in the intermediate stag~ before producing,mtput).
Thu.~s the notion ell a "pov~slble ~ syllable of English is catered fol.
From a psychological viewpoint it is an intere~ting fact that only the "possible" syl\]abh.,s aye considered.
This would also be tile case in human protest, tog Iff neologisms whereby no attempt would be made to form a syllable with an \[mpc~sib\].e in ltJal/flnal consonant cluster comb\]no\]los: humans can accept wwds which conform to the rules of their language even if the words do not actually exist.
Thus, with thi:3 meg/el we can distlngnish Imtween "possible" and "acttlal" words.
If we tested Currol\]'s Jabberwocky using this model we would get a correct syllable structure.
As already noted, the lexictm filters out actual words.
\]09 6.
Conclusion The implementation of this model doe~s not claim to be a speech recognition system as it stands but :\[,s fat.her an attempt to deal with a small component of such in a new, elegant and theorectically satisfytn S way.
Hnlfication and transduction can be seen to be useful m£~hanisms in syllable parsing.
Unification prey \[des uederspeclficahion-manlpulation and featurepan, sing facilities and transduction provides a translation facility between allophsnes and phonemes.
Tvansduction relations interpreted by a flnlte-state transduce/" have the further advantage c}f bidir'ectlonalty.
That is to say, one can translate \[\[om allophones to phonemes OY vice versa (perhaps with some ambiguity in the phoneme-allophone dtre~tion).
This system, however, should be a useful tool \[n both speech synthesis and speech analysis.
An exten&;~ou of this notion of a syllable parser is t(:) tale in terats of phonological words, whereby at the (epre_.sentation level the network would ¢:onsist of two.
sub-nets catering for redu¢:ed and unreduced syllables I'espectively.
A furthei extension is to use a treestructured lexicon could be employed in a similar way to that propor~e(l by Kay /\]9821 to distin~ulsh actual words from pc~.Jslble words.
Representing the lexicon as a diserlmination net and in terms of distinctive feature bundles makes it possible to deal with variol\]s })arts of a recognition system in a uniform way.
The movement of the transducei' may then be directed by usin~ 'the tree-lexicon in paraliel (see Flg.3>.
In. ca se:_~ where the input segment is underspecified hypotheses could be made immediately as to the values tlf particular feaflurgs thus excludi~ 5 paths which will eventually le~d to impossible sequences hence Inct~t~.~ing the efficiency of the parser.
