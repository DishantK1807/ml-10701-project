Various ways of implementing such a scheme can be imagined; one is the blackboard-based approach suggested by Wanner and Hovy \[1996\], another is the "Hunter-Gatherer" search paradigm introduced by Beale \[1996\].

Second, a number of studies take particular (RST-)relati0ns as a starting-point, and examine how these relations are signalled on the linguistic surface; examples are the PURPOSE, RESULT and PRECONDITION relations \[Vander Linden 1994\], the CONCESSION relation \[Grote et al.1997\], and the subject-matter relations occurring in a technical domain \[RSsner and Stede 1992, Delin et al.1996\]. However, these are all isolated studies, geared towards a particular application.

planning The traditional §plit of NLG systems in a content determination/what-to-say component and a realization/how-to-say component was in recent years •supplemented by an intermediate stage: sentence planning, sometimes called micro-planning (e.g., Rambow and Korelsky \[1992\]).

Accordingly, we advocate a flexible order of decisiommaking, as it can be realized in a blackboard-based architecture such as proposed by DIOGENES \[Nirenburg et al.1989\] and HealthDoc \[Wanner and Hovy 1996\].

Studies fall into two distinct groups: First, studies are concerned with identifying the characteristic •properties of a small set of similar markers, and determining the reasons behind choosing a particular marker from this set in a given context; examples are the markers since and because \[Elhadad and McKeown 1990\], or the temporal mark, ers before • and while \[Dorr and Gaasterland 1995\].

Following Wanner and Hovy \[1996\], a sentence planner has tomake the following decisions: Fine-grained discourse structuring, including discourse marker choice; sentence grouping and sentence content determination; clause-internal structuring; Choice of referring expressions; lexical choice} Two groups of considerations are important for these tasks: First, the motivating factors such as stylistic choices, semantic relations, intentions, theme development, focusing, discourse history.

Moser and Moore \[1995\] and DiEugenio et al.\[1997\] also take a broader view on marker production in that they try to determine general factors that influence the use of markers in text, and in that they consider more than pairs of propositions.• However, they are largely • concerned with marker occurrence and placement, not with marker selection.

Approaches that encode marker choice in the grammar (such as Vander Linden \[1994\]), while certainly an improvement over previous h l mappings between relations and markers, loose flexibility when it comes to account for the interactions between marker choice and other sentence planning decisions.

The output of the sentence planning module is a sequence of lexicalised sentence-semantic specifications (SemSpecs), based on SPL \[Kasper 1989\].
