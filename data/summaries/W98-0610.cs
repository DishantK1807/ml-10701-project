Nominator, a module which identifies proper names developed at the IBM TJ Watson Research categorizes them, and links expressions in the same document which refer to the same entity successfully exploited this property of documents (Wacholder et al.1997). Nominator first builds a list of proper names in each document and then applies heuristics in order to link names which refer to the same entity (e.g., Hillary Clinton and Ms.

Talcott. We are currently in the process of refining the head clustering procedure to handle organizations and other categories of proper names that have different naming conventions (Wacholder et al.1997). In contrast to common NPs and proper NPs, reference to concepts in the form of pronominal anaphors contribute no references to new entities and therefore will not be discussed in this paper.

A variation of this observation has been recognized by Strzalkowski (1997) and others, who have used the distinction between heads and modifiers for query expansion.

The input to LinkIT is text which has been pre-processed and tagged with part-of-speech by Mitre's publicly available Alembic Workbecn (Aberdeen et al.1995). One of LinkIT's components is a finite state grammar which extracts simplex NPs.

Later in the document, the same entity is usually referred to by a shorter, more ambiguous form of the name (Wacholder and Ravin 1997).
