Other work on monolingual, comparable sentence alignment by (Barzilay and Elhadad 2003) also supports that it is advantageous to first align comparable passages and then align the bilingual sentences within the aligned passages.

Multiple translations of a Chinese word is disambiguated by looking at the context of the sentences this word appears in (Fung et al., 1999).
P99-1043
The Chinese name entities are extracted with the system described in (Zhai et al 2004).

For comparable corpora, previous bilingual sentence or word pair extraction works are based soly on bilexical context assumption (Fung & McKeown 1995, Rapp 1995, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999, Barzilay and Elhadad 2003, Masao and Hitoshi 2003, Kenji and Hideki 2002).

Zhao and Vogel (2002) used a generative statistical machine translation alignment model, Munteanu and Marcu (2002) used suffix treesbased alignment model, and Munteanu and Marcu (2004) used a maximum entropy based classifier trained from parallel corpus to extract matching sentences from a comparable corpus of Arabic and English news.

Recent work has shown that even parallel sentences extracted from comparable corpora helps improve machine translation qualities (Munteanu and Marcu, 2004).

Previously, the author and other researchers had suggested that bi-lexical information based on context can still be used to find correspondences between passages, sentences, or words, in non-parallel, comparable texts of the same topic (Fung and McKeown 1995, Rapp 1995, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999).

Previous works have extracted bilingual word senses, lexicon and parallel sentence pairs from noisy parallel corpora (Fung and McKeown 1995, Fung and Lo 1998).
