The main linguistic advantages of such a forlnaiisnl are that: it provides u larger donlain of locality than CFG-based formalisms such as HPSG or LFG, it allows factoring recursion from tile domain of local dependencies, as a consextuence of both above properties, it allows the grammar to be totally lexicalized (Schabes et al, 1988).

As noted by Shieber and Schabes 1990, locality constraints are inherent to the formalism of Synchromms TAGs.

More precisely, the semantic interpretation of a sentence is built "synchronously" with its syntactic derivation, by choosing a pair of elementary trees (a syntactic one:T1, a semantic one:L1) from the grammar and repeatedly updating it as follows (Shieber and Schabes 1990): choose a link between two nodes nl and n2 in the pair (T1, L1), choose another pai r of trees (T2 and L2), the root nodes of which match the respective categories of the two nodes chosen above, form a new pair by combining T2 at node nl and L2 at node n2 and remove the link (if T2 and L2 have links, these are preserved in the resul0.

Baschung et al.1987 present a UCG treatment with a more restricted coverage which considers objeet citrics as functors taking (on their right) a verb expecting an NP (or PP) argument on its right and returning a more saturated verb.

This would be somewhat uuprincipled and 5 lead to numerous extra trees, unless one generates the new trees by metarules or lexical rules (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992, Becket 1990).
C92-1034
Feature structures are also associated at the nodes of the elementary trees and constraints on combining trees can be expressed in terms of success or failure of unification (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1988).

It is also the basis of an interactive NLF' enviromnent (Paroubek et al.1992). See Joshi 1987a and Schabes eta\].

We refer the reader to Shieber and Schabes 1990 for formal aspects of Synchronous TAGs (which are more powerful than TAGs).
C90-3045
Such semantic filtering is not without history (Cf Pullum 1984) but it seems especially fruitful with the Synchronous TAG formalism because: the syntax and the semantics use extactly the same formalism, the syntactic and semantic derivations are necessarily built up in parallel.
