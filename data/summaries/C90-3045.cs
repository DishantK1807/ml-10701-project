Schabes and Joshi (1988) and Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985) provide parsing algorithms for TAGs that could serw:: to parse the base formalism of a synchronous TAG.

In the case at hand, we have chosen single-component lexicalized TAGs with adjunction and substitution (Schabes et el., 1988).

Machine translation proceeds akmg similar lines by mapping two 'FAGs directly (Abeill6 et al., 1990), In previous work, one of us noted that generation according to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be semantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived semantics for an expression must include, in an appropriate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.

In summary, however, the analysis is slightly more restrictive than that of Hobbs and Shieber (1987), making predictions regarding the scope of topicalized or wh-moved constituents, relative scope of embedded quantifiers, and possibly even syntactic structure of complex NPs.

Furthermore, it is reasonable to require that the semantic component of a synchronous TAG t~ lexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing according to the semantic grammar and, consequenlly, more efficient generation.
