Treebank texts contain complete structural parsers, POS tags, and annotation of the antecedents of definite pronouns (added by Ge et al.1998). Because of the thorough syntactic information, DEs can be attributed with explicit phrase structure information.

Our experiments created translation modules for two evaluation corpora: written news stories from the Penn Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) and spoken task-oriented dialogues from the TRAINS93 corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1995).

We implemented meta-modules to interface to the genetic algorithm driver and to combine different salience factors into an overall score (similar to (Carbonell and Brown, 1988; Mitkov, 1998)).

This layer is reminiscent of the independent anaphora resolution modules in the Lucy system (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988), except that modules in that system were not designed to be easily turned on or off.
