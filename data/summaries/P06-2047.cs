Graph search algorithms, such as the ChuLiu-Edmonds maximum spanning tree algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967), algorithms based on the dynamic programming (DP) principle (Ozeki, 1994; Eisner, 1996) and the algorithm based on the B&B method (Hirakawa, 2001), are used for the optimum tree search in scored DGs.
C96-1058
(McDonald et al., 2005) proposed a dependency analysis method using a scored DG and some maximum spanning tree search algorithms.
H05-1066
Various types of DGs are used in existing systems according to these classifications, such as non-label word DG(Lee and Choi, 1997; Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005)4, syntactic-label word DG (Maruyama, 1990), semantic-label word DG(Hirakawa, 2001), non-label WPP DG(Ozeki, 1994; Katoh and Ehara, 1989), syntactic-label WPP DG(Wang and Harper, 2004), semantic-label concept DG(Harada and Mizuno, 2001).
