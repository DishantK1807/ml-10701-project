We note that the detection of paradigmatic variation within a slot in a set of otherwise identical aligned sequences (syntagms) is the basis for the classical distributional theory of language (Harris, 1954), as well as for some modern work (van Zaanen, 2000).

The only work described in a recent review (Roberts and Atwell, 2002) as completely unsupervised — the GraSp model (Henrichsen, 2002) — does attempt to induce syntax from raw transcribed speech, yet it is not completely data-driven in that it makes a prior commitment to a particular theory of syntax (Categorial Grammar, complete with a pre-specified set of allowed categories).
