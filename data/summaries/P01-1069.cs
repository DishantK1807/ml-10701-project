For example, the previous best result in the literature was achieved by a combination of 231 kernel support vector machines (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000) with an overall a132a76a133 a110a76a37 value of a209 a204 a41a206a73a165 . Each kernel support vector machine is computationally significantly more expensive than a corresponding Winnow classifier, and they use an order of magnitude more classifiers.

Similar methods have also appeared in other natural language processing systems (for example, in (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000)).

The previously second best system was a combination of five different WPDV models, with an overall a132a21a133 a110a76a37 value of a209 a204 a41a204a136a145 (van Halteren, 2000).

One method that has been quite successful in many applications is the SNoW architecture (Dagan et al., 1997; Khardon et al., 1999).
