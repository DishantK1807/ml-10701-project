In contrast with our discriminative model, a statistical parsing based generative model (Shi et al., 2007) has been proposed for a related task on this data set where the NEs and their relations are extracted together and used to identify which NEs are relevant in a particular sentence.

For relation extraction in the newswire domain, syntactic features have been used in a generative model (Miller et al., 2000) and in a discriminative log-linearmodel(Kambhatla, 2004).

PAKwasdefinedin (Moschitti, 2004) and only considers the path from the predicate to the target argument, which in our setting is the path from the PROTEIN to the ORGANISM or LOCATION names.

Kernel-based methods have also been used for relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) on various syntactic representations, such as dependency trees or constituencybased parse trees.

To benefit from both views, a composite kernel (Zhang et al., 2006) integrates the flat features from entities and structured features from parse trees.
