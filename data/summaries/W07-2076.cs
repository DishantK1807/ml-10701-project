There have also been promising results in recent work on the combination of unsupervised approaches that suggest the gap with respect to supervised systems is narrowing (Brody et al., 2006).

More recently researchers have begun to employ deeper syntactic analysis, such as dependency parsing (Yangarber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Sudo et al., 2001; Sudo et al., 2003; Yangarber, 2003).

We refer to this method as ?stacking?? and it has been previously used to integrate heterogeneous knowledge sources for WSD (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).

In fact, each resource presents different volume and accuracy figures (Cuadros et al., 2006).
