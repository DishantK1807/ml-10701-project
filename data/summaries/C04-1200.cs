For example, the following opinions contain Claims but no Sentiments: “I believe the world is flat” “The Gap is likely to go bankrupt” “Bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan” “Water always flushes anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere” Like Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), we want to automatically identify Sentiments, which in this work we define as an explicit or implicit expression in text of the Holder’s positive, negative, or neutral regard toward the Claim about the Topic.

Recent computational work either focuses on sentence ‘subjectivity’ (Wiebe et al.2002; Riloff et al.2003), concentrates just on explicit statements of evaluation, such as of films (Turney 2002; Pang et al.2002), or focuses on just one aspect of opinion, e.g., (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997) on adjectives.

We wish to study opinion in general; our work most closely resembles that of (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003).
