Fung and Yee (1998), for example, proposed to represent the contexts of a word or phrase with a real-valued vector (e.g., a TF-IDF vector), in which one element corresponds to one word in the contexts.

Nagata et al (2001), for example, proposed to collect partial parallel corpus data on the web to create a translation dictionary.

2. Related Work 2.1 Translation with Non-parallel Corpora A straightforward approach to word or phrase translation is to perform the task by using parallel bilingual corpora (e.g., Brown et al, 1993).

To deal with this difficulty, a number of methods have been proposed, which make use of relatively easily obtainable non-parallel corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).

We extracted Base NPs (noun-noun pairs) from the Encarta 1 English corpus using the tool developed by Xun et al (2000).
