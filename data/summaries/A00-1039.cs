While there has been prior research on identifying the primary lexical patterns of a sub-language or corpus (Grishman et al., 1986; Riloff, 1996), the task here is more complex, since we are typically not provided in advance with a sub-corpus of relevant passages; these passages must themselves be found as part of the discovery process.

This is similar to work by several other groups which aims to induce semantic classes through syntactic co-occurrence analysis (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pereira et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993; Hirschman et al., 1975), although in .our case the contexts are limited to selected patterns, relevant to the scenario.

(Yangarber and Grishman, 1997), while others have focused on methods for automatically converting a corpus annotated with extraction examples into such patterns (Lehnert et al., 1992; Fisher et al., 1995; Miller et al., 1998).

We use the general-purpose dependency parser of English, based on the FDG formalism (Tapanainen and J~rvinen, 1997) and developed by the Research Unit for Multilingual Language Technology at the University of Helsinki, and Conexor Oy.

Another instance is the so-called copredicatire (Nichols, 1978), in the parsing system (J~irvinen and Tapanainen, 1997).

The idea is to combine IR-style document selection with an iterative relaxation process; this is similar to techniques used elsewhere in NLP, and is inspired in large part, if remotely, by the work of (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993) on automatic alignment of sentences and words in a bilingual corpus.
