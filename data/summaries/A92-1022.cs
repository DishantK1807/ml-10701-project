grammar Using a sample of 260 sentence from the MUC-3 corpus (disjoint from the set used here for evaluation), we computed the probability of each production in our context-free grammar using an iterative unsupervised training scheme similar to the inside-outside algorithm \[Fujisaki, 1984; Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Chitrao, 1990\].

Application Task The experiments described below were performed on a version of the PROTEUS system as prepared for MUC-3, the third Message Understanding Conference \[Sundheim, 1991\].

The basic idea of a fitted parse is to "cover" the sentence using constituents of a few types \[Jensen et al., 1983\].

We use a system of preference semantics which penalizes but does not exclude constructs not matching any of these semantic patterns \[Grishman and Sterling, 1990\].

However, based on an idea proposed by Ezra Black \[Black et al., 1991\], a group organized by Phil Harrison has developed a metric and a program for performing just such a comparison.
