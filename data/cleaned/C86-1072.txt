The following paper Js based on work done in the multi-lingual MT-project EUROTRA, an MT-pro~ect of the European Community.
Analysis and generation of clauses within the EUROTRA-framework proceeds through the levels of (at least) EUROTRA constituent structure (ECS), EUROTRA relational structure (ERS) and interface structure (IS) (cf.
Arnold/des Tombe/Jaspaert.1985 and the EUROTRA-REFERENCE MANUAL, version I, revision 0).
At IS, labelling of nodes consists of labellings for time, modality, semantic features, semantic relations and others.
In this paper, we shalI be concerned exclusively with semantic relations (SRs), to which we shall also refer as "participant roles" (PR).
A list of EUROTRA SRs as given in ELS-3 is reproduced beiow: SR ----"---AGENT -EXPERIENCER -PAIIENT PLACE ---I--SPACE L TIME POSSESSION --ORIGIN -~ STUFFTIRESPACE POSGESSION -GOAL ~'~'SPACE TIRE BLUFF PGSSEBSIGN -PATH ~ SPACE I--" TIRE AI~ CONDITION CONCESSIVE CONSEQUENCE CAUSE CONCERN QUALITY ~TOTUN ACCORD ACCOMPANIMENT INSTRUMENT MEASURE According to current EUROTRA legislation, these gRs are assigned to dictionary entries of verbs (and other word classes, which will be disregarded in this paper) by coders, and through these entries to clauses in a pattern matching process.
This approach, while certainly valid in principle, leads to the problem of inter-coder-consistency, at least as long as the means for identifying SRs are paraphrase tests for SRs.
In EUROTRA-D, we have for some time now been experimenting with a set of SRs, or PRs, which are identified with tile help of syntactic criteria.
This approach will be outlined in the following.
Its roots, are to be found in the literature on semantic cases in general (cf.
Fillmore.1968 and 1977, Starosts 1977, Somers.198B) and more particularly, in ideas from Systemic Linguists (cf.
Fawcett.1980 and forthcoming, HaIliday.1967-68 and \]985, Sl:einer.1983 and 1985, Winograd.
1983). 2.
Definition of basic concepts To start with, we need a small set of basic concepts, which will be define(\[ in the following.
There is a basic distinction between Participant Roles and Circumstantial Roles on the semantic \]eve\], which the ELS-3 specifications do not contain.
There is the further distinction between inherent and non-inherent roles, which is also not explicitly made in ELS-3 and may be necessary at some point.
Participant Role: A participant role is a semantic constituent of a clause which is syntactically reaIized as a complement rather than as a modifier.
Circumstantial Role: A circumstantial role is a semantic constituent which is, on clause level, realized as a modifier rather than as a complement ~oq~ Participant Role: A semantic constituent which is, on clause level, realized as obligatory complement O~ional Participant Role: A semantic constituent which is, on clause level, realized as an optional complement Inherent Role: Inherent roles are obligatory participant roles and those participant roles which, Jf they are not realized in a clause, lead to look up in the preceding text or situation for a referent, Cf,: (20) David wax watching.
304 Not) Inherent Role: Non :inherenL roles are those participant roles wh\]eh, \[\[ Lhey #Ire not realized \]n the clause+ do not lead to look up, Cf.: (21) \])evJd J s eatJ rip, 3.

Conclusion The statements in this paper are necessarily very sketchy and brief.
More detailed information will be given in the oral presentation.
The assignment of semantic relations, as presented here, has been worked out for German in some detail.
The available literature for English, especially in the work of Fawcett and Halliday, shows that the treatment of English in the same way does not present a major problem.
It seems to be reasonable to assume that the method outlined constitutes a worthwhile way to explore for a multi-lingual MT-project such as EUROTRA.
Acknowledgements: I am very grateful to my colleagues in EUROTRA-D for many critical comments on my work.
Most indebted, though, I am to Robin P.
Fawcett for many hours of discussion and explorations.
Needless to say, that the responsibility for any weaknesses in form and content rest with the author alone.
