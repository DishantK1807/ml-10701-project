Abstract
The variety of engaging interactions
among users in social medial distinguishes
it from traditional Web media. Such a fea-
ture should be utilized while attempting to
provide intelligent services to social me-
dia participants. In this article, we present
a framework to recommend relevant infor-
mation in Internet forums and blogs using
user comments, one of the most represen-
tative of user behaviors in online discus-
sion. When incorporating user comments,
we consider structural, semantic, and au-
thority information carried by them. One
of the most important observation from
this work is that semantic contents of user
comments can play a fairly different role
in a different form of social media. When
designing a recommendation system for
this purpose, such a difference must be
considered with caution.
1 Introduction
In the past twenty years, the Web has evolved
from a framework of information dissemination to
a social interaction facilitator for its users. From
the initial dominance of static pages or sites, with
addition of dynamic content generation and pro-
vision of client-side computation and event han-
dling, Web applications have become a preva-
lent framework for distributed GUI applications.
Such technological advancement has fertilized vi-
brant creation, sharing, and collaboration among
the users (Ahn et al., 2007). As a result, the role
of Computer Science is not as much of designing
or implementing certain data communication tech-
niques, but more of enabling a variety of creative
uses of the Web.
In a more general context, Web is one of the
most important carriers for “social media”, e.g. In-
ternet forums, blogs, wikis, podcasts, instant mes-
saging, and social networking. Various engaging
interactions among users in social media differ-
entiate it from traditional Web sites. Such char-
acteristics should be utilized in attempt to pro-
vide intelligent services to social media users.
One form of such interactions of particular inter-
est here is user comments. In self-publication, or
customer-generated media, a user can publish an
article or post news to share with others. Other
users can read and comment on the posting and
these comments can, in turn, be read and com-
mented on. Digg (www.digg.com), Yahoo!Buzz
(buzz.yahoo.com) and various kinds of blogs are
commercial examples of self-publication. There-
fore, reader responses to earlier discussion provide
a valuable source of information for effective rec-
ommendation.
Currently, self-publishing media are becoming
increasingly popular. For instance, at this point of
writing, Technorati is indexing over 133 million
blogs, and about 900,000 new blogs are created
worldwide daily1. With such a large scale, infor-
mation in the blogosphere follows a Long Tail Dis-
tribution (Agarwal et al., 2010). That is, in aggre-
gate, the not-so-well-known blogs can have more
valuable information than the popular ones. This
gives us an incentive to develop a recommender
to provide a set of relevant articles, which are ex-
pected to be of interest to the current reader. The
user experience with the system can be immensely
enhanced with the recommended articles. In this
work, we focus on recommendation in Internet fo-
rums and blogs with discussion threads.
Here, a fundamental challenge is to account for
topic divergence, i.e. the change of gist during
the process of discussion. In a discussion thread,
the original posting is typically followed by other
readers’ opinions, in the form of comments. Inten-

tion and concerns of active users may change as
the discussion goes on. Therefore, recommenda-
tion, if it were only based on the original posting,
can not benefit the potentially evolving interests of
the users. Apparently, there is a need to consider
topic evolution in adaptive content-based recom-
mendation and this requires novel techniques in
order to capture topic evolution precisely and to
prevent drastic topic shifting which returns com-
pletely irrelevant articles to users.
In this work, we present a framework to recom-
mend relevant information in Internet forums and
blogs using user comments, one of the most rep-
resentative recordings of user behaviors in these
forms of social media.
It has the following contributions.
uni2219 The relevant information is recommended
based on a balanced perspective of both the
authors and readers.
uni2219 We model the relationship among comments
and that relative to the original posting us-
ing graphs in order to evaluate their combined
impact. In addition, the weight of a comment
is further enhanced with its content and with
the authority of its poster.
2 Related
Work
In a broader context, a related problem is content-
based information recommendation (or filtering).
Most information recommender systems select ar-
ticles based on the contents of the original post-
ings. For instance, Chiang and Chen (Chiang and
Chen, 2004) study a few classifiers for agent-based
news recommendations. The relevant news selec-
tions of these work are determined by the textual
similarity between the recommended news and the
original news posting. A number of later proposals
incorporate additional metadata, such as user be-
haviors and timestamps. For example, Claypool et
al. (Claypool et al., 1999) combine the news con-
tent with numerical user ratings. Del Corso, Gull´ı,
and Romani (Del Corso et al., 2005) use times-
tamps to favor more recent news. Cantador, Bel-
login, and Castells (Cantador et al., 2008) utilize
domain ontology. Lee and Park (Lee and Park,
2007) consider matching between news article at-
tributes and user preferences. Anh et al. (Ahn
et al., 2007) and Lai, Liang, and Ku (Lai et al.,
2003) construct explicit user profiles, respectively.
Lavrenko et al. (Lavrenko et al., 2000) propose
the e-Analyst system which combines news stories
with trends in financial time series. Some go even
further by ignoring the news contents and only us-
ing browsing behaviors of the readers with similar
interests (Das et al., 2007).
Another related problem is topic detection and
tracking (TDT), i.e. automated categorization of
news stories by their themes. TDT consists
of breaking the stream of news into individual
news stories, monitoring the stories for events
that have not been seen before, and categorizing
them (Lavrenko and Croft, 2001). A topic is mod-
eled with a language profile deduced by the news.
Most existing TDT schemes calculate the similar-
ity between a piece of news and a topic profile to
determine its topic relevance (Lavrenko and Croft,
2001) (Yang et al., 1999). Qiu (Qiu et al., 2009)
apply TDT techniques to group news for collabo-
rative news recommendation. Some work on TDT
takes one step further in that they update the topic
profiles as part of the learning process during its
operation (Allan et al., 2002) (Leek et al., 2002).
Most recent researches on information recom-
mendation in social media focus on the blogo-
sphere. Various types of user interactions in the
blogosphere have been observed. A prominent
feature of the blogosphere is the collective wis-
dom (Agarwal et al., 2010). That is, the knowledge
in the blogosphere is enriched by such engaging
interactions among bloggers and readers as post-
ing, commenting and tagging. Prior to this work,
the linking structure and user tagging mechanisms
in the blogosphere are the most widely adopted
ones to model such collective wisdom. For ex-
ample, Esmaili et al. (Esmaili et al., 2006) fo-
cus on the linking structure among blogs. Hayes,
Avesani, and Bojars (Hayes et al., 2007) explore
measures based on blog authorship and reader tag-
ging to improve recommendation. Li and Chen
further integrate trust, social relation and semantic
analysis (Li and Chen, 2009). These approaches
attempt to capture accurate similarities between
postings without using reader comments. Due
to the interactions between bloggers and readers,
blog recommendation should not limit its input to
only blog postings themselves but also incorporate
feedbacks from the readers.
The rest of this article is organized as follows.
We first describe the design of our recommenda-
tion framework in Section 3. We then evaluate
the performance of such a recommender using two

3 System
Design
In this section, we present a mechanism for rec-
ommendation in Internet forums and blogs. The
framework is sketched in Figure 1. Essentially,
it builds a topic profile for each original posting
along with the comments from readers, and uses
this profile to retrieve relevant articles. In par-
ticular, we first extract structural, semantic, and
authority information carried by the comments.
Then, with such collective wisdom, we use a graph
to model the relationship among comments and
that relative to the original posting in order to eval-
uate the impact of each comment. The graph is
weighted with postings’ contents and the authors’
authority. This information along with the original
posting and its comments are fed into a synthe-
sizer. The synthesizer balances views from both
authors and readers to construct a topic profile to
retrieve relevant articles.
3.1 Incorporating
Comments
In a discussion thread, comments made at differ-
ent levels reflect the variation of focus of read-
ers. Therefore, recommended articles should re-
flect their concerns to complement the author’s
opinion. The degree of contribution from each
comment, however, is different. In the extreme
case, some of them are even advertisements which
are completely irrelevant to the discussion topics.
In this work, we use a graph model to differenti-
ate the importance of each comment. That is, we
model the authority, semantic, structural relations
of comments to determine their combined impact.
3.1.1 Authority
Scoring Comments
Intuitively, each comment may have a different de-
gree of authority determined by the status of its
author (Hu et al., 2007). Assume we have u1D45B users
in a forum, denoted by u1D448 uni003D uni007Bu1D462uni0031uni002Cu1D462uni0032uni002Cuni002Euni002Euni002Euni002Cu1D462u1D45Buni007D.
We calculate the authority u1D44Eu1D456 for user u1D462u1D456. To do
that, we employ a variant of the PageRank algo-
rithm (Brin and Page, 1998). We consider the
cases that a user replies to a previous posting and
that a user quotes a previous posting separately.
For user u1D462u1D457, we use u1D459u1D45Funi0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029 to denote the number
of times that u1D462u1D457 has replied to user u1D462u1D456. Similarly,
we use u1D459u1D45Euni0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029 to denote the number of times that
u1D462u1D457 has quoted user u1D462u1D456. We combine them linearly:
u1D459uni2032uni0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029 uni003D u1D6FDuni0031u1D459u1D45Funi0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029uni002Bu1D6FDuni0032u1D459u1D45Euni0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029uni002E
Further, we normalize the above quantity to record
how frequently a user refers to another:
u1D459uni0028u1D456uni002Cu1D457uni0029 uni003D u1D459

uni002E
Inline with the PageRank algorithm, we define
the authority of user u1D462u1D456 as
u1D44Eu1D456 uni003D u1D706u1D45B uni002Buni0028uni0031uni2212u1D706uni0029uni00D7

3.1.2 Differentiating
comments with
Semantic and Structural relations
Next, we construct a similar model in terms of the
comments themselves. In this model, we treat the
original posting and the comments each as a text
node. This model considers both the content simi-
larity between text nodes and the logic relationship
among them.
On the one hand, the semantic similarity be-
tween two nodes can be measured with any com-
monly adopted metric, such as cosine similarity
and Jaccard coefficient (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-
Neto, 1999). On the other hand, the structural re-
lation between a pair of nodes takes two forms
as we have discussed earlier. First, a comment
can be made in response to the original posting
or at most one earlier comment. In graph theo-
retic terms, the hierarchy can be represented as a
tree u1D43Au1D447 uni003D uni0028u1D449uni002Cu1D438u1D447uni0029, where u1D449 is the set of all text
nodes and u1D438u1D447 is the edge set. In particular, the
original posting is the root and all the comments
are ordinary nodes. There is an arc (directed edge)
u1D452u1D447 uni2208 u1D438u1D447 from node u1D463 to node u1D462, denoted uni0028u1D463uni002Cu1D462uni0029, if
the corresponding comment u1D462 is made in response
to comment (or original posting) u1D463. Second, a
comment can quote from one or more earlier com-
ments. From this perspective, the hierarchy can
be modeled using a directed acyclic graph (DAG),

Figure 2: Multi-relation graph of comments based
on the structural and semantic information
denoted u1D43Au1D437 uni003D uni0028u1D449uni002Cu1D438u1D437uni0029. There is an arc u1D452u1D437 uni2208 u1D438u1D437
from node u1D463 to node u1D462, denoted uni0028u1D463uni002Cu1D462uni0029, if the corre-
sponding comment u1D462 quotes comment (or original
posting) u1D463. As shown in Figure 2, for either graph
u1D43Au1D447 or u1D43Au1D437, we can use a uni2223u1D449uni2223uni00D7uni2223u1D449uni2223 adjacency ma-
trix, denoted u1D440u1D447 and u1D440u1D437, respectively, to record
them. Similarly, we can also use a uni2223u1D449uni2223uni00D7uni2223u1D449uni2223 ma-
trix defined on uni005Buni0030uni002Cuni0031uni005D to record the content similar-
ity between nodes and denote it by u1D440u1D436. Thus, we
combine these three aspects linearly:
u1D440 uni003D u1D6FEuni0031 uni00D7u1D440u1D436 uni002Bu1D6FEuni0032 uni00D7u1D440u1D447 uni002Bu1D6FEuni0033 uni00D7u1D440u1D437uni002E
The importance of a text node can be quantized
by the times it has been referred to. Considering
the semantic similarity between nodes, we use an-
other variant of the PageRank algorithm to calcu-
late the weight of comment u1D457:
u1D460uni2032u1D457 uni003D u1D706uni2223u1D449uni2223 uni002Buni0028uni0031uni2212u1D706uni0029uni00D7

u1D45Fu1D458uni002Cu1D457 uni00D7u1D460uni2032u1D458uni002C
where u1D706 is a damping factor, and u1D45Fu1D458uni002Cu1D457 is the nor-
malized weight of comment u1D458 referring to u1D457 de-
fined as
u1D45Funi0028u1D458uni002Cu1D457uni0029 uni003D u1D440u1D458uni002Cu1D457uni2211.alt01
u1D457
u1D440u1D458uni002Cu1D457 uni002Bu1D716uni002C
where u1D440u1D458uni002Cu1D457 is an entry in the graph adjacency ma-
trix M and u1D716 is a constant to avoid division by zero.
In some social networking media, a user may
have a subset of other users as “friends”. This can
be captured by a uni2223u1D448uni2223uni00D7uni2223u1D448uni2223 matrix of uni007Buni0030uni002Cuni0031uni007D, whose
entries are denoted by u1D453u1D456uni002Cu1D457. Thus, with this infor-
mation and assuming poster u1D456 has made a comment
k for user u1D457’s posting, the final weight of this com-
ment is defined as
u1D460u1D458 uni003D u1D460uni2032u1D458 uni00D7
uni0028.alt03u1D44E
u1D456 uni002Bu1D453u1D456uni002Cu1D457

3.2 Topic
Profile Construction
Once the weight of comments on one posting is
quantified by our models, this information along
with the entire discussion thread is fed into a syn-
thesizer to construct a topic profile. As such, the
perspectives of both authors and readers are bal-
anced for recommendation.
The profile is a weight vector of terms to model
the language used in the discussion thread. Con-
sider a posting u1D451uni0030 and its comment sequence
uni007Bu1D451uni0031uni002Cu1D451uni0032uni002Cuni22C5uni22C5uni22C5uni002Cu1D451u1D45Auni007D. For each term u1D461, a compound
weight u1D44Auni0028u1D461uni0029 uni003D uni0028uni0031uni2212u1D6FCuni0029 uni00D7 u1D44Auni0031uni0028u1D461uni0029 uni002B u1D6FC uni00D7 u1D44Auni0032uni0028u1D461uni0029
is calculated. It is a linear combination of the
contribution by the posting itself, u1D44Auni0031uni0028u1D461uni0029, and that
by the comments, u1D44Auni0032uni0028u1D461uni0029. We assume that each
term is associated with an “inverted document fre-
quency”, denoted by u1D43Cuni0028u1D461uni0029 uni003D uni006Cuni006Funi0067 u1D441u1D45Buni0028u1D461uni0029, where u1D441 is
the corpus size and u1D45Buni0028u1D461uni0029 is the number of docu-
ments in corpus containing term u1D461. We use a func-
tion u1D453uni0028u1D461uni002Cu1D451uni0029 to denote the number of occurrences of
term u1D461 in document u1D451, i.e. “term frequency”. Thus,
when the original posting and comments are each
considered as a document, this term frequency can
be calculated for any term in any document. We
thus define the weight of term u1D461 in document u1D451, be
the posting itself or a comment, using the standard
TF/IDF definition (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
1999):
u1D464uni0028u1D461uni002Cu1D451uni0029 uni003D
uni0028.alt03
uni0030uni002Euni0035uni002Buni0030uni002Euni0035uni00D7 u1D453uni0028u1D461uni002Cu1D451uni0029uni006Duni0061uni0078
u1D461uni2032 u1D453uni0028u1D461uni2032uni002Cu1D451uni0029
uni0029.alt03
uni00D7u1D43Cuni0028u1D461uni0029uni002E
The weight contributed by the posting itself, u1D451uni0030,
is thus:
u1D44Auni0031uni0028u1D461uni0029 uni003D u1D464uni0028u1D461uni002Cu1D451uni0030uni0029uni006Duni0061uni0078

The weight contribution from the comments

guage features of these documents but also their
importance in the discussion thread. That is, the
contribution of comment score is incorporated into
weight calculation of the words in a comment.

uni002E
Such a treatment of compounded weight u1D44Auni0028u1D461uni0029
is essentially to recognize that readers’ impact on
selecting relevant articles and the difference of
their influence. For each profile, we select the top-
u1D45B highest weighted words to represent the topic.
260
With the topic profile thus constructed, the re-
triever returns an ordered list of articles with de-
creasing relevance to the topic. Note that our
approach to differentiate the importance of each
comment can be easily incorporated into any
generic retrieval model. In this work, our retriever
is adopted from (Lavrenko et al., 2000).
3.3 Interpretation
of Recommendation
Since interpreting recommended items enhances
users’ trusting beliefs (Wang and Benbasat, 2007),
we design a creative approach to generate hints
to indicate the relationship (generalization, spe-
cialization and duplication) between the recom-
mended articles and the original posting based on
our previous work (Candan et al., 2009).
Article u1D434 being more general than u1D435 can be in-
terpreted as u1D434 being less constrained than u1D435 by
the keywords they contain. Let us consider two ar-
ticles, u1D434 and u1D435, where u1D434 contains keywords, u1D458uni0031
and u1D458uni0032, and u1D435 only contains u1D458uni0031.
uni2219 If u1D434 is said to be more general than u1D435, then
the additional keyword, u1D458uni0032, of article u1D434 must
render u1D434 less constrained than u1D435. Therefore,
the content of u1D434 can be interpreted as u1D458uni0031uni222Au1D458uni0032.
uni2219 If, on the other hand, u1D434 is said to be more
specific than u1D435, then the additional keyword,
u1D458uni0032, must render u1D434 more constrained than u1D435.
Therefore, the content of u1D434 can be interpreted
as u1D458uni0031 uni2229u1D458uni0032.
Note that, in the two-keyword space uni27E8u1D458uni0031uni002Cu1D458uni0032uni27E9, u1D434
can be denoted by a vector uni27E8u1D44Eu1D434uni002Cu1D44Fu1D434uni27E9 and u1D435 can be
denoted by uni27E8u1D44Eu1D435uni002Cuni0030uni27E9. The origin u1D442 uni003D uni27E8uni0030uni002Cuni0030uni27E9 cor-
responds to the case where an article does contain
neither u1D458uni0031 nor u1D458uni0032. That is, u1D442 corresponds to an
article which can be interpreted as uni00ACu1D458uni0031 uni2229uni00ACu1D458uni0032 uni2261
uni00ACuni0028u1D458uni0031 uni222Au1D458uni0032uni0029. Therefore, if u1D434 is said to be more
general than u1D435, uni0394u1D434 uni003D u1D451uni0028u1D434uni002Cu1D442uni0029 should be greater
than uni0394u1D435 uni003D u1D451uni0028u1D435uni002Cu1D442uni0029. This allows us to measure
the degrees of generalization and specialization of
two articles. Given two articles, u1D434 and u1D435, of the
same topic, they will have a common keyword
base, while both articles will also have their own
content, different from their common base. Let
us denote the common part of u1D434 by u1D434u1D450 and com-
mon part of u1D435 by u1D435u1D450. Note that uni0394u1D434u1D436 and uni0394u1D435u1D436
are usually unequal because the same words in the
common part have different term weights in article
u1D434 and u1D435 respectively. Given these and the gener-
alization concept introduced above for two similar
articles u1D434 and u1D435, we can define the degree of gen-
eralization (u1D43Au1D434u1D435) and specialization (u1D446u1D434u1D435) of u1D435
with respect to u1D434 as
u1D43Au1D434u1D435 uni003D uni0394u1D434uni002Funi0394u1D435u1D450uni002Cu1D446u1D434u1D435 uni003D uni0394u1D435uni002Funi0394u1D434u1D450uni002E
To alleviate the effect of document length, we
revise the definition as
u1D43Au1D434u1D435 uni003D uni0394u1D434uni002Funi006Cuni006Funi0067uni0028uni0394u1D434uni0029uni0394u1D435u1D450uni002Funi006Cuni006Funi0067uni0028uni0394u1D434uni002Buni0394u1D435uni0029uni002C
u1D446u1D434u1D435 uni003D uni0394u1D435uni002Funi006Cuni006Funi0067uni0028uni0394u1D435uni0029uni0394u1D434u1D450uni002Funi006Cuni006Funi0067uni0028uni0394u1D434uni002Buni0394u1D435uni0029uni002E
The relative specialization and generalization
values can be used to reveal the relationships be-
tween recommended articles and the original post-
ing. Given original posting u1D434 and recommended
article u1D435, if u1D43Au1D434u1D435 uni003E uni0398u1D454, for a given generalization
threshold uni0398u1D454, then B is marked as a generalization.
When this is not the case, if u1D446u1D434u1D435 uni003E uni0398u1D460, for a given
specialization threshold, uni0398u1D460, then u1D435 is marked as
a specialization. If neither of these cases is true,
then u1D435 is duplicate of u1D434.
Such an interpretation provides a control on de-
livering recommended articles. In particular, we
can filter the duplicate articles to avoid recom-
mending the same information.
4 Experimental
Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed rec-
ommendation mechanism, we carry out a series of
experiments on two synthetic data sets, collected
from Internet forums and blogs, respectively. The
first data set is called Forum. This data set is
constructed by randomly selecting 20 news arti-
cles with corresponding reader comments from the
Digg Web site and 16,718 news articles from the
Reuters news Web site. This simulates the sce-
nario of recommending relevant news from tradi-
tional media to social media users for their further
reading. The second one is the Blog data set con-
taining 15 blog articles with user comments and
15,110 articles obtained from the Myhome Web
site 2. Details of these two data sets are shown in
Table 1. For evaluation purposes, we adopt the tra-
ditional pooling strategy (Zobel, 1998) and apply
to the TREC data set to mark the relevant articles
for each topic.

The recommendation engine may return a set of
essentially the same articles re-posted at different
sites. Therefore, we introduce a metric of novelty
to measure the topic diversity of returned sugges-
tions. In our experiments, we define precision and
novelty metrics as
u1D443uni0040u1D441 uni003D uni2223u1D436 uni2229u1D445uni2223uni2223u1D445uni2223 and u1D437uni0040u1D441 uni003D uni2223u1D438 uni2229u1D445uni2223uni2223u1D445uni2223 uni002C
where u1D445 is the subset of the top-u1D45B articles returned
by the recommender, u1D436 is the set of manually
tagged relevant articles, and u1D438 is the set of man-
ually tagged relevant articles excluding duplicate
ones to the original posting. We select the top 10
articles for evaluation assuming most readers only
browse up to 10 recommended articles (Karypis,
2001). Meanwhile, we also utilize mean aver-
age precision (MAP) and mean average novelty
(MAN) to evaluate the entire set of returned ar-
ticle.
We test our proposal in four aspects. First, we
compare our work to two baseline works. We then
present results for some preliminary tests to find
out the optimal values for two critical parameters.
Next, we study the effect of user authority and
its integration to comment weighting. Fourth, we
evaluate the performance gain obtained from inter-
preting recommendation. In addition, we provide
a significance test to show that the observed differ-
ences in effectiveness for different approaches are
not incidental. In particular, we use the u1D461-test here,
which is commonly used for significance tests in
information retrieval experiments (Hull, 1993).
4.1 Overall
Performance
As baseline proposals, we also implement two
well-known content-based recommendation meth-
ods (Bogers and Bosch, 2007). The first method,
Okapi, is commonly applied as a representa-
tive of the classic probabilistic model for rele-
vant information retrieval (Robertson and Walker,
1994). The second one, LM, is based on statisti-
cal language models for relevant information re-
trieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998). It builds a proba-

bilistic language model for each article, and ranks
them on query likelihood, i.e. the probability of the
model generating the query. Following the strat-
egy of Bogers and Bosch, relevant articles are se-
lected based on the title and the first 10 sentences
of the original postings. This is because articles
are organized in the so-called inverted pyramid
style, meaning that the most important informa-
tion is usually placed at the beginning. Trimming
the rest of an article would usually remove rela-
tively less crucial information, which speeds up
the recommendation process.
A paired u1D461-test shows that using u1D443uni0040uni0031uni0030 and
u1D437uni0040uni0031uni0030 as performance measures, our approach
performs significantly better than the baseline
methods for both Forum and Blog data sets as
shown in Table 2. In addition, we conduct u1D461-tests
using MAP and MAN as performance measures,
respectively, and the u1D45D-values of these tests are all
less than 0.05, meaning that the results of experi-
ments are statistically significant. We believe that
such gains are introduced by the additional infor-
mation from the collective wisdom, i.e. user au-
thority and comments. Note that the retrieval pre-
cision for Blog of two baseline methods is not as
good as that for Forum. Our explanation is that
blog articles may not be organized in the inverted
pyramid style as strictly as news forum articles.
4.2 Parameters
of Topic Profile
There are two important parameters to be consid-
ered to construct topic profiles for recommenda-
tion. 1) the number of the most weighted words
to represent the topic, and 2) combination coeffi-
cient u1D6FC to determine the contribution of original
posting and comments in selecting relevant arti-
cles.We conduct a series of experiments and find
out that the optimal performance is obtained when
the number of words is between 50 and 70, and
u1D6FC is between 0.65 and 0.75. When u1D6FC is set to 0,
the recommended articles only reflect the author’s
opinion. When u1D6FC uni003D uni0031, the suggested articles rep-
resent the concerns of readers exclusively. In the

4.3 Effect
of Authority and Comments
In this part, we explore the contribution of user
authority and comments in social media recom-
mender. In particular, we study the following sce-
narios with increasing system capabilities. Note
that, lacking friend information (Section 3.1.2) in
the Forum data set, u1D453u1D456uni002Cu1D457 is set to zero.
uni2219 RUN 1 (Posting): the topic profile is con-
structed only based on the original posting
itself. This is analogous to traditional rec-
ommenders which only consider the focus of
authors for suggesting further readings.
uni2219 RUN 2 (Posting+Authority): the topic profile
is constructed based on the original posting
and participant authority.
uni2219 RUN 3 (Posting+Comment): the topic profile
is constructed based on the original posting
and its comments.
uni2219 RUN 4 (All): the topic profile is constructed
based on the original posting, user authority,
and its comments.
Here, we set u1D6FEuni0031 uni003D u1D6FEuni0032 uni003D u1D6FEuni0033 uni003D uni0031. Our u1D461-test
shows that using u1D443uni0040uni0031uni0030 and u1D437uni0040uni0031uni0030 as performance
measures, RUN4 performs best in both Forum and
Blog data sets as shown in Table 3. There is a step-
wise performance improvement while integrating
user authority, comments and both. With the as-
sistance of user authority and comments, the rec-
ommendation precision is improved up to 9.8%
and 21.6% for Forum and Blog, respectively. The
opinion of readers is an effective complementarity
to the authors’ view in suggesting relevant infor-
mation for further reading.
Moreover, we investigate the effect of the se-
mantic and structural relations among comments,
i.e. semantic similarity, reply, and quotation. For
this purpose, we carry out a series of experiments
based on different combinations of these relations.

tent and reply relation matrices are used in

uni2219 Quotation+Reply Relation (QRR): both the
quotation and reply relation matrices are used
in scoring the comments.
uni2219 All: all three matrices are used.
The MAP yielded by these combinations for
both data sets is plotted in Figure 3. For the case of
Forum, we observe that incorporating content in-
formation adversely affects recommendation pre-
cision. This concurs with what we saw in our pre-
vious work (Wang et al., 2010). On the other hand,
when we test the Blog data set, the trend is the op-
posite, i.e. content similarity does contribute to re-
trieval performance positively. This is attributed
by the text characteristics of these two forms of
social media. Specifically, comments in news fo-
rums usually carry much richer structural informa-
tion than blogs where comments are usually “flat”
among themselves.
4.4 Recommendation
Interpretation
To evaluate the precision of interpreting the re-
lationship between recommended articles and the
263
original posting, the evaluation metric of success
rate u1D446 is defined as
u1D446 uni003D
u1D45Auni2211.alt02
u1D456uni003Duni0031
uni0028uni0031uni2212u1D452u1D456uni0029uni002Fu1D45Auni002C
where u1D45A is the number of recommended articles,
u1D452u1D456 is the error weight of recommended article u1D456.
Here, the error weight is set to one if the result
interpretation is mis-labelled.
From our studies, we observe that the success
rate at top-10 is around 89.3% and 87.5% for the
Forum and Blog data sets, respectively. Note that
these rates include the errors introduced by the ir-
relevant articles returned by the retrieval module.
To estimate optimal thresholds of generalization
and specialization, we calculate the success rate at
different threshold values and find that neither too
small nor too large a value is appropriate for inter-
pretation. In our experiments, we set generaliza-
tion threshold uni0398u1D454 to 3.2 and specialization thresh-
old uni0398u1D460 to 1.8 for the Forum data set, and uni0398u1D454 to 3.5
and uni0398u1D460 to 2.0 for Blog. Ideally, threshold values
would need to be set through a machine learning
process, which identifies proper values based on a
given training sample.
5 Conclusion
and Future Work
The Web has become a platform for social net-
working, in addition to information dissemination
at its earlier stage. Many of its applications are
also being extended in this fashion. Traditional
recommendation is essentially a push service to
provide information according to the profile of in-
dividual or groups of users. Its niche at the Web
2.0 era lies in its ability to enable online discus-
sion by serving up relevant references to the par-
ticipants. In this work, we present a framework for
information recommendation in such social media
as Internet forums and blogs. This model incor-
porates information of user status and comment
semantics and structures within the entire discus-
sion thread. This framework models the logic con-
nections among readers and the innovativeness of
comments. By combining such information with
traditional statistical language models, it is capa-
ble of suggesting relevant articles that meet the dy-
namic nature of a discussion in social media. One
important discovery from this work is that, when
integrating comment contents, the structural infor-
mation among comments, and reader relationship,
it is crucial to distinguish the characteristics of var-
ious forms of social media. The reason is that the
role that the semantic content of a comment plays
can differ from one form to another.
This study can be extended in a few interest-
ing ways. For example, we can also evaluate its
effectiveness and costs during the operation of a
discussion forum, where the discussion thread is
continually updated by new comments and votes.
Indeed, its power is yet to be further improved and
investigated.
