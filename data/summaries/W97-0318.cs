The ability to distinguish states, e.g., "Mark seems happy," from events, e.g., "Rende ran down the street," is a necessary prerequisite for interpreting certain adverbial adjuncts, as well as identifying temporal constraints between sentences in a discourse (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Doff, 1992; Klavans, 1994).

and for the automatic identification of semantically related groups of words (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993).

Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectual classification by placing verbs on a "stativity scale" according to the frequency with which they occur in the progressive.

Classification performance may also improve by incorporating additional linguistic indicators, such as co-occurrence with rate adverbs, e.g., quickly, or occurrences as a complement of force or persuade, as suggested by Klavans and Chodorow (1992).
C92-4177
Certain features of a clause, such as adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the aspectual class of the clause (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Pustejovsky, 1991; Passonneau, 1988; Klavans, 1994).

The English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord, 1990) has previously been used on corpora to accumulate aspectual data (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).

Previous efforts in corpus-based natural language processing have incorporated machine learning methods to coordinate multiple linguistic indicators, e.g., to classify adjectives according to markedness (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1995), to perform accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), for disambiguation problems (Yarowsky, 1994; Luk, 1995), 158 n States Events be 23,409 100.0% 0.0% have 7,882 69.9% 30.1% all other verbs 66,682 16.2% 83.8% Table 4: Breakdown of verb occurrences.

Aspectual classification is a necessary component for a system that analyzes temporal constraints, or performs lexical choice and tense selection in machine translation (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passonneau, 1988; Doff, 1992; Klavans, 1994).
J88-2003 J88-2005
As suggested by Klavans and Chodorow (1992), a weighted sum of multiple indicators that results in one "overall" indicator may provide an increase in classification performance.

3Similar baselines for comparison have been used for many classification problems (Duda and Hart, 1973), e.g., part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988; Allen, 1995).

Researchers have used empirical analysis of corpora to develop linguistically-based numerical indicators that aid in aspectual classification (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Siegel and McKeown, 1996).
