Important technical problems involving leftrecursive and unit productions are examined and overcome in (Stolcke, 1995).

(Stolcke, 1995, page 8) This correspondence between paths of parser operations and derivations enables the computation of the pre x probability { the sum of all derivations compatible with the pre x seen so far.

These loads can be e ciently calculated using a probabilistic Earley parser (Stolcke, 1995) which is interpreted as generating predictions about reading time on a word-by-word basis.

In this section I provide a brief overview of Stolckeâ€™s algorithm but the original paper should be consulted for full details (Stolcke, 1995).

Aware that the n-gram obscures many linguistically-signi cant distinctions (Chomsky, 1956, section 2.3), many speech researchers (Jelinek and La erty, 1991) sought to incorporate hierarchical phrase structure into language modeling (see (Stolcke, 1997)) although it was not until the late 1990s that such models were able to signi cantly improve on 3-grams (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998).

To address this criticism, the same pre x probabilities could be computing using tree-adjoining grammars (Nederhof et al., 1998).
