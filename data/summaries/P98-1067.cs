In experiments reported elsewhere, we have applied SRV to collections of electronic seminar announcements and World Wide Web pages (Freitag, 1998).
P98-1067
Several researchers have reported IE systems which use machine learning at their core (Soderland, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1997).

Readers interested in a more thorough description of SRV are referred to (Freitag, 1998).
P98-1067
Top-down search is more sensitive to patterns in the data, and less dependent on heuristics, than the bottom-up search used by similar systems (Soderland, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1997).
W97-1002
Rote (see (Freitag, 1998)), memorizes field instances seen during training and only makes predictions when the same fragments are encountered in novel documents.
