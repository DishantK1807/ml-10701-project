The last two counts (CAUS and ANIM) were performed on a 29-million word parsed corpus (\gall Street Journal 1988, provided by Michael Collins (Collins, 1997)).

Our statistical apl)roach, which does not require explicit negative examples, extends ai)l)roaehes that encode l~evin's alternations directly, as symbolic properties of a verb (Dorr et al., 1995; l)orr and Jones, 1996; l)orr, 1997).
