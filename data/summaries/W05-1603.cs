Hence the rule in Figure 1 now has a feature path on each right-hand side element instead of function calls, as in [Busemann, 1996].

[Busemann, 1998] has a more detailed description of this idea.

the Lisp-like rule format was desirable, the Java implementation XtraGen [Stenzhorn, 2002] required a different format anyway, as it is consistently using XML to encode all objects.

[Busemann and Horacek, 1998] refer to the former kind as shallow and to the latter as in-depth generation.

Moreover the costs are small since TG/2 reuses previously generated substrings during backtracking, as described in [Busemann, 1996].

The event-oriented input is created by a non-linguistic component, the scheduling agent system, and converted into a surface-semantic representation, referred to as GIL in [Busemann, 1996], which is verbalized by TG/2.

In TEMSIS, air quality reports reports are generated from a database containing measurement data [Busemann and Horacek, 1998].

Since its first implementation in 1995, the shallow NLG system TG/2 [Busemann, 1996] has been used as a component in several diverse applications involving NLG.

While this result was very encouraging, the grammar writers stated that larger grammars would be less easily developed and maintained.2 As [Busemann and Horacek, 1998] show, the input structures are non-linguistic, i.e., they do not uniquely determine the content-bearing linguistic elements and the sentential structure to be used.
W98-1425
[Busemann and Horacek, 1998] consider this lack of reuse a disadvantage, but state that it is nevertheless acceptable since new grammars can be developed very quickly.

For this purpose the approach to parameterization introduced in [Busemann, 1996] has been refined.

In an attempt to relate existing NLG systems to the RAGS framework [Mellish et al., 2000], TG/2 was among the systems to look at.

TG/2 is and What it isnâ€™t TG/2 has been described originally in [Busemann, 1996; Busemann and Horacek, 1998] as a template-based generator.
