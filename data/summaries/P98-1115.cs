For further discussion, and for the proof of the order independence see (Krotov, 1998).

We had hoped that some approach to a limit would be seen using PTB II (Marcus et al., 1994), which larger and more consistent for bracketting than PTB I.

Also, by partially lexicalising the rule extraction process (i.e., by using some more frequent words as well as the part-of-speech tags), we may be able to achieve parsing performance similar to the best results in the field obtained in (Collins, 1996).

See (Krotov, 1998) for the complete presentation of our methodology and results.

However, the number of trees produced with a general DOP method is so large that Bonnema (Bonnema et al., 1997) has to resort to restricting the tree depth, using a very domain-specific corpus such as ATIS or OVIS, and parsing very short sentences of average length 4.74 words.

Our approach can be generalised in terms of Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) methods (see (Bonnema et al., 1997)) with the tree depth of 1.

The Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994) has been used for a rather simple approach to deriving large grammars automatically: one where the grammar rules are simply 'read off' the parse trees in the corpus, with each local subtree providing the left and right hand sides of a rule.

SFor these experiments, we used two parsers: Stolcke's BOOGIE (Stolcke, 1995) and Sekine's Apple Pie Parser (Sekine and Grishman, 1995).
