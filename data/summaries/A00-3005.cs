• Charts have been used in grammar-based systems as a source of information; they can be resorted to if no complete analysis is found, so as to detect a syntactic error (Mellish 1989; Min-Wilson 1998).

Different techniques have been proposed for the treatment of the significant portion of errors (typographic, phonetic, cognitive and grammatical) that result m valid words (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983; Heidorn et al.1982). However, although most currently used word-processors actually provide a grammar checking module, little work has been done on the evaluation of results.

Although manual examination seems unavoidable we think that, with a corpus of errors big enough, machine learning techniques could be applied to the 28 problem of writing error patterns (Golding and Roth 1996; Mangu and Brill 1997).

• Error patterns (Kukich 1992; Golding and Schabes 1996; Mangu and Brill 1997), in the form of statistical information, hand-coded rules or automatically learned ones.
P96-1010
Regarding their treatment, different approaches have been proposed: • The relaxation of syntactic constraints (Douglas and Dale 1992).

After that, morphological disambiguation (Ezeiza et al.1998) is applied, reducing the high word-level ambiguity from 2.65 to 1.19 interpretations.
P98-1063
• Using either hand-coded rules or automatically learned ones, both methods have still the problem .of obtaining and marking big test corpora, a process that will have to be made mostly manually (except for some limited cases like word confusion (Golding and Roth 1996)).
