In fact, Samuelsson and Voutilainen (1997) show a hyperbolic relationship between the two errors (for the case of a 1988-style HMM-based parser).

As to corpus, Voutilainen and Tapanainen (1993) refer to their tagging scheme as having "been manually applied on some 20,000 words of running text from various genres as well as on some 2,000 test Entwisle and Powers 216 sentences from a large grammar (Quirk et al, 1993), as a first approximation of the inventory of syntactic structures in written English"...

In this paper, we will use the name "the ENGCG parser" as referring to a specific combination of these components in the manner that they are reported in Voutilainen (1995); in particular we are using the version which augments the underlying tagger with a finite-state parser, with heuristics switched on.

We ran these sentences in the more recent ENGCG-2 Tagger(Voutilainen 1995) and received parses that were improved, but the substantial point remained, although to a lesser extent: that tagger had not received the instruction to accept the verb to water as a fully equipped verb, and so a variation in sentence (3) to (4)Let him water the plants.

of Zipf's work Zipf's concept of 'least effort' may be relevant here (Zipf, 1947; Powers, 1998): Zipf argues that the simpler a construct is, the more often humans will want to use it or the more often they need it, the simpler they will make it.

Errorambiguity Voutilainen (1995) uses the term error for "error Type I" and ambiguity for any extra syntactic roles reported by his parser.

(Voutilainen, 1995) We are concerned about the misleading nature of such published statistics, although researchers working on NLP systems are of course well aware that the figures must be interpreted carefully.

Voutilainen (1995, pg) later used "a 38,202-word test corpus consisting of previously unseen journalistic, scientific and manual texts" to test the ENGCG implementation of this scheme.
