For French, no such information is stored now, but in other work (Byrd, et al.(1987)) we have demonstrated the feasibility of transferring some additional lexical information (for example, semantic features such as \[+human\]) from English UDICT via bilingual dictionaries.

The English version of this analyzer has been described in Byrd(1983) and Byrd, et al.(1986) and allows UDICT to recognize inflectionally and derivationally affixed words, compounds, and collocations.

Chodorow, et al.(1985) and Byrd, et al.(1987) discuss techniques for building dictionaries with the required scope by extracting lexical information from machinereadable versions of published dictionaries.

As described in Byrd(1986), UDICT provides a framework for supplying syntactic, semantic, phonological, and morphological information about the words it contains.

Its t'u-st version was built for English and has been used in several systems needing a variety of information about English words (Heidorn, et a1.(1982), Sowa(1984), McCord(1986), and Neff and Byrd(1987)).

French UDICT contains a data base of over 40,000 lemmata which are stored in a direct access file managed by the Dictionary Access Method (Byrd, et al.(1986)). Each entry in this file has one of the lemmata as its key and contains lexical information about that lemma.
