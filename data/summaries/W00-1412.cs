Furthermore, Reiter (1994), who reviews the â€¢ architecture of some models of natural language generation, shows that psycholinguistic and engineering approaches often result in systems, which are similar in crucial respects.

In this paper we ground on two of these common aspects, namely the distinction between what-to-say and how-tosay (De Smedt, Horacek & Zock, 1996) and the use of a pipeline architecture, which divides the generation process "into multiple modules, with information flowing in a 'pipeline' fashion from one module to the next" (Reiter, 1994).

These processes also constitute a pipeline in Reiter's (1994) sense, but they do work in parallel.

De Smedt & Kempen (1987), McKeown (1985), Hovy (1993), Chu-Carroll & Carberry (1998), Radev & McKeown (1998), the type of information to be verbalized also determines the processes of conceptualization on the level of microplanning, cf.
