Furthermore, recent work also provides discourse annotated corpora with rhetorical relations (Carlson, et al., 2003) and techniques for discourse paring for texts (Soricut and Marcu, 2003).

Figure 1: An example of context questions 2 Semantic-rich Discourse Modeling For processing single questions, an earlier study shows that an impressive improvement can be achieved when more knowledge-intensive NLP techniques are applied at both question and answer processing level (Harabagiu et al., 2000).

Therefore, it is important to capture the intention from the user (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

Recent corpus-based approaches to identify semantic roles (Roth et al 2002, Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Gildea and Palmer 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003) have been successful in identifying domain independent semantic relations with respect to the predicate-argument structure.

Since the informational perspective of discourse should capture the semantics of what has been conveyed, Topic and Focus are linked with the semantic information of a question, for example, semantic roles as described in (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).

Specifically, the following information can be either automatically identified or manually annotated: • Syntactic structures automatically identified from a parser (Collins, 1997); • Semantic roles of entities in the question (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002; Gildea and Palmer 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003); • Discourse roles either manually annotated or identified by rules that map directly from semantic roles to discourse roles.

Intentional transitions are closely related to Grosz and Sidner’s “dominance” and “satisfaction precedence” relations, which are more relevant to plan-based discourse (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

The discourse roles are higher-level abstracts of the semantic roles as those provided in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and Propbank (Kingsbury and Palmer 2002).
