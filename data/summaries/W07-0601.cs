DOP maximizes what has been called the ?structural analogy??between a sentence and a corpus of previous sentence-structures (Bod 2006b).
P06-1109
This semantic DOP model was worked out in Bonnema et al.(1997) where the meaning of a sentence was represented by its logical form.
P97-1021
While U-DOP was originally proposed as an engineering approach to language learning (Bod 2005, 2006a), it turns out that the model has a number of properties that may also be of linguistic and cognitive interest.
P06-1109
In Bod (2005, 2006a), DOP was extended to unsupervised parsing in a rather straightforward way.

Let?s start with the typical examples, which are similar to those used in Crain (1991), MacWhinney (2005), Clark and Eyraud (2006) and many others: (8) The man is hungry If we turn sentence (8) into a (polar) interrogative, the auxiliary is is fronted, resulting in sentence (9).

The major difference between our model and other computational learning models (such as Klein and Manning 2005 or Clark and Eyraud 2006) is that we start with trees.
W06-2917
Our approach is more congenial to Clark and Eyraud (2006) who show that by distributional analysis in the vein of Harris (1954) auxiliary fronting can be correctly predicted.

Bod 2006a, 2007), we will stick to the computation of the MPSD for the current paper.
P06-1109
This paper investigates a number of linguistic and cognitive aspects of the unsupervised data-oriented parsing framework, known as U-DOP (Bod 2005, 2006a, 2007).
