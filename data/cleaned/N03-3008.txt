Investigations on Event Evolution in TDT Juha Makkonen Department of Computer Science, P.O.
Box 26, 00014 University of Helsinki Finland jamakkon@cs.helsinki.fi Abstract Topic detection and tracking approaches monitor broadcast news in order to spot new, previously unreported events and to track the development of the previously spotted ones.
The dynamical nature of the events makes the use of state-of-the-art methods difficult.
We present a new topic definition that has potential to model evolving events.
We also discuss incorporating ontologies into the similarity measures of the topics, and illustrate a dynamic hierarchy that decreases the exhaustive computation performed in the TDT process.
This is mainly work-in-progress.
1 Introduction
A fairly novel area of retrieval called topic detection and tracking (TDT) attempts to design methods to automatically (1) spot new, previously unreported events, and (2) follow the progress of the previously spotted events (Allan et al., 1998c; Yang et al., 1998).
Our contribution deals with three problems in TDT.
Firstly, we present a new definition for a topic that would model the event evolution, i.e., the changing nature of a topic.
The previous event definitions do not really lend themselves to this change.
Secondly, we investigate an approach suggested by Makkonen, Ahonen-Myka and Salmenkivi (2002).
They partitioned the termspace into four semantic classes and represented each class with a designated vector.
Unlike the term-weighting model of Yang et al.(2002) this approach enables the use of introduction of different similarity measures for each semantic class.
We formalize the comparison method and suggest a a0 NN approach based on this formalization.
Thirdly, we suggest the use of dynamic hierarchies in a TDT system that would decrease the exhaustive computation of the first story detection.
In practice this means that we import text categorization on top of TDT.
The purpose of this paper is to outline the main aspects of our ongoing and future work.
As this is mainly work-in-progress, we do not have empirical motivation for our work.
This paper is organized as follows: We will discuss the problems of TDT in Section 2 In Section 3 we examine the definitions of an event and a topic.
Section 4 presents a novel event representation and an approach to measure the similarity of such elements.
In Section 5 we deal with dynamic hierarchies.
In Section 6 we discuss our conclusions.
2 Problems
in TDT The events are taking place in the world, and some of them are reported in the news.
A TDT system does not perceive the events themselves, rather makes an effort in deducing them from the continuous news-stream – which is in a sense like the shadows on the wall in Plato’s cave analogy.
Given this setting, what is it that we are trying to model?
Typically, the text categorization is conducted using some machine learning system (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999).
Such system is taught to recognize the difference between two or more predefined classes or categories by providing a good number of pre-labeled samples to learn from.
As to classes and word frequencies, this training material is assumed to lend itself to the same underlying distribution as the material that is to be categorized.
More formally, the documents a1a3a2a5a4a7a6a9a8a11a10a12a6a14a13a11a10a7a15a16a15a16a15a7a10a12a6a18a17a19a20a17a22a21 and their labels a23 a2a5a4a25a24 a8 a10a26a24 a13 a10a7a15a16a15a16a15a16a10a27a24a11a17a28a29a17a30a21 yield to a unknown distribution.
This distribution is expressed as a function a31a32 that assigns to each document-label pair a4a34a33a35a6a37a36a27a10a27a24a26a38a40a39a42a41a43a1a45a44 a23a47a46a20a48a50a49a52a51a53a49a54a46 a1 a46 a10 a48a55a49a57a56a47a49a54a46a23a47a46 a21 a boolean value indicating their relevance, i.e., a31a32a52a58 a1a59a44 a23a61a60 a4a63a62 a48 a10 a48 a21a34a15 The task of classification is to come up with a hypothesis a32a64a58 a1a65a44 a23a54a60 a4a63a62 a48 a10 a48 a21 that represents Edmonton, May-June 2003 Student Research Workshop, pp.
43-48 Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003 a31 a32, practically, with the ’highest’ accuracy.
This accuracy is evaluated with a pre-labeled testing material.
Now, with TDT the problem is different.
Let us assume that the documents and events yield to an unknown distribution represented by the function a31 a66 a58 a1a67a44a69a68 a60 a4a63a62 a48 a10 a48 a21 that assigns each document a6a70a36a71a41a43a1 a boolean value indicating whether it discussed event a72a7a38a50a41a43a68 or not.
The problem is that domain of a68a54a2a5a4a40a72a73a8a74a10a27a72a25a13a11a10a7a15a16a15a16a15a16a10a27a72a75a17a76a53a17a77a21 is timedependent.
The hypothesis a66 a58 a1a61a44a43a68 a60 a4a63a62 a48 a10 a48 a21 built from the training data does not work with evaluation data, because these two data sets do not discuss the same events.
Moreover, the events are very small in size compared to categories and their identity, that is, the most important terms evolve over time.
We can, however, model similarity between two documents.
By examining the pair-wise comparisons in the training set, we can formulate a hypothesis a0a78a58 a1a79a44a80a1 a60 a4a34a62 a48 a10 a48 a21 that assigns the pair a33a81a6 a36 a10a12a6 a38 a39a42a41a64a1a45a44a43a1 a boolean value 1 if the documents discuss the same event, -1 otherwise.
Any two documents of same event are (ideally) similar in a similar way.
This somewhat trivial observation has some implications worth mentioning.
Firstly, by definition news documents report changes, something new with respect to what is already known.
This would lead to think that the identity of an event eludes all static representations and that the representation for a topic would have to adapt automatically to the various changes in the reporting of the event.
Secondly, so far the parameters and thresholds of the state-of-the-art methods in IR have tried to capture this similarity of similarity, but there does not seem be a representation expressive enough (Allan et al., 2000).
Thirdly, the detection and tracking is based on pairwise comparisons which requires exhaustive computation.
Yang et al.(2002) suggested topic-categories that could be used to limit the search space of the first-story detection.
However, building topic-categories automatically is difficult.
In the following we outline some suggestions to these problems: event modeling, event representation and decreasing the computational cost.
3 Events
and Topics Although the concept of event might seem intuitively clear and self-explanatory, formulating a sound definition appears to be difficult.
Predating TDT research, numerous historians and researchers of political science have wrestled with the definitions (Falk, 1989; Gerner et al., 1994).
What seems to be somewhat agreed upon is that an event is some sort of activity conducted by some agent and taking place somewhere at some time.
Definition 1 An event is something that happens at some specific time and place (Yang et al., 1999).
This initial definition was adopted to TDT project and it is intuitively quite sound.
Practically all of the events of the TDT test set yield to the temporal proximity (“burstiness”) and the compactness.
However, there is also a number of problematic cases which this definition seems to neglect: events which either have a long-lasting nature (Intifada, Kosovo–Macedonia, struggle in Columbia), escalate to several large-scale threads or campaigns (September 11), or are not tightly spatiotemporally constrained (BSE-epidemics).
The events in the world are not as autonomous as this definition assumes.
They are often interrelated and do not necessarily decay within weeks or a few months.
Some of these problematic events would classify as activities (Papka, 1999), but when encountering a piece of news, we do not know a priori whether it is a short term event or long term activity, a start for a complex chain of events or just a simple incident.
Definition 2 An event is a specific thing that happens at a specific time and place along with all necessary preconditions and unavoidable consequences (Cieri et al., 2002).
This is basically a variant of Definition 1 that in some sense tries to address the autonomy assumption.
Yet, it opens a number of questions as to what are the necessary preconditions for certain event, an oil crisis, for example.
What are the necessary preconditions and unavoidable consequences of Secretary Powell’s visit to Middle East or of suicide-bombing in Ramallah?
Definition 3 A topic is an event or an activity, along with all related events and activities (Cieri et al., 2002).
Here, Cieri et al.explicate the connection between a topic and an event: they are more or less synonyms.
Rules of interpretation that have been issued to help to draw the line and to attain consistency.
In TDT, there are eleven topic types that tell what kind of other topic types are relevant.
The topic type of the topic is determined by the seminal event.
Since TDT2 and TDT3 corpora are produced along this guideline, this is in a sense the de facto definition.
Definition 4 A topic is a series of events, a narrative that evolves and may fork into several distinct topics.
Definition 4 makes an attempt at addressing the changing or evolving nature of a topic.
A seminal event can lead to several things at the same time and the connection between the various outcomes and the initial cause become less and less obvious as the events progress.
As a practical consequence, the event evolution (Yang et al., 1999; Papka, 1999) causes changes in the vocabulary, especially in the crucial, identifying terms.
The news documents are temporally linearly ordered, and the news stories can be said to form series of different lengths.
Identifying these chains as topics is motivated by Falk’s investigations on historical events (Falk, 1989).
A narrative begins as soon as the first story is encountered.
Then the narrative is developed into one or more directions: simple events, like plane accidents might not have as many sub-plots as a political scandal, a war or economical crises.
Then, at some point one could say the latest story is so different from the initial one that it is considered a first story for a new event.
However, there could remain some sort of link that these two topics (narratives) are somehow relevant.
Hence, this kind of a narrative has a beginning, a middle and an end.
An event evolution is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: An example of event evolution.
Initially, in phase a48 we have only one document, a first story a82, an it constitutes an event that is depicted by the dashed line.
Then in phase a83, document a84 is found relevant to this event.
Since it is found similar to a82, there is link in between them.
In phase a85 there are two more relevant documents: a23 and a86. The former is more found similar to a84 than to a82, and thus it continues the off-spring started by a84 . On the contrary, a86 appears closer to a82 and thus it starts a new direction.
Phase a87 shows two stories, a88a90a89 a48 and a91a3a89 a48 outside the dashed ellipse.
This represents a situation, where the vocabulary of the two expulsed documents is diverging from the rest of the documents, i.e., the inner cohesion of the topic is violated too much.
The dotted ellipse represents the domain of possible topical shifts, i.e., stories that lead too far from the original topic.
They are still regarded as part of the topic, but are on the brink of diverging from the topic and hence candidates for new first stories or seminal events.
Finally, in phase a92 the separation takes place: Three new documents, a88a67a89a93a83, a88a67a89a52a85 and a88a67a89a80a87, are found similar to a88a94a89 a48 . As a result, document a88a94a89 a48 is separated into its own topic.
Note that there is no follow-ups for a91a95a89 a48, and therefore it is not cut off.
The problem of text summarization is similar to detecting topical shifts: traces of all the main topics occurring in the given text need to be retained in the summarization.
On the other hand, text segmentation shares some qualities with the topic shift detection.
Lexical cohesion (Boguraev and Neff, 2000) has been employed in the task as well as in text segmentation (Stokes et al., 2002).
A model of Definition 4 has many open issues.
For example, what is the topic representation and what kind of impact will there be on the evaluation?
We will try to address the former question in the following.
4 Multi-vector Event Model It has been difficult to detect two distinct train accidents or bombings as different events (Allan et al., 1998a).
The terms occurring in the two documents are so similar that the term-space or the weighting-scheme in use fails to represent the required very delicate distinction.
Furthermore, Allan, Lavrenko and Papka suspect that only a small number of terms is adequate to make the distinction between different news events (Allan et al., 1998b).
Intuitively, when reporting two different train accidents, it would seem that the location and the time, possibly some names of people, are the terms that make up the difference.
Papka observes that when increasing the weights of noun phrases and dates the classification accuracy improves and when decreasing them, the accuracy declines (Papka, 1999).
4.1 Event
Vector A news document reporting an event states at the very barest what happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who was involved.
The automatic extraction of these facts for natural language understanding is quite troublesome and time-consuming, and could still perform poorly.
Previous detection and tracking approaches have tried to encapsulate these facts in a single vector.
In order to attain the delicate distinctions mentioned above, to avoid the problems with the term-space maintenance and still maintain robustness, we assign each of the questions a semantic class, i.e., i.e. groups of semantically related words, similarly to approach suggest by Makkonen et al.(2002). The semantic class of LOCATIONS contains all the places mentioned in the document, and thus gives an idea, where the event took place.
Similarly, TEMPORALS, i.e., the temporal expressions name an object, that is, a point or an interval of time, and bind the document onto the time-axis.
NAMES are proper noun phrases that represent the people or organizations involved in the news story.
What happened is represented by ’normal’ words which we call TERMS.
This approach has an impact on the document and the event representations.
Instead of having just one vector, we issue four sub-vectors – one for each semantic class as illustrated in Figure 2.
prime ministerpalestinian Ramallah Yasser Arafat Wednesday Mahmoud Abbas West Back appoint Event vector TERMS NAMES LOCATIONS TEMPORALS Figure 2: “RAMALLAH, West Bank Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat appointed his longtime deputy Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister Wednesday, . . . ” (AP: Wednesday, March 19, 2003) 4.2 Similarity of Hands One could claim that the meaning of a word is in the word’s relation to other words without getting too deep into philosophical discussions as to what and how the meaning is.
This meaning, that is, relation, can be represented in an ontology, where similar terms relate to each other in different manner than dissimilar ones.
The similarity of event vectors is determined classwise: Each semantic class has its own similarity measure, and the over-all similarity could be the weighted sum of these measures, for example.
The interesting thing is that now we can introduce semantics into the vector-based similarity by mapping the terms of a semantic class onto a formal space.
Each pair of terms in this space has a similarity, i.e., a distance.
Two TEMPORAL terms relate to each other on the time-axis, and the similarity of two LOCATION terms can be based on a geographical proximity represented in an ontology.
For example, the utterances next week and the last week of March 2003 do not coincide on the surface, but when evaluated with respect to the utterance time, the expressions refer to the same temporal interval.
Similarly, London and Thames can be found relevant based on an spatial ontology.
Similarity in these ontologies could be a distance on the time-axis or a distance in a tree, as we have previously noted (Makkonen et al., 2003).
Now, let us present the above discussion more formally.
Each term in the document is a member of exactly one semantic class.
Hence, the documents are composed of the union of semantic classes, or equivalently, the document is a structure of a language specified by the unary relations that represent the semantic classes.
Definition 5 Let a96 be a universe and let a97 be a language consisting of a98 unary relations a97a93a2a5a4a74a99 a8 a10a26a99 a13 a10a16a15a7a15a16a15a7a10a26a99a9a100 a46 a99 a36a71a101 a96a78a21 . A model is a97 structure a102a103a2a54a104a105a96a57a10a106a97a108a107 . Now, consider a96 as the set of natural language terms and a97 as the set of semantic classes.
A document representation would be a a97 -structure consisting of terms a4a40a109a5a41a43a96 a46 a109a5a41 a100 a110 a36a22a111a18a8 a99a9a36a12a21a63a10 i.e., a document is simply a union of the semantic classes.
The class-wise similarity of two such structures would be as follows: Definition 6 Let a112a16a36 be a function a112a7a36 a58 a96a113a44a43a96 a60a61a114a115 that indicates the similarity of two elements in a99a116a36 The similarity of two a97 -structures is a function a117 a51 a98 a58 a96a118a44a43a96 a60a61a114a115 a100 such that a117 a51 a98a119a104a120a102a47a10a12a121a122a107a123a2a124a112 a36 a104a105a99a71a125 a36 a10a106a99a71a126 a36 a107 a100 a36a127a111a128a8 a2a130a129 a36 a15 (1) This type of similarity we call the similarity of hands 1.
Hence, the similarity of two documents, a102 and a121, would be a vector a104a35a129 a8 a10a12a129 a13 a10a16a15a7a15a16a15a131a10a27a129a11a100a50a107a42a41 a114a115 a100 . There are many ways to go about turning the vector into a single score (Makkonen et al., 2002).
One way is to define the similarity as a weighted sum of each value of a112a25a36, i.e., a117 a51 a98a57a104a35a102a132a10a12a121a122a107a123a2 a100 a133 a36a127a111a128a8a128a134 a36 a112 a36 a104a105a99a71a125 a36 a10a106a99a71a126a36 a107a135a10 (2) where a134 a36a71a41 a114a115 is the relative weight of class a99a136a36 . The similarities a112a16a36a26a104a120a99 a125 a36 a10a26a99 a126 a36 a107 have also been interpreted as van Rijsbergen’s (van Rijsbergen, 1980) similarity coefficients.
Unlike detective stories, news documents give away the plot in the first few sentences.
Therefore, the similarity measure could exploit the ranking, the ordinal of the sentence in which the term appears, in weighting the class-wise similarity.The rank-score of a term a137 occurring a98 times is a138 a117 a104a81a137a12a107a53a2 a100 a133 a139 a111a128a8 a48 a140a22a141a63a142 a104a35a137 a139 a107 a10 (3) where a137 a139 is the ranking of the a0 th instance of term a137 . Hence the similarity a112 a36 would yield a112a74a143a26a144a135a145 a139a131a146 a36 a104a120a99a123a125 a36 a10a26a99a123a126 a36 a107a29a2 a145 a133 a139 a111a128a8 a138 a117 a104a81a137 a139 a107a131a10 (4) where term a137 a139 occurs a147 times in intersection a99 a125 a36a80a148 a99 a126 a36 . Currently we are experimenting with similarity of hands technique as a relevance score (Yang et al., 2000) for ranking the a0 nearest neighbours for each semantic 1Consider a simple game where one would have to determine the similarity of two hands of cards of arbitrary size (up to 52) drawn from two distinct decks and assume that there is a designated similarity measure for each suit.
For example, with hearts low cards could be of more value.
Furthermore, the suits could be weighted, i.e., clubs could be trump and unchallenged clubs would lead to dissimilarity.
class. In other words, we find the a0 nearest events with respect to TEMPORAL, a0 nearest events with respect to NAMES, etc.
In a sense, each semantic class votes for a0 candidates based on the relevance score and the respective weight of the semantic class.
Once we have the four sets of candidates, we elect the one with highest number of votes.
Hence, let a149a103a2a54a4a40a86 a8 a10a27a86 a13 a10a16a15a16a15a7a15a16a10a26a86a151a150a152a21 be the set of previous a97 -structures (i.e., events).
The function a129a75a153a25a137a154a72 a117 a58 a96a113a44 a114 a88a45a44a155a96 a150 a60 a96 a139 a100 returns a98 vectors of a97 structures of length a0 consisting of structures closest to a102 with respect to relation a99 a36 . In other words, a129a75a153a25a137a154a72 a117 a104a120a102a47a10 a0 a10a154a149a156a107a118a2 a104a35a112 a36 a104a120a102a47a10a27a86 a139 a107 a100 a36a22a111a18a8 a107 a150 a139 a111a128a8 a2 a104a12a104a35a1 a8 a107 a139 a8 a10a7a104a81a1 a13 a107 a139 a8 a10a7a15a16a15a7a15a131a10a7a104a35a1a69a100a55a107 a139 a8 a107a135a10 where a104a35a1 a36 a107 a139 a8 is a length-a0 vector of a97 -structures closest to a102 with respect to relation a99 a36 . The election is a function a72a25a157a35a72a25a24a135a137 a58 a96 a139 a100 a60 a96 such that a72a25a157a35a72a25a24a135a137a131a104a27a104a81a1a158a8a135a107 a139 a8 a10a7a104a35a1a69a13a25a107 a139 a8 a10a16a15a16a15a7a15a131a10a7a104a35a1 a100 a107 a139 a8 a107a53a2 a139 a159 a160 a111a128a8 a100 a159 a36a127a111a128a8 a104a35a1a47a36a105a107a81a161a116a15 Quite obviously, the intersection is too strong a function in this case.
Some vector a104a81a1 a36 a107 a139 a8 might be empty which would make the intersection empty as well.
However, we believe that it would be easier to find optimal weights for the semantic classes via this voting scheme than trying to optimize Equation 2, because there are less parameters.
5 Dynamic
Hierarchies One of the problems that plagues many TDT efforts is the need to compare each incoming document with all the preceding documents.
Even if we issue a time-window and have a straight-forward similarity measure, the number of required comparisons increases drastically as new documents come in.
There have been efforts to decrease the amount of work by centroid vectors (Yang et al., 2000), and by building an ad hoc classifier for each topiccategory (Yang et al., 2002), for example.
We suggest the we adopt text categorization on top of topic detection and tracking, similar to Figure 3.
There has been good results in text categorization (see, e.g., (Yang and Liu, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002)) The predefined categories would form the static hierarchy – the IPTC Subject Reference System 2, for example – on top of all event-based information organization, and the models for the categories could be built on the basis of the test set.
Below the static hierarchy there would be a dynamic hierarchy that evolves as new documents come in and 2International Press Telecommunications Council, http://www.iptc.org new topics are detected.
There is also a time-window to limit the temporal scope.
Once a topic expires, it is removed from the dynamic hierarchy and archived to a news repository of lower operational priority.
The use of static hierarchy has some of the benefits the topic-categories of Yang et al.(2002) had.
It decreases the search space and enables a category-specific weighting-scheme for terms.
For example, when a document is categorized to the class ’science’, there is no need to compare it against the events of any other class; ideally, all the relevant events have also been categorized to the same class.
6 Conclusion
We have discussed three problems relating to TDT and mainly its event evolution.
The novel topic definition allows the topic to evolve into several directions and ultimately to distinguish new topics.
A semantic classbased event vector enables harnessing of domain specific ontologies, such as the time-axis and the geographic distances.
Finally, we presented a TDT system with dynamic hierarchies that would cut down the excessive computation required in the TDT process.
Our previous results were done with a Finnish online news corpus smaller than the TDT corpora (Makkonen et al., 2002).
The use of semantic classes proved to be beneficial.
We have also built a temporal expression scheme and a geographical ontology for TDT purposes (Makkonen et al., 2003).
In this paper, all our discussions were preliminary and should be regarded as such.
In the future we will work to motivate these mostly intuitive theories with empirical results.
