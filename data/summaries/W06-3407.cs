This decision is analogous to Hearst’s (Hearst, 1994, 1997) decision to shift the TextTiling induced boundaries to their nearest reference paragraph boundary.

The first corpus, which we call the Olney & Cai corpus, is a set of dialogues selected randomly from the same corpus Olney and Cai obtained their corpus from (Olney and Cai, 2005).

With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of “topic” that builds upon Passonneau and Litman’s seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993).

The Foltz and Ortho approaches require a trained LSA space, which we prepared the same way as described in (Olney and Cai, 2005).
H05-1122
Two LSA-based algorithms for segmentation are described in (Foltz, 1998) and (Olney and Cai, 2005).
H05-1122
Content-oriented models, such as (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), rely on the re-occurrence of patterns of topics over multiple realizations of thematically similar discourses, such as a series of newspaper articles about similar events.

As opposed to the other baseline algorithms, (Olney and Cai, 2005) applied their orthonormal basis approach specifically to dialogue, and prior to this work, report the highest numbers for topic segmentation of dialogue.

and Lee with Exchanges Barzilay and Lee (2004) offer an attractive frame work for constructing a context-specific Hidden Markov Model (HMM) of topic drift.
N04-1015
Using the definition of topic segment from (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) applied to two different dialogue corpora, we present an evaluation including a detailed error analysis, illustrating why approaches designed for expository text do not generalize well to dialogue.
P93-1020
Following (Olney and Cai, 2005), we built our LSA space using dialogue contributions as the atomic text unit.
H05-1122
The best known algorithm based on this idea is TextTiling (Hearst, 1997).
J97-1003
In addition to possibly narrowing the space of tentative topic-boundaries, exchanges are helpful in that they provide more coarse-grain building blocks for segmentation algorithms that rely on term-distribution as a proxy for dialogue coherence, such as TextTiling (Hearst, 1994, 1997), the Foltz algorithm (Foltz, 1998), Orthonormal Basis (Olney and Cai, 2005), and Barzilay and Lee’s content modeling approach (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).
