Finite mixture models have been employed in a number of text processing applications, such as text classification (e.g., (Li and Yamauishi, 1997; Nigam et al., 2000)) and information retrieval (e.g., (Hofmann, 1999)).

In topic SNote that the quantity within \[---\] in (1) is (empirical) mutual inyormation, which is an effective measure for word co-occurrence calculation (cf.,(Brown et al., 1992)).

A segmentation method (e.g., TextTiling (Hearst, 1997)) generally segments a text into blocks (paragraphs) in accord with topic changes within the text, but it does not identify (or label) by itself the topics discussed in each of the blocks.

Figure 7 shows a graph of calculated similaxity values for each of the candidates in the 5We use similarity rather than distance here in order to simplify comparison between our method and TextTiling (Hearst, 1997).

Finite mixture models have been used in a variety of applications in text processing (e.g., (Li and Yamanishi, 1997; Nigam et al., 2000; Hofmann, 1999)), indicating that they are essential to text processing.

One is to divide a text into blocks (e.g., TextTiling (Hearst, 1997)), the other to divide a stream of texts into its original texts (e.g.,(Allan et al., 1998; Yamron et al., 1998; Beeferman et al., 1999; tteynar, 1999)).

For example, Li and Yamanishi propose to employ in text classification a mixture model (Li and Yamanishi, 1997) defined over categories: P(WIC) = ~ P(klc)P(wlk),w e W,c e C, kEK where W denotes a set of words, and C a set of categories.
