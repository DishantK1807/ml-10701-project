<context> field of computational stylometry addresses these aspects of style. We approach stylometry as an automatic text categorization task that labels documents according to a set of predefined categories (Sebastiani, 2002). Like most text categorization systems, it takes a two-stage approach which (i) achieves automatic selection of features that have high predictive value for the categories to be learned, and (ii) us</context>
