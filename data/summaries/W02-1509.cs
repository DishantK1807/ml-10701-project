However in such a tree it would be impossible to adjoin the tree for the intervening ADVP “quickly” as a VP modifier and still have it between the verb and the NP.9 LexTract then would instead extract an 9A striking use of sister adjunction in (Chiang, 2000) is exactly the elegant way it solves this problem: the non-argument tree can be adjoined onto a node (say, VP), positioning itself in between the VP’s children, which is not possible with TAGs.

With the availability of large natural language corpora annotated for syntactic structure, the treebanks, e.g., (Marcus et al., 1993), automatic grammar extraction became possible (Chen and VijayShanker, 2000; Xia, 1999).

The derivation tree, to the right, contains the history of the tree grafting process that generated the derived tree, to the left.3 1We assume some familiarity with the basic notations in the PTB as in (Marcus et al., 1994).

In this paper we report on a particular experience of automatic extraction of an English grammar from the WSJ corpus of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994)1 using Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAGs, (Joshi and Schabes, 1997)).
