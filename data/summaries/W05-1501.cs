17 . 16 As sketched before, this could be easily done by defining a rule that uses a stochastic model to compute a weight for each f-structure (see e.g., (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002)) and retains only those with the heaviest weights (Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004).

9 Hence, some non-terminals of the CF backbone that correspond 9 Such an approach is indeed more satisfying than a blind skimming that stops the full processing of the sentence whenever the amount of time or memory spent on a sentence exceeds a user-specified limit, replacing it by a partial processing that performs a bounded amount of work on each remaining nonterminal (Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004).

However, the most famous LFG system is undoubtedly the Xerox Linguistics Environment (XLE) project which is the successor of the Grammars Writerâ€™s Workbench (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1994; Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004).

In a way, it is a generalization of the use of a FRAGMENT grammar as described in (Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004).
