Brill (Brill, 1995) outlines a transformation-based learner which learns guessing rules from a pre-tagged training corpus.

In (Zhang&Kim, 1990) a system for the automated learning of morphological word-formation rules is described.

A statistical-based suffix learner is presented in (Schmid, 1994).
C94-1027
In (Brill, 1995) a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described.
J95-4004
A similar approach was taken in (Weischedel et al., 1993) where an unknown word was guessed given the probabilities for an unknown word to be of a particular POS, its capitalisation feature and its ending.

The other tagger was the rule-based tagger of Brill (Brill, 1995).

A rule-based tagger described in (Voutilainen, 1995) is equipped with a set of guessing rules which has been hand-crafted using knowledge of English morphology and intuition.
