ac. uk Abstract Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993) show that Linear Indexed Grammars (I_IG) can be processed in polynomial time by exploiting constraints which make possible the extensive use of structure-sharing.

The key to this algorithm is the use of structure sharing techniques similar to those used to process I_lG efficiently (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993).

Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993) showed that the behaviour of the naive algorithm can be improved upon.

However, Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993) demonstrate that polynomial time performance 75 can be achieved through the use of structuresharing made possible by constraints in the way that LI6 use stacks.

One approach to this problem is to refine parsing algorithms by developing techniques such as restrictions, structure-sharing, and lazy unification that reduce the amount of structure that is stored and hence the need for copying of features structures (Shieber, 1985; Pereira, 1985; Karttunen and Kay, 1985; Wroblewski, 1987; Gerdemann, 1989; Godden, 1990; Kogure, 1990; Emele, 1991; Tomabechi, 1991; Harrison and Ellison, 1992)).

The constraints that we identify for the tree-based system can be regarded equally well as constraints on unification-based grammar formalisms such as PArR (Shieber, 1984).
