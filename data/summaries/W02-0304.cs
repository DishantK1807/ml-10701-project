We then designed two methods that can learn accenting rules for the remaining unknown words: B4CXB5 adapting a POS-tagging method (Brill, 1995) (section 3.3); B4CXCXB5 adapting a method designed for learning morphological rules (Theron and Cloete, 1997) (section 3.4). 3 Accenting unknown words 3.1 Filtering out know words The French MeSH was briefly presented in the introduction; we work with the 2001 version.

as contextual tagging This first method is based on the use of a part-ofspeech tagger: Brill’s (1995) tagger.
