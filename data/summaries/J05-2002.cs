It is clear that such an FA is unambiguous (even deterministic) and that our technique therefore properly subsumes the technique by Stolcke and Segal (1994), although the way that the two techniques are formulated is rather different.
P94-1011
The special case of n-grams has already been formulated by Stolcke and Segal (1994), realizing an idea previously envisioned by Rimon and Herz (1991).
E91-1027 P94-1011
As shown by Mohri (1997), PFAs cannot always be determinized, and no practical algorithms are known to minimize arbitrary nondeterministic (P)FAs.
J97-2003
The construction can be generalized to, for example, tree-adjoining grammars (Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993) and range concatenation grammars (Boullier 2000; Bertsch and Nederhof 2001).
E93-1045
Nederhof (2000), several methods of approximation were discussed that lead to determinized approximating FAs that can be much larger than the input CFGs.
J00-1003
One is an extension with probabilities of existing work on approximation of CFGs by means of FAs (Nederhof 2000).
