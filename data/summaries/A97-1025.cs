Yarowsky (1994) notes that conceptual spelling correction is part of a closely related class of problems which include word sense disambiguation, word choice selection in machine translation, and accent and capitalization restoration.

Recently, Golding and Schabes (1996) described a system, Tribayes, that combines a trigram model of the words' parts of speech with a Bayesian classifier.
P96-1010
A number of feature-based methods have been tried, including Bayesian classifiers (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992; Golding, 1995), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and knowledge-based approaches (McRoy, 1992).

The baseline predictor presented in this paper and in (Golding and Schabes, 1996) are based on the same method so the correspond170 ing columns in Table 2 can be compared to get an idea of the distribution of sentences that contain the most frequent word for each confusion set.
P96-1010
The results described in this section are based on the 18 confusion sets selected by Golding (1995; 1996).
P96-1010 W95-0104
Consequently, our sentence counts for the various confusion sets differ slightly from the counts reported in (Golding and Schabes, 1996).
P96-1010
The results of Tribayes (Golding and Schabes, 1996) are also given.
P96-1010
Golding and Schabes (1996) have already shown that using a trigram model to predict words from a confusion set based on the expected part of speech is very effective.
P96-1010
Table 2 also gives the results obtained by Tribayes as reported in (Golding and Schabes, 1996).
