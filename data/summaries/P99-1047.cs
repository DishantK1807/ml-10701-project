Marcu et al.(1999) discuss in detail the annotation tool and protocol and assess the inter-judge agreement and the reliability of the annotation.

Because of the lack of discourse corpora, these parsers did not evaluate the correctness of the discourse trees they built per se, but rather their adequacy for specific purposes: experiments carded out by Miike et al.(1994) and Marcu (1999) showed only that the discourse structures built by rhetorical parsers (Sumita et al., 1992; Marcu, 1997) can be used successfully in order to improve retrieval performance and summarize text.

The POS tags are determined automatically, using the Brill tagger (1995).

Since discourse markers, such as because and and, have been shown to play a major role in rhetorical parsing (Marcu, 1997), we also consider a list of features that specify whether a lexeme found within the local contextual window is a potential discourse marker.

All previous parsers aimed at determining the rhetorical structure of unrestricted texts (Sumita et al., 1992; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Marcu, 1997; Corston-Oliver, 1998)employed manually written rules.

This similarity is computed by applying in the style of Hearst (1997) a cosine-based metric on the morphed segments.

I Introduction The application of decision-based learning techniques over rich sets of linguistic features has improved significantly the coverage and performance of syntactic (and to various degrees semantic) parsers (Simmons and Yu, 1992; Magerman, 1995; Hermjakob and Mooney, 1997).

The performance with respect to identifying sentence boundaries appears to be close to that of systems aimed at identifying only sentence boundaries (Palmer and Hearst, 1997), whose accuracy is in the range of 99%.

The matrix shows that the segmenter has problems mostly with identifying the beginning of parenthetical units and the intra-sentential edu boundaries; for example, it correctly identifies only 133 of the 220 ZLeaming from binary representations of features in the Brown corpus was too computationally expensive to terminate -the Brown data file had about 0.5GBytes. 5 The shift-reduce action identifier, 5.1 Generation of learning examples The learning cases were generated automatically, in the style of Magerman (1995), by traversing inorder the final rhetorical structures built by annotators and by generating a sequence of discourse parse actions that used only SHIFT and REDUCE operations of the kinds discussed in section 3.

These features specify whether a discourse marker that introduces expectations (Cristea and Webber, 1997) (such as although) was used in the sentence under consideration, whether there are any commas or dashes before the estimated end of the sentence, and whether there are any verbs in the unit under consideration.
