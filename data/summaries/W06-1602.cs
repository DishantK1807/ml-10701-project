We used Clark & Curran’s widecoverage statistical parser (Clark and Curran, 2004) trained on CCG-bank, which in turn is derived from the Penn-Treebank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).

Moreover, this work provides a concrete way of evaluating the output of a stochastic widecoverage parser trained on the CCGBank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).

1993)). We follow (Bos et al., 2004; Bos, 2005) in automatically building semantic representation on the basis of CCG derivations in a compositional fashion.

To assess this classification task we also used the kappa statistics which yielded KCo=0.922 (following (Eugenio and Glass, 2004) we report K as KCo, indicating that we calculate K `a la Cohen (Cohen, 1960).

Note that here f-score is symmetric, sinceprecision(A,B)=recall(B,A),and(balanced) f-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Hachey et al., 2005, see also Section 5).
