The GEN function is quite specific since it has also some stylistic motivations, it is described in depth in (Benamara 2004).

We manually integrated these ontologies in WEBCOOP (Benamara et al.2004a) and added ourselves most properties by hand.

Several intensional operations are also developed to make the response more compact, involving lexicalisations based on GEN (Benamara 2004).

Cooperative know-how involves several forms of responses that include relaxations, intensional calculus, expression of restrictions, of warnings and conditional responses (Benamara et al.2004). This simple example shows that, if a direct response cannot be found, several forms of knowledge and reasoning schemas need to be used and that the NL form of the response requires adequate and subtle lexicalisations, often directed by the reasoning schemas.

WEBCOOP project and its environment This research is part of the WEBCOOP system (Benamara et al.2004), that makes a heavy use of a rich domain ontology, which is a concept ontology structured by means of several semantic relations (Cruse 1986).

The implementation relies on the conceptual metrics, also used for concept relaxation (Benamara et al 2004a) and also on manually marked really complex concepts in the ontology.

Finally, in (Benamara et al.2004), we define a conceptual metrics that determines the distance between two concepts, evaluated in terms of distance in the hierarchy between the two concepts and property differences (nature of properties and values associated).
