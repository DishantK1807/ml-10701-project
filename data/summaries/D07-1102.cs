A system using the parsing techniques presented in this paper was entered in the CoNLL 2007 shared task competition (Nivre et al., 2007).

We can sum over all non-projective spanning trees by taking the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix of the graph defined above, minus the row and column corresponding to the root node (Smith and Smith, 2007).

Recent work shows that k-best maximum spanning tree (MST) parsing and reranking is also viable (Hall, 2007).
P07-1050
Reranking the output of a k-best parser has been shown to improve upon the best results of a stateof-the-art constituency parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).

Training McDonald et al.(2005) present a technique for training discriminative models for dependency parsing.
P05-1012
and Analysis Hall (2007) shows that the oracle parsing accuracy of a k-best edge-factored MST parser is considerably higher than the one-best score of the same parser, even when k is small.

Features Our MST models are based on the features described in (Hall, 2007); specifically, we use features based on a dependency nodes’ form, lemma, coarse and fine part-of-speech tag, and morphologicalstring attributes.

This task evaluated parsing performance on 10 languages: Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish using data originating from a wide variety of dependency treebanks, and transformations of constituency-based treebanks (Hajiˇc et al., 2004; Aduriz et al., 2003; Mart´ı et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2003; B¨ohmov´a et al., 2003; Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Prokopidis et al., 2005; Csendes et al., 2005; Montemagni et al., 2003; Oflazer et al., 2003).

The tree-based reranker includes the features described in (Hall, 2007) as well as features based on non-projective edge attributes explored in (Havelka, 2007a; Havelka, 2007b).
