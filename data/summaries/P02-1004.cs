We profiled data from various domains (Gamon et al.2002a) to substantiate this linguistic claim (see Uszkoreit et al.1998 for similar results).

This is generally viewed as a subarea of aggregation in the generation literature (Wilkinson, 1995; Shaw, 1998; Reape and Mellish, 1999; Dalianis and Hovy, 1993).

In contrast, the sentence realization system code-named Amalgam (A Machine Learned Generation Module) (Corston-Oliver et al., 2002; Gamon et al., 2002b) employs a series of linguistic operations which map a semantic representation to a surface syntactic tree via intermediate syntactic representations.

FERGUS (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000), on the other hand, employs a model of syntactic structure during sentence realization.
C00-1007
We chose to model extraposition as an iterative movement process from the original attachment site to the next higher node in the tree (for an alternative one-step solution and a comparison of the two approaches see (Gamon et al., 2002a)).

We exploit the full set of features and attributes available in the analysis, instead of pre-determining a small set of potentially relevant features (Gamon et al., 2002b).
