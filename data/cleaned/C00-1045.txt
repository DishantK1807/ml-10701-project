Pronominalization revisited* Renate Henschel and Hua Cheng ~md Massimo Poesio HCRC, University of Edinburgh, UK {henschel,huac,poesio}@cogsci.ed.ac.uk Abstract Pronolninalization has been related to tile idea of a local focus a set of discourse entities in the speaker's centre of attention, for exmnple ill Gundel et al.(1993)'s givenness hierarchy or in centering theory.
Both accounts say that the determination of tile tbcus depends on syntactic as well as pragmatic factors, but have not been able to pin those factors down.
In this paper, we uncover the major factors which determine the focus set in descriptive texts.
This new tbcus definition has been ew, luated with respect to two corporm museum exhibit labels, mid newspaper mtieles.
It provides an operationalizable basis for pronoun production, and has been implemented as the reusable module gnome-np.
The algorithm l)ehind gnome-np is conlpared with the most recent pronoun generation algorithm of McCoy and Strube (1999).
1 Introduction
Besides the well established problem of ln'onoun resolution, pronoun generation is now attracting renewed attention.
In the past, generation systelns generated pronouns without attaching much importance to the problem, one notable exception being the classical algorithm of Dale (1990), loosely based on centering theory.
With the emergence of corpus based studies in comtmrational linguistics, the question arises whether it is possible to refine known standard algorithms, or whether an improvement is only to be achieved with the hell) of world knowledge reasoning a matter too complex to be dealt with reliably at this time.
Tile Ibrlner direction is represented by tile pioneering work of McCoy and Strube (1999).
They propose a refined algorithm for tile choice between definite description on the one hand and pronoun on the other for * The work reported in this paper has been calmed out with the tinancial support of UK ESPllC grant L51126.
animate referents I, which is based on distancG time structure mid ambiguity constraints.
Here we introduce a more general algoritlnn for the pronominalization decision that is valid not only for animate but for inanimate referents as well.
In conformity with McCoy and Strube, we group noun phrases with definite determiner and proper nalnes together under tile term "det'inite description".
The algorithm proposes a new pronominalization strategy, which beyond McCoy and Strube (1999)'s criteria makes use of the discom'se status of the antecedent and parallelism effects.
The algorithm has been implemented as the reusable module gnome-np.
It has been re-used in tile web hypertext generation system ILEX (see Oberlander el; al.
(1998)). It shows ml accuracy over 87% with respect to two corpora (each 5000 words) of difl'erent genres.
2 Accounts
of pronominalization In previous ace(rants pronominalization has been related to the idea of a local focus of ~d;tention: a set of discourse referents who/wlfich is in the center of attention of the speaker (e.g.
Sidner (1979), givenness hierarchy (Gun(lel et al., 1993), centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995), RAFT/RAPId.
(Suri, 1993)).
Whereas (Gundel el; al., 1993) do not atteml)t to make their focus notion operationalizable, this has been attempted by fllrther develolmlents of centering.
However these have mostly been applied to the pronoun resolution problem.
In the following we discuss three versions of centering and show that their application to the pronoun generation problem is nevertheless linfited.
Centering. Centering was developed to explain local discourse coherence; the extent to which it benefits pronoun generation is however not immediately clear, hi centering, 1We llSO the terms "discourse entity" and "refc'rent" synonymously in this paper.

It is assumed i;lmt they are 1)ari;ially order(:d.
As a major dei;erminant of the ordering, the gramma.tical fun(:t;ion hierarchy (roughly: SUI/.I~>OIM>OTIII~;IIS) has 1)een 1)r,')t)o,~ed.

The 1)ackward-tooking center (hencefl)rth C1)) is a distinguished 1nerobet of (;lie CI:~, which is defined as the most highly ranked member of the Ct5 of th(' previous lltterallee 'u,i_ \] which is realized in v,i.
The Cb is consid(:red as (;h(: \]o('al focus of ai;i;(:ntion.
Centering sta,t('s two rules.
Only the first; rule makes ~t (:brim at)()u(; l)ronominaliz~tion: ll! any (;lemen(; of the uti;eran(:e ui--1 is realiz(,,d in v,i as l)ronomh th(m l;he C\]) must l)e l)r()l~()minalized in 'it i as well.
As lloted tw McCoy mid Struhe (\]999), this rule apl)lies only in (,h(; ease that (:we sul)seqllent lltterallCeS share Hl()r('~ (;}l~tll o11(~ ref('A'ellt~ m:td (;hal; l;h(: non-el) ref(.'r(,.nt is 1)ronominalized in (,he se(xmd ui:termme.

Centering is a.lso found in Dale (1990) as the method of t)ronominalization control.
However, Dale's center detinii;ion differs from standard centering theory in i;hat it is defined semantically and not on the basis of a syni;aetie ranking.

Functional centering.
Finally, the cent;ering version suggest;ed \])y Stl'ul)e and Hahn (\]!)99) al>l)ears to r(:veal an underlying discourse mechanism resl)onsil)le for centering: the information si;rH(:ture of an utterance (roughly the givennew i)ai;t(:rn) is (;he de('l)er reason for the ranking ()\[ the %rward-h)oking (:eni:(:rs.
This l)ermii;s a generalization of sl;andar(l centering into a language-indel)ell(leld; l;heory eovering 1)oth trex: and fixed word-order languages.
It is however then surprising that this result is not made maximld use of in the Sltb.sc,,(lttent generaISonorient, cA work of McCoy an(1 Strube (1999).

It was motivated by the ol)servation that ~t la.rge percentage of NPs which would have been realized by 1)ronouns using known algorithms, are in fact not, realized as pronomls in real text.
They suggest that such NPs serve to mark ~time changes' in the discourse.
Their algorithm aecordingly makes use of distance, context ambiguity mid telnl)ora\] discourse structure to decide about 1)ronolninalization.
In our work, we have considered a corpus of a ditl'erent genre in which I, emt)oral cha.nge does nol, 1)bW a determining role: descript, ive (;exts.
\¥e 1)repose a new algorithm 307 that significantly simplifies the problem of pronoun choice.
It is based on a new definition of the local focus, which views the discourse status of the antecedent as the major motivation behind focusing.
The algorithm performs equally well when applied to McCoy and Strube's corpus of newspaper articles.
3 Corpus
analysis The algorithm we will present below has been developed in close relation to the MUSE corpus a corpus of museum exhibit labels a.
The corpus is a collection of web pages of the Paul Getty Museum, pages from an exhibition catalogue, and pages froln a jewellery book.
Typical characteristics are tile central role of inanimate referents in these texts, and the lack of temporal change thus providing an interesting countert)art to the newst)aper genre investigated by McCoy and Strube.
With an overall set of around 5000 words, tile cortms contains 1450 NPs.
Each NP has been annotated with respect to, among others, grammatical function, discourse status, gender, number, countability, and antecedent relationships.
23% of the NPs form reference chains (i.e.
at least two mentions of one and the same referent in one text), the other 77% are only mentioned once.
We have 101 different reference chains; the chain-fbrming NPs fall into 10\] discoursenew and 213 anaphoric NPs.
In the following, we will only discuss the anaphoric NPs.
50% of the anaphoric NPs are realized as definite descriptions, 50% as pronouns.
We distinguish between locally bound pronouns, which are determined syntactically (Binding Theory, (Choresky, 1981)), and which we expect the tactical generator to handle correctly, and pronouns which are not locally bound so-called discourse pronouns.
We investigated possible col relations between the discourse 1)ronouns and semantic/pragmatic features of their context.
The basic notions that we found were distance, discourse status of the antecedent, and grammatical function of the antecedent.
All three notions need a precise definition.
Distance. ~lb be able to determine the distance between a discourse entity and its antecedent, a precise determination of what counts 3UIL: http ://www.
hcrc. ed.
ac. uk/'gnome/corpora as utterance unit is necessary.
Following Kameyama (1998), we take as utterance unit the finite clause, lelative clauses and con> plenmnt clauses are not counted as utterances on their own.
This means that we count clauses containing complement clauses or relative clauses as single utterances.
4,a The previous utterance is the preceding utterance at the same level of embedding.
Note that we allow the treatment of clauses with VP coordination (subject ellipsis) as complex coordinated clauses as done in Kameyalna (1998), thus handling subject ellipsis as a discourse pronoun; our algorithm does not; insist on this view however.
The following correlation between pronoun use and distance was tbund in our corpus: 97% of the pronouns have an antecedent in the same or the previous utterance.
Discourse status.
The information status of a discourse entity in an utterance is either given or new.
We use these terms with an identical Lneaning as g~vn'nd and focus in Vallduvi (1993).
Discourse status, as introduced by Prince (1992), is a similar but different notion: A discourse entity is discourse-old, if it has been mentioned before in the same discourse; it is discourse-new otherwise.
All cases of givenness by indirect means like part-whole, set-member relationships, other bridging relations, inferences (Prince's inferrables, anchored and situationally evoked entities) are judged as discourse-new, thus taking into account only tile identity antecedent relationship.
We share Prince's opinion that pronominalization has to do with discourse status, whereas definiteness has to do with information status.
66% of all short-distance discourse pronouns in the MUSE corpus refer to an antecedent which is in itself discourse-old.
Subjecthood. The third strong correlation is the relation between pronoun use and the grmnmatical function of the antecedent.
63% of discourse pronouns have a subject as antecedent.
The following table shows the overall distribution of antecedent properties for short-distance 4This deviates from Kameyama, who analyzes reported speech as separate utterance.

Because the set {}i' a.ntecedents is l'mlkcd there with resl)eCt to infbrm~tion status, this is identical with {mr proposal.

We believe that the discourse status of the antecedent as prmominalization trigger is a general rule, in discourse Sell-l&ii/;,ies.

Strong parallelism is a simulta.neous subject mid object para.lMism in two consecutive clauses.
Strong i)arallelism always overrides the local focus criterion, mid allows tbr pronominalization of referents with discourse-new antecedents in nonsut)ject position.

Ambiguity. Along with McCoy and Strube we argue that ambiguity with respect to gender/number influences the pronominalization decision: members of the local fbcus which have a competing referent (refbrent with similar gender/number) in some span to the left of the referent to be generated should not be realized as t)ronouns so as to minimize the inference load for the reader.
However, not to allow pronominalization in all ambiguous context situations does not ~I)t)ear to be consistent with real texts (McCoy and Strube, 1999).
In the MUSE cortms one third of all focal NPs occur in ambiguous contexts, one half of them is pronominalized, the other half is not.
Two questions require a precise answer to use the ambiguity constraint in a generation algorithm: • Which set of 1)reviously mentioned referents or text st)an is taken into account tbr referents to be in competition? • Which referents are pronominalizcd despite an alnbiguous context?
The answer is surprisingly simple: I/.eferents of the previous utterance which are not in the local fbcus do not disturb pronominalization, even if they have the stone gender/nmnber.
Only if the actual referent has a competitor in the local fbcus, is pronominalization blocked.
This is illustrated in Figure 1 with exmnples (3) and (4), respectively.
In (3) the microscope is discourseold and the only member in the local focus for (u2); the competing referents ocular micrvmctcr" mid technology are new and hence not local fbr utterance (u2).
In (4), the local focus for (u2) is {the at, th, tl, e l,.o'asc} A slight improvement of the performance of the algorithm can be achieved by regarding the role of "heavy" nonrestrictive modification.
hm\]uding the referents of discom'se-new NPs which are amplified by appositions or nonrestrictive relative clauses into the set; of' possible competitors improves accuracy slightly.
Discourse structure signalling.
It is now known that detinite descriptions (or more general overspecified NPs) signal the start of a new discourse segment (Passommau, 1996; Vonk et al., 1992).
For most generation systems generate from an I/ST-like text; plan, discourse segments are naturally given.
The only question fl'om the generation perspective is the degree of detail provided by the segmentation.
Our algorithm gnome-up assumes that the discourse segmentation has already been specified.
At each segment boundary, the local focus is set to nil, thereby disallowing pronominalization for all discourse entities of the first utterance in the segment onset.
It is also well known that plmmed discourse with repeated phrases at the begimfing of a clause are seen as 'bad style'.
Identical repeated pronouns at the clause onset are rarely found in expository and descriptive texts (2.6% of all discourse pronouns in our corpus).
Hmnan writers usually avoid possibly dull lack of variation by employing various aggregation techniques.

The Mgorithm, first, is implemented as a reusable module tbr generation systenls and, second, provides a theoretical account of pronominalization in general.
The proposed algorithm provides a solution for question \[~ above by widening the definition of local Ibcus to be a set with possibly more than one referent.
The Mgorithm also oilers a new solution fbr problem \[~ above, aml)iguous pronoun generation.
Discom'se structuring (~\]) is assumed as given.
A sufficiently finegrained discourse structuring has been explored, for example, by McCoy and Strube fbr their donlmn of newspaper articles, but remMns an issue fbr future research fbr other domains.
We have shown that next to 1)roxilnity, the discourse status of the mltecedcnt is a main criterion for triggering pronomilmlization.
The suggested algorithm generalizes known fbcusing accounts.
Gundel et al.(1993)'s cognitive slat, us of being "in fbcus" is now approximated by the set of all discourse-old entities and the subject of the previous utterance.
The new focus determination is also a generalization of centering's Cb.
The focus so defined serves two functions simultaneously: to trigger 1)ronominMization, and to provide the set; of competitors for pronoun generation in ambiguous contexts.
Although our training corpus is too small to justify general clMms, the ewduation with respect to tile newspaper genre provides evidence that this finding is valid for planned discourse ill generM, independent of the concrete genre.
