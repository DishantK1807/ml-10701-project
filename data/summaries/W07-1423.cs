Initially we assume when judging the entailment relation that it holds for each T-H pair 1 We are using Minipar (Lin, 1998) and Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) as preprocessors, see also sec.

Unlexicalized parsers, on the other hand, achieved accuracies almost equivalent to those of lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003).

The resulting strings are fed to the Stanford Parser (de Marneffe et al., 2006; Klein and Manning, 2003) with its included pretrained model and options ??retainTmpSubcategories??and ??splitTMP 1??

Given an English sentence, we parse it with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and then generate paraphrases using the following syntactic transformations: 1.

Work Klein and Manning presented an unlexicalized PCFG parser that eliminated all the lexicalized parameters (Klein and Manning, 2003).

In many cases, the combination of these approaches has been shown to improve the performance of a single approach both for controlled indexing (Aronson et al., 2004) and free text indexing (Byrne and Klein, 2003).
