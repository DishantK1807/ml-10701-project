Introduction
The ACL 2008 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT-08) took place on Thursday, June
19 in Columbus, Ohio, United States, immediately following the annual meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics, which was hosted by the Ohio State University.

and Using Parallel Texts In the following years the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation was
held at HLT-NAACL 2006 in New York City, US, and at ACL 2007 in Prague, Czech Republic.
The focus of our workshop was to use parallel corpora for machine translation. Recent experimentation
has shown that the performance of SMT systems varies greatly with the source language. In this
workshop we encouraged researchers to investigate ways to improve the performance of SMT systems
for diverse languages, including morphologically more complex languages and languages with partial
free word order.
Prior to the workshop, in addition to soliciting relevant papers for review and possible presentation
we conducted a shared task that brought together machine translation systems for an evaluation on
previously unseen data. This year’s task resembled the shared tasks of previous years in many ways,
but also included Hungarian-English and Spanish-German as new language pairs. In addition, we
evaluated submitted systems against new test sets from the newswire domain.
The results of the shared task were announced at the workshop, and these proceedings also include an
overview paper for the shared task that summarizes the results, as well as provides information about
the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the task. In addition,
there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in some detail.
Due to the large number of high quality submission for the full paper track, shared task submissions
were presented as posters. The poster session was held in the afternoon and gave participants of the
shared task the opportunity to present their approaches. The rest of the day was devoted to oral paper
presentations and Daniel Marcu’s invited talk in the afternoon.
Like in previous years, we have received a far larger number of submission than we could accept for
presentation. This year we have received 18 full paper submissions and 26 shared task submissions.
In total WMT-08 featured 12 full paper oral presentations and 25 shared task poster presentations.
The invited talk was given by Daniel Marcu of the Information Sciences Institute at the University of
Southern California.
We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We also would
like to thank the participants of the shared task and all the other volunteers who helped with the manual
evaluations. We also acknowledge the financial support of the shared task by the EuroMatrix project
funded by the European Commission (6th Framework Programme).
