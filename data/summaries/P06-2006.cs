More recent PTB-based parsers show small improvements over Collins’ Model 3 using PARSEVAL, while Clark and Curran (2004) and Miyao and Tsujii (2005) report 84% and 86.7% F1-scores respectively for their own relational evaluations on section 23 of WSJ.

Bikel (2004) shows that, in Collins’(1999)Model2,bilexicalparameterscontribute less than 0.5% to accuracy on in-domain data while lexical subcategorization-like parameters contribute just over 1%.

Klein and Manning (2003) argue that such results represent about 4% absolute improvement over a carefully constructed unlexicalized PCFGlike model trained and tested in the same manner.1 Gildea(2001)showsthatWSJ-derivedbilexical parameters in Collins’ (1999) Model 1 parser contribute less than 1% to parse selection accuracy when test data is in the same domain, and yield no improvement for test data selected from the Brown Corpus.

The full system can be extended in a variety of ways – for example, by pruning PoS tags but allowing multiple tag possibilities per word as input to the parser, by incorporating lexical subcategorization into parse selection, by computing GR weights based on the proportion and probability of the n-best analyses yielding them, and so forth – broadly trading accuracy and greater domaindependence against speed and reduced sensitivity to domain-specific lexical behaviour (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002; Carroll and Briscoe, 2002; Watson et al., 2005; Watson, 2006).
