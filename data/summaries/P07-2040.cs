2. STR : Supervised learning method using syntactic3 and word-based features, the path of the pairs of NEs in the parse tree and the word ngram between pairs of NEs (Kambhatla, 2004) 3.
P04-3022
They use two kinds of features: syntactic ones and wordbased ones, for example, the path of the given pair of NEs in the parse tree and the word n-gram between NEs (Kambhatla, 2004).

Detection The proposed method employs contextual features based on centering theory (Grosz et al., 1983) as well as conventional syntactic and word-based features.
P83-1007
So far, various supervised learning approaches have been explored in this field (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zelenko et al., 2003).

In this paper, we use centering theory (Kameyama, 1986) to determine how easily a noun phrase can be referred to in the following context.
P86-1031
For example, ?amerika32 ??wa:Ken22?? is used as the feature of the given pair ?Ken22??and ?amerika32?? 2.5 Classification Algorithm There are several structure-based learning algorithms proposed so far (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Suzuki et al., 2003; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004).
