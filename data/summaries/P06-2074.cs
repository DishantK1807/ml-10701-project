Lin. 1997.

For these cases, we found that we are able to verify the context by performing dependency relation parsing (Lin, 1997), which outputs the word ‘victims’ as an object in both instances, with ‘attacked’ as a verb and ‘terrorists’ as a subject.

Although this approach is suitable for automatic training, Xiao et al.(2004) stated that hard matching techniques tend to have low recall due to data sparseness problem.

Roth and Yih (2002) learned the entities and relations together.

approach Differing from previous systems, the language model in ARE is based on dependency relations obtained from Minipar by Lin (1997).

Testing was done on 25 relevant and 25 irrelevant texts from TST3, plus 25 relevant and 25 irrelevant texts from TST4, as is done in Xiao et al.(2004). MUC6 covers news articles in Management Succession domain.

Additionally, Zhou and Su (2002) trained classifiers for Named Entity extraction and reported that performance degrades rapidly if the training corpus size is below 100KB.

However, context-based approaches such as Autoslog-TS by Riloff (1996) and Yangarber et al.(2002) may face difficulties in handling these instances effectively because the context of entity ‘victims’ is located on the left context in the first instance and on the right context in the second.

A possible approach for modeling relations of different complexity is the use of dependency-based kernel trees in support vector machines by Culotta and Sorensen (2004).
