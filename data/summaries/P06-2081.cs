This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person’s four star review is another’s two-star.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) appear to work well for binary sentiment classification tasks, so Argamon et al.(2003) and Pang and Lee (2005) consider One-vs-All, or All-vs-All, variants on SVM, to permit multiple classifications.

However, Pang and Lee (2005) point out that ranking items or comparing reviews will benefit from finer-grained classifications, over multiple ordered classes: is a film review twoor threeor four-star?

For instance, both Pang and Lee (2002) and Turney (2002) consider the thumbs up/thumbs down decision: is a film review positive or negative?

Work focusses on analysing subjective features of text or speech, such as sentiment, opinion, emotion or point of view (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2005; Shanahan et al., 2005).

A richer set of features besides n-grams should be checked, and we should not ignore the potential effectiveness of unigrams in this task (Pang et al., 2002).
