Phonological and morphophono~ logical va~ iations are described using standard finite-state two..level morphological rules.
Interdigitation, prefixation ax~.d s~tffixation are described by t~sing an intersection of ~w~ lexicons which effectively defines lexical representations of wo~'ds, ~o lntrod'trcticm Word-.fir:mat\]on in Semitic languges poses several challengeu to computational morphology.
One obvious difficulty is its nonconcatenative nature ie.
the fact that inflection :is not just adding prefixes and suffixes, but also i~tcludes interdigitation where the phonological sequence 3ymbolizh~g a verbal root is interrupted by individual and short sequences of phonemes denoting various derivational and inflectional stems.
\]fn addition to this, there are ~xumerou~ phonological and raorphophonological processes of a more conventional character.
Two-level phonology assumes a framework for wordformation ~vhere there is an underlying lexical representation of the word-form and a surface representation which are related to each other with two=level rules \[Koskennien~ J983\].
These rules compare the representations directly a~ld they operate in parallel The lexicon comporxent deth.~.es what lexical representations are permissible and how they correspond to sequences of morphemes, see figure 1.

The rule component proves to be similar i~ two-level rule systems ~br other la~guages.
Interdigitation entails more requirements for the lexicon which defines feasible lexical representations and relates them to underlying morphemes..The task for the lexicon component is more or less universal, even if some languages can do with simpler lexicons while others require more sophisticated structures.
This paper discusses a solution which involves using two separate lexicons, one for word roots, and the other for prefixes, flexional elements and suffixes.
Entries for roots leave flexlonal elements unspecified and vice versa.
The intersection of these two lexicons effectively defines lexical representations of word-forms.
2. Morphotactic structure of word-forms.
Akkadian verbs have the following overall pattern: \[pers.\] \[root & flection\] \[gender & numb.\] \[opt.
subjunctive etc.\] \[opt.
obj.\] An example of a full fledged verbal form would be '(that) they caught him': lexicalrepresentation: I X t a B A T u \ n I sh u surface representation: i x x a b t u u n i sh u A dash '-' denotes morpheme boundary, and backslash 'V a morphophoneme for vowel lengthening.
The above wordform is divided into its parts according to the pattern as follows: person 1 root X...
B ...
A T flection ...
t a ...... gender & number u \ subjunctive n 1 object sh u Capital letters are used in order to distinguish radical consonants and vowels fi'om segments in other morphs.
Thus, the root & flection part is XtaBAT where capital letters are components of the root, with lower case letters representing flectional elements.
Nouns, in turn, have an overall structure : \[stem\] \[case & number\[ \[opt.
possessive\] An example of a maximal nominal word-form is their kings ~.
lexicalrepresentation: Sh a R \ a \ n t sh u n U surface representation: sh a r r a a n i sh u n u 313 This can be readily decomposed into its parts as follows: stem Sh a It \ case&number a \ n i possessive sit u n u 3.

v c where flectional elements may occur in the two intervening slots marked with ""...
Flectional elements have a pattern consisting of two parts to fill the corresponding two gaps in the verbal root.
The overall pattern is roughly ...(((c)C)v)...(v or \)...
There is at most one verbal prefix and it indicates person (and partly modus).
Its overalll pattern is (C)y.
There are at most three verbal suffixes attached to the stem.
The first suffix indicates gender and number (and partly person).
They have the form v\ or they are empty.
The second suffix indicates either the subjunctive (u, empty, or n-l) or the ventive (am or aim).
The third suffix denotes the object or the dative case and conforms to a pattern c v( c u(\ c v)) Nominal stems are given as derived complete stems containing three radical consonants which can be identified, but no attempt has been made to generate them from plain radical consonants and flectional elements because stems are idiosyncratic and better described as lexicalized whole units.
Nominal suffixes indicate gender, number and case.
Gender is part of the stem for nouns whereas adjectives have an explicit feminine suffix (a)t (the masculine has no marking).
Number and case are represented by portmanteau morphs.
After these endings there may be a possessive ending according to one of two patterns: v k or c v (c v).
3. Phonological Description Akkadian, like many other Semitic languages, has a considerable number of phonological and morphophonological processes.
This paper describes a fairly complete and tested system of some 30 rules written in two-level formalism and compiled with the TWOL rule compiler \[Karttunen, Koskenniemi and Kaplan, 1987\].
A number of examples is given below accompanied by rules that correspond to the processes.
In each example the lexical representation is given (in bold face) above the surface representation (in normal face).
There are several assimilations word internally and at morpheme boundaries, eg.
an N in the root is assimilated to the immediately following consonant, eg.
7re cut (past tense) ': I~KIS ikkis which corresponds to the rule: "assimilation of N" N:F <=> :F ; where F in Consonants ; Futhermore, 'he said ~: IZtaKAR izzakar "assimilation of dontals" t:F <=> :F ; whore F in Dontals ; and %e trusted hint (something) ': i P Q I D sh u i p q i s s u "suffix assimilation of t" t:s <=> -: ~h: ; "suffix assimilation of sit" sh:s <=> :s --: ; Some alternations caused by laryngeals: 'lord' B a \ E 1 u b e e / u "umlaut" a:e => E: :* : • * E: ; 'he enters ' IE aRkUB i r r u b "elision of a" a:O <=> : Vowel Laryngeal: : CollsonaHt \: Examples of deletion of short vowels: 'good ' oa~lQu dam qu Examples of vowel contractions.

'rite obvious generaliza~io:o, of' lexicons would, \[,hen, be to use transition diagr~m~ b~,%ead of trees.
An entry tbr a verbal stem ~decide' as a regular expression could be: );2*," )iS"' ~ 2',)* 0 .5 Nz* where: >',~ denotes the alphabet for prcfixes~ flectional elemenrl;~.
~tn.d sut_~XeSo Correspondingly, an entry for a pr(,sc:~t te~ ~c ba:;ie stem (G stem) could be: where ~;,~ cv~m~e~ th.e alphabet fbr radical consonants and vowels, Ir~i;erseetions of such root entries and flectional elemer~ts l,~ve e~actly the lexical representations of verbal stereo.
(Tit(,.

The intersection of this a*~d the root lexicon eoxttains ~!\[ tbasible lexical representations (which was the task c)f the lexicon component).
This intersection need J.tot be carried out in advance because the process of recognition can peribrm simultaneous searches in these i,wo c(anpone~.ts aJ~d sinmlatc the intersection.
The result of an actual intersection would be inconvenient because of its size (roughly, the product of the sizes of its eom.ponents).
(Th.ere is D.O operational implementation of this part of the system yet, although facilities to build it are avaUable3 5° Combinations of Morphemes The otructure of \[cxicou that was sketched above greatly ovcrgenera:;e~ because many combinations of prefixes, fle('tional e)emcnts and suffixes are not valid.
Restrictions are needed tbr the cooccurrence of these morphemes.
One ohvious way to cope with such combinatorics is to use unificatim~-b~sed fbatures as in I)-PATR \[Karttunen 1986\].
lh_~ification features have the additional benefit of also providing effective morphosy~d;actic features for ¢~ordZorn'm It seems that the ability of using negation and disjunctiozx in unification would simplify the description.
In the following we assume these to be available.
1,\]fthctive restrictions for prefixes could be eg.: u (rmtPers2 siugular hotFemin ) or ( permn3 plural not~omrn ) i (per'sere3 siHgular masculine) or ( person3 plural uotComm ) where ¢omm refers to a gender which is used in some forms to cover both feminine and masculine (feminine, masculine and Comm are mutually exclusive).
Descriptions tbr suffixes could be eg.: a a notPersl plural notMasc i 1 person2 singular feminine u u person3 plural masculine null morph notPers2SgFem or person1 plural comm The templates can be defined in a straight forward manner to rcsalt in combinations eg.: U... aa tl,..
o u o,..
person3 plural feminine person3 plural masculine person1 singular masculine, or person3 singular masculine The combinatorics of Akkadian prefixes and suffixes seems to be fairly complicated, but a feature calculus seems to be sutIicient for handling it so that it lets only valid combinations through and gives correct morphosyntactic features to word-forms.
