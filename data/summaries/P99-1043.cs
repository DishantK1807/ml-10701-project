(Shfitze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995) all use multiple context words as discriminating features.

Information such as airline schedules, movie reservation, car trading, etc., can all be included in HTML files, to be accessed by a generic spoken interface to the Web browser (Zue, 1995; DiDio, 1997; Raymond, 1997; Fung et al., 1998a).

Co-occurrence statistics is collected from either bilingual parallel and 334 non-parallel corpora (Smadja et al., 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung and Lo, 1998), or monolingual corpora (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994; Liu and Li, 1997; Shiitze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).

Our team has built a multilingual spoken language interface to the Web, named SALSA (Fung et al., 1998b; Fung et al., 1998a; Ma and Fung, 1998).

In (Dagan and Itai, 1994), syntactic relationship is used to find the most powerful "trigger word".

The results are consistent with the idea in (Gale and Church, 1994; Shfitze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).

Co-occurrence information between neighboring words and words in the same sentence has been used in phrase extraction (Smadja, 1993; Fung and Wu, 1994), phrasal translation (Smadja et al., 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Wu, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), target word selection (Liu and Li, 1997; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996), domain word translation (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al., 1992a; Gale et al., 1992b; Gale et al., 1992c; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1995), and even recently for query translation in cross-language IR as well (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998).

As we noted in (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung, 1998), parallel corpora are rare in most domains.

The first baseline method is similar to (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Smadja et al., 1996), where we use the nearest neighboring word of the secondary language word C as feature for disambiguation.

Mutual information is a good measure of the co-occurrence relationship between two words (Gale and Church, 1993).

2.3.1 Baseline: single neighboring word as disambiguating feature The first disambiguating feature we present here is similar to the statistical feature in (Dagan et al., 1991; Smadja et al., 1996; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998), namely the co-occurrence with neighboring words.
A94-1006 J94-4003 J96-1001 P91-1017
We have also demonstrated in our domain translation task that multiple context words are useful (Fung and Lo, 1998; Fung and McKeown, 1997).
P98-1069 W97-0119
The intuition for choosing the nearest neighboring word Ey as the disambiguating feature for C is based on the assumption that they are part of a phrase or collocation term, and that there is only one sense per collocation (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993).
A94-1006 H93-1052 J94-4003
We do not use any syntactic relationship as in (Dagan and Itai, 1994) because such relationship is not available for mixed-language sentences.
