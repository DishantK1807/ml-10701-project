This criticism leads us to automatic approaches for building thesauri from large corpora \[Hirschman et al., 1975; Hindle, 1990; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et al., 1993; Tokunaga et aL, 1995; Ushioda, 1996\].

As Resnik pointed out, however, using the thesaurus structure (classes) can remedy this problem \[Resnik, 1992\].

Roger's International Thesaurus \[Chapman, 1984\] and WordNet \[Miller et al., 1993\] are typical English thesauri which have been widely used in past NLP research \[Resnik, 1992; Yarowsky, 1992\].

3As Uramoto mentioned, this task is also similar to word sense disambiguation except for the size of search space \[Uramoto, 1996\].

Limitations of handcrafted thesauri can be summarized as follows \[Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Uramoto, 1996; Hindle, 1990\].

work The goal of this paper is the same as that for Uramoto \[Uramoto, 1996\], that is, identifying appropriate word classes for an unknown word in terms of an existing thesaurus.

Based on this observation, a third approach has been proposed, namely, combining linguistic knowledge and co-occurrence data \[Resnik, 1992; Uramoto, 1996\].

However, it is very difficult to gather sufficient co-occurrences to calculate similarities reliably \[Resnik, 1992; Basili et al., 1992\].
