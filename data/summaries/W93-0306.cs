Bourigault's LECTER \[Bourigault, 1992\] is a surface-syntactic analyser that extracts 'maximallength noun phrases' -mainly sequences of determiners, premodifiers, nominal heads, and certain kinds of postmodifying prepositional phrases and adjectives from French texts for terminology applications.

These 'smaller' rules do not contradict the more general rules; often it is sim4e.g. by ranking the graanmar rules in terms of compromisability 49 ply the case that further restrictions can be imposed on smaller lexical classes s This flexibility in the grammar formalism greatly contributes to the accuracy of the parser \[Voutilainen, forthcoming a; Voutilainen, forthcoming 1993\].

Church's Parts of speech \[Church, 1988\] performs not only part-of-speech analysis, but it also identities the most simple kinds of noun phrases mostly sequences of determiners, premodifiers and nominal heads by inserting brackets around them, e.g. s Consider for instance the attachment of prepositions\] phrases in general and of ofphrues in particular.

e.g. \[Sampson, 1987a; Taylor, Grover and Briscoe, 1989; Church, 1992\]), we do not object to probabilistic methods in principle; nevertheless, it seems to us that rule-based descriptions are preferable bemuse they can provide for more accurate and reliable analyses than current probabilistic systems, e.g. part-of-speech taggers \[Voutilainen, Heikkil~ and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen, forthcoming a\].
