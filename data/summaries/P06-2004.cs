(Collins and Brooks, 1995) also present a modelwith multiple backoffs.

The results presented here differ slightly from those in (Atterer and Sch¨utze, 2006) due to a coding error.
W06-2913
The supervised component is Collins’ parser (Collins, 1997), trained on the Wall Street Journal.
P97-1003
The difference to (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) was discussed above with respect to analysing the unlabeled corpus.
J93-1005
With the exception of (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), most unsupervised work on PP attachment is based on superficial analysis of the unlabeled corpus without the use of partial parsing (Volk, 2001; Calvo et al., 2005).
J93-1005
The best performing systems for many tasks in natural language processing are based on supervised training on annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the prepositional phrase data set first described in (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994).

Our baseline method for ambiguity resolution is the Collins parser as implemented by Bikel (Collins, 1997; Bikel, 2004).
J04-4004 P97-1003
We did not use the PP data set described by (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994) because we are using more context than the limited context available in that set (see below).
H94-1048
Our disambiguation method is Lattice-Based Disambiguation (LBD, (Atterer and Sch¨utze, 2006)).

5However, the baseline is similarly high for the PP problem if the most likely attachment is chosen per preposition: 72.2% according to (Collins and Brooks, 1995).
W95-0103
28 biguation is the noun-verb link, but the other dependencies also improve the accuracy of disambiguation (Atterer and Sch¨utze, 2006).
W06-2913
Previous work on relative clause attachment has been supervised (Siddharthan, 2002a; Siddharthan, 2002b; Yeh and Vilain, 1998).6 (Siddharthan, 2002b)’s accuracy for RC attachment is 76.5%.7 7 Conclusion Previous work on specific types of ambiguities (like RC and PP) has not addressed the integration of specific resolution algorithms into a generic statistical parser.
P98-2234
(Two weeks after Aug 5, 1997, were set apart for future experiments.) The labeled corpus is the Penn Wall Street Journal treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
J93-2004
Work Other work combining supervised and unsupervised learning for parsing includes (Charniak, 1997), (Johnson and Riezler, 2000), and (Schmid, 2002).
A00-2021 C02-1108
The unsupervised approach of (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) achieves almost 80% accuracy by using partial dependency statistics to disambiguate ambiguous sentences in the unlabeled corpus.
