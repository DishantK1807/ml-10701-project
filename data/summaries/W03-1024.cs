The number of zeros in general in our data is 347, while Seki resolved 355 detected zeros in (Seki et al., 2002a) and 404 in (Seki et al., 2002b).
C02-1078
For this task, we use a named entity recognizer (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).
C02-1054
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have shown good performance in various tasks in Natural Language Processing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Hirao et al., 2002).
C02-1053 C02-1054 N01-1025
We put Ag before Sa because Kameyama’s method was better than Walker’s in Okumura and Tamura (1996).
C96-2147
Since complex sentences are hard to analyze, each sentence is automatically split at conjunctive postpositions (setsuzoku joshi) (Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Ehara and Kim, 1996).
C96-2147
The Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) is important in the heuristic approach.
J95-2003
Okumura and Tamura (1996) experimented on the roles of conjunctive postpositions in complex sentences.
C96-2147
1. Forward center ranking (Walker et al., 1994): (topic a44 empathy a44 subject a44 object2 a44 object a44 others).
J94-2003
The number of zeros in our editorial is 514, while (Seki et al., 2002a) resolved 498 detected zeros.
C02-1078
Therefore, we obtained Seki’s data (Seki et al., 2002a; Seki et al., 2002b), which are based on the Kyoto University Corpus 2 2.0.

They have discussed simple sentenses (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1994; YamuraTakei et al., 2002), dialogues (Yamamoto et al., 1997), stereotypical lead sentences of newspaper articles (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1993), intrasentential resolution (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996; Ehara and Kim, 1996) or organization names in newspaper articles (Aone and Bennett, 1995).

Kameyama (1986) emphasized the importance of a property-sharing constraint.
P86-1031
Walker et al.(1994) proposed forward center ranking for Japanese.

Conjunct The latest conjunctive postposition in the sentence and its classification (Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Yoshimoto, 1986).

2. Property-sharing (Kameyama, 1986): If a zero is the subject of a verb, its antecedent is perhaps a subject in the antecedent’s sentence.
P86-1031
3. Semantic constraints (Yamura-Takei et al., 2002; Yoshino, 2001): If a zero is the subject of ‘eat,’ its antecedent is probably a person or an animal, and so on.
