Example or" sncb systems (see \[Shieber 1985a\]) include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (GPSG), Lexical functional Grammars (LFG), and tIead-driven Phrase Structure Grammars (IIPSG).

We briefly describe a calculus to represent the structures used by this system, extending on the work of Rounds, and Kasper \[Rounds et al.1986, Kasper et al.1986\] involving the logical formulation of feature structures.

Calculus to Represent FTAG Grammars We will now consider a calculus to represent FTAG's by extending on the llogieal formulation oftbature structures given by Rounds and Kasper \[Rou Kasper et al.1986\]. Feature structures in this logic (henceforth called lt!K logic) are represented as formulae.

In Section 3, we introduce a calculus, which is an extension of the logical calculus of Rounds and Kasper \[Rounds et al.1986, Kasper et al.1986\] allowing A-abstraction and application, in order to describe the structures used in FTAG's.

The reason this extensi,~lt of the TAll parser to one fl)t I:'FAG is po,~;sible fi)llows from the lact that the treatment of haviJ,g the t and b feature structures fl)r every node in F'I)A(~ is compatible with the I characterization, adopted in the parsing algorithm in \[Schabes et al.:19881, of a node in le.rms of two subs\[rings.

We will not describe feature structur,~s any fnrther (see \[Shieber 1985a\] for more details on featurc structures and an introduction to the unification based approach to grammars).
