Note that the predicate language representation utilized by Carmel-Tools is in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Hobbs, 1985).

Such applications include tutorial dialogue systems (Zinn et al., 2002; Popescue et al., 2003) and writing coaches that perform detailed assessments of writing content (Ros´e et al., 2003; Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1998; Malatesta et al., 2002) as opposed to just grammar (Lonsdale and Strong-Krause, 2003), and provide detailed feedback rather than just letter grades (Burstein et al., 1998; Foltz et al., 1998).

Hobbs. 1985.
P85-1008
After the parser produces a semantic feature structure representation of the sentence, predicate mapping rules then match against that representation in order to produce a predicate language representation in the style of Davidsonian event based semantics (Davidson, 1967; Hobbs, 1985), as mentioned above.

The area of automated essay grading has enjoyed a great deal of success at applying shallow language processing techniques to the problem of assigning general quality measures to student essays (Burstein et al., 1998; Foltz et al., 1998).
P98-1032
While our approach is not specific to a particular framework for deep syntactic analysis, we have chosen to build upon the publicly available LCFLEX robust parser (Ros´e et al., 2002), the CARMEL grammar and semantic interpretation framework (Ros´e, 2000), and the COMLEX lexicon (Grishman et al., 1994).
