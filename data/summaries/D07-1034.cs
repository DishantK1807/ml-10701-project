You and Chen (2006) used a feature clustering method to create a thesaurus from a Chinese newspaper corpus.

An early effort along this line is Hearst (1992), who attempted to identify hyponyms from large text corpora, based on a set of lexico-syntactic patterns, to augment and critique the content of WordNet.

For instance, Lin (1998) used dependency relation as word features to compute word similarities from large corpora, and compared the thesaurus created in such a way with WordNet and Roget classes.

Curran and Moens (2002) explored a new similarity measure for automatic thesaurus extraction which better compromises with the speed/performance tradeoff.

Ciaramita (2002) compared several models in classifying nouns with respect to a simplified version of WordNet and signified the gain in performance with morphological features.

For Chinese, Tseng (2003) proposed a method based on morphological similarity to assign a Cilin category to unknown words from the Sinica corpus which were not in the Chinese Electronic Dictionary and Cilin; but somehow the test data were taken from Cilin, and therefore could not really demonstrate the effectiveness with unknown words found in the Sinica corpus.

Caraballo (1999) selected head nouns from conjunctions and appositives in noun phrases, and used the cosine similarity measure with a bottomup clustering technique to construct a noun hierarchy from text.
