(See the footnote for line 3 of Unify1.) The sharing version of Copy is similar to the variant in (Tomabechi, 1992).

Work We reduce memory consumption of graph unication as presented in (Tomabechi, 1991) (or (Wroblewski, 1987)) by separating scratch elds from node structures.
P91-1041
It is very similar to the algorithm in (Tomabechi, 1991), but incorporates our indexing technique.
P91-1041
We will adopt the same terminology as Tomabechi in (Tomabechi, 1992).

The conditions for sharing mentioned in (Tomabechi, 1992) are: (1) bottom and atomic nodes can be shared; (2) complex nodes can be shared unless they are modi ed.

Pereira’s (Pereira, 1985) algorithm also stores changes to nodes separate from the graph.

P91-1041
One of the design goals of Tomabechi’s algorithm was to come to an e cient implementation of parallel uni cation (Tomabechi, 1991).
P91-1041
Examples of these approaches are given in (Tomabechi, 1991) and (Wroblewski, 1987).
P91-1041
With respect to over and early copying (as de ned in (Tomabechi, 1991)), our algorithm has the same characteristics as Tomabechi’s algorithm.
