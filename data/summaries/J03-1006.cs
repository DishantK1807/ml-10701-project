For example, Figure 3 presents an alternative form of weighted top-down parsing using pairs of values, following Stolcke (1995).

Furthermore, there are observations by, for example, Chitrao and Grishman (1990), Tjong Kim Sang (1998, Sections 3.1 and 3.4), and van Noord et al.(1999, Section 3.9), that suggest that the apparent advantage of Knuthâ€™s algorithm does not necessarily lead to significantly lower time costs in practice.

As already remarked by Goodman (1999), deduction systems can also be extended to manipulate weights.

This can straightforwardly be generalized to weighted (in particular, stochastic) tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes 1992).
