Furthermore, it is not possible to apply the powerful "one sense per discourse" property (Yarowsky, 1995) because there is no discourse in dictionaries.

WSD is a very difficult task even for humans 6, but semiautomatic techniques to disambiguate genus have been broadly used (Amsler, 1981) (Vossen and Serail, 1990) (Ageno et ah, 1992) (Artola, 1993) and some attempts to do automatic genus disambiguation have been performed using the semantic codes of the dictionary (Bruce et al., 1992) or using cooccurrence data extracted from the dictionary itself (Wilks et al., 1993).

Thus, given a hyponym definition (O) and a set of candidate hypernym definitions, this method selects the candidate hypernym definition (E) which returns the maximum score given by formula (1): SC(O, E) : E cw(wi, wj) (I) 'wIEOAwj6E The cooccurrence weight (cw) between two words can be given by Cooccurrence Frequency, Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1990) or Association Ratio (Resnik, 1992).

Even if most of the techniques for WSD are presented as stand-alone, it is our belief, following the ideas of (McRoy, 1992), that full-fledged lexical ambiguity resolution should combine several information sources and techniques.

Yhrthermore, using only the implicit information contained into the dictionary definitions of LDOCE (Cowie et al., 1992) report a success rate of 47% at a sense level.

(Amsler, 1981), (Vossen and Serail, 1990) ) not only because of its own importance as the backbone of taxonomies, but also because this relation acts as the support of main inheritance mechanisms helping, thus, the acquisition of other relations and semantic features (Cohen and Loiselle, 1988), providing formal structure and avoiding redundancy in the lexicon (Briscoe et al., 1990).
