Introduction
Two ideas currently gaining popularity in spoken dialogue construction are safety critical translation
and pervasive speech-enabled applications. Safety critical, and in particular, medical, applications
have emerged as one of the most popular domains for speech translation. At the first workshop on
medical speech translation, held at HLT 2006, a measure of consensus emerged on at least some
points. The key issue that differentiates the medical domain from most other application areas for
speech translation is its safety-critical nature; systems can realistically be fielddeployed now or in the
very near future; the basic communication model should be collaborative, and allow the client users to
play an active role; and medical systems are often most useful when deployed on mobile devices. This
last point offers a natural link to pervasive computing applications, where spoken language technologies
provide an effective and natural interface for mobile devices in situations where traditional modes of
communication are less appropriate.
However, there is so far little agreement on many central questions, including choices of architectures,
component technologies, and evaluation methodologies. In this workshop we hope that people
interested in these types of application will meet, exchange ideas and demo live systems.
