In the years since the appearance of the first papers on using statistical models for bilingual lexicon compilation and machine translation(Brown et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1993; Church, 1993; Simard et al., 1992), large amount of human effort and time has been invested in collecting parallel corpora of translated texts.

Some of the early statistical terminology translation methods are (Brown et al., 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; Dagan and Church, 1994; Gale and Church, 1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995b).

Attempts at exploring nonparallel corpora for terminology translation are very few (Rapp, 1995; Fung, 1995a; Fung and McKeown, 1997).

Among these, (Rapp, 1995) proposes that the association between a word and its close collocate is preserved in any language, and (Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggests that the associations between a word and many seed words are also preserved in another language.

This approach has also been used by (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al., 1992; Shiitze, 1992; Gale et al., 1993; Yarowsky, 1995; Gale and Church, 1Lunar is not an unknown word in English, Yeltsin finds its translation in the 4-th candidate.

(Rapp, 1995; Fung and McKeown, 1997) suggest that a content word is closely associated with some words in its context.
