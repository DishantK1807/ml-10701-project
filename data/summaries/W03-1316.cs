Recently, support-vector machines (SVMs, (Vapnik, 1995)) have been widely used as fast, effective and reliable means for text-based classification, both for document classification (Joachims, 1998) and classification of specific named entities (Stapley et al., 2002; Kazama et al., 2002).

In the case of term classification, Kazama et al.(2002) used a more exhaustive feature set containing lexical information, POS tags, affixes and their combinations in order to recognise and classify terms into a set of general biological classes used within the GENIA project (GENIA, 2003).
