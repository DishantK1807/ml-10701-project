The framework for the current model is derived from previous work on computational models of verb learning (Fleischman & Roy, 2005).

Similar to Berger & Lafferty (1999), the probability distribution of terms given a category is estimated using a normalized log-likelihood ratio (Moore, 2004), and query terms are sampled randomly from this distribution.

Similar to work in image retrieval (Barnard et al., 2003), we cast the problem in terms of Machine Translation: given a paired corpus of words and a set of video event representations to which they refer, we make the IBM Model 1 assumption and use the expectation-maximization method to estimate the parameters (Brown et al., 1993): ‚àè =+ = m j ajm jvideowordpl Cvideowordp 1 )|()1()|( (1) This paired corpus is created from a corpus of raw video by first abstracting each video into the feature streams described above.
