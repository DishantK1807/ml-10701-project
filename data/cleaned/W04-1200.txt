1:14	COLING 2004 Post-Conference Workshop JNLPBA Proceedings of the International Joint Workshop on Natural Language Processing in Biomedicine and its Applications Edited by Nigel Collier Patrick Ruch Adeline Nazarenko Supported by The SemanticMining Network of Excellence (EU-IST 507505 OFES 03.3399) August 28-29, 2004 University of Geneva, Switzerland i Preface Recent years have seen a growing interest in the application of NLP techniques to texts in the domains of biology and medicine.
2:14	The problem of information overload that has resulted from the massive growth in the scientific literature has clearly shown the necessity to automatically locate, organize and manage facts relating to experimental results.
3:14	At the same time clinicians have experienced greatly improved access to the medical literature and clinical repositories which needs to be matched by the development of enhanced information access tools.
4:14	This year NLPBA (http://www.genisis.ch/~natlang/NLPBA02/) and BioNLP (http://www-tsujii.is.s.utokyo.ac.jp/ACL03/bionlp.htm) have merged to form a joint workshop with the aim of bringing together researchers from natural language processing, bio-informatics, medicine and ontologies who are concerned with developing methods and resources for solving these problems.
5:14	Over the last five years we have seen significant steps forward in the development of language technology and large-scale resources for the Bio-Medical domain such as linguistically annotated corpora (e.g. GENIA POS and NE corpora), ontologies (e.g. Gene Ontology), thesauri (e.g. UMLS Metathesaurus), lexicons and term lists (e.g. UMLS SPECIALIST) as well as information retrieval collections (e.g. TREC Genomics track).
6:14	At the application level we see development of question answering systems, event recognition, zone (rhetorical region) identification, as well as term and bio-entity recognition.
7:14	The demand for information access tools from domain users is increasing to support literature survey, often integrated into online portals where scientists can navigate through related information resources such as genetics and disease databases.
8:14	Ongoing challenges relate to the growing and ambiguous nomenclature, the need to integrate deep knowledge sources into machine learning, a need to scale up methods for processing full text articles etc. The objective of the workshop is to bring together researchers in this area, to establish common themes and goals between different groups.
9:14	We have seen from previous experience in the natural language learning and information retrieval communities the benefits of sharing resources and developing common evaluation criteria.
10:14	In this workshop we are introducing a special shared task to promote discussion of these issues as well as the objective of integrating machine learning with knowledge resources.
11:14	In getting the workshop program finalized we are very grateful to our program committee for their many efforts under a short time schedule.
12:14	Also we acknowledge the kind support of the COLING-2004 workshop and local organizers as well as the GENIA group at University of Tokyo for their hard work organizing the shared task.
13:14	Finally, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers to the workshop and for helping to give us such a wealth of choice in the final program.
