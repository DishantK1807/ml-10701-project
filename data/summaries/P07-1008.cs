These observable variations can serve as valuable clues not just to the specific senses of words in context (e.g., see Pustejovsky, Hanks and Rumshisky, 2004) but to the underlying ontological structure itself (see Cimiano, Hotho and Staab, 2005).

We have described an approach that can be seen as a functional equivalent to the CPA (Corpus Pattern Analysis) approach of Pustejovsky et al.(2004), in which our goal is not that of automated induction of word senses in context (as it is in CPA) but the automated induction of flexible, context-sensitive category structures.
