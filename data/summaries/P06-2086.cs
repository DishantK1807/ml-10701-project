Recently though, the machine learning systems became state-of-the-art, especially for simpler tagging problems, such as named entity recognition (Bikel, Miller et al.1997), or field extraction (McCallum, Freitag et al.2000). The general idea is that a domain expert labels the target concepts in a set of documents.

Recent IE research with bootstrap learning (Brin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999; Phillips and Riloff 2002; Thelen and Riloff 2002) or learning from documents tagged as relevant (Riloff 1996; Sudo, Sekine et al.2001) has decreased, but not eliminated handtagged training.

Some of the systems are rule-based (Fisher, Soderland et al.1995; Soderland 1999), some are statistical (Bikel, Miller et al.1997; Collins and Miller 1998; Manning and Schutze 1999; Miller, Schwartz et al.1999) and some are based on inductive-logic-based (Zelle and Mooney.
