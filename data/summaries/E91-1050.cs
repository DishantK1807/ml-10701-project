formalism described above has been implemented as part of ISSCO's ELU lÂ°, an enhanced PATR-II style (Shieber, 1986) unification grammar environment, based on the UD system presented by Johnson and Rosner (1989).

In generation, as Shieber (1988) and Appelt (1989) observe, a situation may arise in which the representation supplied as input to the process (perhaps by another program) is not itself directly suitable, but is logically equivalent to one that is.
