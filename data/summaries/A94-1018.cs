It can deal with such problems, and develop plausible explanations quickly since it utilizes the full syntactic context by using an active chart parser (Kay, 1980; Gazdar and Mellish, 1989).
P89-1013
One significant advance in the usage of syntactic knowledge was contained in the technique proposed by Mellish (1989).
P89-1013
Otherthan syntactic knowledge includes grammar specific recovery rules such as recta-rules (Weishedel and Sondheimer, 1983), semantic or pragmatic knowledge which may depend on a particular domain (Carbonell and Hayes, 1983) or the characteristics of the ill-formed utterances observed in human discourse (Hindle, 1983).
P83-1019
Several efforts have been conducted to achieve this objective ((Lang, 1988; Saito and Tomita, 1988), for example).
C88-1075 C88-2118
From some perspectives, the role this phase plays is similar to that of the covered bi-directional phase of the Picky parser (Magerman and Weir, 1992), though the method proposed herein does not employ stochastic information at all.
P92-1006
Also, such a capability could be applied to deal with the ungrammatical sentences and sentence fragments that frequently appear in spoken dialogs (Bear, Dowding and Shriberg, 1992).
