1.Introduction
Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying arguments for a predicate and
assigningsemanticallymeaningfullabelstothem.Asemanticrolerepresentsasemantic
relation between a predicate and one of its arguments. Typical semantic roles include
agent,patient,source,goal,andsoforth,thatarecoretoapredicate,aswellaslocation,
time, manner, cause, and so on, that are peripheral. Such semantic information is im-
portant in answering who, what, when, where,andwhy questions therefore is crucial to
natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question-answering (Narayanan and
Harabagiu 2004), information extraction (Surdeanu et al. 2005), summarization (Melli
etal.2005),andmachinetranslation(Boas2002).AnyNLPtaskthatrequiressomeform

theyoccur.SincetheseminalworkofGildeaandJurafsky(2002),statisticalandmachine
learning approaches have been the predominant research paradigm in semantic role
labeling, like most of the subﬁelds in natural language processing and computational
linguistics. A prerequisite for statistical and machine learning approaches to semantic
role labeling is the availability of a signiﬁcant amount of semantically interpreted
corporafromwhichautomaticsystemscanlearn.Therecentactivitiesinsemanticrole
labeling (Carreras and M`arquez 2004b, 2005; Litkowski 2004) have in large part been
driven by the availability of semantically annotated corpora such as the FrameNet
(Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), Proposition Bank (Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury
2005),andNombank(Meyersetal.2004)projectsforEnglish;thetectogrammaticallayer

forCzech;andtheSalsaProjectforGerman(Burchardtetal.2006).Thesesemantically

PropBank and FrameNet have been the two most widely used corpora in de-
veloping automatic semantic role labeling systems. Although both corpora provide
predicate–argument structure annotation, they use very different semantic role labels,
especially for the core arguments of each predicate. In FrameNet, the semantic roles
of a predicate (called a Lexical Unit (LU)) are organized by semantic frames, which
are conceptual structures that describe a particular situation or event along with their
participants,whicharecalledframeelements(FEs).AllLUsinthesamesemanticframe
share one set of semantic roles. For example, the verbs buy and sell both belong to the
semantic frame Commercial_transaction, which involves a Buyer and Seller exchanging
MoneyandGoods.InadditiontothesefourcoreFEs,therearealsothreeNon-CoreFEs:

LikeFrameNet,PropBankalsoassignssemanticrolelabelstosyntacticconstituents
(rather than to the heads in a dependency structure) in a sentence. Unlike FrameNet,
there is no reference ontology like the semantic frame that provides a general set of
semantic roles. Instead, for the core arguments, the PropBank uses a set of predicate-
speciﬁc semantic role labels represented by an integer preﬁxed by Arg: Arg0 through
Arg5. Predicates vary on the number of core arguments they take, but generally the
totalnumberofcoreargumentsdoesnotexceedsix.Thesecoreargumentsaredeﬁned
in frame ﬁles, with one frame ﬁle for each predicate. Within a frame ﬁle, the core

that it is a modiﬁer argument, followed by a secondary tag indicating the type of
modiﬁer. Secondary tags are for semantic information such as location, manner, and
time that are not speciﬁc to a particular verb or even a particular class of verbs and
they are deﬁned based on a general set of guidelines. There is thus a dichotomy in
the representation of the semantic roles for the core and peripheral arguments in the
PropBankannotation.
The predicate-speciﬁc nature of the PropBank semantic roles is clear when com-
paredwiththeFrameNetFE.In(1b),forexample,thesellerisalwayslabeledSellerand
the buyer is always labeled Buyer in the FrameNet annotation whether the predicate
is buy or sell. In contrast, in the PropBank annotation, the buyer is Arg0 when the
predicateisbuyandArg2whenthepredicateissell.Conversely,thesellerisArg0when
the predicate is sell and Arg2 when the predicate is buy. While FrameNet annotates
the semantic roles of both verbal and nominal predicates, the annotation of PropBank
is limited to verbs, with the nominal predicates annotated in a separate but related
project, the Nombank Project (Meyers et al. 2004). The NomBank Project adopted the
same predicate-speciﬁc approach in representing the core arguments of a predicate as
PropBank,withspecialtreatmentfornoun-speciﬁcphenomenasuchassupportverbs.
There is considerable work on English semantic role labeling with both anno-
tation conventions. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) did their seminal work using data
from FrameNet. The Senseval-3 international competition on semantic role labeling
(Litkowski 2004) also used the FrameNet annotation. There is an even larger body of
work using PropBank because it has a larger amount of annotated data on a well-
established data set, the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).
Using the standard training and test sets in the Penn Treebank, there has been a
rapidimprovementinperformanceduetotheuseofmoreadvancedmachine-learning
techniquesandmoreinformativelinguisticfeatures.Theperformanceusingautomatic
parsesonSection23ofthePennTreebankhasapproached0.81F-score(Pradhan,Ward
et al. 2005). There have also been two consecutive CoNLL competitions (Carreras and
M`arquez2004b,2005)onsemanticrolelabelingusingthePropBankdata.
Research on Chinese semantic role labeling is still in its infancy. Work on Chinese
semantic role labeling has been scant and sporadic, mostly due to the lack of a pub-
licly available semantically annotated corpus of signiﬁcant size. Although most of the
machine-learning techniques used in English semantic role labeling are readily trans-
ferabletoChinese,suchtechnologicaltransferisonlypossiblewithsimilarlyannotated

NotingthatChinesesyntacticparsing
is an especially challenging task, Kwong and T’sou (2005) reformulated semantic role
labeling as a task of detecting and classifying the heads of arguments to avoid the
hard problem of getting the correct text spans for the arguments. In this article, we

The Chinese PropBank and Nombank adopted the English PropBank predicate-
speciﬁc approach in representing the semantic roles of the core arguments. In the
absence of a Chinese linguistic ontology like the semantic frames developed for the
EnglishFrameNetProject,usingthePropBank-styleofsemanticrolesallowsfasterde-
velopment.Thepredicate-speciﬁc approach ofthePropBank annotationbuildsasolid
foundation for making high-level generalizations in a bottom-upmanner, if broader
generalizations are needed. The Chinese PropBank focuses on the context-sensitive
component of the semantic role annotation, using frame ﬁles to guide its annotation.
The semantic roles deﬁned in the frame ﬁles are for expected arguments, that is, all
possible arguments for each frameset of a predicate. In a particular sentence, an ex-
pected argument may not always be realized, and when it is, it may not always be
realizedinthesamesyntacticpositionasaresultofsyntacticalternations(Levin1993)

of arguments that demonstrate different syntactic patterns. Thus, predicate–argument
structure analysis at the PropBank annotation level represents a crucial leap towards
proper representation of semantic structure from the syntactic structure. Should the

UsingthesemanticannotationoftheChinesePropBankandNomBankastraining
and test material, we were able for the ﬁrst time to developa Chinese semantic role
labeling system that is trained and tested on semantically annotated Chinese corpora
ofsigniﬁcantsizes.Usingparsesproduced withdifferentlevelsofautomation (afully
automatic parser, a parser with correct segmentation, a parser with both correct seg-
mentationandPOS-tagging,andtreebankgold-standardparses),wewereabletoquan-
tify the impact of different Chinese language processing components on the semantic
analysis of Chinese predicates. Using a Maximum Entropy–based (McCallum 2002)
machinelearningsystem,ourexperimentalresultsshowthatjustbyusingthefeatures
reported in the English semantic role labeling literature, our baseline system achieved
a very high accuracy on Chinese verbs when the gold-standard treebank parses are
used. This suggests that these features port very well between English and Chinese.
Thereisagradualdegradationinsemanticrolelabelingperformancewithadecreasing
level of human annotation (from gold-standard treebank parses to fully automatic
parses). We were able to achieve a modest improvement with additional features tai-
lored to the Chinese language, bringing the overall accuracy to F1-scores of 0.92 and
0.67, respectively, when using treebank and fully automatic parses. We were able to
achieve a larger improvement on the semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates
by using noun-speciﬁc features (F-scores of 0.70 and 0.57, respectively, for treebank
and fully automatic parses), but our results still show that the semantic role labeling
of nominalized predicates is a much more challenging task than that of verbs. This is
partly due to the smaller training set for nominalized predicates, with the number of
nominalized predicates being less than one third of the number of verb instances in
the same corpus. More importantly, the arguments of nominalized predicates have a

ThePropBank-styleannotationisdesignedtoaccountforsyntacticvariations,that

Examples(2)and(3),wehavealreadyseenwhereessentiallythesamepredicateisreal-

in different syntactic positions. Syntactic variations occur even without the categorial
change of the predicate. Levin (1993) demonstrates extensively how the argument
structure of English verbs can be realized differently through diathesis alternations.

The Chinese PropBank also adds a coarse-grained sense tag to the predicate. The
senses of a predicate are motivated by the argument structure of this predicate and

When it means ”recruit,” two arguments are expected: the recruiter and the entity
recruited. Because each of these senses can be realized in different subcategorization
frames related through syntactic alternations, in the PropBank annotation convention,
these senses are formally called framesets, meaning sets of subcategorization frames
that realize a particular sense. The examples in (6) illustrate two of the framesets

3.SystemOverview
Assuming the availability of a parse tree (either hand-crafted parses in a treebank or
parses generated by an automatic parser) as input, to assign the semantic role labels
describedinSection2automaticallyinvolvesﬁrstofallidentifyingwhichconstituents
intheparsetreearesemanticargumentstothepredicateinquestionandthenassigning
appropriate semantic role labels to them. The predominant approach to the semantic
role labeling task is to formulate it as a classiﬁcation problem (Pradhan, Ward et al.2004;XueandPalmer2004)thatcanbesolvedwithmachine-learningtechniques.One
can imagine a classiﬁcation task in which each constituent in the parse tree is labeled
either with one of the numbered argument labels (Arg0 through Arg5), or with one
of the semantic adjunct labels ArgM-TMP, ArgM-MNR,andsoon,orwiththeNULL
label, indicating the constituent is neither an argument nor adjunct to the predicate.
Thissimpleformulationoftheclassiﬁcationproblemisrarelypracticedinthesemantic
role labeling literature for the simple reason that the majority of the constituents in a
parse tree are generally not related to the predicate in question. For machine-learning
approaches, thismeansthatthenegative samples, constituents thatarelabeled NULL,
would far outweigh the positive samples, constituents that are actual semantic argu-
ments or adjuncts. Such an imbalance would lead to poor performance for machine-
learning systems, so in practice, most semantic role labeling systems work in stages,
whichminimallyconsistofanargumentdetectionstageandanargumentclassiﬁcation
stage. Argument detection is generally formulated as a binary classiﬁcation task that
separatesconstituentsthatareargumentsoradjunctstoapredicatefromthosethatare
not related to the predicate in question. By lumping together argument and adjunct
labels,thepositiveandnegativesampleimbalanceisalleviatedsomewhat.Inaddition,
it has been shown that argument detection and argument classiﬁcation need different
setsoffeatures(XueandPalmer2004).Asystemcannottakeadvantageofthisifboth
are done in one fell swoop. With a powerful machine-learning algorithm, argument
detection can be done with high accuracy (Hacioglu et al. 2004; Pradhan, Ward et al.2004),providedthattheappropriatefeaturesareused.
The positive and negative sample imbalance can only be partially addressed by
havingaseparateargumentdetectionstage.Evenwithabinaryclassiﬁcationtask,the
number of negative samples is still overwhelmingly larger than the positive samples.
Inaddition,itdoesnottakeadvantageofthefactthattheargumentsandadjunctsofa

InthissectionwereportourexperimentsonthesemanticrolelabelingofChineseverbs,
using the Chinese PropBank as training and test material. There are two variables in
our experimental settings. The ﬁrst variable is the level of human annotation in the
syntacticparsesthatserveasinputtooursemanticrolelabelingsystem.Weusedparses
that are fully automatic, parses that assume correct segmentation, parses that assume
correct segmentation as well as POS-tagging, and hand-crafted treebank parses. The
second experimental variable is whether it is known which constituents in the parse

treearearguments.Iftheconstituentsareknown,thesemanticrolelabelingreducesto
a pure classiﬁcation problem where each class is one of the semantic role labels. The
semantic role labeling system only needs to determine what the correct semantic role
should be. If it is unknown which constituents are arguments or adjuncts and which
ones are irrelevant to the predicate in question, the system then needs to ﬁrst ﬁgure
out which constituents, out of all the constituents in the parse tree, are arguments to
the predicate and then decide what the correct semantic role labels should be. We did
notexperimentwithallcombinationsofthesetwovariablesandtheknownconstituent

the conjunct that the predicate does not occur in and all its children are eliminated as
possible arguments to the predicate in question. Punctuation marks at all levels are

4.2Features
One characteristic of feature-based semantic role modeling is that the feature space is
generallylarge.Thisisincontrastwithalow-levelNLPtasksuchasPOStagging,which
generally has a small feature space. A wide range of features have been shown to be
usefulinpreviousworkonsemanticrolelabeling(GildeaandJurafsky2002;Pradhan,
Wardetal.2004;XueandPalmer2004)andwesuspectthatmanymorewillbetested
before the ﬁeld will settle down to a core set of features. In their preliminary work on
Chinese semantic role labeling, Sun and Jurafsky (2004) successfully ported a number
of the features used in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) to Chinese. In our experiments we
adapted more features that have been described in recent work on English semantic
role labeling to Chinese. We used a combination of features from Gildea and Jurafsky
(G&J) (2002), Pradhan, Ward et al. (P et al.) (2004), and Xue and Palmer (X&P) (2004),
andtheseareusedasbaselinefeatures.Inaddition,weproposedasetofnewfeatures

rolelabelmayoccurinsometypicalpositions.Forexample,themajorityoftheadjuncts,

constituentinfocustothepredicate,representsamore”ﬁne-grained”position.Whereas
the values for the simple position feature are just BEFORE or AFTER, the values for
the path feature can represent syntactic notions like subject or object. For example, a
237
ComputationalLinguistics Volume34,Number2
subject may be represented as ”NP↑IP↓VP↓VV” and an object may be represented as
”VV↑VP↓NP.” Intuitively, path features are more informative than simple position
features but they are also sparse because they are more speciﬁc. The path feature
provestobeparticularlyeffectivefortheargumentdetectiontask,whichisperhapsnot
unexpected.AswehaveshowninSection4.1,theargumentsandadjunctsofapredicate
tendtobepopulatedalongthespineofaparsetreeanchoredbythepredicate,andthis
informationiscapturedverynicelybythepathfromthepredicatetotheconstituentin
question.
The head word and its part of speech are clearly informative for semantic role
labeling. For example, a noun phrase headed by_d_1066_d_2102(”today”) is very likely to be a
temporalelement;soisaprepositionalphrasewiththeheadword_d_1943(”at”).However,
for prepositional phrases, the preposition is not always the most informative element.
Sometimes the head word of its NP complement is more predictive of the semantic
category. For example, in the prepositional phrase _d_1943(”at”) _d_1487_d_1048(”Beijing”), the NP
head _d_1487_d_1048(”Beijing”) is more telling of the fact that it indicates a location. So for
prepositionalphrasesweuseboththeprepositionandtheheadnounasfeaturesinour
system. As has been discussed by Sun and Jurafsky, the head word feature also tends
to be sparse, especially given the smaller size of the Chinese Treebank. The chance of
seeing a word in the test data that also occurs in the training data is small. The POS
tag serves as one form of backoff: Constituents headed by words that have the same
part-of-speecharelikelytoreceivethesamesemanticrolelabelsaswell.
Thesubcatfeature,asimplementedinpreviouswork(GildeaandJurafsky2002),is

As we pointed out in Section 2, the argument labels in the PropBank annotation
are verb-speciﬁc. Given a head word or phrase type, the system will be more certain
of the semantic role label when it also knows what the predicate is. The same head
wordorphrasetypemaybeassociatedwithdifferentsemanticrolelabelsfordifferent
predicates. The head word + predicate and the phase type + predicate features are
designedtocapturethislinguisticintuition.Theothertypeofcombinationfeaturesare
verb class+head word and verb class+phrase type. We will discuss the use of verb
classesasfeaturesindetailinSection4.2.1.
Theﬁrst-word-in-the-constituentandthephraselabeloftheleftsiblingfeaturesare
fromPradhan,Wardetal.(2004)andtheinterestedreaderisreferredtotheirworkfor
an explanation of why these are useful features. Because Chinese is a language with
mixed headedness, namely, some phrases are left-headed and some phrases are right-
headed,theﬁrstwordandlastwordareamorerobustbutsloppierwayofﬁndingthe
headwhenthehead-ﬁndingheuristicsfail.
Someofthelinguisticphenomenathatimpactthesyntacticrealizationofargument

Xue SemanticRoleLabelingofChinesePredicates
of the clause headed by BEI is typically Arg1. In order to capture this information, we
added as features the path from the BEI and BA words to the constituent in focus.
BA and BEI are not predicates themselves, so these features are only invoked for the
predicateinthecomplementclauseoftheBAandBEI.
4.2.1 Using
Verb Classes to Improve Semantic Role Labeling.Withthecurrentexperimental
setup,asisalsothecaseinmostoftheworkonsemanticrolelabeling,trainingdataand
test data are not divided by verb instances but by the number of articles. As a result,
itisexpectedthattheverbinstancesarenotevenlydivided.Itisentirelypossiblethat
someverbscanonlybefoundinthetrainingdataandotherscanonlybefoundinthe
test data. By our count, there are 4,526 verb types in the training data and 1,038 verb
typesinthetestdata.Onehundredseventy-sixverbtypesthatoccurinthetestdataare
absentfromthetrainingdata.Becausethesemanticrolelabelsaredeﬁnedwithregard
to the individual verbs, this can be a real problem because the model learned in the
trainingprocessdoesnotoptimallyﬁtwiththetestdataifdifferentverbsareinvolved.
Fortunately,manyverbshavesimilarargumentstructuresandthereforeareannotated
with similar semantic role labels in the Chinese PropBank. For example, verbs like_d_1448
_d_2101(”enlarge”),_d_1448_d_1432(”makemoredrastic”),_d_1448_d_2697(”accelerate”),_d_1448_d_2623(”strengthen”),_d_1448
_d_3972(”deepen”),_d_1448_d_6705(”accelerate”),_d_1448_d_6869(”givemoreweight”),_d_1448_d_7473(”makehigher”)all
take two arguments, a theme that undergoes a change of state and an external force
or agent that brings about the change of state. These verbs are uniformly annotated
and they all have two numbered arguments with Arg0 denoting the cause and Arg1
denotingthetheme.Itwouldmakesensetogrouptheseverbstogetherintoaclassand
use this information in the features as has been done for English using VerbNet (Yi,

theverbsalongthreedimensions:thenumberofarguments,thenumberofframesets,
andselectedsyntacticalternations.
Number of arguments Verbs in the Chinese PropBank can have one to ﬁve argu-
ments, with the majority of them having one, two, or three arguments. Verbs with
zeroargumentsareauxiliaryverbs

like_d_2678(”will”),_d_2663_d_1084(”beableto”),_d_6300(”should”),
_d_3221(”dare”), _d_1592(”may”), _d_5421(”be willing to”), _d_5468(”can”), _d_5468_d_2098(”can”), _d_7305(”must”), _d_2561
_d_2628(”should”),andsomeotherlightverbs.Verbsthathaveﬁveargumentsarechangeof
state verbs like_d_2592_d_7103(”lengthen”),_d_5267_d_4734(”shorten”),_d_7177_d_1133(”lower”),_d_3103_d_7473(”increase”),
_d_2926_d_2101(”enlarge”), _d_5267_d_2354(”make smaller”). These verbs generally take as arguments a
theme that undergoes the change of state, the original state, the new state, the range
ofthechange,andthecauseoragentthatbringsaboutthechange.
Number of framesets A frameset roughly corresponds to a major sense. This infor-
mation is used because it is common that the different framesets of a verb can have
differentnumbersofarguments.Forexample,verbslike_d_2542_d_6115(”balance”) canbeused
either as a non-stative verb, in which case it means ”balance,” or a stative verb, in
4 Onecouldsaythattheargumentoftheauxiliaryverbistheentireproposition,butinthisphaseofthe
ChinesePropBank,auxiliaryverbsarenotannotated.
239
ComputationalLinguistics Volume34,Number2
which case it means ”balanced.” When it is used as a non-stative verb, it takes two
arguments, the thing or situation that is balanced and the balancer, the entity that
maintainsthebalance.Whenitisusedasastativeverb,obviouslyitonlytakesasingle
argument.
Syntactic alternations We also represent certain types of syntactic alternations. One
salient type of syntactic alternation is the well-known ”subject of intransitive / object
oftransitive”alternationdescribedindetailinLevin(1993).Chineseverbsthatdemon-
stratethisalternationpatterninclude_d_1376_d_4253(”publish”).Forexample,_d_6661(”this”)_d_3378(CL)
_d_1015(”book”)playsthesamesemanticroleeventhoughitisthesubjectin”_d_6661/this_d_3378/CL
_d_1015/book _d_1376_d_4253/publish _d_1021/AS” and the object in ”_d_6661/this _d_2319/CL _d_1376_d_4253/publishing
_d_4840/house_d_1376_d_4253/publish_d_1021/ASP_d_6661/this_d_3378/CL_d_1015/book.”
Thus each verb will belong to a class with a symbol representing each of the
three dimensions. For example, a given verb may belong to the class ”C1C2a,” which
means that this verb has two framesets, with the ﬁrst frameset having one argu-
ment and the second having two arguments. The ”a” in the second frameset repre-
sents a type of syntactic alternation. Forty classes were semi-automatically derived in
thismanner.
Suchaclassiﬁcationschemewillundoubtedlyprovetobelinguisticallyunsophis-
ticated. Verbs that have the same number of arguments may have different types of
arguments, and the current classiﬁcation system does not pick up these distinctions.
However, our experiments show that even such a simple classiﬁcation can be used to
providefeaturesthatimprovethesemanticrolelabelingperformance.
4.3UsingAutomaticParses
Previous work (Sun and Jurafsky 2004) on Chinese semantic role labeling uses a
parser that assumes correct (hand-crafted) segmentation. As word segmentation is
a very challenging problem that has attracted a large body of research by itself, it is
still unclear how well semantic role tagging in Chinese can be performed in realistic
situations. In our experiments, we implemented a Maximum Entropy–based parser
similar to Luo (2003). The parser performs Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging,
and parsing in one integrated system. The parser is trained on the Xinhua news and
BroadcastnewsportionoftheChineseTreebank,whichhas498Kwords.Testedonthe
held-out test data, the parser achieved an unlabeled precision and recall of 0.889 and
0.868, respectively, for the combined word segmentation and parsing accuracy. When
thewordsegmentationissingledoutforevaluation,theparserachievedanF-scoreof
0.969. It is important to point out that these results cannot be directly compared with
most of the results reported in the literature, where correct segmentation is assumed.
Inaddition,inordertoaccountforthedifferencesinsegmentation,eachcharacterhas
to be treated as a leaf of the parse tree. This is in contrast with word-based parsers
where words are terminals. For comparison purposes, we also used the Bikel parser
(Bikel 2004). Because the Bikel parser assumes segmented sentences as input, we
extracted the segmentation from the output of our parser and fed it into the Bikel
parser. We also experimented with using gold-standard segmentation and POS from
theChineseTreebankasinputtotheBikelparsertomeasuretheeffectofsegmentation
and POS tagging on the performance on the semantic role labeling. Because semantic
role labeling is performed on the output of a syntactic parser, only constituents in the

drops about one percentage point. When the arguments are known, the accuracy is
at 94.1% when the new features are used, up one percentage point from the baseline.
This accuracy is fairly high considering the fact that the state-of-the-art for semantic
rolelabelingsystemstrainedontheEnglishPropBank(Palmer,Gildea,andKingsbury
2005) is about 93% percent (Pradhan, Ward et al. 2004; Xue and Palmer 2004) when
the arguments are known and the English PropBank is a much larger corpus that has
one million words. The high baseline accuracy also suggests that the features used
for the English semantic role labeling port very well to Chinese. In addition, there are
severalfacilitatingfactorsforChinesesemanticrolelabelingwhenhand-craftedparses
areprovidedasinput.Firstofall,Chineseverbsappeartobelesspolysemous,atleast
the ones that occur in the Chinese Treebank. Of the 4,854 verbs in this version of the
ChinesePropositionbank,only62verbshavethreeormoreframesets.Incontrast,294
verbsoutofthe3,300verbsinthePennEnglishPropBankhavethreeormoreframesets.
Whenaverbislesspolysemous,theargumentsoftheverbtendtoberealizedinamore
uniform manner in syntax. As a result, the argument labels are easier to predict from
their structure. Chinese seems to compensate forthis factby using a larger number of
verbs. This becomes obvious when we consider the fact that the 4,854 verbs are from
just 250K words and the 3,300 verbs in the English PropBank are from one million
words. A related fact is that adjectives in Chinese are traditionally counted as verbs
andtheygenerallyhaveonlyoneargumentwithamuchsimplersyntacticrealization.
For example,_d_1188_d_2303(”inexpensive”) and_d_5910(”thin”) are considered stative verbs in the
ChineseTreebank.
Wealsobelievethatamoresubtleexplanationforthehighersemanticrolelabeling
accuracy given the annotation of the Chinese Treebank is the fact that the Chinese
Treebankhasricherstructure(seeXueetal.[2005]foracomparisonofthePennEnglish
TreebankandtheChineseTreebank).Byusinglessﬂatandmorehierarchicalstructures,
theChineseTreebankresolvessomeoftheattachmentambiguitiesthatimpairsemantic

ThisapparentadvantageinChinesesemanticrolelabelingisdiminishedwhenan
automatic parser is used. First of all, the hierarchical structures in the hand-crafted
parses that aid semantic role labeling are hard to recover with an automatic parser.
Resolving the many attachment ambiguities caused by the hierarchical structures in
languageisoneofthemostdifﬁcultproblemsintheparsingliterature.ParsingChinese
in a realistic scenario is especially difﬁcult given that it has to build structures from

5.SemanticRoleLabelingofNominalizedPredicates
In this section, we describe our experiments on nominalized predicates in Chinese,
using the Chinese NomBank as training and test data. In Section 5.1 we show that
the pruning algorithm for nominalized predicates needs to account for two disjoint
cases. When a support verb is present, the pruning algorithm needs to go outside
the NP headed by the predicate to search for potential arguments. When there is no
support verb, the arguments can generally be found inside the NP headed by the
predicate.InSection5.2,wedescribethefeaturesusedinthesemanticrolelabelingof
nominalizedpredicates.Therearethreegroupsoffeatures:featuresusedinthesemantic
role labeling of verbs minus a few features that do not carry over to nouns, features
used for verbs that need to be substantially adapted, and new features we designed
speciﬁcallyfornominalizedpredicates.Theexperimentsweconductedonnominalized
predicates largely parallel those of verbs, for an easier comparison. Again there are
twoexperimentalvariables,thelevelofhumanannotationintheinputtothesemantic
role labeling system and whether the constituents for the arguments are known. The
experimentalresultsarepresentedinSection5.3.
5.1PruningforNominalizations
Like verbal predicates, the arguments and adjuncts of a nominalized predicate are
relatedtothepredicateitselfinlinguisticallywell-understoodstructuralconﬁgurations.
As we pointed out in Section 2, most of the arguments for nominalized predicates are
insidetheNPheadedbythepredicateunlesstheNPistheobjectofasupportverb,in
whichcaseitsargumentscanoccuroutsidetheNP.Typicallythesubjectofthesupport
verb is also an argument of the nominalized predicate, as illustrated in Example (3).
Themajorityoftheconstituentsarenotrelatedtothepredicateinquestion,especially
becausethesentencesinthetreebanktendtobeverylong.Therearetwodistinctcases
thatneedtobehandleddifferently,dependingonthepresenceorabsenceofasupport
verb for the nominalized predicate. When the nominalized predicate does not occur
withasupportverb,generallyallofitsargumentsarerealizedwithintheNPofwhich
it is the head. The pruning algorithm starts from the predicate, collects its sisters, and
adds them to the candidate list. It then iteratively goes upone level and collects the
sisters of that constituent until it reaches the top-level NP of which it is the head. An
exception is made when the constituent is DNP, in which case the candidate added is
the ﬁrst daughter of the DNP, not the DNP itself. This is illustrated in Example (9),

When a nominalized predicate occurs with a support verb, the NP headed by the
nominalizedpredicateisgenerallytheobjectofthesupportverb.Argumentscanoften
be found both inside and outside this object NP. The pruning algorithm starts from
the nominalized predicate and collects its sisters. It then iteratively goes one level up
until it reaches the top-level IP node. At each level, the sisters of the current node are
added to the list of candidates. Note that the algorithm does not stopat the topNP

Overall, pruning works less effectively for nouns than for verbs. When treebank
parses are used, our pruning algorithm can recall over 94% of the arguments while
pruning out 93% (87,724 out of 93,916) of the nodes. When automatic parses (maxent
segmentation + Bikel parser) are used, our pruning algorithm can recall 73% of the
argumentsoutofthe88%ofargumentsthathaveaconstituentintheparsetree,while
pruningout93%(85,160outof91,356)ofthenodes.However,althoughthereisasmall

used,thereisahugegaininprecision(from0.146to0.623),asimilartrendtothatwhich

5.2Features
The features we use for the semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates fall into
three groups. The baseline features we used are the same features we used for the
semanticrolelabelingofverbs.Thesecondgroupoffeaturesareadaptedfromfeatures
used in the semantic role labeling of verbs. In particular, the path feature is redeﬁned
inthesemanticrolelabelingofnominalizedpredicates.AsigniﬁcantnumberofNPsin

nouns on both sides of a predicate, which is a noun itself, the path from the predicate
to the preceding or following noun has the same value. However, the preceding and
followingnounsdonothavethesameprobabilityofbeinganargument.Wetherefore
needtoclearlymarkthepositionofthepredicate(e.g,P=NN↑NP↓NNisnotthesame
as NN↑NP↓NN=P). Such a problem does not exist for the semantic role labeling of
verbs because their arguments are rarely a verb as well. The third groupof features
are new features we added speciﬁcally for the semantic role labeling of nominalized
predicates. Like the features for the semantic role labeling of verbal predicates, the
featuresforargumentdetectiononlyaremarkedas”D”andthefeaturesforargument

Severalfeaturesthatweusedforthesemanticrolelabelingofverbalpredicateswere
dropped from our experiments with nominalized predicates. Speciﬁcally, the subcat
feature and subcat+ features were not used because it is not clear how these features
can be deﬁned for a nominalized predicate. A couple of new features were added
to the feature set for semantic role labeling of nominalized predicates. As we have
demonstrated in Section 5.1, a support verb to a large extent determines whether or
246
Xue SemanticRoleLabelingofChinesePredicates
not the arguments of a nominalized predicate can occur outside the NP of which it
is the head. Therefore it is effective information for discriminating arguments from
non-arguments.Itisalsoindicativeofthespeciﬁcsemanticroleofanargumentinthe
argumentclassiﬁcationtask.Tocapturethisobservation,weusedacombinedfeatureof

structure with their sisters as their arguments. The sisterhood feature is designed to
capturethisobservationanditisalsousedforbothargumentdetectionandargument

When a nominalized predicate is in the subject position, the NP in the topic position
tends to be its argument. A binary feature is invoked when the constituent in focus is

argument detection. The value for this feature can be before or after the support verb,

5.3Experiments
5.3.1 Data. Our system is trained and tested on a pre-release version of the Chinese
NomBank. This version of the Chinese NomBank consists of standoff annotation on
the ﬁrst 760 articles (chtb_001.fid to chtb_931.fid) of the Chinese Treebank. This
is the same chunk of treebank data as used in our experiments on verbs. It has 1,227
nominalizedpredicatetypesand10,497nominalizedpredicateinstances,incomparison
with the 4,854 verb predicate types and 37,183 verb predicate instances in the same
chunk of data. By instance, the NomBank is between a quarter and one third of the
size of the Chinese PropBank. Similarly to our experiments on verbs, we divide the
training, development, and test data by the number of articles, not by the predicate
instances.Forallourexperiments,weusedthesamedatasplitasthatoftheverbs:648

5.3.2 Results

Compared with the 94.1% for verbal predicates on the same data, the 84.3% the

ized predicates is a much more challenging task. The difference between the semantic
role labeling accuracy for verbal and nominalized predicates is even greater when the

Our system achieves an F-score of 0.696 when treebank parses are used, and this is
in contrast with the F-score of 0.92 for verbal predicates under similar experimental
conditions.
For our experiments using automatic parses, we used the same parsers for nomi-
nalizedandverbalpredicates.Theﬁrstparseristhecharacter-basedMaximumEntropy

correct segmentation and correct segmentation plus correct POS-tagging as input to
the Bikel parser to measure the degradation in performance with decreasing levels of
human annotation. Our results show that the Bikel parser outperforms our Maxent
parser 0.028 (F-score) in semantic role labeling accuracy when using fully automatic

treebank parses are used and when automatic parses are used. There are two possible
explanations. One is that the NP structures are more local and less prone to parsing
errors, so there is less of a difference between treebank and automatic parses. This is
248

consistent with the fact that 88% of the arguments for nominalized predicates were
recoveredbytheparser,incontrastwiththe87%oftheargumentsforverbalpredicates.

5.3.3 Error
Analysis. The much lower accuracy in the semantic role labeling of nomi-
nalized predicates warrants a closer examination. One thing we looked at is the fact
that arguments of nominalized predicates can occur either inside or outside the NP
headed by the predicate. Of the 1,124 predicate instances in the test data, 331 of them
haveargumentsthatoccuroutsidetheNPheadedbythepredicate.Theremaining793
instances have all their arguments inside the NP. We found a signiﬁcant difference in

6.RelatedWork
Computational approaches to semantic interpretation have a long tradition, but the
line of research that this work follows is relatively young. Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)
provided the seminal work on the semantic role labeling, using the FrameNet corpus
as training and test material. Since then, there has been rapid improvement in the se-
manticrolelabelingaccuracyofEnglishverbs,fueledbythedevelopmentofPropBank
(Palmer, Gildea, and Kingsbury 2005), which annotates the verbs in the one-million-
wordPennTreebankwithsemanticrolelabels.Awiderangeofstatisticalandmachine
learning techniques have been applied to the semantic role labeling of verbs, using
PropBankastrainingandtestmaterial.Themachine-learningtechniquesusedinclude
SupportVectorMachines(Pradhan,Wardetal.2004;Tsaietal.2005),MaximumEntropy
(Xue and Palmer 2004; Haghighi, Toutanova, and Manning 2005; Liu et al. 2005; Yi
and Palmer 2005), Conditional Random Fields (Cohn and Blunsom 2005), and many
others. Because semantic role labeling is a complex task based on a wide range of
lowerlevelnaturallanguagetechniques,manydifferentpreprocessing,integration,and
combinationtechniqueshavebeenexplored.Therelativemeritsofusingafullsyntactic
parserthatprovideshierarchicalstructures(XueandPalmer2004)vs.ashallowchunker
(Pradhan, Hacioglu et al. 2005; Hacioglu et al. 2004) has been studied extensively.
Noting that parsing errors are difﬁcult or even impossible to recover at the semantic
249

role labeling stage, Yi and Palmer (2005) experimented with integrating semantic role

etal.(2005),M`arquezetal.(2005),andTsaietal.(2005)pursuedalternativeapproaches
to make their semantic role labeling systems more robust by combining the output of
multiplesystems.Punyakanok,Roth,andYi(2005),inparticular,achievedthebestper-

outputofdifferentsemanticrolelabelingclassiﬁersusingachunkingprocedure.They
also reported the state-of-the-art result (F1 = 0.81) on the standard PropBank test set,
using the same techniques. Most of the early systems consider each argument on its
own when assigning the semantic role labels, allowing the theoretical possibility that
more than one core argument may share the same semantic role label, violating the
linguisticconstraintthatthesamesemanticrolelabelcannotbeassignedtomorethan
onecoreargument.Toutanova,Haghighi,andManning(2005)addressthisbyusinga
joint-learningstrategytoruleoutsuchconﬂictingargumentlabels.
The semantic role labeling performance on the FrameNet data set has also
improved signiﬁcantly from Gildea and Jurafsky’s (2002) early results, thanks mostly
to the Senseval-3 semantic role labeling competition (Litkowski 2004). Participants of
Senseval-3 have used a variety of machine learning algorithms to tackle the semantic
role labeling problem: Maximum Entropy (Baldewein et al. 2004; Ngai et al. 2004;
Kwon, Fleischman, and Hovy 2004); Boosting, SNOW, and Decision Lists (Ngai et al.2004); SVM (Bejan et al. 2004; Moldovan et al. 2004; Ngai et al. 2004); Memory-based
learning(Baldeweinetal.2004),aswellasGenerativemodels(Thompson,Patwardhan,
and Arnold 2004). Bejan et al. (2004) achieved the best result using an SVM classiﬁer
combined with improved linguistic features. They achieved an F1 measure of 0.763 in
theirinternalevaluation,and0.831usingthemorelenientofﬁcialSenseval-3scorer.
Comparedwiththelargebodyofworkonthesemanticrolelabelingonverbs,the
argument structure analysis of nominal predicates has so far received less attention.
Jiang and Ng (2006) reports a semantic role labeling system on nominal predicates,
also using the maximum entropy approach. Their system achieves F1 scores of 0.727
and0.691,respectively,ongold-standardandautomaticparses,indicatingsemanticrole
labeling of nominal predicates is a much more difﬁcult problem than that of verbs for

250

semantic role labeling adopted here represents a departure from this tradition in that
the semantic relations in PropBank and NomBank are predicate-speciﬁc. There is no
serious attempt to induce cross-predicate semantic relations. In addition, the semantic
relationsrepresentedbythePropBank/NomBanksemanticrolesarenotpairwiserela-
tions between the predicate and one of its arguments as they are in previous work. A
thirddifferenceisthattheargumentsofanominalizedpredicatecanbefoundoutside

preliminary work for analyzing the predicate–argument structure of 630 propositions
for 22 nominalizations taken from the Chinese Treebank. Noting the difﬁculty of
Chinese parsing, Kwong and T’sou (2005) approached the semantic role labeling task
as one of identifying and labeling the head word of the arguments. They annotated
the semantic roles for 41 verbs in 980 sentences in a primary school textbook corpus
andthesameverbsin2,122sentencesinanewscorpus.Perhapsnotsurprisingly,they
reported F1 scores of 0.529 and 0.444, respectively, for the textbook and news corpora

when the training and test data are from different corpora. As far as we know, the
work reported here is the ﬁrst to use sizable Chinese semantically annotated corpora.

7.ConclusionsandFutureWork
WehavepresentedtheﬁrstexperimentalresultsonChinesesemanticrolelabelingusing
the Chinese PropBank and the Chinese NomBank. We have shown that given gold-
standard parses, Chinese semantic role labeling can be performed with considerable
accuracyonChineseverbs.Infact,eventhoughtheChinesePropBankisasigniﬁcantly
smaller corpus than the English PropBank, we achieved results that are comparable
withthestate-of-the-artEnglishsemanticrolelabelingsystems.Wesuggestthreefactors
that are particularly conducive to the semantic role labeling of Chinese verbs when
the hand-crafted treebank parses are used as input. One is that Chinese verbs tend
to be less polysemous compared with English, which contributes to a more uniform
mapping between the predicate–argument structure and its syntactic realization. An-
otherfacilitatingfactoristhatstativeverbs,whichgenerallytranslateintoadjectivesin
English,accountforalargeproportionofalltheverbsintheChinesePropBankandthey
tend to have simple argument structures. Finally, we suggest that the richer structure
in the Chinese Treebank makes certain aspects of the semantic role labeling simpler.

ComputationalLinguistics Volume34,Number2
One such example is that the clear structural distinction between syntactic arguments
and adjuncts makes it easier for the semantic role labeling system to differentiate core
argumentsandadjunctsforChineseverbs.Thesealltranslateintolowerconfusability
along the lines of Erk and Pad´o (2005) in the mapping from the syntactic structure to
thesemanticrolelabels.
When the semantic role labeling takes raw text as input, it cannot take advantage
of the rich syntactic structure of the treebank unless it can be reproduced with high
accuracy by an automatic parser. Even though our experiments using fully automatic
parsesyieldpromisinginitialresults,theaccuracyissigniﬁcantlylowerthantheEnglish
stateoftheart.Ourparsingaccuracyishamperedbyasigniﬁcantlysmallertrainingset
that is only half the size of the Penn Treebank. We also suggest that there are a few
inherent linguistic properties of the Chinese language that make syntactic parsing a
particularly challenging task. The ﬁrst has to do with the fact that Chinese text does
notcomewithwordboundariesandourparserhastobuildstructuresfromcharacters
rather than words. The second has to do with the fact that Chinese has very little
inﬂectional morphology that the parser can exploit when deciding the part-of-speech
tags of the words. Both word segmentation and POS-tagging difﬁculties will lead to
parsingerrorswhenlargerphrasestructuresarebuilt.
Ourexperimentalresultsalsoshowasubstantialgapbetweensystemperformance
onverbsandnominalizedpredicates.Thisdifferencecanbepartiallyattributedtothe
smaller corpus size of the Chinese Nombank, with fewer instances of nominalized
predicates than verbs in the underlying Chinese Treebank, but we believe the main
reasonisthatthesemanticrolelabelingismorechallengingfornominalizedpredicates
than for verbs. This again can be explained in terms of confusability in the mapping
fromsyntacticstructuretothepredicate–argumentstructure.Ingeneral,theNPsinthe
ChineseTreebankhaveﬂatterstructurescomparedwithverbs.Forexample,thereisno
clearstructuraldistinctionbetweenargumentsandadjunctsfornominalizedpredicates
that are analogous to the argument/adjunct distinction for verbs. Another reason for
theloweraccuracyfornominalizedpredicatesisthemorediversedistributionoftheir
arguments. Arguments can be found either inside or outside the NP headed by the
predicate,oreveninrelativeclausesthatmodifytheNPheadedbythepredicate.
There are many directions we can go from here for future work. There are many
proven techniques thatcanbeimplemented forChinese,themostimportantofwhich
is to make Chinese parsers more robust. One thing we plan to experiment with is the
combination of multiple parsers and multiple semantic role labeling systems. We also
believethatwehavenotsettledonan”optimal”setoffeaturesforChinesesemanticrole
labeling and more language-speciﬁc customization is necessary. We believe that joint-
learningisalsoapromisingavenuetopursue,especiallyforverbswheregenerallymore
coreargumentsarerealized.
