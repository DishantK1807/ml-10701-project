These resolution rule aspects will not be developed here; though they have been developed in the literature, e.g., see (Carter, 1987), and (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983).

Until now, this kind of constraint has been tackled mainly in terms of syntactic aspects, see (Lappin and Leass, 1994) (Merlo, 1993) and (Hobbs, 1985).
J94-4002
We exploit the focusing mechanism proposed by Sidner (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sialher, 1983) extending and refining her algorithms.
J81-4001
We describe the main elements of the focusing approach that are necessary to understand our method, without going into great detail, see (Sidner, 1979) (Sidner, 1981) (Sidner, 1983).
