We also compared CR to a very different learning strategy: the similarity-based lexical method (Sekine et al.1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998), described in section 2.3.

According to other learning approaches, the linguistic conditions used to characterize requirements may be situated at the lexical level (Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Sekine et al.1992). A pair like bbright, approveÀ, lawÀ matches those expressions containing a form of lemma law (e.g., law,laws,Law,Laws) appearing to the right of the verb approve (to be more precise, to the right of any form of lemma approve).

However, Allegrini, Montemagni, and Pirrelli (2000) define a second clustering step involving significant differences with regard to our Clustering 2.

2. Statistics-Based Methods for Learning Linguistic Requirements During the last years, various stochastic approaches to linguistic requirements acquisition have been proposed (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993; Sekine et al.1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Framis 1995; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1995; Resnik 1997; Dagan, Lee, and Pereira 1998; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000).

Among the works cited above, Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi (1992) has the highest degree of supervision.

Selection restrictions are typically used to capture facts about the world that are generally, but not necessarily, true (Androutsopoulos and Dale 2000).
C00-1003
Similarly to our approach, Allegrini, Montemagni, and Pirrelli (2000) developed an automatic procedure to remove odd words from clusters.
C00-1002
Most works on attachment resolution use as test data only phrase sequences of type vp–np–pp (Sekine et al.1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Reymar, and Roukos 1994; Collins and Brooks 1995; Li and Abe 1998; Niemann 1998; Grishman and Sterling 1994).

Finally, it can be identified as the head or the dependent role within a binary grammatical relationship such as subject, direct object, or modifier (Sekine et al.1992; Grishman and Sterling 1994; Framis 1995).
A92-1014 C94-2119
The most knowledgerich approaches need a handcrafted thesaurus (WordNet) to semantically annotate nouns of the training corpus (Resnik 1997; Framis 1995; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000).
C00-1028 W97-0209
Let us note that these techniques do not allow the acquisition of complete subcategorization frames (Brent 1991; Manning 1993).
P91-1027 P93-1032
In other approaches to requirement learning, linguistic conditions are defined in semantic terms by means of specific tags (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1992; Resnik 1997; Framis 1995).
A92-1013 W97-0209
Finally, Pantel and Lin (2000) offer a hybrid method based on the two basic views on semantic similarity, absolute and relative.

For instance, the method described in Grishman and Sterling (1994) scores a precision of,0.84.

However, some degree of human supervision could be involved in building automatic tools (e.g., a neural tagger in Marques, Lopes, and Coelho [2000]) or linguistic external sources (e.g., WordNet in Resnik [1997]; Framis [1995]; Ciaramita and Johnson [2000]), which are used to annotate the corpus.
C00-1028 W97-0209
For instance, it may serve to solve structural ambiguities (Hindle and Rooth 1993) or to build a subcategorization lexicon (Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000).
J93-1005
Some approaches describe linguistic conditions only at the syntactic level (Hindle and Rooth 1993; Marques, Lopes, and Coelho 2000).
J93-1005
We use a particular weighted version of the Lin (1998) coefficient.
P98-2124 P98-2127
In Beale, Niremburg, and Viegas (1998), hard requirements are named constraints, whereas the term preferences is employed for soft requirements.
P98-2216
Lexical methods provided with similarity-based generalizations are found in Sekine et al.(1992), Grishman and Sterling (1994), and Dagan, Lee, and Pereira (1998).
A92-1014 C94-2119
They are situated, in fact, at the domain-specific level, which is considered more appropriate for use in computational tasks (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).
