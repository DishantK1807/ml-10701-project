Examining the generation of referring expressions realised as definite descriptions one has to mention, first of all, that the problem of selecting the minimal set (in the sense of Griceâ€™s quantity maxim) of object properties needed for an unambiguous description of the referent has exponential computational complexity [Reiter, 1990].

They distinguish three types of preciseness, i.e. precise, imprecise, or very imprecise pointing, and integrate pointing into the graph-based algorithm proposed by [Krahmer et al., 2003].
J03-1003
Only [Krahmer and van der Sluis, 2003] integrate pointing and definite descriptions in a more natural way and account for vague pointing.

Several approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, namely [Dale, 1992; Krahmer et al., 2003; Horacek, 1997; Gardent, 2002].
