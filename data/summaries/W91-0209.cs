Whilst this account of the division of labour between default but circumscribed linguistic processes and more open-ended inference remains attractive, the treatment of coercion in this case as a unary syntactic rule, or in Pustejovsky's (1989c) alternative account as a lexical rule, seems inadequate.
E89-1000
As with the metonymic cases (Pustejovsky, 1989c; Briscoe et al., 1990), we believe that the notion of coercion during syntactic and semantic interpretation provides an account of when a metaphorical interpretation will be adopted, and we would like to characterise coercion in terms of possible mappings defined by lexical rules.

In Briscoe et al.(1990) we offered an account of logical metonymies such as that involved in the interpretation of "Bill enjoyed / regretted that paper", drawing on Pustejovsky (1989a), in which a unary syntactic rule is used to coerce the entity-denoting NP "that paper" into an event-denoting NP with an underspecified predicate.

We assume a similar account of the overriding of default interpretations with these types of example as we offered in the case of logical metonymies (Briscoe et al., 1990).

This process seems to involve the foregrounding of one component of the meaning of the place denoting word we follow Pustejovsky (1989a,b,c) in assuming that the lexical semantic representation of nouns includes information about typical relations which the objects they denote enter into; in particular, the "qualia structure" for such nouns will contain (telic) information which allows direct access to the information that they are inhabited.
E89-1000
Pustejovsky (1989a) argues that in examples such as a), b) or c) "long" will have an interpretation in which it modifies the telic or agentive role of "book" because it is an event modifier.

Our account contrasts with that of, say, Hobbs et al.(1987) who posit an underspecified and impoverished lexical semantic representation which is enriched through an open-ended process of abductive or deductive reasoning with world (or domain) knowledge.

By contrast, an account such as that of Hobbs et al.(1987) has difficulty explaining why the default interpretation is adopted in the absence of contextual information, unless the effects of lexical organisation are reconstructed in terms of weightings encoding preferences amongst inferences.

"John enjoyed the film", John finished the beer") can, at least given the analyses of Pustejovsky (1989c) and Briscoe et al.(1990). Finally, processes of conversion and derivation can be identical; for example, both "purchase" and "replace" have deverbal nominal forms "purchase" and "replacement", both nouns can denote the action involved and take appropriate complements ("Bill's purchase of his new car", "Bill's replacement of John with Mary"), and both can denote the result of the action ("Bill's purchases were many and varied....
