Current trends in biomedical natural language processing:
the view from computational linguistics

Background
Research in computational linguistics in the biomedical domain traditionally focuses on two major
areas: fundamental advances in language processing; and application of language processing methods
to bridge the gap between basic biomedical research, clinical research, and translation of both types of
research into practice. Several conferences provide opportunities for discussion of these two types of
research in specific sub-domains of Biomedical Natural Language Processing. For example, Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) and its associated special interest group and Pacific Symposium
on Biocomputing (PSB) focus on NLP research applied to issues of interest to biologists, whereas
American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) is concerned with medical informatics issues.
Rather than focusing on a specific area of interest, ACL BioNLP workshop strives to provide a forum
for any important, new, and exciting research in the field of Biomedical Natural Language Processing.
Rather than focusing on a specific theme as we have in previous years, the goal of the workshop this
year was to solicit work of interest to NLP researchers on any topic in the biomedical domain.
Submissions, acceptance, and themes
Asking researchers to share their interests was rewarded by 34 submissions (5 posters and 19 full
papers). Of those, 10 were accepted as full papers and 18 as poster presentations. The combined
expertise of the program committee allowed for providing three thorough reviews for each paper. The
exceptionally high quality manuscripts accepted for presentation cover a wide area of subjects in clinical
and biological areas, as well as methodological issues applicable to both sublanguages.
Named entity recognition (NER) continues to be an active area of research. NER research presented
here involves development of new statistical and hybrid approaches to identification and disambiguation
of gene [1], protein [2], chemical names [3], and clinical entities.
Overwhelmingly, researchers chose statistical or hybrid approaches to the tasks at hand. This is
probably the reason for growing interest in creation of annotated corpora [4], development of methods
for augmenting the existing annotation [5], speeding up the annotation process [5], and reducing its cost;
evaluating the comparability of results obtained applying the same methods to different collections [6],
And increasing compatibility of different annotations [7].
Increasingly sophisticated relation extraction methods [6, 8] are being applied to a broader set of
iii
relations [9]. Other steps towards deeper understanding of the text include methods for creation of
gene profiles [10], identification of uncertainty [11], discourse connectivity [12], and temporal features
of clinical conditions [13].
The applicability of NLP methods to clinical tasks is explored in the work on identification of language
impairments [14] and seriousness of suicidal attempts [15].
Finally, application of NLP methods to classic information retrieval problems such as automatic
indexing of biomedical literature [16] and the newer information retrieval problem of image
retrieval [17] are explored.
Acknowledgments
Organizing the BioNLP workshop is an extremely gratifying experience. We are indebted to the authors
who chose to submit their high quality research covering a variety of interesting topics to this workshop.
Our main hurdle was the selection of oral presentations, in which we relied on the thoughtful and
thorough reviews provided by the program committee. We thank the ACL organizers for their help
and clarifications on numerous issues. Last, but not least our thanks go to the workshop sponsors:
The Computational Medicine Center and Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center and The UK National Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM).
