A number of nonconcatenative grammar formalisms has been put forward, such as head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extraposition grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981).

introducing extraposition grammars in (Pereira, 1981), is focused on displacement of noun phrases in English.

Other non-concatenative formalisms are head-wrapping grammars (HG) (Pollard, 1984), extraposition grammars (XG) (Pereira, 1981) and various exotic forms of tree adjoining grammar (Kroch and Joshi, 1986).

This makes it possible to allow a topicalized NP only if somewhere to its right there is an unfilled trace: S --~ Topic S Topic . . . XP --* NP While XG allows for elegant accounts of cross-serial dependencies and topicalization, it seems again hard to simultaneously account for verb and noun movement, especially if the bracketing constraint introduced in (Pereira, 1981), which requires that XG derivation graphs have a planar representation, is not relaxed.
