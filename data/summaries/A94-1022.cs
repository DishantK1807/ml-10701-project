Annotating sub-constituents with grammatical relations regularizes the syntactic structure with respect to particular grammatical rules, and allows a "relation-torelation" form of compositionality, as opposed to the more traditional "rule-to-rule" version that is exemplified by such systems as Gemini (Dowding et al, 1993) and the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992).

Because the Semantic Linker uses the same set of realization rules as the rest of the system, when the system is ported to a new domain the Semantic Linker can be used immediately a distinct advantage over some other approaches to fallback understanding, such as (Stallard and Bobrow, 1992) or (Jackson et al, 1991).

Conventional approaches to subcategorization, such as Definite Clause Grammar (Pereira and Warren, 1980), Categorial Grammar (Ades and Steedman, 1982), PATR-II (Shieber, 1986), and lexicalized TAG (Schabes et al, 1988) all deal with complementation by including in one form or another a notion of "subcategorization frame" that specifies a sequence of complement phrases and constraints on them.

3 Ill-Formedness Handling: The Semantic Linker When an utterance cannot be parsed with Delphi's bestfirst parser (Bobrow, 1991) either because it is illformed, mis-recognized by the speech system, or simply because it is outside the coverage of the grammar it can still be partially understood by the system, often well enough to give the correct response.

The component responsible for partial understanding in the Delphi system is called the Semantic Linker (Stallard and Bobrow, 1993).

133 Subcategorization constraints in Delphi are encoded in lexical entries using a structure called a "map" (Stallard and Bobrow, 1991).
