For instance, the Estonian-English part of the Ispra JRC-Acquis corpus1 and the parallel corpus of the University of Tartu2 have 2 thousand common source articles (Kaalep and Veskis, 2007). Also the Hunglish corpus (Varga et al., 2005) contains both EU legislation texts (potentially overlapping with JRC-Acquis) and movie subtitles (potentially overlapping with the OPUS corpus). We use</context>
<context> method introduced in this paper is to process two parallel corpora that have common source documents. Finding these common documents is treated as a separate task and is discussed, for instance, in (Kaalep and Veskis, 2007). The method works by finding a correspondence between the sentence pairs of both parallel corpora; see figure 1 for an illustrative example. Having such a correspondence determined, it can be furthe</context>

Approximate Sentence Matching (Kaalep and Veskis, 2007) use Levenshtein distance and check whether the distance between two sentences doesn’t exceed 1% of the average length of the two sentences.

The aim here was to obtain a common corpus with maximum size; therefore both the matching and the unique sentences were included from both input corpora. In order to include some sentences from ali</context>

Introduction The number and sizes of available parallel corpora keep growing – e.g. the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) has doubled and the JRC-Acquis corpus (Steinberger et al., 2006) – tripled during 2007; recently a multilingual parallel corpus of movie subtitles was announced as part of the OPUS corpus (Tiedemann</context>
