Bagga and Baldwin (1998) describe a technique for crossdocument coreference which involves extracting the set of all sentences containing expressions in a coreference chain for a specific entity (e.g.

in the LaSIE system The LaSIE system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) has been designed as a general purpose IE system which can conform to the MUC task specifications for named entity identification, coreference resolution, IE template element and relation identification, and the construction of scenario-specific IE templates.

The overall contributions of these stages may be briefly described as follows (see (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) for further details): lexical preprocessing reads and tokenises the raw input text, performs phrasal matching against lists of proper names, identifies sentence boundaries, tags the tokens with parts-of-speech, performs morphological analysis; parsing and semantic interpretation builds lexical and phrasal chart edges in a feature-based formalism then does two pass chart parsing, pass one with a special named entity grammar, pass two with a general grammar, and, after selecting a 'best parse', which may have only partial coverage, constructs a predicate-argument representation of each sentence; discourse interpretation adds the information from the predicate-argument representation to a hierarchically structured semantic net which encodes the system's world and domain model, adds additional information presupposed by the input, performs coreference resolution between new and existing instances in the world model, and adds any information consequent upon the new input.
