General, automated techniques that could supply this requirement are becoming increasingly available (Morin and Jacquemin 1999, for example).

The SPECIALIST minimal commitment parser relies on the SPECIALIST Lexicon as well as the Xerox stochastic tagger (Cutting et al.1992). The output produced is in the tradition of partial parsing (Hindle 1983, McDonald 1992, Weischedel et al.1993) and concentrates on the simple noun phrase, what Weischedel et al.(1993) call the "core noun phrase," that is a noun phrase with no modification to the right of the head.

Several approaches provide similar output based on statistics (Church 1988, Zhai 1997, for example), a finite-state machine (AitMokhtar and Chanod 1997), or a hybrid approach combining statistics and linguistic rules (Voutilainen and Padro 1997).
