If this is felt to be problem, then ~estricting (in the sense of (Shieber 1985)) the subsumption test in the second half of Definition 3 to ignore the values of certain features, i.e. pred, would bepstraight-forward.

van Noord (1990) discusses allowing a limited form of extension, essentially to fill in atomic-valued features.
C90-2052
If a transfer component is included in the approaches I'm concerned with, as in van Noord (1990), its rules function to elaborate the product of analysis, not replace it, and they could without loss of generality be incorporated into the source and/or target grammars.
C90-2052
lIn this we follow Wedekind (1988), where we use X/x for an arbitrary underlying form, as he uses Â¢/~ for f-structure and Z/a for sstructure.
C88-2150
2Again our T is similar to Wedekind (1988)'s adequacy condition C.
C88-2150
It is just this sort of seems to be required for see for example Sadler and Thompson (1991) and the discussion therein of Kaplan et al.(1989), where X for the desired target arises as a side effect of the analysis of the source, and Xs is additionally constrained by the target language grammar 3.

II. WEAKER FORMULATIONS Work on translation (Sadler and Thompson 1991) suggests that a less strict definition of T is required.
E91-1051
As far as I know, aside from a few parenthetical remarks by various authors, only van Noord (1990) addresses the issue of alternative adequacy conditions--I will place his suggestion in its relevant context below.
C90-2052
Note that for Wedekind (1988) this move amounts to removing the coherence requirement, which prevents the addition of additional information during generation.
C88-2150
THEORY-BASED TRANSLATION As mentioned above, the need to consider more carefully the nature of the adequacy conditions for the generation relation has arisen from developments in theory-based translation (Kaplan et al.1989, Sadler and Thompson 1991, van Noord 1990).

53 Wedekind 1988, Momma and DSrre 1987, Shieber, van Noord, Pereira and Moore 1990, Estival 1990, Gardent & Plainfoss~ 1990) have taken the adequacy condition T to be strict isomorphism, possibly of some formalismspecific sub-part of the structures Xs and X, e.g. the f-structure part in the case of Wedekind (1988) and Momma and DSrre (1987).
