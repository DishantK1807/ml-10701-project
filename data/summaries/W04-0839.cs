However, inclusion of such features has been shown to improve accuracies (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004).

However, both (Pedersen, 2001a) and (Lee and Ng, 2002) show that different learning algorithms produce similar results and that the use of appropriate features may dramatically improve results.

Prior research (e.g., (McRoy, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002)) suggests that use of both syntactic and lexical features will improve disambiguation accuracies.

We have shown earlier (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004) that there is indeed large complementarity between lexical and syntactic features by experiments on line, hard, serve, interest, SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 data.

Further, some of the work (e.g., (McRoy, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996)) suggests that using both kinds of features may result in significantly higher accuracies as compared to individual results.

(Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004) show results to the same conclusions for SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 data that have similar low training data per task, while, the line, hard, serve and interest data which have much larger training data per task are shown to benefit from a larger context.

They are derived from the Duluth systems that participated in SENSEVAL-2, and which are more fully described in (Pedersen, 2001b).
