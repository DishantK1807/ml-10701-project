Recently, researchers have developed other tools for automatically tagging aspects of TimeML, including EVENT (Sauri et al.2005) at 0.80 F-measure and TIMEX3 6 tags at 0.82-0.85 F-measure.

Finally, (Lapata and Lascarides 2004) use found data to successfully learn which (possibly ambiguous) temporal markers connect a main and subordinate clause, without inferring underlying temporal relations.

In terms of hand-coded approaches, (Mani and Wilson 2000) used a baseline method of blindly propagating TempEx time values to events based on proximity, obtaining 59.4% on a small sample of 8,505 words of text.

(Mani et al.2003) obtained 80.2 F-measure training a decision tree on 2069 clauses in anchoring events to reference times that were inferred for each clause.

(Berglund et al.2006) use a document-level evaluation approach pioneered by (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2000), which uses a distinct evaluation metric.

(Li et al.2004) obtained 78-88% accuracy on ordering within-sentence temporal relations in Chinese texts.

A wealth of prior research by (Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang and Schubert 1992), (Kamp and Reyle 1993), (Lascarides and Asher 1993), (Hitzeman et al.1995), (Kehler 2000) and others, has explored the different knowledge sources used in inferring the temporal ordering of events, including temporal adverbials, tense, aspect, rhetorical relations, pragmatic conventions, and background knowledge.

However, rather than hand-creating lexical rules and running into the same limitations as with GTagâ€™s rules, we used an empiricallyderived resource called VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004), available at http://semantics.isi.edu/ocean.

Machine learning results using unclosed and closed data 3.2 Expanding Training Data using Temporal Reasoning To expand our training set, we use a temporal closure component SputLink (Verhagen 2004), that takes known temporal relations in a text and derives new implied relations from them, in effect making explicit what was implicit.
