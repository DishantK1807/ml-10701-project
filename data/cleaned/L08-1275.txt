Introduction The research in natural language processing (NLP) for Thai has so far concentrated only within morphological analysis (i.e. word segmentation (Aroonmanakun, 2002; Sornlertlamvanich, 1993; Meknavin et al., 1997; Kawtrakul and Thumkanon, 1997), part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Murata et al., 2002) or both (Kruengkrai et al., 2006)).

To obtain the probability values from SVMs, we use the probability estimation in LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001). 4. Experimental Results The experiment is done on the first portion of annotated corpus. The corpus consists of 2692 sentences. The sentence length ranges between 2 words to 20 words with an averag</context>

Unlike some languages, most dependency relations are limited to only one direction (e.g., Japanese (Sekine et al., 2000), Turkish (Eryigit and Oflazer, 2006)). The root node can also be found in arbitrary positions (i.e. at the first, last or the middle of the sentence), while the root node of languages that have a single direction of dependency relation</context>

To judge how well our parser performs, we survey some similar works in developi</context>
