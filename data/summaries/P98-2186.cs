In its most general setting, the TBL hypothesis is not a classifier (Brill, 1995).

The most notable methods are based on Hidden Markov Models(HMM)(Kupiec, 1992; Schiitze, 1995), transformation rules(Brill, 1995; Brill, 1997), and multi-layer neural networks(Schmid, 1994).

There~The features I-8 are part of (Brill, 1995) features 1139 fore, the features of the following words will depend on the output tags of the preceding words.

Transformation based learning(TBL) (Brill, 1995) is a machine learning approach for rule learning.

(Brill, 1995) uses lexicon for initial annotation of the training corpus, where each word in the lexicon has a set POS tags seen for the 1138 word in the training corpus.

The SNOW approach has been successfully applied to other problems of natural language processing(Golding and Roth, 1998; Krymolowski and Roth, 1998; Roth, 1998).

There have been attempts to apply neural networks to POS tagging(e.g.,(Schmid, 1994)).
