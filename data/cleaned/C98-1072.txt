Abstract 
A critical path in the development of natural language 
understanding (NLU) modules lles in the difficulty of 
defining a mapping from words to semantics: Usually it 
takes in the order of years of highly-skilled labor to de
velop a semmltic mapping, e.g., in the form of a semantic 
grammar, that is comprehensive enough for a given do
main. Yet, due to the very nature of human language, 
such mappings invariably fail to achieve full coverage oil 
unseen data. Acknowledging the impossibility of stat
ing a priori all the surface forms by which a concept can 
be expressed, we present GSG: an empathic computer 
system for the rapid deployment of NLU front-ends and 
their dynamic customization by non-expert end-users. 
Given a new domain for which an NLU front-end is to 
be developed, two stages are involved. In the author
ing stage, GSG aids the developer in the construction 
of a simple domain model and a kernel analysis gram
mar. Then, in the run-time stage, GSG provides the end
user with an interactive environment in which the kernel 
grammar is dynamically extended. Three lear~ling meth
ods are employed in the acquisition of semantic mappings 
from mmeen data: (i) parser predictions, (ii) tfidden un
derstanding model, and (iii) end-user paraphr~es. A 
baseline version of GSG has been implemented and pre
liminary experiments show promising results. 
1 Introduction

The mapping between words and semantics, be it in 
the form of a semantic grammar, 1 or of a set of rules 
that transform syntax trees onto, say, a frame-slot 
structure, is one of the major bottlenecks in the de
velopment of natural language understanding (NLU) 
systems. A parser will work for any domain but 
the semantic mapping is domain-dependent. Even 
after the domain model has been established, the 
daunting task of trying to come up with all the 
possible surface forms by which each concept can 
1 Semantic
grammars are grammars whose non-terminals 
correspond to semantic concepts (e.g., \[greeting\] or 
\[suggest_time\]) rather than to syntactic constituents (such 
as Verb or IounPhrass). They have the advantage that the 
semantics of a sentence can be directly read off its parse tree, 
and the disadvantage that a new grammar must be developed 
for each domain. 
be expressed, still lies ahead. Writing such map
pings takes in the order of years, can only be per
formed by qualified humans (usually computational 
linguists) and yet the final result is often fragile and 
non-adaptive. 
Following a radically different philosophy, we pro
pose rapid (in the order of days) deployment of NLU 
modules for new domains with on-need basis learn
ing: let the semantic grammar grow automatically 
when and where it is needed. 
2 Grammar
development 
If we analyze the traditional method of developing 
a semantic grammar for a new domain, we find that 
the following stages are involved. 
1. Data collection. Naturally-occurring data from 
the domain at hand are collected. 
2. Design of the domain model. A hierarchical 
structuring of the relevant concepts in the do
main is built in the form of an ontology or do
main model. 
3. Development of a kernel grammar. A grammar 
that covers a small subset of the collected data 
is constructed. 
4. Expansion of grammar coverage. Lengthy, ar
duous task of developing the grammar to extend 
its coverage over the collected data and beyond. 
5. Deployment. Release of the final grammar for 
the application at hand. 
The GSG system described in this paper aids all but 
the first of these stages: For the second stage, we 
have built a simple editor to design and analize the 
Domain Model; for the third, a semi-automated way 
of constructing the Kernel Grammar; for the fourth, 
an interactive environment in which new semantic 
mappings are dynamically acquired. As for the fifth 
(deployment), it advances one place: after the short 
initial authoring phase (stages 2 and 3 above) the 
final application can already be launched, since the 
semantic grammar will be extended, at run-time, by 
the non-expert end-user.

3.1 Authoring
stage 
In the authoring stage, a developer 2 creates the Do
main Model (DM) with the aid of the DM Editor. 
In our present formalism, the DM is simply a di
rected acyclic graph in which the vertices correspond 
to concept-labels and the edges indicate concept
subconcept relations (see Fig. 2 for an example). 
Once the DM is defined, the Kernel Grammar Ed
itor drives the development of the Kernel Grammar 
by querying the developer to instantiate into gram
mar rules the rule templates derived from the DM. 
For instance, in the DM in Fig. 2, given that con
cept \[suggest_timeS requires subconcept \[time\], 
the rule template I'suggest_time\] +--\[time\] is 
generated, which the developer can instantiate into, 
say, rule (2) in Fig. 3. 
The Kernel Grammar Editor follows a concrete
to-abstract ordering of the concepts obtained via a 
topological sort of the DM to query the developer, 
after which the Kernel Grammar is complete 3 and 
2Understood here as a qualified person (e.g., knowledge 
engineer or software developer) who is familiar with the do
main at hand and has access to some sample sentences that 
the NLU front-end is supposed to understand. 
3We say that grammar G is complete with respect to do
main model DM if and only if for each arc from concept i to 
concept j in DM there is at least one grammar rule headed 
by concept i that contains concept j. This ensures that any 
idea expressible in DM has a surface form, or, seen it from 
another angle, that any in-domaln utterance has a paraphrase

the NLU front-end is ready to be deployed. 
It is assumed that: (i) after the authoring stage 
the DM is fixed, and (ii) the communicative goal of 
the end-user is expressible in the domain. 
3.2 Run-time stage 
Instead of attempting "universal coverage" we rather 
accept the fact that one can never know all the sur
face forms by which the concepts in the domain can 
be expressed. What Gs6 provides in the run-time 
stage are mechanisms that allow a non-expert end
user to "teach" the meaning of new expressions. 
The tight coupling between the SouP parser 4 and 
the IDIGA s environment allows for a rapid and multi
faceted analysis of the input string. If the parse, or 
rather, the paraphrase automatically generated by 
GsG 6, is deemed incorrect by the end-user, a learn
ing episode ensues. 
that is covered by G.

the first author incorporating heuristics to, in this order, max
imize coverage, minimize tree complexity and maximize tree 
probability. 
SAcronym for interactive, distributed, incremental gram
mar acquisition. 
6In order for all the interactions with the end-user to be 
performed in natural language only, a generation grammar 
is needed to transform semantic representations into surface 
forms. To that effect GSG is able to cleverly use the analysis 
grammar in "reverse." 
By bringing to bear contextual constraints, GSG 
can make predictions as to what a sequence of un
parsed words might mean, thereby exhibiting an 
"empathic" behavior toward the end-user. To this 
aim, three different learning methods are employed: 
parser predictions, hidden understanding model, 
and end-user paraphrases. 
3.2.1 Learning

Similar to Lehman (1989), learning in GSG takes 
place by the dynamic creation of grammar rules that 
capture the meaning of unseen expressions, and by 
the subsequent update of the stochastic models. Ac
quiring a new mapping from an unparsed sequence 
of words onto its desired semantic representation in
volves the following steps. 
1. Hypothesis formation and filtering. Given the 
context of the sentence at hand, GsG constructs 
hypotheses in the form of parse trees that cover 
the unparsed sequence, discards those hypothe
ses that are not approved by the DM 7 and ranks 
the remaining by likelihood. 
2. Interaction with the end-user. The ranked hy
potheses are presented to the end-user in the 
form of questions about, or rephrases of, the 
original utterance. 
3. Dynamic rule creation. If the end-user is sat
isfied with one of the options, a new grammar 
rule is dynamically created and becomes part 
of the end-user's grammar until further notice. 
Each new rule is annotated with the learning 
episode that gave rise to it, including end-user 
ID, time stamp, and a counter that will keep 
track of how many times the new rule fires in 
successful parses, s 
3.2.2 Parser
predictions 
As suggested by Kiyono and Tsujii (1993), one can 
make use of parse failures to acquire new knowledge, 
both about the nature of the unparsed words and 
about the inadequacy of the existing grammar rules. 
GSG uses incomplete parses to predict what can 
come next (i.e. after the partially-parsed sequence 
7I.e., parse trees containing concept-subeoncept relations 
that are inconsistent with the stipulations of the DM. 
8The degree of generalization or level of abstraction that 
a new rule should exhibit is an open question but currently a 
Principle of Maximal Abstraction is followed: 
(a) Parse the lexical items of the new rule's right-hand-side 
with all concepts granted top-level status, i.e., able to 
stand at the root of a parse tree. 
(b) If a word is not covered by any tree, take it as is into 
the final rlght-hand side. Else, take the root of the parse 
tree with largest span; if tie, prefer the root that ranks 
higher in the DM. 
For example, with the DM in Fig. 2 and the grammar in Fig. 3, 
What about Tuesdayf is abstracted to the maximally general 
what about \[time\] (as opposed to what about \[day_of_week\] 
or what about \[p0int'l).

in left-to-right parsing, or before the partially-parsed 
sequence in right-to-left parsing). This allows two 
kinds of grammar acquisition: 
1. Discovery of expression equivalence. E.g., with 
the grammar in Fig. 3 and input sentence What 
about Tuesday afternoon? GSG is able to ask 
tile end-user whether the utterance means the 
same as How about Tuesday afternoon? (See 
Figs. 4, 5 and 6). That is because in the pro
cess of parsing What about Tuesday afternoon? 
right-to-left, the parser has been able to match 
rule (2) in Fig. 2 up to about, and thus it 
hypothesizes the equivalence of what and how 
since that would allow the parse to complete. 9 
2. Discovery of an ISA relation. Similarly, from 
input sentence How about noon? Gs6 is able 
to predict, in left-to-right parsing, that noon is 
a \[time\]. 
3.2.3 Hidden
understanding model 
As another way of bringing contextual information 
to bear in the process of predicting the meaning 
9For real-world grammars, of, say, over 1000 rules, it is 
necessary to bound the number of partial parses by enforcing 
a maximum beam size at the left-hand side level, i.e., placing 
a limit on tile number of subparses under each nouterminal 
to curb the exponential explosion.

of unparsed words, the following stochastic models, 
inspired in Miller et al. (1994) and Seneff (1992), 
and collectively referred to as hidden understanding 
model (HUM), are employed. 
â¢ Speech-act n-gram. Top-level concepts can be 
seen as speech acts of the domain. For instance, 
in the DM in Fig. 2 top-level concepts such 
as \[greeting\], \[farewell\] or \[suggestion\], 
correspond to discourse speech acts, and in 
normally-occurring conversation, they follow a 
distribution that is clearly non-uniform. 1Â°

to the concepts in the DM (i.e., equivalent to 
grammar non-terminals) and the observations 
to the embedded concepts appearing as imme
diate daughters of the state in a parse tree. 
For example, the parse tree in Fig. 4 contains 
the following set of <state, observation> pairs: 
{< \[time\], \[point\] >, < \[point\], \[day_of_week\] >, 
< \[point\], \[time_of_day\] >}. 
â¢ Concept-word HMM. Discrete hidden Markov 
model in which the states correspond to the con
cepts in the DM and the observations to the em
bedded lexical items (i.e., grammar terminals) 
appearing as immediate daughters of the state 
in a parse tree. For example, the parse tree 
in Fig. 4 contains the pairs: {< \[day_of_week\], 
tuesday>, < \[time_of_day\], afternoon>}. 
The HUM thus attempts to capture the recurring 
patterns of the language used in the domain in an 
asynchronous mode, i.e., independent of word order 
(as opposed to parser predictions that heavily de
pend on word order). Its aim is, again, to provide 
predictive power at run-time: upon encountering an 
unparsable expression, the HUM hypothesizes possi
ble intended meanings in the form of a ranked list of 
the most likely parse trees, given the current state in 
the discourse, the subparses for the expression and 
the lexical items present in the expression. 
Its parameters can be best estimated through 
training over a given corpus of correct parses, but 
in order not to compromise our established goal of 
rapid deployment, we employ the following tech
niques. 
1. In the absence of a training corpus, the HUM 
parameters are seeded from the Kernel Gram
mar itself. 
2. Training is maintained at run-time through dy
namic updates of all model parameters after 
each utterance and learning episode. 
3.2.4 End-user paraphrases 
If the end-user is not satisfied with the hypotheses 
presented by the parser predictions or the HUM, a 
third learning method is triggered: learning from 
a paraphrase of the original utterance, given also 
by the end-user. Assuming the paraphrase is 
understood, m GsG updates the grammar in such a 
fashion so that the semantics of the first sentence 
are equivalent to those of the paraphrase. 12 
11 Precisely, the requirement that the grammar be complete 
(see note 3) ensures the existence of a suitable paraphrase for 
any utterance expressible in the domain. In practice, however, 
it may take too many attempts to find an appropriate para
phrase. Currently, if the first paraphrase is not understood, 
no further requests are made. 
12Presently, the root of the paraphrase's parse tree directly 
becomes the left-hand-side of the new rule.

4 Preliminary
results 
We have conducted a series of preliminary exper
iments in different languages (English, German and 
Chinese) and domains (scheduling, travel reserva
tions). We present here the results for an experiment 
involving the comparison of expert vs. non-expert 
grammar development on a spontaneous travel reser
vation task in English. The grammar had been de
veloped over the course of three months by a fnll
time expert grammar writer and the experiment con
sisted in having this expert develop on an unseen 
set of 72 sentences using the traditional environment 
and asking two non-expert users lz to "teach" GsÂ¢3 
the meaning of the same 72 sentences through in
teractions with the system. Table 1 compares the 
correct parses before and after development. 
It took the expert 15 minutes to add 8 rules and 
reduce bad coverage from 27.01% to 13.51%. As 
for the non-experts, end-user1, starting with a sim
ilar grammar, reduced bad parses from 22.97% to 
12.17% through a 30-minute session 14 with GSG that 
gave rise to 8 new rules; end-user2, starting with the 
smallest possible complete grammar, reduced bad 
parses from 41.89% to 22.98% through a 35-minute 
session 14 that triggered the creation of 17 new rules. 
60% of the learning episodes were successful, with 
an average number of questions of 2.91. The unsuc
cessful learning episodes had an average number of 
questions of 6.19 and their failure is mostly due to 
unsuccessful paraphrases. 
As for the nature of the acquired rules, they dif
fer in that the expert makes use of optional and re
peatable tokens, an expressive power not currently 
available to GSG. On the other hand this lack of 
generality can be compensated by the Principle of 
Maximal Abstraction (see note 8). As an example,

5 Discussion

Although preliminary and limited in scope, these 
results are encouraging and suggest that grammar 
development by non-experts through GSG is indeed 
possible and cost-effective. It can take the non
expert twice as long as the expert to go through a set 
of sentences, but the main point is that it is possible 
at all for a user with no background in computer sci
ence or linguistics to teach GsG the meaning of new 
expressions without being aware of the underlying 
machinery. 
Potential applications of Gsc are many, most no
tably a very fast development of NLU components 
for a variety of tasks including speech recognition 
and NL interfaces. Also, the IDIGA environment 
enhances the usability of any system or application 
that incorporates it, for the end-users are able to eas
ily "teach the computer" their individual language 
patterns and preferences. 
Current and future work includes further develop
ment of the learning methods and their integration, 
design of a rule-merging mechanism, comparison 
of individual vs. collective grammars, distributed 
grammar development over the World Wide Web, 
and integration of GSG's run-time stage into the 
JANUS speech recognition system (Lavie et al. 1997).
