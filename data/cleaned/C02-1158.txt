These methods acquire translation rules from pairs of similar sentences in a bilingual text corpora.
This means that it is diﬃcult for the systems to acquire the translation rules from sparse data.
As a result, these methods require large amounts of training data in order to acquire high-quality translation rules.
To overcomethis problem, we propose a method ofmachine translation using a Recursive Chain-linktype Learning.
In our new method, the system can acquire many new high-quality translation rules from sparse translation examples based on already acquired translation rules.
Therefore, acquisition of new translation rules results in the generation of more new translation rules.

1 Introduction
Rule-Based Machine Translation(MT)(Hutchins and Somers, 1992) requires large-scale knowledge to analyze both source language(SL) sentences and target language(TL) sentences.
Moreover, it is diﬃcult for a developer to completely describe large-scale knowledge that can analyze various linguistic phenomena.
Therefore, Rule-Based MT is time-consuming and expensive.
Statistical MT and Example-Based MT have been proposed to overcome the difﬁculties of Rule-Based MT.
These approaches correspondto Corpus-Basedapproach.
CorpusBased approach uses translation examples that keep including linguistic knowledge.
This means that the system can improve the quality ofitstranslationonlybyaddingnewtranslation examples.
However, in Statistical MT(Brown et al., 1990), large amounts of translation examples are required in order to obtain high-quality translation.
Moreover, ExampleBased MT(Sato and Nagao, 1990; Watanabe and Takeda, 1998; Brown, 2001; Carl, 2001) which relies on various knowledge resources results in the same diﬃculties as Rule-Based MT.
Therefore, Example-Based MT, which automatically acquires the translation rules from only bilingual text corpora, is very eﬀective.
However, existing Example-Based MT systems using the learning algorithms require large amounts of translation pairs to acquire high-quality translation rules.
In Example-Based MT based on analogical reasoning(Malavazos, 2000; Guvenir, 1998), the diﬀerent parts are replaced by variables to generalize translation examples as shown in (1) of Figure 1.
However, the number of diﬀerent parts of the two SL sentences must be same as the number of diﬀerent parts of the two TL sentences.
This means that the condition of acquisition of translation rules is very strict because this method allows only n:n mappings in the number of the diﬀerent parts between the SL sentences and the TL sentences.
As a result, many translationrulescannot be acquired.
(McTait, 2001) generalizes both the diﬀerent parts and the common parts as shown in Figure 1(2).
This means that (McTait, 2001) allows m:n mappings in the number of the diﬀerent parts, or the number of the common parts.
However, itisdiﬃculttoacquirethetranslation rules that correspond to the lexicon level.
On the other hand, we have proposed a method of Machine Translation using Inductive Learning with Genetic Algorithms(GA-ILMT)(Echizenya et al., 1996).
This method automatically generates the similar translation examples from only given translation examples by applying genetic algorithms(Goldberg, 1989) as shown in (3a) of Figure 1.
Moreover, the system performs Inductive Learning.
By using Inductive Learning, the abstract translation rules are acquired by performing phased extraction of different parts as shown in Figure 1(3b) and (3c).
In all methods shown in Figure 1, the condition of acquisition of translation rules is that two similar translation examples must exist.
As a result, the systems require large amounts of translation examples.
We propose a method of MT using Recursive Chain-link-type Learning as a method to overcome the above problem.
In our method, the system acquires new translation rules from sparse data using other already acquired translation rules.
For example, ﬁrst, translation rule B is acquired by using translation rule A when the translation rule A exists in the dictionary.
Moreover, translation rule C is acquired by using the translation rule B.
Such a process of acquisition of translation rules is like a chain where each ring is linked.
Therefore, we call this mechanism Recursive Chain-link-type Learning(RCL).Thismethodcaneﬀectively acquire many translation rules from sparse data withoutdependingon thediﬀerentparts ofsimilar translation pairs.
In this paper, we describe the eﬀectiveness of RCL through evaluation experiments.

Inthispaper,weapplythisability to a translation example that consists of SL and TL sentences.
A system with RCL can acquire translation rules from sparse translation examples.
Figure 2 shows how translation rules are acquired using this method 1. Figure 2 shows the process where translation rules B, C and D are acquired one after another using RCL.
In this paper, source parts arethose parts that are extracted from the SL sentences of translation examples, and target parts are those parts that are extracted from the TL sentences of translation examples.
Moreover, part translation rules are pairs of source parts and 1 In Figure 2, the use of a Greek character means that all language characters correspond to unknown character strings for a computer.

target parts, extracted as parts like translation rules A and C i n Figure 2.
Sen tence translation rules are pairs of source and target parts extracted as sen tences like translation rules B and D i n Figure 2.
On the other hand, translation rules that are used as starting p oin ts in the acquisition pro cess of translation rules, like translation rule A i n Figure 2, are acquired b y using GA-ILMT.
The reason b eing that the system can p erform translation based on only learning abilit y without an y analytical kno wledge, b y using GA-ILMT and R CL.
A system with R C L acquires part translation rules and sen tence translation rules together.
As a result, a c hain reaction causes the acquisition of translation rules.
In the pro cess No.1 of Figure 2, translation rule A has information that the system can extract “Z” from the SL sen tences of translation examples, or the source parts of translation rules, and can extract “ ζ ” from the TL sen tences or the target parts.
Therefore, the system can acquire the sen tence translation rule B b y extracting “Z” from the SL sen tence of translation example No.1 and “ ζ ” from the TL sen tence of translation example No.1.
The acquired translation rule B has information that the system can extract from the righ t o f “E” to the left of “H” in the SL sen tences of translation examples, or the source parts of translation rules, and can extract from the righ t o f “ θ ” t o the left of “ η ” i n the TL sen tences or the target parts.
By using this information, in pro cess 2, the system can acquire part translation rule C � NΩ � νω � b y extracting “NΩ” from the SL sen tence of translation example No.2 and “ νω ” from the TL sen tence.

4 Process
4.1 Translation process In the translation process, the system generates translation results using acquired translation rules.
First, the system selects the sentence translation rules that can be applied to the SL sentence.
Second, the system generates thetranslationresultsbyreplacingthevariables in the sentence translation rules with the part translation rules.
4.2 Feedback
process In the feedbackprocess, the system evaluates the translation rules used.
First, the system evaluatesthetranslationruleswithoutvariables by using the results of combinations between the translation rules with variables and the translation rules without variables(Echizen-ya et al., 1996).
Next, the system evaluates translationruleswithvariablesbyusingtheprocesses of combinations between the translations rules with variables and the translation rules without variables(Echizen-ya et al., 2000).
As a result, the system increases the correct translation frequencies, or the erroneous translation frequencies, of the translation rules by using these evaluation methods for the translation rules.
4.3 Learning
process 4.3.1 GA-ILMT In this paper, by using the process of acquisition of translation rules in GA-ILMT, the system acquires both sentence and part translation rules.
These rules are then used as starting points when the system performs RCL.
4.3.2 Recursive
Chain-link-type Learning(RCL) In this section, we describethe processofacquisition of translation rules using RCL.
The details of the process of acquisition of part translation rules are as follows.
(1)The system selects translation examples that have common parts with the sentence translation rules.
(2)The system extracts the parts that correspond to the variables in the source parts and in the target parts of the sentence translation rules from the SL sentences, and the TL sentences of the translation examples.
(3)The system registers pairs, of the parts extractedfromtheSLsentencesandtheparts extracted from the TL sentences, as the part translation rules.
(4)The system gives the correct and erroneous frequencies of sentence translation rules to the acquired part translation rules.
Figure 4 2 shows an example of the acquisitionofaparttranslationruleusingthesentence translation rule.
In Figure 4, (thirty;30[sanju]) as the part translation rule is acquired because “thirty” corresponds to the variable in the source part of sentence translation rule and “30[sanju]” corresponds to the variable in the target part of sentence translation rule.

5 Experiments
for performance evaluation 5.1 Experimental procedure There are two kinds of data as experimental data.
One is learning data and the other is evaluation data.
In these experiments, 1,759 translationexampleswereusedaslearningdata.
These translation examples were taken from textbooks(Nihon Kyozai(1), 2001; Nihon Kyozai(2), 2001; Hoyu Shuppan, 2001) for secondgrade junior high school students.
As well, 1,097 translation examples were used as evaluation data.
These translation examples were taken from textbooks(Bunri, 2001; Sinko Shuppan, 2001) for second-grade junior high school students.
Allofthesetranslationexampleswere processed by the method outlined in Figure 3.
The initial condition of the dictionary is empty.
Moreover,weusedthreeothercommercialRuleBased MT systems, comparing our system with those systems.
We call these three MT systems A, B and C respectively.
5.2 Evaluation
standards The correct translation results are grouped into two categories: (1) The correct translation Thismeansthatthetranslationresultscorrespond to the correct translation results taken from textbooks respectively(Bunri, 2001; Sinko Shuppan, 2001).
(2) A correct translation which includes unknown words This means that the translation results with substituted nouns or adjectives as variables correspond to the correct translation results taken from textbooks respectively(Bunri, 2001; Sinko Shuppan, 2001).
In this paper, the eﬀective translation results are the translation results that correspond to (1) and (2), and the ineﬀective translation results are the translation results that do not correspond to (1) and (2).
Moreover, the eﬀective translation rate is the rate of the eﬀective translation results in all the evaluation data.
The translation results are ranked when several translation results are generated.
The translation results using the translation rules whose rate of correct translation frequency is high, are ranked at the top.
We evaluated the translation results that are ranked from No.1 to No.3. 5.3 Experimental results and discussion Table 1 shows examples of eﬀective translation results in our system with RCL.
Table 2 shows the results of comparative experiments of our system and the three Rule-Based MT systems.
We excluded 309 SL sentences from 1,097 SL sentences used as evaluation data in Table 2.
In oursystem, the309SLsentencesbecametheineﬀective translation results because of a lackof learning data.
Therefore, the 309 SL sentences are not inadequate as evaluation data.
Table 2 shows the eﬀective translation rates in 788 SL sentences, which were left after excluding 309 SL sentences from the 1,097 SL sentences used as evaluation data.
In the other three RuleBased MT systems, the same 788 SL sentences were used as evaluation data and the translation results which correspond to (1) and (2) Table 1: Examples of eﬀective translation results.

described in section 5.2 were evaluated as the correct translation results.
The eﬀective translation rate in the system with only GA-ILMT was 45.1%.
In Table 2, the eﬀective translation rate of system with RCL is almost the same as the eﬀective translation rates of system A, but is higher than systems B and C.

Meaning that only translation results that had almost the same character strings as the correct translation results taken from the textbooks(Bunri, 2001; Sinko Shuppan, 2001) were eﬀective translation results.
For example, “f�x�10�TT��b[Sore wa yaku juppun kakari masu.]” is an ineﬀective translation result because of the correct translation results for “It takes about ten minutes.” is “�10�TT��b[Yaku juppun kakari masu.]” in textbook(Bunri, 2001; Sinko Shuppan, 2001).
In this Japanese sentence, phrase “f�x[sore wa]” results in needlessly long.
Therefore, we evaluate the translation results that have diﬀerent phrases to the correct translation results as the ineﬀective translation results in terms of the quality of translation.
Table3showsacomparisonofeﬀectivetranslation ratesbasedon quality.
InTable3, weconﬁrmed that the system with RCL can generate more high-quality translation results than the three other Rule-Based MT systems.
In the system with RCL, the erroneous translation rules are also acquiredlike a linked chain.
For example, in Figure 2, the translation rules B, C and D are acquired as the erroneous translation rules when the translation rule A is the erroneous translation rule.
Namely, a chain reactioncauses theacquisition oferroneous translation rules.
In learning data, the rate of erroneous part translation rules to the acquired part translation rules was 47.9%, and the rate of erroneous sentence translation rules to the acquired sentence translation rules was 38.2%.
However, such erroneous translation rules are automatically decided as being erroneous translation rules in the feedbackprocess resulting from the ineﬀective translation results.
6 Conclusion
In existing Example-Based MT systems based on learning algorithms, similar translationpairs must exist to acquire high-quality translation rules.
This means that the systems require large amounts of translation examples to acquire high-quality translation rules.
On the other hand, a system with RCL can acquire many new translation rules from sparse translation examples because it uses other already acquired translation rules based on the learning algorithms described in section 2.
As a result, the quality of the translation and the effective translation rate of our system is higher than other Rule-Based MT systems.
However, our system still does not reach the level of a practical MT system and requires more translation rules to realize the goal of a practical MT system.
Although our system is not a practical enough MT system, the system can eﬀectively acquire the translation rules from sparse data by using RCL.
Therefore, we consider that the quality of translation improves only by adding new translation examples without the diﬃculty ofRule-BasedMT systemsin which adeveloper mustcompletelydescribelarge-scaleknowledge.
In the future, we plan to add a mechanism that eﬀectively combines the acquired translation rules so that the system realizes the translation of practical SL sentences.
