Yarowsky (1995) tested the claim on about 37,000 examples and found that when a polysemous word appeared more than once in a discourse, they took on the majority sense for the discourse 99.8% of the time on average.

Baldwin and Bond (2003a; 2003b) have proposed a method for automatically learning countability from corpus data.

These instances can be retagged with their countability by using the proposed method and some kind of bootstrapping (Yarowsky, 1995).

Note that although the source of the data is the same as in Section 5, as Yarowsky (1995) did.

Others including Bond and VatikiotisBateson (2002) and Oâ€™Hara et al.(2003) use ontology to determine countability.

This improvement is close to that of one sense per discourse (Yarowsky, 1995) (improvement ranging from 1.3% to 1.7%), which seems to be a sensible upper bound of the proposed method.

In this method, the decision list (DL) learning algorithm (Yarowsky, 1995) is used.

Lapata and Keller (2005) and Peng and Araki (2005) have proposed web-based models for learning countability.

In this paper, we propose a method for reinforcing countability prediction by introducing a novel concept called one countability per discourse that is an extension of one sense per discourse proposed by Gale et al.(1992). It claims that when a noun appears more than once in a discourse, they will all share the same countability in the discourse.

Countability per Discourse One countability per discourse is an extension of one sense per discourse proposed by Gale et al.(1992). One sense per discourse claims that when a polysemous word appears more than once in a discourse it is likely that they will all share the same sense.
