Semantic Coherence Scoring Using an Ontology Iryna Gurevych Rainer Malaka Robert Porzel Hans-Peter Zorn European Media Lab GmbH Schloss-Wolfsbrunnenweg 31c D-69118 Heidelberg, Germany a0 gurevych,malaka,porzel,zorn@eml.org a1 Abstract In this paper we present ONTOSCORE, a system for scoring sets of concepts on the basis of an ontology.
We apply our system to the task of scoring alternative speech recognition hypotheses (SRH) in terms of their semantic coherence.
We conducted an annotation experiment and showed that human annotators can reliably differentiate between semantically coherent and incoherent speech recognition hypotheses.
An evaluation of our system against the annotated data shows that, it successfully classifies 73.2% in a German corpus of 2.284 SRHs as either coherent or incoherent (given a baseline of 54.55%). 1 Introduction Following Allen et al.(2001), we can distinguish between controlled and conversational dialogue systems.
Since controlled and restricted interactions between the user and the system increase recognition and understanding accuracy, such systems are reliable enough to be deployed in various real world applications, e.g. public transportation or cinema information systems.
The more conversational a dialogue system becomes, the less predictable are the users’ utterances.
Recognition and processing become increasingly difficult and unreliable.
Today’s dialogue systems employ domainand discourse-specific knowledge bases, so-called ontologies, to represent the individual discourse entities as concepts, and their relations to each other.
In this paper we present an algorithm for measuring the semantic coherence of sets of concepts against such an ontology.
In the following, we will show how the semantic coherence measurement can be applied to estimate how well a given speech recognition hypothesis (SRH) fits with respect to the existing knowledge representation, thereby providing a mechanism that increases the robustness and reliability of dialogue systems.
In Section 2 we discuss the problem of scoring and classifying SRHs in terms of their semantic coherence followed by a description of our annotation experiment.
Section 3 contains a description of the kind of knowledge representations employed by ONTOSCORE.
We present the algorithm in Section 4, and an evaluation of the corresponding system for scoring SRHs is given in Section 5.
A conclusion and additional applications are given in Section 6.
2 Semantic
Coherence and Speech Recognition Hypotheses 2.1 The Problem While a simple one-best hypothesis interface between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) suffices for restricted dialogue systems, more complex systems either operate on n-best lists as ASR) output or convert ASR word graphs (Oerder and Ney, 1993) into n-best lists, given the distribution of acoustic and language model scores (Schwartz and Chow, 1990; Tran et al., 1996).
For example, in our data a user expressed the wish to see a specific city map again, as:1 (1) Ich I w¨urde would die the Karte map gerne like wiedersehen to see again Looking at two SRHs from the ensuing n-best list we found that Example (1a) constituted a suitable representation of the utterance, whereas Example (1b) constituted a less adequate representation thereof.
(1a) Ich I w¨urde would die the Karte map eine one wieder again sehen see (1b) Ich I w¨urde would die the Karte map eine one Wiedersehen Good Bye Facing multiple representations of a single utterance consequently poses the question, which of the different hypotheses corresponds most likely to the user’s utterance.
Several ways of solving this problem have been 1All examples are displayed with the German original on top and a glossed translation below.

9-16 Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003 proposed and implemented in various systems.
Frequently the scores provided by the ASR system itself are used, e.g. acoustic and language model probabilities.
More recently also scores provided by the NLU system have been employed, e.g. parsing scores or discourse scores (Litman et al., 1999; Engel, 2002; Alexandersson and Becker, 2003).
However, these methods assign higher scores to SRHs which are semantically incoherent and lower scores to semantically coherent ones and disagree with other.
For instance, the acoustic and language model scores of Example (1b) are actually better than for Example (1a), which results from the fact that the frequencies and corresponding probabilities for important expressions, such as Good Bye, are rather high, thereby ensuring their reliable recognition.
Another phenomenon found in our data consists of hypotheses such as: (2) Zeige Show mir me alle all Vergn¨ugen pleasures (3) Zeige Show mir me alle all Filmen Films In these cases language model scores are higher for Example (2) than Example (3), as the incorrect inflection on alle Filmen was less frequent in the training material than that of the correct inflection on alle Vergn¨ugen.
Our data also shows as one would intuitively expect that the understanding-based scores generally reflect how well a given SRH is covered by the grammar employed.
In many less well-formed cases these scores do not correspond to the correctness of the SRH.
Generally we find instances where all existing scoring methods disagree with each other, diverge from the actual word error rate and ignore the semantic coherence.2 Neither of the aforementioned approaches systematically employs the system’s knowledge of the domains at hand.
This increases the number of times where a suboptimal recognition hypothesis is passed through the system.
This means that, while there was a better representation of the actual utterance in the n-best list, the NLU system is processing an inferior one, thereby causing overall dialogue metrics, in the sense of Walker et al.(2000), to decrease.
We propose an alternative way to rank SRHs on the basis of their semantic coherence with respect to a given ontology representing the domains of the system.
2.2 Annotation
Experiments In a previous study (Gurevych et al., 2002), we tested if human annotators could reliably classify SRHs in terms 2As the numbers evident from large vocabulary speech recognition performance (Cox et al., 2000), the occurrence of less well formed and incoherent SRHs increases the more conversational a system becomes.
of their semantic coherence.
The task of the annotators was to determine whether a given hypothesis representsa n internally coherent utterance or not.
In order to test the reliability of such annotations, we collected a corpus of SRHs.
The data collection was conducted by means of a hidden operator test.
We had 29 subjects prompted to say certain inputs in 8 dialogues.
1.479 turns were recorded.
Each user-turn in the dialogue corresponded to a single intention, e.g. a route request or a sight information request.
The audio files were then sent to the speech recognizer and the input to the semantic coherence scoring module, i.e. n-best lists of SRHs were recorded in log-files.
The final corpus consisted of 2.284 SRHs.
All hypotheses were then randomly mixed to avoid contextual influences and given to separate annotators.
The resulting Kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996) over the annotated data yields a0a2a1 a3a5a4a7a6, which seems to indicate that human annotators can reliably distinguish between coherent samples (as in Example (1a)) and incoherent ones (as in Example (1b)).
The aim of the work presented here, then, was to provide a knowledge-based score, that can be employed by any NLU system to select the best hypothesis from a given n-best list.
ONTOSCORE, the resulting system will be described below, followed by its evaluation against the human gold standard.
3 The
Knowledge Base In this section, we provide a description of the preexisting knowledge source employed by ONTOSCORE, as far as it is necessary to understand the empirical data generated by the system.
It is important to note that the ontology employed in this evaluation existed already and was crafted as a general knowledge representation for various processing modules within the system.3 Ontologies have traditionally been used to represent general and domain specific knowledge and are employed for various natural language understanding tasks, e.g. semantic interpretation (Allen, 1987).
We propose an additional way of employing ontologies, i.e. to use the knowledge modeled therein as the basis for evaluating the semantic coherence of sets of concepts.
The system described herein can be employed independently of the specific ontology language used, as the underlying algorithm operates only on the nodes and named edges of the directed graph represented by the ontology.
The specific knowledge base, e.g. written in DAML+OIL or OWL,4 is converted into a graph, consisting of: 3Alternative knowledge representations, such as WORDNET, could have been employed in theory as well, however most of the modern domains of the system, e.g. electronic media or program guides, are not covered by WORDNET.
4DAML+OIL and OWL are frequently used knowledge modeling languages originating in W3C and Semantic Web a0 the class hierarchy, with each class corresponding to a concept representing either an entity or a process; a0 the slots, i.e. the named edges of the graph corresponding to the class properties, constraints and restrictions.
The ontology employed herein has about 730 concepts and 200 relations.
It includes a generic top-level ontology whose purpose is to provide a basic structure of the world, i.e. abstract classes to divide the universe in distinct parts as resulting from the ontological analysis.
The top-level was developed following the procedure outlined in Russell and Norvig (1995).
In the view of the ontology employed herein, Role is the most general class in the ontology and represents a role that any entity or process can perform.
It is divided into Event and Abstract Event.
Event is used to describe a kind of role any entity or process may have in a ”real” situation or process, e.g. a building or an information search.
It is contrasted with Abstract Event, which is abstracted from a set of situations and processes.
It reflects no reality and is used for the general categorization and description, e.g.
Number, Set, Spatial Relation.
There are two kinds of events: Physical Object and Process.
The class Physical Object describes any kind of objects we come in contact with living as well as nonliving having a location in space and time in contrast to abstract objects.
These objects refer to different domains, such as Sight and Route in the tourism domain, Av Medium and Actor in the TV and cinema domain, etc., and can be associated with certain relations in the processes via slot constraint definitions.
The modeling of Process as a kind of event that is continuous and homogeneous in nature, follows the frame semantic analysis used for generating the FRAMENET data (Baker et al., 1998).
Currently, there are four groups of processes (see Figure 1): a0 General Process, a set of the most general processes such as duplication, imitation or repetition processes; a0 Mental Process, a set of processes such as cognitive, emotional or perceptual processes; a0 Physical Process, a set of processes such as motion, transaction or controlling processes; a0 Social Process, a set of processes such as communication or instruction processes.
Let us consider the definition of the Information Search Process in the ontology.
It is modeled as a projects.
For more detail, see www.w3c.org. subclass of the Cognitive Process, which is a subclass of the Mental Process and inherits the following slot constraints: a0 begin time, a time expression indicating the starting time point; a0 end time, a time expression indicating the time point when the process is complete; a0 state, one of the abstract process states, e.g. start, continue, interrupt, etc.
a0 cognizer, filled with a class Person including its subclasses.
Information Search Process features one additional slot constraint, piece-of-information.
The possible slot-fillers are a range of domain objects, e.g.
Sight, Performance, or whole sets of those, e.g.
Tv Program, but also processes, e.g.
Controlling Tv Device Process.
This way, an utterance such as: (4) I I h¨atte gerne would like Informationen information zum about Schloss castle can also be mapped onto Information Search Process, which has an agent of type User and a piece of information of type Sight.
Sight has a name of type Castle.
Analogously, the utterance: (5) Wie How kann can ich I den the Fernseher TV steuern control can be mapped onto Information Search Process, which has an agent of type User and has a piece of information of type Controlling Tv Device Process.
4 Ontology-based Scoring of SRHs ONTOSCORE performs a number of processing steps, each of them will be described separately in the respective subsections.
4.1 Mapping
of SRH to Sets of Concepts A necessary preprocessing step is to convert each SRH into a concept representation (CR).
For that purpose we augmented the system’s lexicon with specific concept mappings.
That is, for each entry in the lexicon either zero, one or many corresponding concepts where added.
A simple vector of the concepts, corresponding to the words in the SRH for which concepts in the lexicon exist, constitutes the resulting CR.
All other words with empty concept mappings, e.g. articles, are ignored in the conversion.

4.2 Mapping
of CR to Graphs ONTOSCORE converts the domain model, i.e. an ontology, into a directed graph with concepts as nodes and relations as edges.
One additional problem that needed to be solved lies in the fact that the directed subclass-of relations enable path algorithms to ascend the class hierarchy upwards, but do not let them descend, therefore missing a significant set of possible paths.
In order to remedy that situation the graph was enriched during its conversion by corresponding parent-of relations, which eliminated the directionality problems as well as avoids cycles and 0paths.
In order to find the shortest path between two concepts, ONTOSCORE employs the single source shortest path algorithm of Dijkstra (Cormen et al., 1990).
Given a concept representation CR a0a2a1a4a3,..., a1a6a5a8a7, the algorithm runs once for each concept.
The Dijkstra algorithm calculates minimal paths from a source node to all other nodes.
Then, the minimal paths connecting a given concept a1a10a9 with every other concept in CR (excluding a1a11a9 itself) are selected, resulting in an a12a14a13a15a12 matrix of the respective paths.
4.3 The
Scoring Algorithm To score the minimal paths connecting all concepts with each other in a given CR, we first adopted a method proposed by Demetriou and Atwell (1994) to score the semantic coherence of alternative sentence interpretations against graphs based on the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE).
To construct the graph the dictionary lemmata were represented as nodes in an isa hierarchy and their semantic relations were represented as edges, which were extracted automatically from the LDOCE.
As defined by Demetriou and Atwell (1994), a16 a1 a0a11a17 a3a4a18a17a11a19 a18 a4 a4 a4 a18a17 a5 a7 is the set of direct relations (both isa and semantic relations) that can connect two nodes (concepts); and a20 a1 a0a2a21 a3a22a18a21a23a19 a18 a4 a4 a4 a18a21 a5 a7 is the set of corresponding weights, where the weight of each isa relation is set to a3 and that of each other relation to a24 . For each two conceptsa1 a9, a1a26a25 the set a27 a1 a0a29a28 a3a2a18a28a30a19 a18 a4 a4 a4 a18a28a8a31a32a7 denotes the scores of all possible paths that link the two concepts.
The score for path a33a35a34a36a33 a1a37a24 a18 a4 a4 a4 a18a29a38a40a39 can be given as: a28a42a41 a1 a5 a43 a9a45a44a46a3a48a47 a9a49a21a23a9 where a47 a9 represents the number of times the relation a17a4a9 exists in path a33 . The ensuing distance between two concepts a1 a9 and a1a26a25 is, then, defined as the minimum score derived between a1a10a9 and a1 a25, i.e.: a0 a34 a1 a9a18 a1a26a25 a39 a1 a38a2a1 a12 a34 a28 a41a22a39 a33 a1 a24 a18a4a3 a18 a4 a4 a4 a18a29a38 The algorithm selects from the set of all paths between two concepts the one with the smallest weight, i.e. the cheapest.
The distances between all concept pairs in CR are summed up to a total score.
The set of concepts with the lowest aggregate score represents the combination with the highest semantic relatedness.
Demetriou and Atwell (1994) do not provide concrete evaluation results for the method.
Also, their algorithm only allows for a relative judgment stating which of a set of interpretations given a single sentence is more semantically related.
Since our objective is to compute semantic coherence scores of arbitrary CRs on an absolute scale, certain extensions are necessary.
In this application, the CRs to be scored can differ in terms of their content, the number of concepts contained therein and their mappings to the original SRH.
Moreover, in order to achieve absolute values, the final score should be related to the number of concepts in an individual set and the number of words in the original SRH.
Therefore, the results must be normalized in order to allow for evaluation, comparability and clearer interpretation of the semantic coherence scores.
4.4 Scoring
Concept Representations We modified the algorithm described above to make it applicable and evaluatable with respect to the task at hand as well as other possible tasks.
The basic idea is to calculate a score based on the path distances in a5 a16 . Since short distances indicate coherence and many concept pairs in a given a5 a16 may have no connecting path, we define the distance between two concepts a1a11a9 and a1 a25 that are only connected via isa relations in the knowledge base as a0 a31a7a6a9a8 . This maximum value can also serve as a maximum for long distances and can thus help to prune the search tree for long paths.
This constant has to be set according to the structure of the knowledge base.
For example, employing the ontology described above, the maximum distance between two concepts does not exceed ten and we chose in that case a0 a31a7a6a9a8 a1 a24 a3 . We can now define the semantic coherence score for a5 a16 as the average path length between all concept pairs in a5 a16 : a10 a34a11a5 a16 a39 a1 a12a14a13a16a15a16a17a13a19a18a21a20a23a22a25a24a26a17a13a16a15a28a27 a44 a13a19a18 a0 a34 a1a6a9a18 a1 a25 a39 a29 a5 a16 a29 a19a31a30 a29 a5 a16 a29 Since the ontology is a directed graph, we have a29 a5 a16 a29 a19 a30 a29 a5 a16 a29 pairs of concepts with possible directed connections, i.e., a path from concept a1a2a9 to concept a1 a25 may be completely different to that from a1 a25 to a1a6a9 or even be missing.
As a symmetric alternative, we may want to consider a path from a1a10a9 to a1 a25 and a path from a1 a25 to a1a10a9 to be semantically equivalent and thus model every relation in a bidirectional way.
We can then compute a symmetric score a10a33a32 a34a11a5 a16 a39 as: a10 a32 a34a11a5 a16 a39 a1 a3 a12a14a13a16a15a16a17a13a19a18a9a20a23a22a34a24a26a17 a9a36a35 a25 a38a2a1 a12 a34 a0 a34 a1 a9a18 a1a26a25 a39 a18 a34 a0 a34 a1 a25 a18a1 a9a39a39 a29 a5 a16 a29 a19a7a30 a29 a5 a16 a29 ONTOSCORE implements both options.
In the ontology currently employed by the system some reverse relations can be found, e.g. given a1a4a3 =Broadcast and a1 a19 =Channel, there exists a path from a1a2a3 to a1 a19 via the relation has-channel and a different path from a1 a19 to a1a2a3 via the relation has-broadcast.
However, such reverse relations are only sporadically represented in the ontology.
Consequently, it is difficult to account for their influence on a10 a34a11a5 a16 a39 in general.
That is why we chose the a10a33a32 a34a11a5 a16 a39 function for the evaluation, i.e. only the best path a0 a34 a1a6a9a18 a1 a25 a39 between a given pair of concepts, regardless of the direction, is taken into account.
4.5 Word/Concept Relation Given the algorithm proposed above, a significant number of misclassifications for SRHs would result from the cases when an SRH contains a high proportion of function words (having no conceptual mappings in the resulting CR) and only a few content words.
Let’s consider the following example: (6) Wo Where den the Informationen information zu to das the gleiche same The corresponding CR is constituted out of a single concept Information Search Process.
ON TOSCORE would classify the CR as coherent with the highest possible score, as this is the only concept in the set.
This, however, would often lead to misclassifications.
We, therefore, included a post-processing technique that takes the relation between the number of ontology concepts a37 a13 in a given CR and the total number of words a37a39a38 in the original SRH into account.
This relation is defined by the ratio a40 a1a41a37 a13a9a42 a37a43a38 . ONTOSCORE automatically classifies an SRH as being incoherent irrespective of its semantic coherence score, if a40 is less then the threshold set.
The threshold may be set freely.
The corresponding findings are presented in the evaluation section.
4.6 ONTOSCORE
at Work Looking at an example of ONTOSCORE at work, we will examine the utterance given in Example (1).
The resulting two SRHs a10 a16a45a44 a3 and a10 a16a45a44 a19 are given in Example (1a) and (1b) respectively.
The human annotators considered a10 a16a46a44 a3 to be coherent and labeled a10 a16a46a44 a19 as incoherent.
According to the concept entries in the lexicon, the SRHs are transformed into two alternative concept representations.
As no ambiguous words are found in this example, a5 a16 a3 corresponds to a10 a16a45a44 a3 and a5 a16 a19 corresponds to a10 a16a45a44 a19 : a5 a16 a3 : a0 Person; Map; Watch Perceptual Processa7 ; a5 a16 a19 : a0 Person; Map; Parting Processa7 . They are converted into a graph.
According to the algorithm shown in Section 4.3, all paths between the concepts of each graph are calculated and weighted.
This yields the following non-a0 a31a7a6a9a8 paths: a5 a16 a3 a0 a34a1a0a3a2a5a4a7a6a9a8a11a10a13a12a5a14a7a6a5a12a5a15a11a4a17a16a3a2a11a18a5a10a19a14a19a20a3a6a5a12a11a21a19a21 a18 a10a13a12a5a14a22a21a5a20a24a23 a39 a1a37a24 via the relation has-watcher; a0 a34a1a0a3a2a5a4a7a6a9a8a11a10a13a12a5a14a7a6a5a12a5a15a11a4a17a16a3a2a11a18a5a10a19a14a19a20a3a6a5a12a11a21a19a21 a18a26a25 a2a24a15 a39 a1a37a24 via the relation has-watchable object.
a5 a16 a19 a0 a34a27a10a13a2a5a14a19a4a29a28a30a23a11a31a32a10a19a14a13a20a3a6a5a12a13a21a19a21 a18 a10a13a12a17a14a22a21a24a20a24a23 a39 a1 a24 via the relation has-agent; The ensuing results are: According to a10 According to a10 a32 a10 a34a11a5 a16 a3 a39 a1 a6 a10a33a32 a34a11a5 a16 a3 a39 a1a34a33 a10 a34a11a5 a16 a19 a39 a1a34a35 a4a37a36 a10a33a32 a34a11a5 a16 a19 a39 a1 a6 In both cases the results are sufficient for a relative judgment, i.e. a10 a16a45a44 a19 constitutes a less semantically coherent structure as a10 a16a45a44 a3 . To allow for a binary classification into semantically coherent vs.
incoherent samples, a cutoff threshold must be set.
The results of the corresponding experiments will be presented in Section 5.2. 4.7 Word Sense Disambiguation Due to lexical ambiguity, the process of transforming an n-best list of SRH to concept representations often results in a set of CRs that is greater than 1, i.e. a given SRH could be transformed into a set of CRs a0 a5 a16 a3, ..., a5 a16 a5a42a7 . Word sense disambiguation could, therefore, also independently be performed using the semantic coherence scoring described herein as an additional application of our approach.
However, that has not been investigated thoroughly yet.
For example, lexicon entries for the words: I Person am Static Spatial Process, Self Identification Process, None on Two Point Relation, None the None Philosopher’s Walk Location yield a set of interpretations for an SRH such as: (7) Ich I bin am auf on dem the Philosophenweg Philosopher’s Walk a38a40a39a42a41a44a43 Person, Static Spatial Process, Locationa45 a38a40a39a47a46a48a43 Person, Static Spatial Process, Two Point Relation, Locationa45 a38a40a39a50a49a51a43 Person, Self Identification Process, Locationa45 a38a40a39a50a52a51a43 Person, Self Identification Process, Two Point Relation, Locationa45 a38a40a39a47a53a48a43 Person, Two Point Relation, Locationa45 a38a40a39a50a54a51a43 Person, Location a45 and corresponding final scores: a55a57a56a27a38a40a39a42a41a59a58a61a60a63a62 ; a55a57a56a27a38a40a39 a46 a58a61a60a48a64a66a65a67a69a68 ; a55a57a56a27a38a40a39 a49 a58a61a60a48a70a66a65a71a9a64 ; a55a57a56a27a38a40a39a50a52a72a58a61a60a48a70 ; a55a57a56a27a38a40a39a47a53a73a58a61a60a48a64a66a65a64 ; a55a57a56a27a38a40a39a50a54a72a58a61a60a75a74a77a76a42a60a51a78a80a79a82a81a73a83 ; The examination of the resulting scores allows us to conclude that a5 a16 a19 constitutes the most semantically coherent representation of the initial SRH, a5 a16 a3 and a5 a16a80a84 display a slightly lesser degree of semantic coherence, whereas a5 a16a86a85, a5 a16a80a87 and a5 a16a86a88 are much less coherent and may, thus, be considered inadequate.
5 Evaluation
5.1 Context The ONTOSCORE software runs as a module in SMARTKOM (Wahlster et al., 2001), a multi-modal and multi-domain spoken dialogue system.
The system features the combination of speech and gesture as its input and output modalities.
The domains of the system include cinema and TV program information, home electronic device control, mobile services for tourists, e.g. tour planning and sights information.
ONTOSCORE operates on n-best lists of SRHs produced by the language interpretation module out of the ASR word graphs.
It computes a numerical ranking of alternative SRH and thus provides an important aid to the understanding component of the system in determining the best SRH.
The ONTOSCORE software employs two knowledge sources, an ontology (about 730 concepts and 200 relations) and a word/concept lexicon (ca.
3.600 words), covering the respective domains of the system.
5.2 Results
The evaluation of ONTOSCORE was carried out on a dataset of 2.284 SRHs.
We reformulated the problem of measuring the semantic coherence in terms of classifying the SRHs into two classes: coherent and incoherent.
To our knowledge, there exists no similar software performing semantic coherence scoring to be used for comparison in this evaluation.
Therefore, we decided to use the results from human annotation (s.
Section 2.2) as the baseline.
A gold standard for the evaluation of ONTOSCORE was derived by the annotators agreeing on the correct solution in cases of disagreement.
This way, we obtained 1.246 (54.55%) SRH classified as coherent by humans, which is also assumed to be the baseline for this evaluation.
Additionally, we performed an inverse linear transformation of the scores (which range from 1 to a0 a31a31a6 a8 ), so that the output produced by ONTOSCORE is a score on the scale from 0 to 1, where higher scores indicate greater coherence.
In order to obtain a binary classification of SRHs into coherent versus incoherent with respect to the knowledge base, we set a cutoff thresh old.
The dependency graph of the threshold value and the results of the program in % is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 2: Finding the optimal threshold for the coherent versus incoherent classification The best results are achieved with the threshold 0.29.
With this threshold, ONTOSCORE correctly classifies 1.487 SRH, i.e. 65.11% in the evaluation dataset (the word/concept relation is not taken into account at this point).
Figure 3 shows the dependency graph between a40, representing the threshold for the word/concept relation and the results of ONTOSCORE, given the best cutoff threshold for the classification (i.e.
0.29) derived in the previous experiments.
The best results are achieved with the a40 a1 a3a5a4a0a1a0 . In other words, the proportion of concepts vs.
words must be no less than 1 to 3.
Under these settings, ONTOSCORE correctly classifies 1.672 SRH, i.e. 73.2% in the evaluation dataset.
This way, the technique brings an additional improvement of 8.09% as compared to initial results.
6 Concluding
Remarks The ONTOSCORE system described herein automatically performs ontology-based scoring of sets of concepts conFigure 3: Finding the optimal threshold for the word/concept relation stituting an adequate representation of speech recognition hypotheses.
To date, the algorithm has been implemented in a software which is employed by a multidomain and multi-modal dialogue system and applied to the task of scoring n-best lists of SRH, thus producing a score expressing how well a given SRH fits within the domain model.
For this task, it provides an alternative knowledge-based score next to the ones provided by the ASR and the NLU system.
In the evaluation of our system we employed an ontology that was not designed for this task, but already existed as the system’s internal knowledge representation.
As future work we will examine how the computation of a discourse dependent semantic coherence score, i.e. how well a given SRH fits within domain model with respect to the previous discourse, can improve the overall score.
Additionally, we intend to calculate the semantic coherence score with respect to individual domains of the system, thus enabling domain recognition and domain change detection in complex multi-modal and multi-domain spoken dialogue systems.
Currently, we are also beginning to investigate whether the proposed method can be applied to scoring sets of potential candidates for resolving the semantic interpretation of ambiguous, polysemous and metonymic language use.
