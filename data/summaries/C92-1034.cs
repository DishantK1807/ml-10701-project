These unique properties of LTAGs have been shown to be linguistically very useful (Kroch and Jo~hi, 1985; Kroch, 1987; Kroch, 1989; Abeill6, 1988; Shieber and Schabes, 1990).

The framework for describing the tree that will be associated with the lexicai item is very similar to unification based tree-adjoining grammar (Vijay-Shanker, 1992) in which the trees are described with partial descriptions of their topology (Rogers and Vijay-Shanker, 1992) using statements of domination Acres DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 Ao~r 1992 2 0 6 Paoc.
