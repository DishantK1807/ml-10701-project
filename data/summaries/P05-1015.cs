Also, one could use mixture models (e.g., combine positive and negative language models) to capture class relationships (McCallum, 1999; Schapire and Singer, 2000; Takamura, Matsumoto, and Yamada, 2004).

negative (Turney, 2002; Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Dave, Lawrence, and Pennock, 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

(Termbased versions of this premise have motivated much sentiment-analysis work for over a decade (Das and Chen, 2001; Tong, 2001; Turney, 2002)).

We hope that some of the insights derived here might apply to other scales for text classifcation that have been considered, such as clause-level opinion strength (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hwa, 2004); affect types like disgust (Subasic and Huettner, 2001; Liu, Lieberman, and Selker, 2003); reading level (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004); and urgency or criticality (Horvitz, Jacobs, and Hovel, 1999).

Also, even the two-category version of the rating-inference problem for movie reviews has proven quite challenging for many automated classi cation techniques (Pang, Lee, and Vaithyanathan, 2002; Turney, 2002).
