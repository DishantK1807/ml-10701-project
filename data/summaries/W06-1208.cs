However, unestablished compounds are common: almost 70% of compounds identied in the BNC co-occur with a frequency of only one (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).

items that did not occur in the same chunk, according to a chunker based on fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001), 2.

We do so using the combination of the morphological component of CELEX (Burnage, 1990), a lexical database, NOMLEX (Macleod et al., 1998), a nominalisation database, and CATVAR (Habash and Dorr, 2003), an automatically constructed database of clusters of in ected words based on the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1997).

They appear frequently: more than 1% of the words in the British National Corpus (BNC: Burnard (2000)) participate in noun compounds (Tanaka and Baldwin, 2003).

Keller and Lapata (2003) show that Web counts can obviate data sparseness for syntactic predicate argument bigrams.

Lapata (2002) observes that almost half (47%) of the verb noun pairs constructed are not attested within the BNC.

Although the observed results failed to match, or even approach, various benchmarks set by Lapata (2002) (87.3% accuracy) and Grover et al.(2005) (77%) for the subject object and subject 58 direct object prepositional objects classi cation tasks respectively, the presented approach is not without merit.

The approach suggested by Keller and Lapata (2003) for obtaining bigram information from the Web could provide an approach for estimating the syntactic verb argument counts for a given compound (dashes in Tables 1 and 2).

Lapata (2002) and Grover et al.(2005) again use a corpus statistical paraphrase based approach, but with verb argument relations for compound nominalisations attempting to de ne the relation as one of subject, direct object, or a number of prepositional objects in the latter.

Early attempts to automatically classify compound nouns have taken a semantic approach: Finin (1980) and Isabelle (1984) use role nominals derived from the head of the compound to ll a slot with the modi er.

Vanderwende (1994) uses a rule based technique that scores a compound on possible semantic interpretations, while Jones (1995) implements a graph based uni cation procedure over semantic feature structures for the head.

Nakov and Hearst (2005) demonstrate that Web counts can aid in identifying the bracketing in higher arity noun compounds.
W05-0603
For evaluation, we have the two way classi ed data set used by Lapata (2002), and a three way classi ed data set constructed from open text.

Similar results were reported by Lapata (2002) over her data set using backed off smoothing, the most closely related method.

Finally, Rosario and Hearst (2001) make use of a domain speci c lexical resource to classify according to neural networks and decision trees.
