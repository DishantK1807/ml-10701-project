In order to find out which of the three processing methods and which of the nine combination methods performs best, we have applied them to the training data of the CoNLL-2000 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) in a 10-fold cross-validation experiment (Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991).

This is surprising given that Buchholz et al.(1999) used 956696 tokens of training data and we have used only 211727 (78% less).

Our method outperforms the results mentioned in Buchholz et al.(1999) in four of the five cases (ADJP, NP, PP and VP); only for ADVP chunks it performs slightly worse.

The recognition rate for NP chunks (F~=1=93.23) is close to the result for a related standard baseNP data set obtained by Tjong Kim Sang (2000) (93.26).

Chunks can be represented with bracket structures but alternatively one can use a tagging representation which classifies words as being inside a chunk (I), outside a chunk (O) or at a chunk boundary (B) (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).

Tjong Kim Sang (2000) describes how a systeminternal combination of memory-based learners can be used for base noun phrase (baseNP) recognition.

A combination of baseNP classifiers that use the five representation performs better than any of the included systems (Tjong Kim Sang, 2000).
