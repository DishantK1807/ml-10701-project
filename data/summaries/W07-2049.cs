First, we assume that all the positive training in1For direct comparability with our earlier research, semantic relations used in our examples are taken from (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998), and differ slightly from those used in the SemEval-2007 task.

This is because identical words occur more often in coordinate head words than in other lexical dependencies (there were 43 pairs with identical words in the coordination set, compared to 3 such pairs in the 150 SimTest ncoord xcoord SDcoord nnonCoord xnonCoord SDnonCoord 95% CI p-value coordDistrib 503 0.11 0.13 485 0.06 0.09 [0.04 0.07] 0.000 (Resnik, 1995) 444 3.19 2.33 396 2.43 2.10 [0.46 1.06] 0.000 (Lin, 1998) 444 0.27 0.26 396 0.19 0.22 [0.04 0.11] 0.000 (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) 444 0.13 0.65 395 0.07 0.08 [-0.01 0.11] 0.083 (Wu and Palmer, 1994) 444 0.63 0.19 396 0.55 0.19 [0.06 0.11] 0.000 (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) 444 1.72 0.51 396 1.52 0.47 [0.13 0.27] 0.000 (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998) 459 1.599 2.03 447 1.09 1.87 [0.25 0.76] 0.000 (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) 451 114.12 317.18 436 82.20 168.21 [-1.08 64.92] 0.058 (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) 459 0.67 0.18 447 0.66 0.2 [-0.02 0.03] 0.545 random 483 0.89 0.17 447 0.88 0.18 [-0.02 0.02] 0.859 Table 1: Summary statistics for 9 different word similarity measures (plus one random measure):ncoord and nnonCoord are the sample sizes for the coordinate and non-coordinate noun pairs samples, respectively; xcoord, SDcoord and xnonCoord, SDnonCoord are the sample means and standard deviations for the two sets.

Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994).

During development, several other clustering algorithms and parameters have been tested, but the settings described above gave us the best EuroWordNet similarity score (using Wu and Palmer (1994)).

The rst method uses sense collocations as proposed by Moldovan et al.(2004), and the second method uses the lexical similarity of the component words in the NC as proposed by Kim and Baldwin (2005).

Moldovan et al.(2004) propose a 35class scheme to classify relations in various phrases; the same scheme has been applied to noun compounds and other noun phrases (Girju et al., 2005).

Collocation Method Moldovan et al.(2004) proposed a method called semantic scattering for interpreting NCs.

(Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use supervised methods and explore classification features from a simple structured type hierarchy.

The proposed task is a generalisation of the more conventional task of interpreting noun compounds (NCs), inwhichwetakeaNCsuchas cookie jar and interpret it according to a pre-dened inventory of semantic relations (Levi, 1979; Vanderwende, 1994; BarkerandSzpakowicz, 1998).

The similarity scores are calculated using the method of Wu and Palmer (1994) as implemented in WordNet::Similarity (Patwardhan et al., 2003).

Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.

3 WordNet-Based Similarity Measures We also examine the following measures of semantic similarity which are WordNet-based.3 Wu and Palmer (1994) propose a measure of similarity of two concepts c1 and c2 based on the depth of concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.

They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel corpus.

For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence between certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994).

(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2005) gave the annotators an example of each phrase in a sentence along with WordNet senses and position of arguments.
