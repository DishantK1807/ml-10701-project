Using the Web to overcome data sparseness has been attempted before (Keller et al., 2002); however, there are issues: misspellings, typographic errors, and pages in other languages all contribute to noise in the results.

First, the work has looked at any nominalizations as complements of potential light verbs (what they term “support verbs”) (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996).

Substituting pieces of a multiword expression with semantically similar words from a thesaurus can be used to determine productivity—higher degree of substitutability indicating higher productivity (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al., 2003).3 Instead of using a thesaurusbased measure, Villavicencio (2003) uses substitutability over semantic verb classes to determine potential verb-particle combinations.

Verb Constructions Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003).

For example, Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) used some linguistic properties to weed out potential light verbs from lists sorted by raw frequency, while Dras and Johnson (1996) used frequency of the verb weighted by a weak predictor of its prior probability as a light verb.

3Note that although Lin characterizes his work as detecting non-compositionality, we agree with Bannard et al.(2003) that it is better thought of as tapping into productivity.

In general, there is no one “light verb construction” that can be dealt with uniformly in a computational system, as is suggested by Sag et al.(2002), and generally assumed by earlier computational work on these constructions (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996).
