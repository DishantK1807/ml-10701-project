Constructing a Model of Dialog Mare KOIT Tartu State University Tartu USSR Abstract In the present paper communicative cycle (CC) is considered as a dialog arising between two partners during solving a problem.
Communicative strategy (C5) is seen as a general scheme by which a dialog participant is guided in achieving his goal.
CC is described in terms of the goals of the participants and CS.
I, Introduction Dialog is a bilateral process the par ~ ticipants of which communicate each other messages concerning the surrounding world.
Each participant interchangingly undertakes the role of the author or the recipient.
For communication to be possible the communicants must understand each other, i.e.
%halt knowledge of language and about the world must have a shared part.
Each participant should also know something about the partner his goals, knowledge, possibilities, etc.
The task of a dialog model is a formal description of the process of communication or, in a narrower sense, description of the communicative structure of the text (speech) generated by the communicants in this process.
Such description may be represented, for example, in the form of a generative grammar or graph /Robinson 1982, Metzlng 1981/ and it can be realized on a computer.
One of the aims of working out the dialog models is just to facilitate the communication of man with the computer, bringing it nearer to man-to-man communication.
Next we consider some problems arising in simulating dialog interaction.
2. Communicative cycle and communicative strategy We limit ourselves only to treating such dialogs where the communicants (let 332 them be A and B) as co-operative partners solve some problems.
The unit of simulation will be communicative cycle (CC).
We define CC as dialog arising between two partners during solving a problem.
CC consists of the alternate turn-takings of the communicants though not every such sequence forms a CC.
The turns are built up of communicative acts (CA).
The minimal combination in a CC is a couple or triplet of turn-takings Of the participants (cf.
/Langleben 1984/), for example A: question B: answer, or A: question B: answer A: acceptance of the answer.
Any CC starts with setting up a communicative goal by one of the participants (A).
Let the goal of A be "B does a deed D'°.
In natural communicatlon achieving a goal requires more than one communicative turn-taking from both A and B.
Typically, A has some obstacles in achieving D: e.g.
B does not want to do D; B does not realize that not doing D involves negative consequences; B thinke that he is not able to do D, etc.
For this reason A must, in addition to fixing the goal, also determine the resources he has at his disposal for overcoming these obstacles, and the way of using these resources it means that A must outline the communicative strategy.
Having fixed the goal G, A tries to direct the relevant intellectual and emotional processes of B (his interests, assessments, opinions) during the process of communication in such a way as to eventually lead B to a decision to do D.
In doing so influencing the partner is actually directed at certain aspects of his mind: his knowledge, assumptions, assessments, wishes.
These relevant aspects of the mind of the partner may be called his psychic parametrss, in short P-paramstres.
The decision of B to perform D depends upon the concrete configuration of the values of his P-parametreso The unfavourabls values are %he obstacles mentioned above.
The essence of applying a ~t~ategy lies in the fact that A organizes his t~iPn-takings to B in such a way that their r~)sult6 will be a change in the values of fi~)d P-parametres in a required direction: increasing his knowledge, changing his assessm~3nts, increasing his conviction, Peducing or increasing his wishes, and so on.
Within ;1 fixed strategy certain P-parametres are chosen which can be influenced, the di?ectlon and ways of influence (e.go strategies of threa%enlng, scaring, tempting, convinc:Lng~ etc)~ With respect to the primary comlaunicatlve goal the changing of the values of P-parametres may be called "instrumental goal".
The development of the theory of communicat~ive strategies thus presupposes the developr~ont of a theory of the P-parametres.
I% woui~d be part of a certain qualitative theory of declslon-making and should, in addition ±o explicating the system of Pparametres, explain also the influence of Pparamet%'es upon the decisions made by a person.
The factors that must be taken Into accoun± in shaping a decision ape numerous.
But it turns out that thls diversity can be reduced to a limited number of p~imary paPametres.
We can bring forth the following types of P-parametres: assessments (rational evaluations and those of pleasantness); knowled~e (also skills, experience); intorests; requirements (wishes, needs, among them a need fop communication).
Th~ explication of all possible Pparametl'es requires additional inestlgations (first of all psychological).
In a model of dialog the P-parametres of a communicative partner mare up one part of the model of partner, During communication some of these values ~tay undergo changes.
3. Simulating the communicative cycle First of all let us describe the process of formalizing the notion of communica%ire stt,ategy (CS).
CS may be defined as a procedure which deformities the choice of an author's com~ municatJve acts.
This choice need not be unique.
In this respect CS differs from strategy in the game theory Or from a plan of communication.
The author A has fixed his communlca= tive str.ategy if he i) \]=as established the set of P-parametres of the partner B relevant 'to his communicative goal G it) knows in case of every relevant P-parametre whether in order to achieve the goal G it is necessary to increase or lower the required value iii) has determined among the relevant Pparametres one parametre, changing the value of which is the Immedla%e goal G of implementing the strategy iv) knows in case of every relevant P--parametre how to change its values either directly with the help of certain CAs, or indirectly, by changing the values of other P-parameires.
Let us consider one example of CS.
Let the goal of %he au±hor A of the strategy be G z "B performs a deed D".
(I) The relevant P-parame%res of B: a wish to do D assessment of positive consequences of D assessment of negative consequences of D knowledge of the fulfillment of the preconditions of D, etc.
(2) Let A know that B's wish %o de D is lower than required for doing it.
(3) Let the P-parametme A wan±s to change be B's wlsh to do D (which needs increasing).
This is the immediate goal G i of the strategy.
(4) P-parametres "assossmen±" and "knowledge" can be influenced d~rectly by such communlcative acts as "giving information", "explanation", "substantiation".
The P-papametre "wish to do D" can be influenced only indirectly, through some other P-parametres, e.g. bF increasing B's assessment of positive consequences of D, by lowering B's assessment of negative consequences of D, by increasing B's knowledge about the fulfillment of preconditions of D.
The goal G 1 of applying this strategy is to increase B's wish to do D.
This may proceed in different ways (by setting up some subgoals and applying corresponding suBstrategles): A may increase B's assessment of the positive consequence of D (by giving information of them, substantiating and explaining), i.e. to allure, cajole; A can lower B's assessment of negative con~ sequences of D (by giving information, 555 substantiating and explaining their badheSS), i.e. to warn, threaten, scare: A can increase B's ~nowledge about the fulfillment of the preconditions of D (e.g.
by informing B about the availabilitF of resources required for doing D, explaining it), i.e. tO convince.
The communicative strategy does not de±ermine uniquely the way of achieving a goal (the sequence of communicative acts of the partners) but leaves the freedom of choice.
Constructing the next turn depends among oiheP things upon the changes which have been brought about in the partne~°s model by the information received during interpreting the previous turn-takings of the partner (for eMample, it may happen %hat some assumptions of the author about the partner do not hold).
The communicative cycle proceeds as follows (participants A and B, A is the initiator of communication, G is the com~ municative goal of A).
In accordance with special rules of interest /Saluveer, elm 1986/ A finds the Pparametres of B relevant to the goal G.
On the basis of the partner model A determines the necessary changes in the values of these parametres.
Next, A chooses a relevant P.parametre which value needs changing.
In ±his way he chooses his communicative s±rategy the goal G i of which is changing the value of the chosen P-parametr~ (in such a ~ay as is ~equired for achieving the goal G).
In case of every F-pa~ametre A knows either the list of CAs or the list of other P-parame%res through which i% is possible to increase or lower %he value of the chosen P~ parametre.
In order to achieve the goal G 1 A has therefore either to choose a CA from a given ~ list or determlne a new P-parametre (which, in its turn, determined a new communicative stra±egy which is par% of 'the initial CS) and mare up the next turn-ta~ing.
Partner B whose goal does not need coinside with the goal G determines, according to %he rules of interest, th~ P-paremetres of partne~ A which are relevant to his goal.
On the basis of the model of A (i.e.
his partner model) B determines %he necessary changes in these pa~ametres.
