All sentences of length greater than 40 were ignored for testing purposes as done in both C&C and Goodman (1997).

Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced best-first PCFG parsing, the approach taken here.

Experiment For our experiment, we used a tree-bank grammar induced from sections 2-21 of the Penn Wall Street Journal text (Marcus et al., 1993), with section 22 reserved for testing.

Goodman's results (1997) are hard to compare against ours because his parser returns more than a singe best parse and because he measures processing time, not edges.

Alternatively, it may be that because our FOM causes our parser to prefer edges with a high inside times (estimated) outside probability, it is in fact partially mim132 icking Goodman's (Goodman, 1996) 'Labelled Recall' parsing algorithm, which does not return the highest probability parse but attempts to maximize labelled bracket recall with the test set.

One can imagine the same techniques coupled with more informative probability distributions, such as lexicalized PCFGs (Charniak, 1997), or even grammars not based upon literal rules, but probability distributions that describe how rules are built up from smaller components (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1997).

The next section describes their work in more detail, Besides C&C the work that is most directly comparable to ours is that of Goodman (1997) and Ratnaparki (1997).
