The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in Order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given that several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981; Gmsz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et aL, 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk et al., 1992; Azzam et al., 1998; Hitzeman and P.oesio, 1998).

The oddness of the situation can be explained by the fact that both groups seem primafacie to be righL Empkical experiments studies that employ linear techniques for determining the LPAs of anaphom report recall and precision anaphora resolution results in the range of 80% ~in and I.eass, 1994; Ge et al., 1998).

In other cases, these modules are integrated by means of statistical (Ge et al., 1998) or uncertainty reasoning techniques (Mitkov, 1997).

The units that hierarchically precede a given unit are determined according to Veins Theory (VT) (Cristea et al., 1998), which is described briefly below.

Most current anaphora resolution systems implement a pipeline architecture with three modules CLappin and Leass," 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997).

This is consistent with the distinction between "direct" and "indirect" references discussed by Cristea, et ai.(1998).

Linear-O models an approach that assumes that all anaphors can be resolved intra-uuit; Linear-I models an appreach that corresponds roughly to centering (Grosz et aL, 1995).

Empirical experiments that investigated the relation between discourse structure and reference also claim that by exploiting the structure of discourse one has the potential of determining correct co-referential links for more than 80% of the referential expressions (Fox, 1987; Cristea et al., 1998) although to date, no discourse-based anaphora resolution system has been implemented.

In some cases, anaphora resolution systems implement these modules explicitly (I-Iobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997).

In most cases,, the COLLECT module determines an LPA by enumerating all antecedents in a window of text that pLeced__es the anaphor under scrutiny (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997; Ge et al., 1998).

Veins of child nodes are computed recursively according to the rules described by Cristea et al.(1998).

And the interposition of a nucleus 47 after a satellite blocks the accessibility of the satellite for all nodes that are lower in the corresponding discourse structure (see (Cristea et el., 1998) for a full definition).
