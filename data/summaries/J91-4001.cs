To compare with a similar approach, in Stock's island-driven bidirectional chart (Stock et al.1988), the searching actions are triggered by islands (an island is a more reliable word hypothesis resulting from speech recognition) and the searching directions may be bidirectional; i.e., an active edge may search for constituents on both sides as shown in Figure 6.

Also, Pareschi and Steedman (1987) had proposed another similar bidirectional chart parsing algorithm to handle operations such as functional composition for categorial grammars applications (Steedman 1985).
