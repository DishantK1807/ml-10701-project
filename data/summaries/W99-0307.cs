It has been argued that the reliability of a coding schema can be assessed only on the basis of judgments made by naive coders (Carletta, 1996).

Although we believe that cascade techniques that were used to measure agreement between hierarchies (Moser and Moore, 1997; Carletta et al., 1997) are more adequate for diagnosing problems in the annotation, we found these techniques difficult to apply on our data.

This position was taken by other computational linguists as well (Carletta et al., 1997, p.

style The vast majority of the computational approaches to discourse parsing rely on models that implicitly or explicitly assume that parsing is incremental (Polanyi, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Gardent, 1997; Schilder, 1997; van den Berg, 1996; Cristea and Webber, 1997).

In some cases, the role of these relations was considered to fall outside the scope of a study (Flammia and Zue, 1995); in other cases, judgements were made with respect to a taxonomy of very few intention-based relations (usually dominance and satisfaction-precedence) (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Hirschberg and Litman, 1987; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Carletta et al., 1997).

k -~ P(A) P(E) (3) 1P(E) Carletta (1996) suggests that the units over which the kappa statistic is computed affects the outcome.

For example, Carletta et al.(1997) computed agreement on a coarse segmentation level that was constructed on the top of finer segments, by determining how well coders agreed on where the coarse segments started, and, for agreed starts, by computing how coders agreed on where coarse segments ended.
