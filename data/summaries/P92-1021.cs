Root forms in the lexicon are represented in a discrimination net for efficient access (cf Emirkanian and Bouchard, 1988).

And lattices are also often used in the task of converting Japanese text typed in kana (syllabic symbols) to kanji; the lack of interword spacing in written Japanese and the complex morphology of the language mean that lexical items and their boundaries cannot be reliably identified without applying syntactic and semantic knowledge (Abe et al, 1986).

The key intermediate representation is that of quasi logical.form (QLF; Alshawi, 1990, 1992), a version of slightly extended first order logic augmented with constructs for phenomena such as anaphora and quantification that can only be resolved by reference to context.

3 3This is the reverse of Veronis' (1988) algorithm, where roots are matched before affixes.

Veronis, 1988, Emirkanian and Bouchard, 1988, van Berkel and De Smedt, 1988) emphasizes the former, often on the grounds that competence errors are both harder for the user to correct and tend to make a worse impression on a human reader.

The default methods, all of which may be switched on or off using system commands, supply facilities for inferring entries through access to an external machine-readable dictionary; for defining sequences of capitalized tokens as proper names; for spelling correction (described in detail in the next section); and for interacting with the user who may suggest a replacement word or phrase or enter the VEX lexical acquisition subsystem (Carter, 1989) to create the required entries.
