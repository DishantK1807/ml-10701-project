Automatically annotated texts, produced by systems using the same markup scheme, were then compared with the manually annotated versions, using scoring software made available to MUC participants, based on (Vilain et al., 1995).

in LaSIE The LaSIE system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) and (Humphreys et al., 1998), has been designed as a general purpose IE system which can conform to the MUC task specifications for named entity identification, coreference resolution, IE template element and relation identification, and the construction of scenario-specific IE templates.

It is expressed in the XI formalism (Gaizauskas, 1995) which provides a basic inheritance mechanism for property values and the ability to represent multiple classificatory dimensions in the hierarchy.

This example is taken from a New York Times article in the MUC-7 training corpus on aircraft crashes: 1An important limitation of Sidner's algorithm, noted in (Azzam, 1996), is that the focus registers are only updated after each sentence.

is implemented within the general coreference mechanism provided by the LaSIE (Large Scale Information Extraction) system (Gaizauskas et al., 1995) and (Humphreys et al., 1998), Sheffield University's entry in the MUC-6 and 7 evaluations.

This paper describes an evaluation of a focusbased approach to pronoun resolution (not anaphora in general), based on an extension of Sidner's algorithm (Sidner, 1981) proposed in (Azzam, 1996), with further refinements from development on real-world texts.

Focus-Based Pronoun Resolution in LaSIE Our implementation makes use of the algorithm proposed in (Azzam, 1996), where elementary events (EEs, effectively simple clauses) are used as basic processing units, rather than sentences.
