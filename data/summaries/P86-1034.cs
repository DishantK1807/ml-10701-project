Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983) have made similar claims about the role of non-pronominal definite noun phrases and pronominal definite noun phrases.
P83-1007
The a priori restriction on the set of potential antecedents for anaphora resolution has been called focusing (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1985; Reichman, 1981; Sidner, 1983).
P83-1007 P85-1027
Given that pronominals are used to refer to important or recent concepts (Guindon, 1985), the distribution of antecedents of pronominal anaphors should cluster in the current subdialogue (i.e.
P85-1027
The last structure, the attentional structure, is not discussed here but has been discussed in Guindon (1985).
P85-1027
Empirical evidence for these claims are presented in Guindon (1985).
P85-1027
A cognitive model of anaphora resolution and focusing is provided in Guindon (1985) and Kintsch and van Dijk (1978).
P85-1027
Some of these markers have been reported by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), and Polanyi and Scha (1983).
P83-1007
The results of Guindon (1985) showing different anaphora resolution times for different types of anaphors with antecedent in or out of focus also support the refocusing" theories of anaphora resolution.
P85-1027
The allocation of short-term memory during discourse comprehension corresponds to the concept of attentional state (Grosz and Sidner, 1985) and is described in more detail in Guindon (1985).
P85-1027
The determined boundary markers were consistent with those found by Grosz (1977), Reichman (1981), and Polanyi and Scha (1983).
P83-1007
This other factor is topicality or importance (Guindon, 1985; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978).
