Possibilities include associating items with similar existing senses (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2005) or clustering them into approximate senses.

There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2005), which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection.

The Berkeley FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) is building a semantic lexicon for English describing the frames and linking them to the words and expressions that can evoke them.

They were parsed with Minipar (Lin, 1993); named entities were computed using Heart of Gold (Callmeier et al., 2004).

This is problematic for the use of FrameNet analyses as a basis for inferences over text, as e.g. in Tatu and Moldovan (2005).

The analysis is based on FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), a resource that lists senses and semantic roles for English expressions.
