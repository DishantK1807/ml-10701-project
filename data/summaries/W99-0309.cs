What does exist at the moment is coding schemes for particular domains and/or applications: in the case of dialogue acts, for example, there are several 'specific' schemes for given applications, some of which have been shown to lead to reliable coding (Alexandersson et al., 1997; Carletta et al., 1997).

<anchor href="coref, xmlSid(de_88)" type="subset " /> </link> <link href=" corer, xml#id (de_90)" type="subset " > <anchor href-"coref, xml#id(de_88)"/> </link> As the poor reliability scores which have been obtained by (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) for this kind of scheme indicate, once one moves beyond the ident relation, it can be difficult to decide how to classify the link between two elements.

In their reliability study, (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) found a fair agreement among annotators (K = .76) concerning which NPS were anaphoric and which ones were not, and about 95% agreement on antecedents for those definite descriptions that all subjects ideatiffed as anaphoric; but no agreement on identif.ving bridging references (K=.24), and often different antecedents were indicated for those that all annotators classified as bridges.
