To overcome the problem of varying link distances, Agirre and Rigau (1996) propose a semantic similarity measure (referred to as "conceptual density") which is sensitive to i) the length of the path, ii) the depth of the nodes in the hierarchy (deeper nodes are ranked closer) and iii) the density of nodes in the subhierarchies (concepts involved in a denser subhierarchy are ranked closer than those in a more sparse region).

As a somewhat radical alternative to taxonomical relationships, other ways of measuring semantic similarity based on distributional evidence have been put forward in the literature (see, among others, Brown et al.1991, Gale et al.1992, Pereira and Tishby 1992), which emphasise the role played by context in this game.

In some experiments of syntactic disambiguation (subject/object assignment in Italian, Montemagni 1995, Montemagni et al.1996), we tried to combine both taxonomical and distributional measures in such a way that the system retied on taxonomical information first, to turn to distributional evidence only when the first step was not conclusive.

4. Distributionally-based semantic similarity A semantic similarity measure computed on the basis of distributional evidence is at work in SENSE, an example-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) system carrying out the task on the basis of a representative set of typical patterns of use (Federici et al.1997). In particular, SENSE presupposes prior availability of verb-noun pairs where the contextually relevant sense of the verb token is assigned.
