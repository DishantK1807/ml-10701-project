The Web is being explored not only as a super corpus for NLP and linguistic research (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003) but also, more importantly to MT research, as a treasure for mining bitexts of various language pairs (Resnik, 1999; Chen and Nie, 2000; Nie and Cai, 2001; Nie and Chen, 2002; Resnik and Smith, 2003; Way and Gough, 2003).

Existing parallel corpora have illustrated their particular value in empirical NLP research, e.g., Canadian Hansard Corpus (Gale and Church, 1991b), HK Hansard (Wu, 1994), INTERSECT (Salkie, 1995), ENPC (Ebeling, 1998), the Bible parallel corpus (Resnik et al., 1999) and many others.

Large volumes of training data of this kind are indispensable for constructing statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 2000), acquiring bilingual lexicon (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 1997), and building example-based machine translation (EBMT) systems (Nagao, 1984; Carl and Way, 2003; Way and Gough, 2003).
