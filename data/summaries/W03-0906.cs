We do not completely rule out the possibility that some more sophisticated, ontologically promiscuous, first-order analysis (perhaps along the lines of (Hobbs, 1985)) might account for these kinds of monotonicity inferences.

Evaluation of essentially the same grammar on a dependency annotated subset of section 23 of the UPenn Wall Street Journal gives the accuracy of best parses as 85%, increasing by another 4% for nonfragmentary analyses (Riezler et al., 2002).
P02-1035
More sophisticated first-order accounts (Hirst, 1991; Hobbs, 1985) may be extendable to bear this load.
