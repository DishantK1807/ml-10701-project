We are using ITSPOKE as a platform for examining whether acoustic-prosodic information can be used to improve the recognition of pedagogically useful information such as student emotion (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), and whether speech can improve the performance evaluations of dialogue tutoring systems (e.g., as measured by learning gains, ef ciency, usability, etc).
