Similarly, Beesley (1996) seems content in employing a great number of CV templates in his large-scale finite-state model of Arabic morphology, which are intersected with lexical roots and then transformed to surface realizations by various epenthesis, deletion and assimilation rules.

Kiraz (1996) uses multi-~tape two-level morphology to analyze some Arabic data, but despite the suggestive title must simulate prosodic operations such as 'add a mora' by their extensionalized rule counterparts, which refer to C or V segments instead of moras.

A recent proposal by Karttunen (1998) dispenses with the weights while still relying on the same regularity assumption.
W98-1301
The OT framework itself has been shown to be expressible with weighted finite-state automata, weighted intersection and bestpath algorithms (Ellison 1994) if constraints and OT's GEN component the function from underlying forms to prosodified surface forms are regular sets.
