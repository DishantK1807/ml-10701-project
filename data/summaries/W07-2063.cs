Here, we concentrate on the following SemEval 2007 Web People Search Task (Artiles et al., 2007): a search engine user types in a person name as a query.
W07-2012
As past and recent research (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Phan et al., 2006), we have addressed the problem as a document clustering problem.
P98-1012
The documents are analysed by the default GATE1 ANNIE system (Cunningham et al., 2002) and single document summarization modules (Saggion and Gaizauskas, 2004b) from our summarization toolkit2.
P02-1022
Statistics (term frequencies and tf*idf) are computed over tokens and Mentions using the appropriate tables (these tools are part of the summarization toolkit) and vector representations created for each document (same as in (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)).
