It would be also interesting to compare our solution with different approaches found in the literature, as for example [Reiter and Dale, 1992] or [Krahmer and Theune, 2000] for the referring expression generation, and the one of Dalianis and Hovy [Dalianis and Hovy, 1996] for the aggregation.

Finally, it is important to note that our approach presents some differences respect to the one of Reiter and Dale [Reiter and Dale, 1992].

Genetic algorithms are also used in [Mellish et al., 1998] where the authors state the problem of given a set of facts to convey and a set of rhetorical relations that can be used to link them together, how one can arrange this material so as to yield the best possible text.

Kibble and Power [Kibble and Power, 2000] propose a system which uses Centering Theory [Walker et al., 1998] for planning of coherent texts and choice of referring expressions.

As shown in [Reiter and Dale, 1992], a referring expression must communicate enough information to be able to uniquely identify the intended referent in the current discourse context, but avoiding the presence of redundant or otherwise unnecessary modifiers.
