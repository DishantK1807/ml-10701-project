Experiments on the ATIS corpus For our experiments we used part-of-speech sequences of spoken-language transcriptions from the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990), with the labeled-bracketings of those sequences in the Penn Treebank (Marcus, 1991).

Most instantiations of this idea estimate the probability of a parse by assigning application probabilities to context free rewrite roles (Jelinek, 1990), or by assigning combination probabilities to elementary structures (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992).

In stochastic tree-adjoining grammar (Schabes, 1992), this lack of context-sensitivity is overcome by assigning probabilities to larger structural units.

In (Bod, 1992b) superstrong equivalence relations between other stochastic grammars are studied.

For a treatment of DOP in more formal terms we refer to (Bod, 1992a).

In (Pereira and Schabes, 1992), 90.36% bracketing accuracy was reported using a stochastic CFG trained on bracketings from the ATIS corpus.

In (Schabes, 1992) it is proposed to infer a stochastic TAG from a large training corpus using an inside-outside-like iterative algorithm.

Data Oriented Parsing fDOP) (Scha, 1990; Bod, 1992a), distinguishes itself from other statistical approaches in that it omits the step of inferring a grammar from a corpus.

Carlo Parsing It is easy to show that an input string can be parsed with conventional parsing techniques, by applying subtrees instead of rules to the input string (Bod, 1992a).

An important advantage of using a corpus for probability calculation, is that no tr0jning of parameters is needed, as is the case for other stochastic grammars (Jelinek et al., 1990; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Schabes, 1992).
