Depending on the method, patterns rely on morpho-syntactic properties (Daille, 1996; Ibekwe-SanJuan, 1998), the co-occurrence of terms and connectors (Enguehard, 1992; Baroni and Bernardini, 2004) or the alternation of informative and non-informative words (Vergne, 2005).

For instance, the frequency of occurrence of a word in a domain-specific corpus can be compared with its frequency of occurrence in a reference corpus (Rayson and Garside, 2000; Baroni and Bernardini, 2004).

Consequently, insteadofrelyingonasubworddictionary to analyse compounds like (Schulz et al., 2002), our method makes use of these regularities to automatically extract prefixes and initial combining forms from corpora.

The method for the identification of compound words could be improved by an automatic approach to morphological segmentation as done by (Creutz and Lagus, 2004).

This table also gives the number of key words, i.e., single-word terms extracted by comparing the frequency of occurrence of words in both corpora for each language (Rayson and Garside, 2000).
