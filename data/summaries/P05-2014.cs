Labelling was carried out by three computational linguistics graduate students with 89% agreement resulting in a Kappa statistic of 0.87, which is a satisfactory indication that our corpus can be labelled with high reliability using our tag set (Carletta, 1996).

Aspects of dialogue macrogame theory (DMT) (Mann, 2002) may help to increase tagging accuracy.

Although this is higher than the results from 13 recent studies presented by Stolcke et al.(2000) with accuracy ranging from â‰ˆ 40% to 81.2%, the tasks, data, and tag sets used were all quite different, so any comparison should be used as only a guideline.

Set We chose 12 tags by manually labelling the dialogue corpus using tags that seemed appropriate from the 42 tags used by Stolcke et al.(2000) based on the Dialog Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) tag set (Core and Allen, 1997).
J00-3003
Although other studies have attempted to automatically tag utterances with dialogue acts (Stolcke et al., 2000; Jurafsky et al., 1997; Kita et al., 1996) it is difficult to fairly compare results because the data was significantly different (transcribed spoken dialogue versus typed dialogue) and the dialogue acts were also different ranging from a set of 9 (Kita et al., 1996) to 42 (Stolcke et al., 2000).
J00-3003
A superset of dialogue acts that covers all domains would necessarily be a large number of tags (at least the 42 identified by Stolcke et al.(2000)) with many tags not being appropriate for other domains.
J00-3003
Stolcke et al.(2000) point out that the use of dialogue acts is a useful first level of analysis for describing discourse structure.
J00-3003
Dialogue acts have been used to benefit tasks such as machine translation (Tanaka and Yokoo, 1999) and the automatic detection of dialogue games (Levin et al., 1999).
