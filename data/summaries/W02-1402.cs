A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).

Based on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown et al.(1993), the basic principle of our translation model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sentences, if two words often co-occur in the source and target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they are translations of each other.

Brown et al.(1993) defined a series of probabilistic translation models for MT purposes.

Another body of related work is the literature on word clustering in computational linguistics (Brown et al.1992; Finch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grefenstette 1994a) and document clustering in information retrieval (van Rijsbergen 1979; Willett 1988; Sparck-Jones 1991; Cutting et al.1992). In contrast to this earlier work, we cluster contexts or, equivalently, word tokens here, not words (or, more precisely, word types) or documents.
