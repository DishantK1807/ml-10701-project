Satta and Peserico (2005) showed that a permutation can be defined for any length n such that tabular parsing strategies must take at least Ω(Nc√n), that is, the exponent of the algorithm is proportional to the square root of the rule length.

Thus, not only do there exist permutations that have complexity higher than the square root case of Satta and Peserico (2005), but in fact the probability that a randomly chosen permutation will have higher complexity approaches one as the rule length grows.
