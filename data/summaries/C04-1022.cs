Word Representations A recently developed approach that addresses this problem is that of Factored Language Models (FLMs) (Kirchho et al., 2002; Bilmes and Kirchho, 2003), whose basic idea is to decompose words into sets of features (or factors) instead of viewing them as unanalyzable wholes.

Several techniques have been developed to address this problem, in particular smoothing techniques (Chen and Goodman, 1998) and class-based language models (Brown and others, 1992).

FLMs have been implemented as an add-on to the widely-used SRILM toolkit1 and have been used successfully for the purpose of morpheme-based language modeling (Bilmes and Kirchho, 2003), multi-speaker language modeling (Ji and Bilmes, 2004), and speech recognition (Kirchho et al., 2003).
