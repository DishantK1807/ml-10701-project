For example, decision tree induction has been applied to word sense disambiguation (Black 1988), determiner prediction (Knight et al.1995), coordination parsing (Resnik 1993), syntactic parsing (Magerman 1993), and disambiguating clue phrases (Siegel 1994; Siegel and McKeown 1994; Litman 1994).

This section evaluates an approach to clustering verbs developed and implemented by Hatzivassiloglou, based on previous work for semantically clustering adjectives (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Hatzivassiloglou 1997).

Clauses with have as their main verb, composing 8.0% of the corpus, are highly ambiguous, and have been addressed separately by considering the direct object of such clauses (Siegel 1998a, 1998b).

These tendencies are likely to correlate with aspectual class (Klavans and Chodorow 1992).

â€¢ In related work, clausal constituents other than the verb can be incorporated to help resolve ambiguity and alleviate verb sparsity (Siegel 1998a, 1998b).

Linguistic models motivate the division between a module that first detects fundamental aspect and a second that detects aspectual transformations (Hwang and Schubert 1991; Schubert and Hwang 1990; Dorr 1992; Passonneau 1988; Moens and Steedman 1988; Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1994).
J88-2003 J88-2005
Aspectual classification is also a necessary prerequisite for interpreting certain adverbial adjuncts, as well as identifying temporal constraints between sentences in a discourse (Moens and Steedman 1988; Dorr 1992; Klavans 1994).
J88-2003
Aspectual coercion, a second type of aspectual transformation, can take place when a clause is modified by an aspectual marker that violates an aspectual constraint (Moens and Steedman 1988; Pustejovsky 1991).

3. Linguistic Indicators Aspectually categorizing verbs is the first step towards aspectually classifying clauses, since many clauses in certain domains can be categorized based on their main verb only (Siegel 1997, 1998b, 1999).
P99-1015 W97-0318 W98-0702
In addition, it is crucial for lexical choice and tense selection in machine translation (Moens and Steedman 1988; Klavans and Chodorow 1992; Klavans 1994; Dorr 1992).
C92-4177 J88-2003
Previous efforts have applied machine induction methods to coordinate corpusbased linguistic indicators in particular, for example, to classify adjectives according to markedness (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1995), to perform accent restoration (Yarowsky 1994), for sense disambiguation problems (Luk 1995), and for the automatic identification of semantically related groups of words (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Schi.itze 1992).

If a clause occurring: necessarily entails: then it must be: in past progressive tense as argument of stopped in simple present tense past tense reading past tense reading the habitual reading Nonculminated Event Nonculminated Event or State Event 2.3 Interpreting Temporal Connectives and Modifiers Several researchers have developed models that incorporate aspectual class to assess temporal constraints between connected clauses (Hwang and Schubert 1991; Schubert and Hwang 1990; Dorr 1992; Passonneau 1988; Moens and Steedman 1988; Hitzeman, Moens, and Grover 1994).

Further cognitive and philosophical rationales behind these semantic distinctions are surveyed by Siegel (1998b).

A verb's aspectual category can be predicted by co-occurrence frequencies between the verb and linguistic phenomena such as the progressive tense and certain temporal modifiers (Klavans and Chodorow 1992).

6. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised methods for clustering words have been developed that do not require manually marked examples (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Schfitze 1992).

Markers and Constraints Certain features of a clause, such as the presence of adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the aspectual class of the clause (Vendler 1967; Dowty 1979; Pustejovsky 1991; Passonneau 1988; Klavans 1994; Resnik 1996; Olsen and Resnik 1997).

Further details regarding the measurement of these indicators, and the linguistic constraints that motivate them, can be found in Siegel (1998b).

For more detail on the clustering algorithm and further results see Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Hatzivassiloglou (1997).

Note, however, that there are several advantages to linguistic indicators that measure the frequency of linguistic phenomena such as the progressive over measuring the frequencies of open-class words (Siegel 1998b).

Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectual classification by placing verbs on a scale according to the frequency with which they occur with certain aspectual markers from Table 2.

A comparison between human markers for this test was performed over a different corpus, and is reported below in Section 5.2.1. 5 For evaluation over sets of unique verbs, see Siegel (1998b).

For example, in a separate study, optimizing for F-measure resulted in a more dramatic trade-off in recall values as compared to those attained when optimizing for accuracy (Siegel 1998b).

Further analysis of such results are given by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993).

We employ the English Slot Grammar (ESG) parser (McCord 1990), which has previously been used on corpora to accumulate aspectual data (Klavans and Chodorow 1992).

baselines for comparison have been used for many classification problems (Duda and Hart 1973), e.g., part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988; Allen 1995).

E-mail: kathy@cs.columbia.edu @ 2001 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Moens and Steedman 1988; Dorr 1992; Klavans 1994) and is therefore a required component for applications that perform certain natural language interpretation, generation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.

These applications require the ability to reason about time, i.e., temporal reasoning.

604 Siegel and McKeown Improving Aspectual Classification 4.1 Logistic Regression As suggested by Klavans and Chodorow (1992), a weighted sum of multiple indicators that results in one "overall" indicator may provide an increase in classification performance.

Furthermore, indicators measured over multiple clausal constituents (e.g., main verb-object pairs) alleviate verb ambiguity and sparsity and improve classification performance (Siegel 1998b).

This incompleteness has been illustrated empirically by showing that some indicators help for only a subset of verbs (Siegel 1998b).
