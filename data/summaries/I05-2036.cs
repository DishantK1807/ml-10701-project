role identification There are number of different existing approaches for identifying semantic roles, varying from traditional parsing approaches, for example using HPSG grammars and Lexical Functional Grammars, that strongly rely on manuallydeveloped grammars and lexicons, to data-driven approaches, for example AutoSlog (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998).

In the domain of the Air Traveler Information System (Miller et al., 1996) the authors apply statistical methods to compute the probability that a constituent can fill in a semantic slot within a semantic frame.

Gildea and Jurafsky (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) describe a statistical approach for semantic role labelling using data collected from FrameNet by analysing a number of features such as phrase type, grammatical function, position in the sentence, etc.
