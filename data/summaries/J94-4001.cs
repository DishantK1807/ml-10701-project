In English, conversely, the phrase following the conjunction is the posthead, and the pre-head is searched for in the same way (Agarwal and Boggess 1992).

A method proposed by some researchers (Agarwal and Boggess 1992; Nagao et al.1983) for selecting the correct structure is, in outline, that the two most similar components to the left side and to the right side of a conjunction are detected as two conjoined heads in a conjunctive structure.

Nevertheless, most work in this area (e.g., Dahl and McCord 1983; Fong and Berwick 1985; Hirschman 1986; Kaplan and Maxwell 1988; Sag et al.1985; Sedogbo 1985; Steedman 1990; Woods 1973) has concerned the problem of creating candidate conjunctive structures or explaining correct conjunctive structures, and not the method for selecting correct structures among many candidates.
