Our lexicon is built automatically using a previously developed word aligner based on the k-vec aligner as outlined by (Fung & Church, 1994).

3 Data-Oriented Translation Data-Oriented Translation (DOT) (Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003), which is based on DataOriented Parsing (DOP) (Bod, 1998; Bod et al., 2003), comprises a context-rich, experience-based approach to translation, where new translations are derived with reference to grammatical analyses of previous translations.
C00-2092
(Matsumoto et al., 1993) and (Imamura, 2001) focus on using alignments to help resolve parsing ambiguities.
P93-1004
(Matsumoto et al., 1993) align 〈source,target〉 dependency trees, with a view to resolve parsing ambiguities, but their approach cannot deal with complex or compound sentences.
P93-1004
(Eisner, 2003) outlines a computationally expensive structural manipulation tool which he has used for intra-lingual translation but has yet to apply to interlingual translation.
P03-2041
(Eisner, 2003) presents a tree-mapping method for use on dependency trees which he claims can be adapted for use with PS trees.
P03-2041
(Gildea, 2003) performs tree-totree alignment, but treats it as part of a generative statistical translation model, rather than a seperate task.
P03-1011
(Gildea, 2003) outlines an algorithm for use in syntax-based statistical models of MT, applying a statistical TSG with probabilities parameterized to generate the target tree conditioned on the structure of the source tree.
P03-1011
(Kay and R¨oscheisen, 1993; Gale & Church, 1993), no methods exist for aligning non-isomorphic phrasestructure (PS) tree fragments at sub-sentential level for use in MT.
J93-1004 J93-1006
However, unlike (Gildea, 2003), we treat the problem of alignment as a seperate task rather than as part of a generative translation model.
P03-1011
In previous approaches to Data-Oriented Translation (DOT: (Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003)), such fragments were produced manually.
