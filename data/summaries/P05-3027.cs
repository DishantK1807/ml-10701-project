Our initial work (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) focused on word sense discrimination, which takes as input contexts that each contain a given target word, and produces as output clusters that are presumed to correspond to the different senses of the word.

Previous work in word sense discrimination has shown that contexts of an ambiguous word can be effectively represented using first order (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) or second order (SchÂ¨utze, 1998) representations.
