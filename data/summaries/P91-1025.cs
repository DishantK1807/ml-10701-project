llThis parameter may be tied to the "intentional" aspect of discourse as proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).

More general approaches to divergences allow (iii) MULTI-LEVEL MAPPINGS, i.e., direct transfer rules for mapping between different representation levels, e.g., structural correspondences of Kaplan et al.(1989), typed feature structure rewriting system of Zajac (1989), and abduction-based system of Hobbs and Kameyama (1990).

¢ • reference time = the time pivot of the linguistic SOur characterization of the context of utterance draws on a number of existing approaches to discourse representation and discourse processing, most notably those of Grosz and Sidner (1986), Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp 1981, Helm 1982), Situation Semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983, Gawron and Peters 1990), and Linguistic Discourse Model (Scha and Polanyi 1988).

See, e.g., Scha and Polanyi (1988) and Hobbs (1990) for discourse structure models.

Consider another example, a portion of step-bystep instructions for copying a file from a remote system to a local system: EXAMPLE 2: FTP ~Thls term was taken from Dorr (1990) where the problem of divergences in verb predicate-argument structures was treated.

One way to implement these methods is in the abduction-based system proposed by Hobbs and Kameyama (1990).

They can be handled by (i) STRUCTURE-TO-STRUCTURE TRANSFERS, e.g., structural transformations of Nagao (1987), the sublanguage approach of Kosaka et al (1988), or by (ii) TRANSFER VIA A "DEEPER" COMMON GROUND, e.g., the entity-level of Carbonell and Tomita (1987), the lexical-conceptual structure of Dorr (1990).
