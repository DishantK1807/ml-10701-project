More details on the building of this vector space model can be found in (Widdows, 2003; Widdows and Peters, 2003).

This method was used because it has been found to be effective at producing good term-term similarities for word-sense disambiguation (Sch¨utze, 1998) and automatic lexical acquisition (Widdows, 2003), and these similarities wereused to generateinteresting queries and to judge the effectiveness of different forms of negation.

Ribiero-Neto, 1999), and from this original application vector models have been applied to semantic tasks such as word-sense acquisition (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Widdows, 2003) and disambiguation (Sch¨utze, 1998).

It turns out that these vector connectives are precisely those used in quantum logic (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936), a development which is discussed in much more detail in (Widdows and Peters, 2003).

The mathematical apparatus is covered in greater detail in (Widdows and Peters, 2003).

Theoretical motivation for this formulation can be found in (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936, §1,§6) and (Widdows and Peters, 2003): for example, B is the smallest subspace of V which contains the set {bj}.
