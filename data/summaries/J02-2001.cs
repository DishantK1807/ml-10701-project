It is not within the scope of this paper to develop solutions to this general problem (but see Nirenburg, Lesser, and Nyberg [1989], Wanner and Hovy [1996], Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin [1997], and Stede [1999] for a variety of solutions).

Given a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained language-independent concepts, a set of near-synonyms is simply a set of words that all link to the same language-independent concept (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993; Hirst 1995).

Indeed, many recent text generation systems, including MOOSE (Stede 1999), ADVISOR II (Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin 1997), and Hunter-Gatherer (Beale et al.1998), among others (see Reiter and Dale’s [1997] survey), adopt this view, yet their lexical-choice components do not account for near-synonymy.

9. Related Work Most computational work on near-synonymy has been motivated by lexical mismatches in machine translation (Kameyama et al.1991). In interlingual MT, an intermediate representational scheme, such as an ontology in knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) (Nirenburg et al.1992), or lexical-conceptual structures in UNITRAN (Dorr 1993) is used in encoding lexical meaning (and all other meaning).

There are many different similarity measures, which variously use taxonomic lexical hierarchies or lexical-semantic networks, large text corpora, word definitions in machine-readable dictionaries or other semantic formalisms, or a combination of these (Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Kozima and Furugori 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Church et al.1994; Grefenstette 1994; Resnik 1995; McMahon and Smith 1996; Jiang and Conrath 1997; Sch ¨utze 1998; Lin 1998; Resnik and Diab 2000; Budanitsky 1999; Budanitsky and Hirst 2001, 2002).

4 DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) found that whereas some differentiae are easily expressed in terms of clear-cut abstract (or symbolic) features such as 4 The classic opposition of denotation and connotation is not precise enough for our needs here.
E93-1055 J93-3002
Viegas (1998), on the other hand, describes a preliminary solution that accounts for semantic vagueness and underspecification in a generative framework.

And third, although corpus-based methods (e.g., Lin’s [1998]) do compute different similarity values for different pairs of near-synonyms of the same cluster, Church et al.(1994) and Edmonds (1997) show that such methods are not yet capable of uncovering the more subtle differences in the use of near-synonyms for lexical choice.

preference is like a floating constraint (Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin 1997) in that it can be satisfied by different types of decision in sentence planning but differs in that it may be satisfied to different degrees.

Because style is a global aspect of text, a certain style can be (and should be) achieved by more than just lexical choice; structural choices are just as important (DiMarco and Hirst 1993).
J93-3002
Since there is as yet no comprehensive theory of style, our approach is similar to past approaches, such as those of DiMarco and Hirst (1993), Stede (1993), and Hovy (1988).

Near-synonymy seems to have been of little concern, however, in statistical MT research: The seminal researchers, Brown et al.(1990), viewed such variations as a matter of taste; in evaluating their system, two different translations of the same source that convey roughly the same meaning (perhaps with different words) are considered satisfactory translations.
J90-2002
Many stylistic dimensions have been proposed by Hovy (1988), Nirenburg and Defrise (1992), Stede (1993), and others.

of the Model Our model is based on the contention that the meaning of an open-class content word, however it manifests itself in text or speech, arises out of a context-dependent combination of a basic inherent context-independent denotation and a set of explicit differences 12 EuroWordNet’s Inter-Lingual-Index (Vossen 1998) links the synsets of different languages in such a manner, and Resnik and Yarowsky (1999) describe a related notion for defining word senses cross-lingually.
P98-2127
Even if a statistical approach could account for near-synonymy, Edmonds (1997) showed that its strength is not in choosing the right word, but rather in determining which near-synonym is most typical or natural in a given context.
P97-1067
In general, near-synonyms can differ with respect to any aspect of their meaning (Cruse 1986): • denotational variations, in a broad sense, including propositional, fuzzy, and other peripheral aspects • stylistic variations, including dialect and register • expressive variations, including emotive and attitudinal aspects • structural variations, including collocational, selectional, and syntactic variations Building on an earlier analysis by DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) of the types of differentiae used in synonym discrimination dictionaries, Edmonds (1999) classifies near-synonymic variation into 35 subcategories within the four broad categories above.
E93-1055 J93-3002
Usually, words that are close in meaning are near-synonyms (or plesionyms) 1 — almost synonyms, but not quite; very similar, but not identical, in meaning; not fully intersubstitutable, but instead varying in their shades of denotation, connotation, implicature, emphasis, or register (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993).
