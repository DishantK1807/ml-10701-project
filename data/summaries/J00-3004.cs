The way in which Chinese characters are used in names differs greatly from the way they are used in ordinary text, and some researchers, notably Sproat et al.(1996), have established special-purpose recognizers for Chinese names (and translated foreign names), designed to improve the accuracy of automatic segmenters by treating names specially.

Hockenmaier and Brew (1998) present an algorithm, based on Palmer's (1997) experiments, that applies a symbolic machine learning technique--transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill 1995)--to the problem of Chinese word segmentation.

According to Sproat et al.(1996) and Wu and Fung (1994), experiments show that only about 75% agreement between native speakers is to be expected on the "correct" segmentation, and the figure reduces as more people become involved.

Sproat et al.(1996) implement special recognizers not only for Chinese names and transliterated foreign names, but for components of morphologically obtained words as well.
