Other approaches to improving alignment have combined alignment models, e.g., using a log-linear combination (Och and Ney, 2003) or mutually independent association clues (Tiedemann, 2003).

(Toutanova et al., 2002) or dependency relations (Cherry and Lin, 2003).

We computed precision, recall and error rate on the entire set of sentence pairs for each data set.5 To evaluate NeurAlign, we used GIZA++ in both directions (E-to-F and F-to-E, where F is either Chinese (C) or Spanish (S)) as input and a refined alignment approach (Och and Ney, 2000) that uses a heuristic combination method called grow-diagfinal (Koehn et al., 2003) for comparison.

Some NLP applications for classifier ensembles are POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; Abney et al., 1999), PP attachment (Abney et al., 1999), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002), and parsing (Henderson and Brill, 2000).

Word-level alignment is a critical component of a wide range of NLP applications, such as construction of bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Diab and Resnik, 2002), projection of language resources (Yarowsky et al., 2001), and statistical machine translation.

Dependency relations are produced using a version of the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) that has been adapted for building dependencies.

For example, Liu (2005) uses a log-linear combination of linguistic features.

We generate POS tags using the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for English and Chinese, and Connexor for Spanish.
