Very different techniques are required to deal with audio or analogue equivalent waveforms (Elliott and Atwell, 2000; Elliott and Atwell, 1999).

Without committing ourselves to a formal phrase structure approach, (in the Chomskian sense) or even to a less formal 'chunking' of language (Sparkle Project, 2000), it is this universal hierarchical structure, evident in all human languages and believed necessary for any advanced communicator, that constitutes the next phase in our signal analysis (Elliott and Atwell, 2000).

'Phrase-like' chunks Having detected a signal which satisfies criteria indicating language-like structures at a physical level (Elliott and Atwell, 2000; Elliott and Atwell, 1999), second stage analysis is required to begin the process of identifying internal grammatical components, which constitute the basic building blocks of the symbol system.
