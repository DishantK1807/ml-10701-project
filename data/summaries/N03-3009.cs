In Section 3, we compare the segmentation performance of our lexical chaining algorithm with two other well known lexical cohesion based approaches to segmentation; namely TextTiling (Hearst 1997) and C99 (Choi 2000).

The aim of early segmentation research was to model the discourse structure of a text, thus focusing on the detection of finegrained topic shifts, at a clausal, sentence or passage/subtopic level (Hearst 1997).

To test this observation we re-ran C99 and TextTiling experiments on the Reuters and CNN C B A collections, using only nouns, adjectives, nominalized verbs (provided by the NOMLEX (Meyers et al.1998)), and nominalized adjectives as input.

The first by Okumara and Honda (1994) involved an evaluation based on five Japanese texts, the second by Stairmand (1997) used twelve general interest magazine articles and the third by Kan et al.(1998) used fifteen Wall Street Journal and five Economist articles.

As explained in Section 3, we determine the effectiveness of our SeLeCT system with respect to two other lexical cohesion based approaches to segmentation, namely the TextTiling (Hearst 1997) and C99 algorithms (Choi 2000)2.

However, in a recent publication Pevzner and Hearst (2002) highlight several faults with the Pk metric.

More specifically, lexical cohesion ‘is the cohesion that arises from semantic relationships between words’ (Morris, Hirst 1991).
J91-1002
In (Choi 2000) boundaries are hypothesized using sentences as the basic unit of text; however both C99 and TextTiling can take advantage of paragraph information when the input consists of one paragraph per line.

In future experiments we plan to compare SeLeCT’s performance on written and spoken news texts with two recently proposed systems, U00 (Utiyama 2001) and CWM (Choi 2001), which have marginally outperformed the C99 algorithm on Choi’s (2000) test corpus.
