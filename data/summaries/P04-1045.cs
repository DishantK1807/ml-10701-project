In (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), we discuss a scheme for manually annotating student turns in a human-human tutoring dialogue corpus for intuitively perceived emotions.2 These emotions are viewed along a linear scale, shown and de ned as follows: negative a12a14a13 neutral a13a16a15 positive.

As discussed in (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004), two annotators had previously labeled 453 turns in this corpus with the emotion annotation scheme discussed in Section 3, and performed a preliminary set of machine learning experiments (different from those reported above).

We continue to manually annotate ITSPOKE data, and are exploring partial automation via semi-supervised machine learning (Maeireizo-Tokeshi et al., 2004).

Our corpus of dialogues with ITSPOKE was collected from November 2003 April 2004, as part of an evaluation comparing ITSPOKE, Why2-Atlas, and human tutoring (Litman et al., 2004).

(Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) further details our annotation scheme and discusses how it builds on related work.

2 Computer-Human Dialogue Data Our data consists of student dialogues with ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system) (Litman and Silliman, 2004), a spoken dialogue tutor built on top of the Why2-Atlas conceptual physics text-based tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2002).

In prior work we built on and generalized such research, by de ning a three-way distinction between negative, neutral, and positive student emotional states that could be reliably annotated and accurately predicted in human-human spoken tutoring dialogues (ForbesRiley and Litman, 2004; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004).

Moreover, based on results in (Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004), we hypothesized that combining speech and lexical features would result in better performance than either feature set alone.
