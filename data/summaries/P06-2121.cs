To address the problems, we take the notion of weakly supervised (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) or unsupervised learning (Hasegawa, 2004; Grenager et al., 2005) to develop a framework able to bootstrap with a small set of seed patterns, and then induce more relevant patterns form the unannotated psychiatry web corpora.

A possible solution to reducing the problem is to use a general-purpose ontology 945 such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), or a domainspecific ontology constructed using automatic approaches (Yeh et al., 2004).

Traditional approaches to semantic pattern induction can be generally divided into two streams: knowledge-based approaches and corpus-based approaches (Lehnert et al., 1992; Muslea, 1999).
