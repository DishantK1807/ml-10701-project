X, Y and other Zs) which associate synonyms and hyponyms (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).

However, corpus size is no longer a limiting factor: whereas up to now people have typically worked with corpora of around one million words, it has become feasible to build much larger document collections; for example, Banko and Brill (2001) report on experiments with a one billion word corpus.

Banko and Brill, (2001) also found this trend for the task of confusion set disambiguation on corpora of up to one billion words.

Most systems extract co-occurrence and syntactic information from the words surrounding the target term, which is then converted into a vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).

Since MINIPAR performs morphological analysis on the context relations we have added an existing morphological analyser (Minnen et al., 2000) to the other extractors.
