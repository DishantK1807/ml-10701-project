The Influence of Tagging on the Classification of Lexical Complements Catherine Macleod, Adam Meyers, and Ralph Grishman, Computer Science Department New York University 715 Broadway, 7th Floor New York, NY 10003 {macleod, meyers, gri shman}@c s.
nyu. edu Abstract A large corpus (about 100 MB of text) was selected and examples of 750 fl'equently occurring verbs were tagged with their compleinent (:lass as defined by a large computational syntactic dictionary, COMLEX Syntax.
This tagging task led to the refinement of already existing classes and to the addition of classes that had previously not been defined.
This has resulted in the enrichment and improvement of the original COMLEX Syntax dictionary.
Tagging also provides statistical data which will allow users to select, more common complelnents of a particular verb and ignore rare usage.
We discuss below some of the problems encountered in tagging and their resolution.
1 Introduction
COMLEX Syntax is a moderately-broad-coverage English lexicon (with about 38,000 root; forms) developed at New York University under contract to the Linguistic Data Consortium; the first version of the lexicon was delivered in May 1994.
The tagged version was delivered in August 1995.
The h;xicon is available to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium for both research and commercial applications.
It was developed specifically for use in processing natural language by computer.
COMLEX Syntax is particularly detailed in its treatment of subeategorization (cotnplement structures).
It includes 92 different subcategorization features for verbs, 14 for adjectives, and 9 for nouns.
These distinguish not only the (lifterent constituent structures which may appear in a complement, but also the different control features associated with a constituent structure.
In order to make this dictionary useful to the entire Natural Language Processing coinmunity, an effort was made to provide detailed yet theory neutral syntactic information.
In part, this involved using categories that are generally recognized, i.e. norms, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, adverbs, and their corresponding phrasal expansions np, vp, adjp, pp, advp.
COMLEX cites the specific: prepositions and adverbs hi prepositional anti particle phrases associated with particular verbs.
1 As
a starting point, the classes for complements and features developed by the New York University Linguistic String Project (LSP) (Fitzpatrick, 1981), were selected sin(x, the coverage is very broad and the classes well defined.
These classes were augmented and flnther refined by studying the coding employed by several other major lexicons used for automated language analysis.
The Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) (Hornby, 1980), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor, 1978), the verb (:odes developed for English by Sanfilippo as part of the ACQUILEX project(Sanfilippo, 1992), and The Brandeis Verb Lexicon 2 were consulted.
A Brandeis-like notation was adopted for COMI,EX complement naines.
The Brandeis notation is compositional, consisting of lists of elements joined by hyphens e.g. pl-ing-sc (preposition "about" followed by a gerund where tile matrix subject is the subject of the gerund e.g.
"he lied about going").
In adapting this notation for COMLEX, the list of complement nmnes became fixed and a separate explicit definition of tile syntactic structure associated with each complement name was provided.
I,hrther information on these classes and definitions can be found in the Reference Manual (Macleod, 1993) and the COMLEX Word Classes Manual (Wolff', 1995).
2 Tagging
Task We tagged 100 exmnples for each of 750 common verbs which had previously been entered in the COMLEX lexicon.
These tags, which becmne part of the dictionary entry, contain tile location of the example and the name of the w~'rbal complement identified at that location (see figure 1 for a sample 1e.g. pp :pval "to" for he went to the party; part-np :adval "up" for he woke up the child.

Grimshaw and R.

The original motivation lot tagging was l,wofold, (1) to gather stadstil:s on the fix> quency of oc(:urrencc of a parti(:ular complement of a verb and (2) 1,o check on COMI3BX (:overag(;, ascertaining @at l,he most {:(mun(mly occurring (',{}mph~meni;s had no|, be(;n (}verl(/oked in tim (}riginal cntries.

(13) ..
School where their delicate transformation BEGAN.
\[where\] In all the above cases, except for sentence (13) the complement can be unambiguously recovered.
In sentence (9) they bought something, in (10) they would agree on the statement, and in (11) he/she has got somettfing on.
However, even though "where" is to be reconstructed in both (12) and (13) only in (12) can it be unambiguously interpreted as being part of a pp (they were walking to somewhere); in (13) "where" could be interpreted as a pp or an advp (it began there/it began at school) so we classify it as having the class "where" (which is not a COMLEX complement).
5 Parentheticals
hlrther "missing" complements were found in parentheticals.
(14) For example, to move (as the score REQUIRES) from the lowest -F-major register up to a barely audible ~N minor in four seconds, not skipping, at the same time, even one of the 407 fingerings, seems a feat too absurd to consider, and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage.
(15) The ideal home, they AGREED, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms, just enough for a family Reconstructing a TO-INF ~r "requires" in (14) would not be correct since "require" needs a NPTO-INF (*the score requires to move), but it is not clear what the np could be (perhaps "the flautist"? the tone?).
We felt these cases to be different from the other cases that we have discussed above not only because of the difficulty of locating the complement but in the nature of the construction.
This construction is more similar, in fact, to COMLEX's V-SAY feature which allows a verb like "say" to occur in sentence adjunct positions without its complement, s (16) He said, "I want to see you".
(17) "I", he said, "want to see you".
(18) "I want", he said, "to see you".
(19) "I want to see you," he said.
Therefore, we concluded that the fact that these verbs can occur without their complements is a fact about the graminar of parentheticals.
These examples, then, have been tagged as "parenthetical" and the new COMLEX feature PARENTHETICAL has been given to the verbs which can occur in parentimtical constructions.
6 The
"Intransitive" Question We have encountered several types of zeroing in the corpus which occur with verbs which we would normally consider transitive (~ or verbs which can be intransitive only under special circumstances.
For example, in isolation, "agree" may not occur intransitively unless it has a plural subject (COMLEX intrans-recip class).
7 (20) he agreed with her.
(21) they agreed.
(with each other) ~Examples not from the corpus.
aNote, that while ibr some "transitive" verbs are defined only as verbs which take NP complements, we consider verbs "transitive" that take any type of complement, including PPs 7These examples are not from the corpus 474 (22) *he agreed.
However, the data is rife with examples of intransitive '!agree" occurring with a singular subjeer as seen by the following examlfles.
(23) the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners, the girl reluctantly AGREED.
(24) Why, it's all right, isn't it, Mother"7 Her woolly-minded parent AGREED "Of course, dear", she said.
"It's only that I like to know where you go".
(25) "He's one hell of a decent boy.
I like that kid".
"I AGREE, yes".
(26)... he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research for the labor novel; if Breasted AGREED, they would get a car and tour the country, (27) ..spoke up, "plenty of it.
Let me give Papa blood".
The doctor AGREED, but explained that it would be necessary first to check Fred's blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type...
We have estat)lished the.
class INTRANSELLIPSIS for these cases and since we feel that the coInplement is "underlyingly" t)resent (the tagger is able.
to supply the missing material) we would like to 1)e able to reconstruct a coral)l(> inent totthe above instances of "agree".
There scent to be twe 1)ossi/)ilities: (A) whe.re someone agrees with someone that-s (in (23) she agreed \[with him/that it was done that way\], s in (24) she agreed \[with her/that it was all right\], in (25) I agree \[with you/with that/that he is a decent boy\]); (B) a toqnfinitive (in (26) if he agreed \[to become his assistant\], in (27) he agreed (to let him/her give him blood\]).
Even though this last example (27) I)resents some difli('ultics in re(:onstruction (1) because it o(:curs outside the senten(:e containing the verb and (2) beemlse there is a (:hange of mood fl:om imperative to inlii|itival, we can mMerstand that the doctor agreed to let \[hint\] give blood and reconstruct a subject controlled to-infinitive.
The COMLEX tag entry is (INTRANS-ELLIPSIS :ELLIP (to-inf-sc)) lntrans-ellii)sis is the nalne, of the (:lass and what is elided (:ell|p) is a subject eontrolh,d to infinitive (to-inf-sc, a COMLEX eolnplelnent).
The others (senteImes 23-25) were tagged, arbitrarily, as having a prepositional phrase containing the l)reposi tion "with" and they will be entered in the diet|onary with the tag INTRANS-EI~MPSIS :ELLII ) a l SThere is Mso th(; reading st e agreed to do it; that w&y" (pp :pval ("with")).
The new COMLEX complement INTRANS-ELLIPSIS is added to verbs of this type and therefore COMLEX differentiates between "true" intransitives 9 and eases like the above.
W~ also found occurrences of "hat)itual" intransit;ives in the text.
Even verbs which are always considered to be transitive, like "hit" for example, can be used intransitively if the action is considered to be habitual.
10 (28) That child always hits.
(29) She always abbreviates, a very annoying habit.
(30) He nagged constantly.
We tagged these \[INTRANS-HABITUAL\].~1 Since it seems that this ix really a grammatical question, as any verb (it would seem) may occur an a habitual intransitive, it has not been proposed as a COMLEX comph;inent.
7 New
Noun Phrase Complement, NADVP During ore: tagging, we tound that |her(; are a group of noun phrases that t)attern with adverbs and prepositional phrases, which we have called NADVI"s (Noun Adverbial Phrases).
These arc divided into NADVP-TIME, NADVP-DIR, NP-NADVP-LOC and NADVP-MANNER.
()flea these expressions are adjuncts, but in the following examples, they are comt)lelnents since they are.
required to t)roduce a grammatical sentence.(The examples in this section are not from the corpus but similar examt)les were fo(md) The meeting took 3 hours.
\[nadvp-time\] *The meeting took.

\[nadvp-dir\] *He headed.
He put the stakes every five feet.
\[np-nadvp-loc\] *He put the stakes.

These noun phrases may be substituted tbr by adverbs or prepositional phrases.

475 He put it that way.
\[np-nadvp-manner\] He put it firmly.
\[nadvp-dir\] In general these verbs do not take regular np complenlents, at least not with the same meaning.
The meeting took/lasted 3 hours.
He took/*lasted the car.
He headed/went home.
He headed/*went the cow down the road.
*He put the stakes the table.
*He put it the interest.
8 NUNITP: to Tag or not to Tag Another (:lass of noun t)hrases caused us great soul searching.
A number of verbs take very particular noun phrases.
Verbs like "increase", "decrease" and "expand" take complement groups which require a noun with the subclass NUNIT.
~2 These verbs occurred t)redoIninately in environments like The price increased 5 to :tO percent.
The price increased 5 dollars a share.
We decided not to make this a separate NP coniplement for several reasons: (1) these verl)s also take regular NP complements, though in some instances (as in the below example) the meaning of the verb changc.s.
As COMLEX does not sense disambiguate the semantic difference does not af~ feet the dictionary entry.
"Those vitamins increased his appetite".
(2)the NUNITPs are not syntacticly distinguished; other nouns occur with similar structures.
"He ate 5 to :tO pickles (a day)".
On the other hand, the increase-type verbs can appear with a whole range of nunitp comt)lements (cornpleinents which contain an nunitp 1at: The price increased (5Z) to $10 (a share).
The price increased (SY,) from $10 (a share).
The price increased from $10 (a share) to $30 (a share).
The price increased to 30 dollars from i0 dollars.
The price increased by 5Z to end at $i00.
whereas verbs like "eat" can not *He ate to/from 10 pickles.
*He ate by 10~ to 20 pickles (a day).
Mthough we decided not to add NUNITP as a separate NP complement, we have let the NUNITP tags for verb complements remain, to reflect the information that in our corpus this type t~These art'.
nouns which can appear in quantifier phrases including a scalar adjectiw~ before another noun o1 as a head noun tollowed by a prel)ositional phrase containing a scalar mmn (a two FOOT long board/a board two FEET in length).
laThe nunitp is S/dollars in the examples of verb occurs almost exclusively with this type of NP.
Wc have added a separate frame group with the name NUNITP-TO-IANGE which includes the conq)leinents mentioned abow~'.
Although, it is called NUNITP to underline the fact that ordinarily the nouns that occur are NUNITs or at'('.
coerced into being NUNITs in this structure ~4, the.
NPs are not formally distinguished as such in the notation of the fl'ame group.
The fact (hal; these noun phrases, and the NADVPs above, behave in a manner distinct Dom other NPs is recognized and discussed in Ross's paper on Defective Noun Phrases (Ross, 1995) 9 Tagging Improves COMLEX Aside fl'om presenting these interesting and llilexpected phenomena, tagging has tightened ut) the classification of some coml)lements, leading in the direction of combining some complements ghat had been separate and re-grouping others.
COMLGX had a frame-group which classifie<l together a number of wh-comt)lements.
Now there is a different grouping with the original "whether"/"if"/"what" (WIt-S comt)lement) and "how" (HOW-S, PI'-HOW-TO-INF) augmented by "where"/"when" / "how much" / "how Inany" (WHERE-WHEN-S).
This last; group was estM> lished for verbs like "define" and "forecast" which do not take members of the original fi'ame groups.
"Last year, the Supreme Court DEFINED when companies, such as military contractors, may defend themselves".
*The Supreme Court defined if companies may defend themselves.
"Ptolemy's problem is to FORECAST where, against the inverted bowl of night, some particular light will be found at future times".
*The problem is to forecast how to find the light.
?The problem is to forecast how he will react.
Tags l;hat were not deemed worthy to become COMLEX complements for various reasons (e.g.
rarity or sublanguage use) are defined in the COMLEX Syntax Mmmal for ~l%gged Entri(!s (Meyers, 1995).
All in all, our tagging has been interesting and informative.
We have acquired not only statistical data on the occurrence of colnplements in texts but information on possible gaps in COMLEX's syntactic coverage which we moved to rectify, when it seemed justified, and we have a record in our tagged data of those instances which we.
did not add to C()MM';X classes.
We have HCompare "The price increased by five percent to a total of 2,000 dollars per share".
"The contents of each barrel increased by 5 pickles to a total of 25 pickles per barrel".
