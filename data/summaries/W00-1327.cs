These methods are reported to be particularly unreliable for low frequency scFs (Brent, 1991, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Manning, 1993; Manning and Schiitze, 1999; Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy, 2000), resulting in a poor overall performance.

The estimate for the correct distribution of SCFs over all English verbs was obtained by extracting the number of verbs which are members of each SCF class in the ANLT dictionary (Boguraev et al., 1987).

for SCF Acquisition Briscoe and Carroll's (1997) verbal acquisition system distinguishes 163 SCFs and returns relative frequencies for each SCF found for a given predicate.

While Briscoe and Carroll (1997) used a statistical filter based on binomial hypothesis test, we adopted another method, where the conditional SCF distribution from the system is smoothed before filtering the SCFS, using the different techniques introduced in section 3.3.

Adopting the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) we report an experiment which demonstrates how these estimates can be used in filtering.
A97-1052
The first was to acquire an unfiltered subcategorization lexicon for 20 million words of the British National Corpus (BNÂ¢) (Leech, 1992) data using Briscoe and Carroll's (1997) system (introduced in section 3.2).

As Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy (2000) discuss, any statistical filtering method would work better at low frequences than the one applied, since this simply disregards all low frequency SCFS.

The SCFs are a superset of classes found in the ANLT and COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) dictionaries.

Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy (2000) have showed that a simple method of filtering SCFs on the basis of their relative frequency performs more accurately than statistical filtering.
W00-1325
According to Korhonen, Gorrell and McCarthy (2000), the poor performance of statistical filtering can be largely explained by the zipfian nature of the data, coupled with the fact that many statistical tests are based on the assumption of two zipfian distributions correlating: the conditional SCF distribution of an individual verb (p(scfilverbj)) and the unconditional SCF distribution of all verbs in general (p(scfl)).
W00-1325
Employing the SCF acquisition framework of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), we have demonstrated that these estimates can be used to improve SCF acquisition significantly, when combined with smoothing and a simple filtering method.
