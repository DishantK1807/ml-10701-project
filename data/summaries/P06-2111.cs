Wu and Zhouâ€™s (2003) paper is most closely related to our study.

However, bilingual parallel corpora have mostly been used for tasks related to word sense disambiguation such as target word selection (Dagan et al., 1991) and separation of senses (Dyvik, 1998).

Work Monolingual syntax-based distributional similarity is used in many proposals to nd semantically related words (Curran and Moens (2002), Lin (1998), van der Plas and Bouma (2005)).

Van der Plas and Bouma (2005) present a similar experiment for Dutch, in which they tested most of the best performing measures according to Curran and Moens (2002).

This is in contrast with the results reported by Wu and Zhou (2003).

Several researchers (Curran and Moens (2002), Lin (1998), van der Plas and Bouma (2005)) have used large monolingual corpora to extract distributionally similar words.
P98-2127 W02-0908
The precision scores are in line with the scores reported by Wu and Zhou (2003) in a similar experiment discussed under related work.

Several authors have used a monolingual parallel corpus to nd paraphrases (Ibrahim et al.(2003), Barzilay and McKeown (2001)).

Curran and Moens (2002) report on a largescale evaluation experiment, where they evaluated the performance of various commonly used methods.

For this experiment we used Pointwise Mutual Information (I) (Church and Hanks, 1989).

For the word alignment, we apply standard techniques derived from statistical machine translation using the well-known IBM alignment models (Brown et al., 1993) implemented in the opensource tool GIZA++ (Och, 2003).
