We made at the outset the assumption that conjunction, as a type of text cohesion (Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004), is a marker of structure and genre that is highly relevant to foreign-language teaching (FLT) tasks.

Although Halliday &amp; Hasan (1976) define the “units” of conjunction as conjunctives, conjunctive adjuncts, or discourse adjuncts, and later (Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004) even as conjunctions, we use the term connectors, because it is more consistent with the terminology known by language teachers and learners across languages.

Since for Russian and Ukrainian no classification of conjunctive relations is available, we derived them by translation from (Halliday &amp; Matthiessen, 2004), which at the same time provided a basis for their classification by type of semantic function. We also collected them from academic grammars of Russian and Ukrainian, and later extracted them from </context>
