Generation The nondirectionaly of Synchronous TAGs enables us to use it for semantic interpretation as well as for generation (see Shieber and Schabes \[1990b\]).

Similar to the work of Lang (1974) and Tomita (1987) extending LR parsers for arbitrary CFGs, the LR parsers for TAGs can be extended to solve by pseudo-parallelism the conflicts of moves.

In the case at hand, we have chosen single-component lexicalized TAGs with adjunction and substitution (Schabes, Abeill6 and Joshi \[1988\]).

Machine Translation The transfer between two languages, such as French and English, can be done by putting directly into correspondence large elementary units without going through some interlingual representation and without major changes to the source and target grammars (Abeill6, Schabes and Joshi \[1990\]).

The complete construction of LR-style parser for TAGs can be found in Schabes and Vijay-Shanker (1990).

For natural language processing, although LR(k) parsers are not powerful enough, conflicts between multiple choices are solved by pseudo-parallelism (Lang, 1974, Tomita, 1987).

A variant of TAGs, called synchronous TAGs, has been developed (Shieber and Schabes \[1990(a)\]).

Quantifiers In order to characterize quantifier scoping possibilities, multi-component TAGs (as defined by Joshi, 1987) is used as the base formalism for synchronous TAG (see Shieber and Schabes \[1990(a)\] for more details on quantifiers scoping with Synchronous TAG).

Applications Synchronous TAGs suggest elegant solutions to the semantics of idioms, quantifier scoping (Shieber and Schabes, \[1990a\]) and provide an elegant framework for generation (Shieber and Schabes, \[1990b\]) and machine translation (Abeill6, Schabes and Joshi \[1990\]).
