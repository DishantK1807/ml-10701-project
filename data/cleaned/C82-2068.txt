Q SO uR "INFORMATIONAL" LANGUAGES AND MODELS.
A SEMANTIC VIEW Jan gabr§ula, Jitka Svobodov~, Jaroslav Svoboda Faculty of Philosop~y, Charles University, Prague, Czechoslovakia (1) In natural languages as well as in any other sign system code signs (semia) are to be distinguished from episemis (enunclatlve si6us).
In artificial ("Info1~natlonal") systems signs are sub, so% to asymmetric dualism involving the necessity of eynergy of semia in a comparatively insIEnlficant measure when compared with signs in natural languageso ' On the other hahd, a measure of assymetry may be established, for example, in some constituents of the tradltional language of arithletlc where even the phenomenon of "double articulation" of signs is encountered, plemes funotionIng to a limited extent as pleremes or semlao On this ~ ocoasion.we rely on the Common definition of the term pleme as a constituting element of the expression, a sort of subsymbol, ~l~ment de l°expression (of.
J. Pohl, 23, 453-468)° A new definition of vleme is given on this occasion: pleme absolute, relative (semi-symbol),.
The pleme constituting the cipher (Number, quantity) eemia is strongly dependent on the syntactic synerg~v This dependence is the larger the lower is the particular numeral no t at ion o Both constant mathematical signs and co'natant signs of some other "formalized'* languages have their specific sign 277 basis, whereas variable symbols possess a very vague meaning of mere "cipher-representatives" or "number-representatives", without any own defined, pre-coded systemic and specific deno t at i on • Grouped together into organized structures, variable s~mbols can function as abstract episemia (elementary and complex), and thus as elementary models, only for an (advised) recipient capable of usin~ certain -elgorithm8 m for replselng symbols by constant signs or of transferring them into signs of natural language.
The icon and symptom act as episemia for an advised recipient • We can imagine a number of logical or arithmetical languages which can operate each with regard to all others as metala.nguages.
At the same time, translation algorithm may sometimes be rather complex in view of tyDolozica~ differences between such systems, e•g.
in the bicipher (twofigure) numeral notation, syntactical synergy and line~ arrangement of plemes are encountered in a very profuse measure when compared to, for example, the decimal notation where the symbol O when placed to the right of a figure serves to multiply it by 10.
The principle of cipher plemes is very economioz 3 plemes may have 6 permutations (31 6), 4| 24, 5| 120, 61 720, 10!
= 3 628 000, but plemss as letters do not constitute semia in every permutation, e.g• ael, ale, ~, ela, ~.

based on the structural features which refer to the totality of the devices of expression, to the structural organization of the totality of the devices of expressions strata, registers, sub-systems, sub-lances, sub-codes, varieties, "special languages".
278 Scientific sub-system and "artificial" systmn can be examined not only in contrast to other sub-systeNs (vertical -"social n, horizontal -"professional", regional..., of.
J. Svobodov~-C~elov~, Beitr~e zur roNm~ischen Philologie, XIII, Berlin 1974, Heft 1/2, 217-229) of the sane language, but also in relation to the scientific subsystems of other languages.
(3) Arithmetical language, Morse code (with specific merimnatical level), conventional symbols used in transnLtttin8 messages by flags, et cetera, can be, entirely or partially, internationalized, • but also "idiolectized".
In a natural language, some signs or categories of signs (e.g.
Shtftere, Tense, "Verbal" Aspects, of.
J. ~., IN: Prague School of Linguistics..., London, Oxford Univ.
Press 1972, 95-111) denote or, rather, designate the speaker's subJective conception of ontological reality rather than objective measurable values.
A simple example taken from planimetry inspires us to examine even while using mathen~tical lan~ uage notation the problem of relations between reality, or a model (whether mathematical or physical) of reality, or else various potential conoeptiona of the same reality.
(4) In conclusion, the problem of relations between v~'TJ.n8 degrees of designation of the same real situation as well as the problem of the relation between its designation by means of mathematical expression and one in a natural language is illustrated on a mathematical model of meteorological situation while taking into account the concept of a fuzzy sere As far as t~e transfer and difusion of the atmospherioal pollutien is concerned, we describe them in two different languases (Lasrange, Euler), which represent a problem, both mutually, as well as in the moment while being interpreted into ~ natural languase.
279 And £t is by solWJ-u8 this problem (mal4;ol'ittms', list o~ instructions, organ£sram defined by Jaroslav 3voboda) that we want to avoid botJa dtetort£on and the complete loss of ~nformatton.
