The system being developed in LISP by NYU is called PROTEUS (PROtotype TExt Understanding System) (Grishman et al., submitted for publication); the SDC system is called PUNDIT (Prolog UNDerstander of Integrated Text) (Palmer et al.1986). Notwithstanding the difference in implementation languages, we have tried to maintain a high level of compatibility between the two systems.
