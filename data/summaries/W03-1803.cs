As an alternative to a precompiled bilingual dictionary, translation pairs can be extracted from a parallel corpus (Fung, 1995; Smadja et al., 1996; Ohmori and Higashida, 1999), that is a bilingual document set that is translation-equivalent at the sentence or paragraph level; we term this MT configuration alignment-driven MBMT (or MBMTALIGN).

The BNC had been tagged and chunked using fnTBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001), and lemmatised using morph (Minnen et al., 2001), while the Mainichi Shimbun had been segmented and tagged using ALTJAWS.5 For both English and Japanese, we took only those NN bigrams adjoined by non-nouns to ensure that they were not part of a larger compound nominal.

It is possible to extract translation pairs from a comparable corpus by way of the following process (Cao and Li, 2002): 1.

Indeed, Tanaka (2002) successfully combines synonym-substitution with translation selection and achieves appreciable gains in accuracy.

Whereas a parallel corpus assumes translation equivalence, a comparable corpus is simply a crosslingual pairing of corpora from the same domain (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Rapp, 1999; Tanaka and Matsuo, 1999; Tanaka, 2002).
