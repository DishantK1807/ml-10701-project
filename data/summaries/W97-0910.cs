Subsequently, language descriptions have been developed for Swedish (Gamb~ck and Rayner, 1992), French and Spanish (Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1995).

The primary, rule-based translation mechanism performs transfer at the level of Quasi-Logical Form (QLF), a type of predicate/argument style notation (Alshawi et al., 1991).

Our methodology for performing this task makes use of rationally constructed, balanced domain corpora to focus the effort on frequently occurring problems (Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1995).

Morphologies are written in a variant of two-level morphology (Carter, 1995), and grammars in a unification-based formalism (Alshawi (ed), 1992).
