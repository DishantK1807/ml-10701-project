It consists of a parsing program, a large-coverage b~glish grammar, and a Icsicon.
Thc gramnlarls effcctivcncss in parsing texts is due in large part to a substantial Imdy of detail cvl \vc.Il -formedness rcst rictions which eliminate most incorrect syntactic parses which would be allo~vecl by a weaker grammar.
The restrictions mainly test for compatible combinations of word subclasses.
This paper dcfines the 109 adjective, noun and verb suhclasscs.
These subolasses, as \'ell as others not prcscnted herc, are defined Ln such a way that they can he used as a guide for dassifymg new entries to the LSP lexicon and as a lingpistic reference twl.
Fach definition lncludcs a statement of the intent of tllc subclass, a diawostic frame, sentence examples and a worcl list draun from tho present dictionary.
The subclasses are defined tro reflect precisely the grammatical propertics tested for by the restrictiol~s of the grammar Where necessary for clariking the intent of the subclass, three additiollal criteria are employed: excision, implicit and corcfcrcncc, and paraphrase.
The subclasscs have been defined so as to be consistent with a subsecluent stage of transformational analysis rilzicl~ is currently being imp1 ementd.
An illustration of the trcatmcnt of a subclass is: AASP: an aclicctive is in AASP if it occurs only with the non-sentehtial hon-Sh7 right adjunct to V OBJ (SN an emlxdded, or contained, sentence) (DSNG, 7) : John is able to walk.

Each entry bebm provides a definition of the subclass, a diagnostic frame, sentence examples.
and a word list dram from the lexicon of the computer-grammar (ca 10,000 word entries).
The subclasses are defined in terms of string grammar.
In string analysis, a sentence is decomposed into an elementary sentence, or center string, and adjunct strings.
Iil a string, each word class may bapreceded or followed by left or right adjunct string^,^ and the center string as a whole may have adjunct strings ?vhich precede or follow the center string or occur at interior parts of the string.
A string grammar makes restrictions as to which subclasses can co-occur.
The subclass definitions, therefo~e, are based mainly on these ocburrence possibilities (e.g., a count noun is specitied as a noun which camiot occur without a preceding article).
More precisely, the entire computer grammar consists of a set of approximately 200 contest-free (BND definitions, a set of abut 250 restrictions, and a \lord dictionary.
The BNF definitions define the center and adjunct strings of the language as well as sentence nominalization (embedded sentence) strings u;hich may occur in subject, object or complement position.
In parsing a sentence, once an element of a string (e.g., SUBJECT, VERB, or OBJECT) has been identified in the sentence, restrictioi~s are invoked to test.various properties, including the subclasses of the words ivithin this element or within this element and an element previously identified.
When a word is classified for the LSP lexicon it must be assigned to the syntactic classe (N, V, etc).
which appear in the context-free definitions-and to the specific subclasses (e.g., count noun) which are tested for by the restrictions.
The trames and definitions are a compact statement of these constraints.
Fbr reference to the computer grammar, we have used the code names of strings and restrictions, bttt the text can be read independently of the referenced material, The strings have roughly mnemonic names.
An explanation of some of the mnemonics used in the text is included in the rererence guide which follows this introduction.
The restrictions referred to are of several main types: agreement restrictions (AGREI noun phrase restrictions (N), position restrictions (POS), quantifier restrictions (Q), selectior restrictions (SEL), restrictions on sentence embedding (SN) . and WH-string restrictions m) The name of each restriction is preceded by a W or D and followed by an integer, e.g.: WAGR '~fi addition to the Noun, Adjective and Verb classes, the other major classes are Adverb, Pronoun, Quantifier, Article, Subordinate Conjunction and Preposition.
Coordinate Conjunctions and comparative connectives are treated individually.
9 LIn
this text, as in the LSP grammar, the notation LXTl (X being a wdrd class, e.g., N noun V verb, etc).
stands for X appearing with its optional left adjuncts (LX) and optional right adjuncts (RX).
X is called the host of its adjunct strings.
Thus, old men with canes is an instance ot LNR in which old is a left adjunct of the host N man, and with caneq is a right adjunct of the host N man.
While a subclass is precisely defined by its appearance in the restrictions gf the grammar, a person who is classifying words for the lexicon may need additional criteria in order to capture the intent oi the subclass.
This is particularly true in defining the verb subclasses which specify the object strings with which a verb can occur (the OBJIIIST of the test).
Here the frames and restrictions may not suffice to distinguish occurrences of the words as instances of the subclass from other possible occurrences covered by the grammar.
For example, it is important to distinguish an object string occurrence of SVINGO insdney kept people working overtime from a non-object-string occurrence of the same wordclass sequence,' e.g., one consistingof a noun with its adjunct such as N + reducea relative VINGO in They fired people working overtime.
Of course, some verbs will have ambiguous occurrences, ee.g.,"keep in the first example.
It would' be incorrect, however.
to class fire as occurring with a SVINGO object on the basis of the second exzmple.
We haye therefore used additional criteria in defining the object strings in order to clarify the intent of particular subclasses.
The criteria used are: (1) Ekcision.
In an occurrence of an element with its adjunct in a sentence, the adlunct can be excised leaving a well-formed sentence unchanged in meaning and selection from the original sentence (except for detail added by the adjunct).
Thus, we can test whether a word sequence in a sentence is an object string occurrence by excising the portion which might be an Wjunct.
If the remaining sentence is either different in grammaticality, meaning dr selection from the original sentence, then the sequence as a whole is cansidered an object strifig occurrence.
Fbr our purposes, if the sequence is an object string octurrence, then the verb with which it occurs must be sulxlassed for that object string.
For example, line, show and carxmust be subclassed as occurring with the particle string DP, and walk not, s inc e They lined up.
$ They lined.
He showed off.
He showed.
(difference in meahing) He cam fed on.
The point easried.
(difference in selection) He walked on.
He walked.
(no difference in grammaticality, selection or meaning) (2) Understood reference.
If a given noun in one sequence-occurrence is understood as referring to a particular noun N, and, in a different occurrence as referring to an N,, the two occurrences must not be considered as ilistances of the same string.
For example, since messengers in (1) refers to they and messengers in (2) refers to boys, the t~vo occurrences of as N must n& be considered as the same string: (r) They served the boys a$ messengers.
(2) They treated the boys as messengers.
(3) Paraphrase.
If a semantic contrast can be found in otherwise identical sequeilces, then these sequences cannot be considered as instances of the same string when subclassing he term %equencen applies to word sequences the structural description of nhich is under discussion.
a verb.
For example, the as which is equivalent to 'in the capacity oft in (3) functions as part of the object string A~BJBI.:, while the as which is equivalent to 'when' in (4) functions as part of an adjunct which does not restrict the verl~: (3).
John served as a lieutenant.
(4) Jollll cha~ as a lieutenant.
hie to the difficulty of judging the appropriateness of a paraphrase, ho~~ever n.e have used this criterion sparingly.
As we have noted, the frames and definitions precisely reflect the use of the.
major classes and subclasses in the presently implemented string grammar.
However, it should also be noted that this grammar, and the associated lexical categories, have been defined so as to be consistent with a, subsequent stage of transformational analysis which is currently being implemented.
lh some cases, the same string form has several transformational sources; where this affects the dictionary classification, we have noted it.
Something should be said abut the form of the dictionary entries as they appear in the computer lexicon.
Each word is classified for all its major class occurrences (N, V, eCc).
and its subc~asses within each major class.
The classification is based on the usage of the word in the language as a wllole, not its use in a particular text.
Ho\vever, purely coIloquia1 and literary uses have not been covered because of the intended application to scientific tex-ts.
The classificatio~~s of the niords are arranged in a hierarchical structure: the malor classes may have subelasses and the subclasses in turn may have subclasses.
Fbr esample, the adjective clear, which can occur as the predicate of a,sentential subject, is in the subclass AS ENT1.
The particular type of sentential subjects clear occurs with (IVH and THAT embeddings) require that it be classified in the two subclasses A\i7H and ATIlAT of ASENTI.
This part of the lesical entry appears as follows: CLEAR ADJ: (ASENTI : (AWH, AT-W3) or alternatively : CLEAR ADJ: .lo.
10 = ASENT.1: (AWH, ATHAT).
where the particular line number assiw (.lo) is arbitrary.
Where this type of further subdivision of a subclass is i;acessary, a sample dictionary entry is provided along with the definitions and frames below.
It should be noted that while the entries in the lexicoh are by word rather than stem the word entries based on a particular stem can refer to portions of a basic entry which they share in common, e.g., the object list of a verb (OBJLIST) is specified once for all forms df the verb (tensed verb tV, present participle Ving, past participle Ven and infinitive V).
The notational conventions used in the subclass definitions and frames are as follows: 2 an ungrammatical sequence x x Rhe underlined term) is the class being subclassed in the frame or a particular lexical item used in the frame.
s s (the double undarlin.ec1 term) is the class being subclassed in the frame where the frame also contains a particular lexical item (X) in a franc! an optional element (S) in a demition, a further subdivision of a subclass T article D adverb OBJ a cover tcrm for all.
the object strings (see ol~jcct string reference wide) Sh" an embedded sentence of the following types: TEIATS 'That John was here FORTOVO fqr Mary to go TOVO to live SVINGO then1 worlring overtime Cl SIIOULD that John b-e here SWI~ \~l~~thq+j ~vliy/ how.
. .he went It should also be noted tM-€ the specified frame which delimits a word is not the only frame in ~vhid.~ fhiZt word can occur; it serves merely as the test frame when classifying words.
The presellt paper is an outgrowth of ongoing work on the LSP lexicon throughout its various implementations and applications since 19G5.
It draws particularly an a previous write-up of the LSP gramr (fl.
Sager, " i Computer String Grammar of Ehglish",ring Program Report No.
