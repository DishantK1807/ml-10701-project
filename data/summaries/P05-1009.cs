Following (Mohri et al., 2002; Knight and Graehl, 1998), we implement language models using weighted finite-state acceptors (wFSA).

This exponential complexity comes as no surprise given that the problem of intersecting an ngram language model with a bag of words is known to be NP-complete (Knight, 1999).
J99-4005
Over the years, several proposals of generic NLG systems have been made: Penman (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991), FUF (Elhadad, 1991), Nitrogen (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995), Fergus (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000), HALogen (Langkilde-Geary, 2002), Amalgam (Corston-Oliver et al., 2002), etc.

We evaluate accuracy performance using two automatic metrics: an identity metric, ID, which measures the percent of sentences recreated exactly, and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), which gives the geometric average of the number of uni-, bi-, tri-, and four-grams recreated exactly.

In Machine Translation, for example, sentences are produced using application-specific “decoders”, inspired by work on speech recognition (Brown et al., 1993), whereas in Summarization, summaries are produced as either extracts or using task-specific strategies (Barzilay, 2003).
