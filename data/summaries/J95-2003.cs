Grosz et al.Centering follow-on research can be roughly grouped in a few main areas: • Cross-linguistic work on centering: 25 (German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish): Di Eugenio (1990); Hoffman and Turan (1993); Kameyama (1985, 1986, 1988); Rambow (1993); Walker, Iida, and Cote (1990, 1994); Yongkyoon (1991); Ziv and Grosz (1994).
C90-2047 J94-2003 P86-1031 P90-1010
• Centering and linguistic realizations: 26 Cote (1992, 1993); Hurewitz and Linson (1993); Kameyama (1993); Nakatani (1993); Passonneau (in press, 1991); Prince (1994); Prince and Walker (1995); Suri and McCoy (1993); Turan (1995); Walker (1989).
P89-1031 P91-1009
• Empirical and psycholinguistic evaluation of centering predictions: Brennan (1995); Gordon and Chan (in press); Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom (1993); Gordon and Scearce (1995); Hudson-D'Zmura (1988); Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell (1986); Walker (1989).
P89-1031
Since Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) was first circulated a number of researchers have tested and developed aspects of the theory presented here.
J86-3001
Psychological research (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988) and cross-linguistic research (Di Eugenio 1990; Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990, 1994) have validated that the CB is preferentially realized by a pronoun in English and by equivalent forms (i.e., zero pronouns) in other languages.

Centering fits within the theory of discourse structure developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).
J86-3001
• Centering, dialogue, and global discourse structure: Brennan'(1995); Hurewitz and Linson (1993); Roberts (1993); Sparck Jones (1993); Walker (1993); Walker and Whittaker (1990).
P90-1010
Section 9 lists several papers appearing after Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) that investigate factors affecting the Cf ordering.
J86-3001
drafts of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) were in circulation from 1983.
J86-3001 P83-1007
This draft (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1986) has led to a number of papers by others on this topic and has been extensively cited, but has never been published.
J86-3001
At the time Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) was written, it struck us that situation semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983) provided a particularly convenient setting in which to frame our own theory of discourse phenomena, though our account relied only on general features of this approach and not on details of the theory as then articulated.

Kameyama, Megumi (1986).

In such cases additional inferences are 17 Empirical investigations of these claims of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) suggest they are too strong.

Although there are as yet no psycholinguistic results related to the effect of pronominalization on determining Cb(Un_l), cross-linguistic work (Kameyama 1985; Prince and Walker 1995; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994) argues that it plays such a role.
J94-2003
The relationship between this kind of lexical-semantic influence over centering and that of so-called 'empathy' verbs, e.g., Kameyama (1985), Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994), remains to be determined.
J94-2003
have been urged to publish the more detailed description of the centering framework and theory proposed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) so that an official version would be archivally available.
J86-3001
To accomplish this goal, we have chosen to remove descriptions of many open research questions posed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) as well as solutions that were only partially developed.
J86-3001
Finally, in Section 9 we conclude with a brief comparison of centering with the research that preceded it and a summary of research that expands on Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
J86-3001
Many of these papers proposed extensions to or revisions of the theory and attempted to answer questions posed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
J86-3001
22 Christine Nakatani provided this example, which is far more compelling than the one originally in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
J86-3001
• Centering algorithms: Baldwin (1993); Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987); Kehler (1993); Walker (1989); Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994).

Preface Our original paper (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) on centering claimed that certain entities mentioned in an utterance were more central than others and that this property imposed constraints on a speaker's use of different types of referring expressions.
P83-1007
In Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) we did not explore this issue further; the general issue of the roles of functional dependence and implicit focus in centering remain open.

Cb(25b) is then the value-flee interpretation, and Cb(26b) is the value-loaded one (at the time of the writing of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986), George Bush, but now \[1995\] A1 Gore).
J86-3001
In Proceedings, 13th International Conference on Computational Linguistics 26 Kameyama's dissertation research (Kameyama 1985) was carried out contemporaneously with the extensions from our 1983 paper to Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).
