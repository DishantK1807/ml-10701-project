Some studies on word vectors have compared the performance among different methods on some specific tasks such as semantic disambiguation (Niwa and Nitta, 1994) and cued/free recall (Steyvers et al., 2004), but it is not at all clear whether there are essential differences in the quality of similarity among word vectors constructed by different methods, and if so, what kind of similarity is involved in what kind of word vectors.

Vector negation (Widdows, 2003) may be a useful technique for this purpose.

Other methods use a variety of other information: cooccurrence of two words (Burgess, 1998; SchÂ¨utze, 1998), occurrence of a word in the sense definitions of a dictionary (Kasahara et al., 1997; Niwa and Nitta, 1994) or word association norms (Steyvers et al., 2004).
