In this paper we use TEASE (Szpektor et al., 2004), a stateof-the-art unsupervised acquisition algorithm for lexical-syntactic entailment rules.

Although knowledge-bases of entailment-rules and paraphrases learned by acquisition algorithms were used in other NLP applications, such as QA (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) and IE (Sudo et al., 2003; Romano et al., 2006), to the best of our knowledge the output of such algorithms was never applied to IR before.

Automatically Learning Entailment Rules from the Web Many algorithms for automatically learning paraphrases and entailment rules have been explored in recent years (Lin and Pantel, 2001; 1http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html 67 Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Satoshi, 2005).

The typical way to address variability in IR is to use lexical query expansion (Lytinen et al., 2000; Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002).
