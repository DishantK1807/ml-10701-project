The syntactic relations are generated by the Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1993).

Probably the most widely used association weight function is (point-wise) Mutual Information (MI) (Church et al., 1990), (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan, 2000), defined by: )()( ),(log),( 2 fPwP fwPfwMI = A known weakness of MI is its tendency to assign high weights for rare features.

Distributional Similarity has been an active research area for more than a decade (Hindle, 1990), (Ruge, 1992), (Grefenstette, 1994), (Lee, 1997), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan et al., 1999), (Weeds and Weir, 2003).

The judgment criterion follows common evaluations of paraphrase acquisition (Lin and Pantel, 2001), (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001), and corresponds to the meaning-entailing substitutability criterion discussed in Section 1.
P01-1008
Typical feature weighting functions include the logarithm of the frequency of word-feature cooccurrence (Ruge, 1992), and the conditional probability of the feature given the word (within probabilistic-based measures) (Pereira et al., 1993), (Lee, 1997), (Dagan et al., 1999).

We considered first an evaluation based on WordNet data as a gold standard, as in (Lin, 1998; Weeds and Weir, 2003).

(Weeds and Weir, 2003)) measure of Lin (1998) as a representative case, and utilized it for our analysis and as a starting point for improvement.

The experiment was conducted using an 18 million tokens subset of the Reuters RCV1 corpus,2 parsed by Linâ€™s Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1993).
