So far, the annotation of discourse structure of documents has been applied primarily to identifying topical segments (Hearst, 1997), inter-sentential relations (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Ts’ou et al., 2000), and hierarchical analyses of small corpora (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu et al., 1999).

• Previous research has shown that RST trees can play a crucial role in building natural language generation systems (Hovy, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore, 1995) and text summarization systems (Marcu, 2000); can be used to increase the naturalness of machine translation outputs (Marcu et al.2000); and can be used to build essayscoring systems that provide students with discourse-based feedback (Burstein et al., 2001).

The kappa coefficient (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) has been used extensively in previous empirical studies of discourse (Carletta et al., 1997; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

The method described in Marcu et al.(1999) maps hierarchical structures into sets of units that are labeled with categorial judgments.

• Previous research on annotating texts with rhetorical structure trees (Marcu et al., 1999) has shown that texts can be annotated by multiple judges at relatively high levels of agreement.

The resulting corpus contains 385 documents of American English selected from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), annotated in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory.

The scope of the annotation refers to the levels of analysis within the document, and can be characterized as follows: • sentential: annotation of features at the intra-sentential or inter-sentential level, at a single level of depth (Sundheim, 1995; Tsou et al., 2000; Nomoto and Matsumoto, 1999; Rebeyrolle, 2000).

However, rich theoretical approaches to discourse/text analysis (Van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983; Meyer, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and Thompson, 1988) have yet to be applied on a large scale.

Wiebe et al.(1999) present a method for automatically formulating a single best tag when multiple judges disagree on selecting between binary features.

• hierarchical: annotation of features at multiple levels, building upon lower levels of analysis at the clause or sentence level (Moser and Moore, 1995; Marcu, et al.1999) • document-level: broad characterization of document structure such as identification of topical segments (Hearst, 1997), linking of large text segments via specific relations (Ferrari, 1998; Rebeyrolle, 2000), or defining text objects with a text architecture (Pery-Woodley and Rebeyrolle, 1998).

While some take the elementary units to be clauses (Grimes, 1975; Givon, 1983; Longacre, 1983), others take them to be prosodic units (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993), turns of talk (Sacks, 1974), sentences (Polanyi, 1988), intentionally defined discourse segments (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), or the “contextually indexed representation of information conveyed by a semiotic gesture, asserting a single state of affairs or partial state of affairs in a discourse world,” (Polanyi, 1996, p.5).

During the orientation phase, the annotators were introduced to the principles of Rhetorical Structure Theory and the discourse-tagging tool used for the project (Marcu et al., 1999).

Annotation Task Our methodology for annotating the RST Corpus builds on prior corpus work in the Rhetorical Structure Theory framework by Marcu et al.(1999). Because the goal of this effort was to build a high-quality, consistently annotated reference corpus, the task required that we employ people as annotators whose primary professional experience was in the area of language analysis and reporting, provide extensive annotator training, and specify a rigorous set of annotation guidelines.

These scores reflect very strong agreement and represent a significant improvement over previously reported results on annotating multiple texts in the RST framework (Marcu et al., 1999).

Consistency We tracked inter-annotator agreement during each phase of the project, using a method developed by Marcu et al.(1999) for computing kappa statistics over hierarchical structures.
