By 261 contrast, Ellison's (1994) best-paths construction tbr unbounded constraints, and previously proposed constructions tbr directional-style constraints (set ยง2.5) only find the optimal outt)ut for a single input, or at best a finite lexicon.

Lazy "on-the-fly" construction techniques (Mohri, 1997) can be used to avoid allocating states or arcs until they arc discovered during exploration from the start State.
