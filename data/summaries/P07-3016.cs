(Stevenson and Joanis, 2003) investigate the applicability of this general feature space to unsupervised verb clustering tasks.

To overcome this drawback, (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003) develop a general feature space for supervised verb classification.

However, semantic grouping of verbs on the basis of their syntactic distribution or other quantifiable features has also gained attention (Schulte im Walde, 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Dorr and Jones, 1996).

(Merlo and Stevenson, 2001) approximates diathesis alternations by hand-selected grammatical features.

(Brent, 1993) uses regular patterns.

(Schulte im Walde, 2000; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) use subcategorization frame frequencies obtained from parsed corpora, potentially completed by semantic selection information.

We are also planning to test top-down clustering methods such as the one described in (Pereira et al., 1993).
