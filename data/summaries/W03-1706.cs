To make the model more practical in parameter estimation, we assume the features in feature set FS are independent from each other, thus: ∏ ∈ = FSFi AFiPAFSP ),|(),|( ββ (5) Under this PCFG+PF model, the goal of a parser is to choose a parse that maximizes the following score: )|,(maxarg)|( 1 AFS i i i n i T PSTScore β∏ = = (6) Our model is thus a simplification of more sophisticated models which integrate PCFGs with features, such as those in Magerman(1995), Collins(1997) and Goodman(1997).

Like baseNP chunking(Church, 1988; Ramshaw & Marcus 1995), content chunk parsing is also a kind of shallow parsing.
