4.2 Transformation-based Learning Transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995), or TBL, is one of the most successful rule-based machine learning algorithms.

Empirical evidence for this argument can be seen from the result of the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002)(Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003), where the ranking of the participating systems changes with the test corpora.

Transformation-based learning has been used to tackle a wide range of NLP problems, ranging from part-ofspeech tagging (Brill, 1995) to parsing (Brill, 1996) to segmentation and message understanding (Day et al., 1997).

Tsukamoto et al.(2002) used piped AdaBoost.MH models for NER.

More closely relevant to the experiments described here in, two of the best-performing three teams in the CoNLL-2002 Named Entity Recognition shared task evaluation used boosting as their base system (Carreras et al., 2002)(Wu et al., 2002).
