Abney (1997) proposes a Markov Random Field or log linear model for SUBGs, and the models described here are instances of Abney's general framework.

J97-4005
Abney (1997) proposes a gradient ascent, based upon a Monte Carlo procedure for estimating E0(fj).
J97-4005
Berger et al.(1996) and Jelinek (1997) make this same point and arrive at the same estimator, albeit through a maximum entropy argument.

On the other hand, as Abney (1997) points out, the context-sensitive dependencies that "unification-based" constraints introduce render the relative frequency estimator suboptimal: in general it does not maximize the likelihood and it is inconsistent.
