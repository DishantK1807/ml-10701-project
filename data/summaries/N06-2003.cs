Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topicsegmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents.

Content-oriented models, such as (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), rely on the re-occurrence of patterns of topics over multiple realizations of thematically similar discourses, such as a series of newspaper articles about similar events.

The Foltz and Ortho approaches require a trained LSA space, which we prepared as described in (Olney and Cai, 2005).

Two such algorithms for segmentation are described in (Foltz, 1998) and (Olney and Cai, 2005).

As opposed to the other baseline algorithms, (Olney and Cai, 2005) applied their orthonormal basis approach specifically to dialogue, and prior to this work, report the highest numbers for topic segmentation of dialogue.

The first corpus, which we refer to as the Olney & Cai corpus, is a set of dialogues selected randomly from the same corpus Olney and Cai selected their corpus from (Olney and Cai, 2005).

Following (Olney and Cai, 2005), we built our LSA space using dialogue contributions as the atomic text unit.

a dialogue contribution) adds (informativity) and how relevant it is to the local context (relevance) (Olney and Cai, 2005).

The best known algorithm based on this idea is TextTiling (Hearst, 1997).
