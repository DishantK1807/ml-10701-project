For all experiments, we used a C-SVM with a gaussian RBF kernel as implemented by LibSVM in the YALE toolkit (Chang and Lin, 2001; Mierswa et al., 2006).

SVMs. While our training set (796 abstracts in Train set B) is substantially smaller than that reported in previous studies (McKnight, 2003; Lin, 2006; Xu, 2006), the F-score for AIM, RESULTS, CONCLUSION are comparable to previous results.

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Later papers in (Xu, 2006; Lin, 2006) have found that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) based approaches more effectively model the sequential ordering of sentences in abstracts.

Our best results here are comparable to those previously reported on similar tasks on the class, AIM, RESULTS and CONCLUSION (Xu, 2006; Lin, 2006).

Studies have shown that results deteriorate when classifying sentences in unstructured abstracts (McKnight, 2003; Lin, 2006).

Over the last several years, various statistical syntaxbased models were proposed to extend traditional word/phrase based models in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Lin, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Ding et al., 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).
