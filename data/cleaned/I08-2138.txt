A Punjabi Grammar Checker 
 
 
Abstract 
This article provides description about the 
grammar checking software developed for 
detecting the grammatical errors in Punjabi 
texts and providing suggestions wherever 
appropriate to rectify those errors. This 
system utilizes a full-form lexicon for 
morphology analysis and rule-based 
systems for part of speech tagging and 
phrase chunking. The system supported by 
a set of carefully devised error detection 
rules can detect and suggest rectifications 
for a number of grammatical errors, 
resulting from lack of agreement, order of 
words in various phrases etc., in literary 
style Punjabi texts.  
1 Introduction

Grammar checking is one of the most widely used 
tools within natural language engineering 
applications. Most of the word processing systems 
available in the market incorporate spelling, 
grammar, and style-checking systems for English 
and other foreign languages, one such rule-based 
grammar checking system for English is discussed 
in (Naber, 2003). However, when it comes to the 
smaller languages, specifically the Indian 
languages, most of such advanced tools have been 
lacking. Spell checking has been addressed for 
most of the Indian languages but still grammar and 
style checking systems are lacking. In this article a 
grammar checking system for Punjabi, a member 
of the Modern Indo-Aryan family of languages, is 
provided. The grammar checker uses a rule-based 
system to detect grammatical errors in the text and 
if possible generates suggestions to correct those 
errors.  
To the best of our knowledge the grammar 
checking provided here will be the first such 
system for Indian languages. There is n-gram 
based grammar checking system for Bangla (Alam 
et al, 2006). The authors admit its accuracy is very 
low and there is no description about whether the 
system provides any suggestions to correct errors 
or not. It is mentioned that it was tested to identify 
correct sentences from the set of sentences 
provided as input but nothing is mentioned as far 
as correcting those errors is concerned. However, 
the system that we discuss here for Punjabi detects 
errors and suggests corrections as well. In doing 
so, provides enough information for the user to 
understand the error reason and supports the 
suggestions provided, if any. 
2 System
Overview 
The input Punjabi text is given to the preprocessing 
system that performs tokenization and detects any 
phrases etc. After that morphological analysis is 
performed, this returns possible tags for all the 
words in the given text, based on the full-form 
lexicon that it is using. Then a rule-based part of 
speech tagger is engaged to disambiguate the tags 
based on the context information. After that, the 
text is grouped into various phrases accordingly to 
the pre-defined phrase chunking rules. In the final 
phase, rules to check for various grammatical 
errors internal to phrases and agreement on the 
sentence level, are applied. If any error is found in 
a sentence then based on the context information 
corrections are suggested (generated) for that.

 For the purpose of morphological analysis we 
have divided the Punjabi words into 22 word 
classes like noun, adjective (inflected and 
uninflected), pronoun (personal, demonstrative, 
reflexive, interrogative, relative, and indefinite), 
verb (main verb, operator verb, and auxiliary verb), 
cardinals, ordinals, adverb, postposition, 
conjunction, interjection etc., depending on the 
grammatical information required for the words of 
these word classes. The information that is in the 
database depends upon the word class, like for 
noun and inflected adjective, it is gender, number, 
and case. For personal pronouns, person is also 
required. For main verbs gender, number, person, 
tense, phase, transitivity etc. is required. As 
mentioned earlier the lexicon of this morphological 
analyzer is full form based i.e. all the word forms 
of all the commonly used Punjabi words are kept 
in the lexicon along with their root and other 
grammatical information. 
 For part of speech tagging, we have devised a 
tag set keeping into mind all the grammatical 
categories that can be helpful for agreement 
checking. At present, there are more than 600 tags 
in the tag set. In addition to this, some word-
specific tags are also there. The tag set is very user 
friendly and while choosing tag names existing tag 
sets for English and other such languages were 
taken into consideration, like NNMSD –  
masculine, singular, and direct case noun, 
PNPMPOF – masculine, plural, oblique case, and 
first person personal pronoun. The approach 
followed for part of speech tagging is rule-based, 
as there is no tagged corpus for Punjabi available 
at present. As the text we are processing may have 
grammatical agreement errors, so the part of 
speech tagging rules are devised considering this. 
The rules are applied in sequential order with each 
rule having an attached priority to control its order 
in this sequence. 
 For phrase chunking, again a rule-based 
approach was selected mainly due to the similar 
reasons as for part of speech tagging. The tag set 
that is being used for phrase chunking includes 
tags like NPD – noun phrase in direct case, NPNE 
– noun phrase followed by u0A28ੇ ne etc. The rules for 
phrase chunking also take into account the 
potential errors in the text, like lack of agreement 
in words of a potential phrase. However, as would 
be expected there is no way to take the misplaced 
words of a phrase into account, like if words of a 
phrase are separated (having some other phrase in 
between) then that cannot be taken as a single 
phrase, even though this may be a potential error. 
 In the last phase i.e. grammar checking, there 
are again manually designed error detection rules 
to detect potential errors in the text and provide 
corrections to resolve those errors. For example, 
rule to check modifier and noun agreement, will go 
through all the noun phrases in a sentence to check 
if the modifiers of those sentences agree with their 
respective head words (noun/pronoun) in terms of 
gender, number, and case or not. For this matching, 
the grammatical information from the tags of those 
words is used. In simple terms, it will compare the 
grammatical information (gender, number, and 
case) of modifier with the headword 
(noun/pronoun) and displays an error message if 
some grammatical information fails to match. To 
resolve this error, the grammar checking module 
will use morphological generator, to generate the 
correct form (based on headword’s gender, 
number, and case) for that modifier from its root 
word.  
 For example, consider the grammatically 
incorrect sentence u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A47 u0A32u0A5Cu0A15u0A3E u0A1Cg127u0A26u0A3E u0A39u0A48 sohne larka 
janda hai ‘handsome boy goes’. In this sentence in 
the noun phrase, u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A47 u0A32u0A5Cu0A15u0A3E sohne larka ‘handsome 
boy’, the modifier u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A47 sohne ‘handsome’ (root 
word – u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A3E sohna ‘handsome’), with masculine 
gender, plural number, and direct case, is not in 
accordance with the gender, number, case of its 
head word. It should be in singular number instead 
of plural. The grammar checking module will 
detect this as an error as ‘number’ for modifier and 
headword is not same, then it will use 
morphological generator to generate the ‘singular 
number form’ from its root word, which is same as 
root form i.e. u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A3E sohna ‘handsome’ (masculine 
gender, singular number, and direct case). So, the 
input sentence will be corrected as u0A38u0A4Bu0A39u0A23u0A3E u0A32u0A5Cu0A15u0A3E u0A1Cg127u0A26u0A3E 
u0A39u0A48 sohna larka janda hai ‘handsome boy goes’. 
 The error detection rules in grammar checking 
module are again applied in sequential order with 
priority field to control the sequence. This is done 
to resolve phrase level errors before going on to 
the clause level errors, and then to sentence level 
agreement errors.

3 Grammar
Errors 
At present, this grammar checking system for 
Punjabi detects and provides corrections for 
following grammatical errors, based on the study 
of Punjabi grammar related texts (Chander, 1964; 
Gill and Gleason, 1986; Puar, 1990): 
Modifier and noun agreement 
The modifier of a noun must agree with the noun 
in terms of gender, number, and case. Modifiers of 
a noun include adjectives, pronouns, cardinals, 
ordinals, some forms of verbs etc. 
 
Subject and verb agreement 
In Punjabi text, the verb must agree with the 
subject of the sentence in terms of gender, number, 
and person. There are some special forms of verbs 
like transitive past tense verbs, which need some 
specific postpositions with their subject, like the 
use of u0A28ੇ ne with transitive verbs in perfect form 
etc. 
 
Noun and adjective (in attributive form) 
agreement 
This is different from ‘modifier and noun 
agreement’ as described above in the sense that 
adjective is not preceding noun but can be virtually 
anywhere in the sentence, usually preceding verb 
phrase acting as a complement for it. It must still 
agree with the noun for which it is used in that 
sentence. 
 
Order of the modifiers of a noun in noun phrase 
If a noun has more than one modifier, then those 
modifiers should be in a certain order such that 
phrase modifiers precede single word modifiers but 
pronouns and numerals precede all other. 
 
Order of the words in a verb phrase 
There are certain future tense forms of Punjabi 
verbs that should occur towards the end of verb 
phrase without any auxiliary. In addition, if 
negative and emphatic particles are used in a verb 
phrase then the latter must precede the former. 
 
u0A26u0A3E u0A3Eu0A3Eu0A3E da postposition and following noun phrase 
agreement 
All the forms of u0A26u0A3E da postposition must agree in 
terms of gender, number, and case with the 
following noun phrase that it is connecting with the 
preceding noun phrase. 
 
Some other options covered include noun phrase 
must be in oblique form before a postposition, all 
the noun phrases joined by connectives must have 
same case, main verb should be in root form if 
preceding u0A15u0A47 ke etc.

5 System
Features 
The system is designed in Microsoft Visual C# 
2005 using Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0. The 
entire database of this tool is in XML files with the 
Punjabi text in Unicode format. Some of the 
significant features of this grammar checking 
system are:  
Rules can be turned on and off individually 
Being a rule-based system all the rules provided in 
section 3 can be turned on and off individually 
without requiring any changes in the system. The 
rules are kept in a separate XML file, not hard 
coded into the system. To turn on/off a rule, 
changes can be made to that XML file directly or it 
can be done through the options provided within 
the system.  
 
Error and Suggestions information 
The system is able to provide enough reasons in 
support of every error that it detects. With a 
meaningful description of the rule, it provides the 
grammatical categories that failed to match if there 
is an error and provides the desired correct value 
for those grammatical categories, with suggestions. 
However, the information about grammatical 
categories may not be much meaningful to an 
ordinary user but if someone is learning Punjabi as 
a foreign/second language then information about 
correct grammatical categories according to the 
context can be helpful. Wherever possible system 
also specifies both the words, for which matching 
was performed, making it more clear that what is 
wrong and with respect to what, as shown in 
Figure 1, it shows that which was the head word 
and which word failed to match with it. 
The suggestions produced by the Punjabi 
Grammar Checker for the following grammatically 
incorrect sentence to correct the first incorrect 
word u0A30u0A39u0A40u0A06u0A02 rahian ‘-ing plural’ are u0A3Fu0A30u0A39u0A3E riha ‘-ing 
singular’ and u0A30u0A39u0A40 rahi ‘-ing singular’:  
u0A2Eg130 u0A16u0A47u0A21 u0A30u0A39u0A40u0A06u0A02 u0A39u0A28  
main khed rahian han  ‘I are playing’ 
 
943
 
Figure 1. Punjabi Grammar Checker – Error Reason 
 
Figure 1 shows the grammatical categories that 
failed to match for the subject u0A2Eg130 main ‘I’ and part 
of the verb phrase u0A30u0A39u0A40u0A06u0A02 rahian ‘-ing plural’. It 
provides the values for the grammatical categories 
that failed to match for the incorrect word along 
with the desired values for correction.  
6 System
Scope 
The system is designed to work on the literary 
style Punjabi text with SOV (Subject Object Verb) 
sentence structure. At present, it works properly on 
simple or kernel sentences. It can detect any 
agreement errors in compound or complex 
sentences also. However, there may be some false 
alarms in such sentences. The sentences in which 
word order is shuffled for emphasis has not been 
considered, along with the sentences in which 
intonation alone is used for emphasis. Due to 
emphatic intonation, the meaning or word class of 
a word may be changed in a sentence e.g., u0A24u0A47 te 
‘and’ is usually a connective but if emphasized it 
can be used as an emphatic particle. However, this 
is hard to detect from the written form of the text 
and thus has not been considered. However, if 
some emphatic particles like u0A39u0A40 he u0A08 ee u0A35u0A40 ve etc., 
are used directly in a sentence to show emphasis 
then that is given due consideration.  
7 Hardware
and Software Requirements 
The system needs hardware and software as would 
be expected from a typical word processing 
application. A Unicode compatible Windows XP 
based PC with 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB of hard disk 
space and Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 
installed, would be sufficient.
