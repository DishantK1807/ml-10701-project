For both the language modeling and information extraction, we are using the partial parser Sparser (McDonald 1992).

We are using the partial parser "Sparser" (McDonald 1992), which was developed for extracting information from open text, such as Wall Street Journal articles.

There is currently a upsurge in research in partial parsing in the natural language community (e.g., Hindle 1983, Weischedel, et al.1991), where rather than building a single syntactic tree for each sentence, a forest is returned, and phrases outside the coverage of the grammar and unknown words are systematically ignored.

As Schabes (1992) points out in reference to lexicalized stochastic tree adjoining grammars (SLTAG), an effective linguistic model must capture both lexical and hierarchical information.
