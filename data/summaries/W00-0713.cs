From the original data set, used by (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994), (Collins and Brooks, 1995), and (Zavrel et al., 1997), (Daelemans et al., 1999) took the train and test set together to form the particular data also used here.

We assume a tagger architecture that processes a sentence from a disambiguated left to an ambiguous right context, as described in (Daelemans et al., 1996).

More generally, further research should focus on the scaling properties of the approach (including the scaling of the external ruleinduction algorithm), should investigate more and larger language data sets, and should seek comparisons with other existing methods that claim to handle complex features efficiently (Brill, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Roth, 1998; Brants, 2000).

(Veenstra, 1998) used the Base-NP tag set as presented in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): I for inside a Base-NP, O for outside a Base-NP, and B for the first word in a Base-NP following another Base-NP.
