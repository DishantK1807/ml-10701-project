Stochastic approaches to linguistic analyses have been strongly reevaluated in the past few years, either for syntactic analysis (Gm'side et al.1987, Church 1988), or for NLP applications (Brown et al.1988), or for semantic analysis (Zemik 1989, Smadja 1989).

As a matter of fact, dictionaries now tend to encode all the theoreticcd possibilities on a same level, but "if e;'e~ possibility in the diction:m, must be given equal weight, parsing is very diificult" (Church 1988, p.3): they should provide infornaation on what is more likely to occur, e.g. relative likelihood of alternate pm-ts of speech for a word or of ahernate word-senses, both out of context and it" possible taking into account contextu~d factors.

3. The strength of association within word-pairs As regards the first point we have used the method of measuring thc association ratio between two words as described by Church and llanks (1989).

l.troduction: LDB requirements The creation and development of a large Lexical Database (LDB) which, until now, mainly reuses the data found in standard Machine Readable Dictionaries, has been going on in Pisa for a number of years (see Calzolari 1984, 1988, Calzolari, Picchi 1988).
