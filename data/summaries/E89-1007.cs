Koskenniemi(1985) refined the notation and sketched a compilation method, and Ritchie, Black et a1.(1987), Karttunen et al.(1987) describe compilation techniques for two variants of the notation.

BACKGROUND Koskenniemi(1983a,b;1984) proposed a rule-system for describing morphological regularities in a language, depending centrally on the idea of matching two sequences of symbols a lexical string (made up of the lexical forms of morphemes) and a surface string (the sequence of characters in the normal, inflected, form of the word).
P84-1038
By way of illustration, here is a two-level morphological rule taken from Ritchie, Pulman et al.(1987): e:0 <=> =:C2 < +:0 V:= > or < C:C V:V> <+:0 e:e> or {g:g c:c} <+:0 {e:e i:i} > or 1:0 +:0 or c:c <+:0 a:0 t:t> Rules are phrased in terms of symbol-pairs (written with an infix colon), where the first in the pair is a lexical symbol and the second is a surface symbol.

The formalisation given here will deal only with the core ideas, as embodied in Koskenniemi(1985) (and other implementations such as Karttunen et al.(1987), -51 Ritchie, Black, et a1.(1987)).
