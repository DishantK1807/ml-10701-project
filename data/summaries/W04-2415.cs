Hierarchical Recognition of Propositional Arguments with Perceptrons Xavier Carreras and Llu´ıs M`arquez TALP Research Centre Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) fcarreras,lluismg@lsi.upc.es Grzegorz Chrupała GRIAL Research Group University of Barcelona (UB) grzegorz@pithekos.net 1 Introduction We describe a system for the CoNLL-2004 Shared Task on Semantic Role Labeling (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004a).
W04-2412
The learning algorithm follows the global strategy introduced in (Collins, 2002) and adapted in (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004b) for partial parsing tasks.
W02-1001 W04-2412
The algorithm is essentially the same as the one introduced in (Collins, 2002).
