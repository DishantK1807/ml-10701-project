The Monroe domain (Tetreault et al., 2004; Stent, 2001) is a series of task-oriented dialogues between human participants set in a simulated rescue operation domain, where participants collaboratively plan responses to emergency calls.

Finally, it is clear that finding only the discourse context referents of a noun phrase is not sufficient; intuitively, and as shown by Schuler (2002), realworld referents can also aid in the parsing task.

Schuler (2002) describes a parser which builds both a syntactic tree and a denotation-based semantic analysis as it parses.

Adding semantic information increases the accuracy of the reference resolution from 44% to 58% (Tetreault and Allen, 2004), and consequently improves the feedback provided to the parser.

For example, there are a number of robust semantic processing systems (Pinkal et al., 2000; Rose, 2000; Worm, 1998; Zechner, 1998) which contain incremental parsers that pass on partial results immediately to the robust semantic analysis component, which begins to work on combining these sentence fragments.

Incremental Parsing Architecture Many current parsers fall into the class of historybased grammars (Black et al., 1992).

Computational parsers, however, still tend to operate an entire sentence at a time, despite the advent of speech-to-intention dialogue systems such as Verbmobil (Kasper et al., 1996; Noth et al., 2000; Pinkal et al., 2000), Gemini (Dowding et al., 1993; Dowding et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1995) and TRIPS (Allen et al., 1996; Ferguson et al., 1996; Ferguson and Allen, 1998).

One of the major current applications of parsers that operate incrementally is for language modelling in speech recognition (Brill et al., 1998; Jelinek and Chelba, 1999).
