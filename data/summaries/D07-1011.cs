This study falls within a recent trend in which empirical issues in GRE have begun to be tackled (Gupta and Stent, 2005; Jordan andWalker, 2005; ViethenandDale, 2006).

Evaluation results showed that these principles are on the right track, with significantly better performance over a previous model (van Deemter, 2002).

Efficiency: Searching through disjunctive combinations results in a combinatorial explosion (van Deemter, 2002).

For example, {e1,e3} can be distinguished by the following Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) description1: (2) 〈TYPE : desk〉∧`〈COLOUR : red〉∨〈COLOUR : blue〉´∧` 〈ORIENTATION : right〉∨〈ORIENTATION : back〉´ Such a description would be returned by a generalised version of Algorithm 1 proposed by van Deemter (2002).

GRE has been dominated by Dale and Reiter’s (1995) Incremental Algorithm (IA), one version of which, generalised to deal with non-disjunctive plural references, is shown in Algorithm 1 (van Deemter, 2002).

As a result, IApart considers values of an attribute in order of discriminatory power (Dale, 1989), defined in the present context as follows: |[[ 〈A : v〉 ]] ∩R| + |[[ 〈A : v〉 ]] − (U −R)| |[[ 〈A : v〉 ]]| (9) Discriminatorypowerdependsonthenumberofreferents a property includes in its extension, and the number of distractors (U−R) it removes.

This markup abstracts away from differences in lexicalisation, making it an ideal resource to evaluate content determination algorithms, because it is semantically transparent, in the sense of this term used by van Deemter et al.(2006). This markup scheme also enables the compositional derivation of a logical form from a natural language description.

Proposals to deal with (3) include Gardent’s (2002) non-incremental, constraint-based algorithm to generate the briefest available description of a set, an approach extended in Gardent et al.(2004). An alternative, by Horacek (2004), combines bestfirst search with optimisation to reduce logical complexity.
P02-1013
Due to its hillclimbing nature, the IA avoids combinatorial search, unlike some predecessors which searched exhaustively for the briefest possible description of a referent (Dale, 1989), based on a strict interpretation of the Gricean Maxim of Quantity (Grice, 1975).
P89-1009
Form: Descriptions can become logically very complex (Gardent, 2002; Horacek, 2004).
P02-1013
Other approaches, such as Gardent’s (2002) brevityoriented algorithm, would perform poorly on our data.
P02-1013
Unlike van Deemter (2002), we only focus on disjunction, leaving negation aside.
