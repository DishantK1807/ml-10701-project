Parser The parser is based on Clark et al.(2002) and takes as input a POS-tagged sentence with a set of possible lexical categories assigned to each word.

This paper assumes a basic knowledge of CCG; see Steedman (2000) and Clark et al.(2002) for an introduction.

Note that the inside-outside approach can be combined with any maximum entropy estimation procedure, such as those evaluated by Malouf (2002).
W02-2018
Clark et al.(2002) give examples showing how heads can fill dependency slots during a derivation, and how long-range dependencies can be recovered through unification of co-indexed head variables.

Statistical parsing models have recently been developed for Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG, Steedman (2000)) and used in wide-coverage parsers applied to the WSJ Penn Treebank (Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002).

The theory underlying log-linear models is described in Della Pietra et al.(1997) and Berger et al.(1996). Briefly, the log-linear form in (6) is derived by choosing the model with maximum entropy from a set of models that satisfy a certain set of constraints (Rosenfeld, 1996).

Implementations of GIS typically use a “correction feature”, but following Curran and Clark (2003) we do not use such a feature, which simplifies the algorithm.
E03-1071
In this paper we use a dynamic programming technique applied to a packed chart, similar to those proposed by Geman and Johnson (2002) and Miyao and Tsujii (2002), which efficiently estimates the model parameters over the complete space without enumerating parses.
P02-1036
We would like the parsing model to include long-range dependencies, but this introduces problems for generative parsing models similar to those described by Abney (1997) for attribute-value grammars; hence Hockenmaier and Steedman do not include such dependencies in their model, and Clark et al.include the dependencies but use an inconsistent model.
J97-4005
We have just begun the process of evaluating parsing performance using the same test data as Clark et al.(2002). We are especially interested in the effectiveness of incorporating long-range dependencies as features, which CCG was designed to handle and for which we expect a log-linear model to be particularly effective.
P02-1042
A Gaussian prior also handles the problem of “pseudo-maximal” features (Johnson et al., 1999).
P99-1069
Grammar Following Clark et al.(2002), we augment CCG lexical categories with head and dependency information.

3 Log-Linear Models for CCG Previous parsing models for CCG include a generative model over normal-form derivations (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002) and a conditional model over dependency structures (Clark et al., 2002).

Charts Geman and Johnson (2002) have proposed a dynamic programming estimation method for packed representations of unification-based parses.
P02-1036
Log-linear models have previously been applied to statistical parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Toutanova et al., 2002; Riezler et al., 2002; Osborne, 2000).

The supertagger of Clark (2002) provides the lexical categories, with a parameter setting which assigns around 4 categories per word on average.
