(Church and Gale, 1995b) extend this work, showing how to model word ~equency distributions in a manner consistent with the fact that some words are evenly spread, while others tend to occur often in documents where they occur at all.

It is of interest in its own right, because a sublanguage corpus, or one containing only a specific language variety, has very different characteristics to a general corpus (Biber, 1993), yet it is not obvious how a corpus's position on this scale can be assessed.

A recent paper by (Sekine, 1997) explores the domain dependence of parsing.

(Church and Gale, 1995a) show how Inverse Document Frequency, a measure based on the proportion of documents a word occurs in, can be used alongside word frequency to estimate how distinctive a word is of the texts it occurs in.

(Dunning, 1993) and (Pedersen, 1996) shows how some of the methods which have been used in the past (particularly mutual information scores) are invalid for rare events, and introduce accurate measures of how 'surprising' rare events are.

For a perfect language model, the cross-entropy would be the entropy of the corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993; Charniak, 1993).
