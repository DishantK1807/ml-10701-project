We have therefore chosen to re-use an existing handcrafted grammar which produces compositionally derived underspecified logical forms, namely the wide-coverage grammar, morphological analyser and lexicon provided by the Alvey Natural Language Tools (ANLT) system (Carroll et al.1991, Grover et al.1993). Our immediate aim is to increase coverage up to a reasonable level and thereafter to experiment with ranking the parses, e.g. using Briscoe and Carroll’s (1993) probabilistic extension of the ANLT software.

The version of the ANLT system described in Carroll et al.(1991) and Grover et al.(1993) does not allow tagged input but work by Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on statistical parsing uses an adapted version of the system which is able to process tagged input, ignoring the words in order to parse sequences of tags.

The lemmatisation is performed by Minnen et al.’s (2000) morpha program which is not an XML processor.

There was radiographic JJ evidence NN of diminished JJ or stabilized JJ pleural JJ effusion NN 2The LT TTT tagger uses the Penn Treebank tagset (Marcus et al., 1994): JJ labels adjectives, NN labels nouns and VB labels verbs.

The computation of ‘grammatical relations’ from shallow parsers or chunkers is still at an early stage (Buchholz et al., 1999, Carroll et al., 1998) and there are few other robust semantic processors, and none in the medical domain.

Our current pipeline includes a call to Elworthy’s (1994) CLAWS2 tagger.

The identification of sentence boundaries, mark-up of sentence elements and POS tagging is done by the statistical program ltpos (Mikheev, 1997).

As a final stage, we may find it useful to follow Kasper et al.(1999) and have a ‘fallback’ strategy for failed parses where the best partial analyses are assembled in a robust processing phase.
