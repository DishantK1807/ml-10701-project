Recently, two algorithms for resolving APAs and individual pronominal anaphors (henceforth IPAs) in specific English dialogues have been proposed Eckert and Strube-s (2000) es00 and Byron-s (2002) phora.

(Byron and Allen, 1998) and even more in Danish (Navarretta, 2004).

The reliability for the two annotation tasks (κ-statistics (Carletta, 1996)) was of 0.94 and 0.90 respectively.

We have compared the obtained results with those obtained by testing bfp (Brennan et al., 1987) and str98 (Strube, 1998).

In phora the antecedents of personal pronouns are searched for looking at their degree of salience which is implemented by word order as in (Grosz et al., 1995).

(Grosz et al., 1995), with Hajiˇcov´aet al.-s (1990) salience account which assigns the highest degree of salience to entities in the focal part of an utterance in Information Structure terms, which often introduce new information in discourse.
