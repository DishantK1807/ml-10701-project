Mackay and Kondrak (2005) adapted the algorithm to calculate similarity scores for word pairs in orthographic form, focusing on identifying translation equivalents in bilingual corpora.

As in Mackay and Kondrak (2005) and described above, we use the Forward and Viterbi algorithms in both their regular (normalised for length) and log-odds form to calculate similarity scores for every word pair.

Just as Mackay and Kondrak (2005), we found the overall best performance was obtained using the logoddsversionofViterbialgorithm(withinsertionand deletion probabilities based on the token frequencies).

Mackay and Kondrak(2005)proposearandommodelwhichhasonly insertion and deletion states and generates one word completely before the other, e.g. m O @ l k @ m E l @ k X X X X X X Y Y Y Y Y The model is described by the transition probability  and is displayed in Figure 3.

Mackay and Kondrak (2005) introduce Pair Hidden Markov Models (PairHMMs) to language studies, applying them to the problem of recognising ?cognates??in the sense of machine translation, i.e. pairs of words in different languages that are similar enough in sound and meaning to serve as translation equivalents.

Following Mackay and Kondrak (2005), we also experimented with a modified PairHMM obtained by setting non-substitution parameters constant.

The emission probabilities can be either set equal to the insertion and deletion probabilities of the word similarity model (Durbin et al., 1998) or can be specified separately based on the token frequencies in the data set (Mackay and Kondrak, 2005).

First, we can use the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the probability of the best alignment and use this probability as a similarity score (after correcting for length; see Mackay and Kondrak, 2005).

Martijn Wieling, Therese Leinonen and John Nerbonne apply PAIR HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS (PHMM), introduced to CL by Mackay and Kondrak (2005), to a large collection of Dutch dialect pronunciations in an effort to learn the degree of segment differentiation.
W05-0606
Like Mackay and Kondrak (2005) we evaluate the results both on a specific task, in our case, dialect classification, and also via examination of the segment substitution probabilities induced by the PairHMM training procedures.

Levenshtein distance The Levenshtein distance was introduced by Kessler (1995) as a tool for measuring linguistic distances between language varieties and has been successfully applied in dialect comparison (Nerbonne et al., 1996; Heeringa, 2004).
