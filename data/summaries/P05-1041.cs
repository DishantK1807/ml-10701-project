By using a Japanese grammar (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002) based on a monostratal theory of grammar (HPSG: Pollard and Sag, 1994) we could simultaneously annotate syntactic and semantic structure without overburdening the annota330 tor.

This kind of dynamic, discriminant-based treebanking was pioneered in the Redwoods treebank of English (Oepen et al., 2002), so we refer to it as Redwoods-style treebanking.

We are constructing the Hinoki treebank as part of a larger project in cognitive and computational linguistics ultimately aimed at natural language understanding (Bond et al., 2004).

The Japanese grammar JACY was extended until the coverage was over 80% (Bond et al., 2004).

In the next phase of the Hinoki project, we are concentrating on acquiring an ontology from these semantic representations and using it to improve the parse selection (Bond et al., 2004).

The system we used for treebanking was the [incr tsdb()] Redwoods environment2 (Oepen et al., 2002).
C02-2025
As computational grammars and parsers have increased in coverage and accuracy, an alternate approach has become feasible, in which utterances are parsed and the annotator selects the best parse Carter (1997); Oepen et al.(2002) from the full analyses derived by the grammar.
