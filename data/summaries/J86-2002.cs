McCoy (1982) and McKeown (1982) attempt to provide answers to questions about the structure of the data base rather than extensional information as to its contents.

McKeown, K.R. 1982 The TEXT System for Natural Language Generation: An Overview.
P82-1028
In this sense they are very similar to McCoy's (1982) "very specific axioms", although how they interact with heuristics to produce summary responses is different.
P82-1029
The approach taken in McKeown's (1982) TEXT system is also appealing in this regard since its area of application is data bases (albeit describing database structure rather than database contents).
P82-1028
Preferred attributes perform for our system the same function that McCoy's (1982) "important attributes list" does for the ENHANCE system.
P82-1029
Together with the heuristics, they give our system many of the abilities of McCoy's (1982) ENHANCE system to reflect a user's preconceived notions as to which patterns of data are meaningful and which are not.
P82-1029
The interesting patterns are similar to McCoy's (1982) "distinguishing descriptive attributes", although we use them to produce summary responses rather than to answer questions on database structure.

Further details of these examples (and others) are contained in Kalita (1984).

A readable overview of the system can be found in Kalita, Colbourn (Jones) and McCalla (1984); a detailed presentation is available in Kalita (1984).

Pioneering front-end systems such as REL (Thompson and Thompson 1975), LUNAR (Woods, Kaplan, and Nash-Webber 1972), ROBOT (Harris 1977), "PLANES (Waltz 1978), REQUEST (Plath 1976), TORUS (Mylopoulos et al.1976), and RENDEZVOUS (Codd et al.1978) experimented with, among other things, various parsing formalisms (e.g.

Researchers such as Davidson (1982), Grosz (1977), Sidner and Israel (1981), and Webber (1978) have tackled problems such as the resolution of anaphoric references, the tracking of the user's focus of attention, and the generation of cooperative responses.
