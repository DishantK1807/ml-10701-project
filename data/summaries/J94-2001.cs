It is interesting to note that the most commonly used method is Viterbi tagging (see DeRose 1988; Church 1989) although it is not the optimal method for evaluation at word level.

These kinds of considerations fit nicely inside a probabilistic formulation of the problem (Beale 1985; Garside and Leech 1985), which offers the following advantages: • a sound theoretical framework is provided • the approximations are clear • the probabilities provide a straightforward way to disambiguate • the probabilities can be estimated automatically from data.

Data We use the "treebank" data described in Beale (1988).

Two main approaches have generally been considered: rule-based (Klein and Simmons 1963; Brodda 1982; Paulussen and Martin 1992; Brill et al.1990) probabilistic (Bahl and Mercer 1976; Debili 1977; Stolz, Tannenbaum, and Carstensen 1965; Marshall 1983; Leech, Garside, and Atwell 1983; Derouault and Merialdo 1986; DeRose 1988; Church 1989; Beale 1988; Marcken 1990; Merialdo 1991; Cutting et al.1992). More recently, some work has been proposed using neural networks (Benello, Mackie, and Anderson 1989; Nakamura and Shikano 1989).
