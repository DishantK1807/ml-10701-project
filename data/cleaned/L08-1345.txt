This is probably because the lexicons are often manually created and make use of knowledge and expertise that is difficult to codify&amp;quot; (Lamel and Adda, 1996). This paper attempts to go some way towards rectifying this lack of discussion. 2.1 General lexicon versus placename lexicon In the case of a lexicon of placenames, the task of producing this lexico</context>

The work reported here is an extension of that work, which was developed within the &amp;quot;Festival&amp;quot; TTS framework (Taylor et al., 1998). Welsh has particular features which are relevant: a) The correspondence between Welsh orthography and pronunciation is very regular, so letter-to-sound (LTS) rules will give good results for standa</context>
