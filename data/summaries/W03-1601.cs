Our approach is fundamentally di#0Berent from systems that reason directly about syntax and build realizations by syntactic rank #28#28Bateman, 1997#29, #28Elhadad et al., 1997#29; #28Nicolov et al., 1995#29; #28Stone and Doran, 1997#29#29.

Our mapping between semantic and syntactic constituents bears resemblance to the pairingsin Synchronous TAG #28Shieber and Schabes, 1990#29.

One grammatical formalism that is well-suited for our purposes is the D-Tree Substitution Grammars #28DSG, #28Rambow et al., 2001#29#29, a variant of Tree-Adjoining Grammars #28TAG#29.

One standard approach to sentence generation from predicate#2Fargument structure #28like the semantic-head-driven generation in #28Shieber et al., 1990#29#29 involves a simple algorithm.
