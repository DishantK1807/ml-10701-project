In addition, we hope to incorporate class-based techniques, such as the modeling of verb-argument selectional preferences \[Resnik, 1992\], as a mechanism for achieving improved performance on unfamiliar collocations.

As a solution to the data shortages for the above methods, \[Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b\] proposed the use of "pseudo-words," artificial sense ambiguities created by taking two English words with the same part of speech (such as guerilla and reptile), and replacing each instance of both in a corpus with a new polysemous word guerrilla~reptile.

ONE SENSE PER COLLOCATION David Yarowsky* Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 yarowsky@unagi.cis.upenn.edu ABSTRACT Previous work \[Gale, Church and Yarowsky, 1992\] showed that with high probability a polysemous word has one sense per discourse.

More recent work \[Brown et al.1991\]\[Hearst 1991\] has utilized a set of discrete local questions (such as word-to-the-right) in the development of statistical decision procedures.
