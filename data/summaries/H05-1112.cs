This includes the seminal paper of (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), Senseval 3 and coNLL competitions on automatic labeling of semantic roles detection of noun compound semantics (Lapata, 2000), (Rosario and Hearst, 2001) and many others.

For the automatic detection of the semantic relations encoded by genitives, the boundary constructed by the Semantic Scattering model is more apppropriate than a “tree cut”, like the ones used for verb disambiguation (McCarthy, 1997) (Li and Abe, 1998) and constructed using the Minimum Description Length model (Rissanen, 1978).

In 1999, Berland and Charniak (Berland and Charniak, 1999) applied statistical methods on a very large corpus to find PART-WHOLE relations.

Using a state-of-the-art open-text WSD system with 70% accuracy for nouns (Novischi et al., 2004), each word is mapped into its corresponding WordNet 2.0 sense.

Each genitive instance was tagged with the corresponding semantic relations by two annotators, based on a list of 35 most frequently used semantic relations proposed by (Moldovan et al., 2004) and shown in Table 1.
