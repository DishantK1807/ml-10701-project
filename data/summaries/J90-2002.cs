Statistical methods have proven their value in automatic speech recognition (Bahl et al.1983) and have recently been applied to lexicography (Sinclair 1985) and to natural language processing (Baker 1979; Ferguson 1980; Garside et al.1987; Sampson 1986; Sharman et al.1988). We feel that it is time to give them a chance in machine translation.
