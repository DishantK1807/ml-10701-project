For languages with limited electronic resources, i.e. low-density languages, however, we cannot use automated techniques based on parallel corpora (Gale and Church, 1991; Melamed, 2000; Resnik, 1999; Utsuro et al., 2002), comparable corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998), or multilingual thesauri (Vossen, 1998).

TBL(Brill,1995)isarule-basedmachinelearning method with some attractive qualities that make it suitable for language related tasks.
J95-4004
TBL (Brill, 1995), a rule-based machine learning algorithm, has been applied to various NLP tasks.

To overcome the lengthy training time associated with this approach, we used fnTBL, a fast version of TBL that preserves the performance of the algorithm (Ngai and Florian, 2001).
