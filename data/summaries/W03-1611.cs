To solve this problem, we adopt an idea one sense per collocation which was introduced in word sense disambiguation research (Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
Most of previous work on paraphrasing took corpus-based approach with notable exceptions of Jacquemin (Jacquemin et al., 1997; Jacquemin, 1999) and Katz (Katz, 1997).
P97-1004 P99-1044
To deal with variations of linguistic expressions, paraphrasing has recently been studied for various applications of natural language processing, such as machine translation (Mitamura, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002), dialog systems (Ebert et al., 2001), QA systems (Katz, 1997) and information extraction (Shinyama et al., 2002).

Barzilay and McKeown assume that two translations from the same original text contain paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001).

In particular, text alignment technique is generally used to find sentence level paraphrases (Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2002).
W02-1022
However, query expansion of phrasal index terms has not been fully investigated yet (Jacquemin et al., 1997).

As shown in this example, the paraphrases generated based on Japanese word formation rule cannot be classified in terms of the past paraphrase classification (Jacquemin et al., 1997).
