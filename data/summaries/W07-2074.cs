Most systems did not use sense tagged data for disambiguation though MELB did use SemCor (Miller et al., 1993b) for filtering infrequent synonyms and UNT used a semi-supervised word sense disambiguation combined with a host of other techniques, including machine translation engines.

We also obtain salient bigrams in the context, with the methods and the software described in (Pedersen, 2001).

Bag of WordNet synsets The WordNet (Miller, 1993) synonym sets and their hypernyms of all the open class words that occur in the same sentence as the target preposition.

Notice that our calculation of the MFS is based on the frequencies in the SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993), as we exploit WordNet sense rankings.

Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

for the all-words task To train the classifiers for the all-words task we just used Semcor (Miller et al., 1993).

Compared with WordNet (Miller et al., 1993)?? which has been used widely in QA?FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet are still relatively new, and therefore their usefulness for QA has still to be proven.

1The PoS tagging was performed with the fnTBL toolkit (Ngai and Florian, 2001).
