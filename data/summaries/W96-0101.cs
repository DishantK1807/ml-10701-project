In the part-of-speech hterature, whether taggers are based on a rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons, 1963), (Brill, 1992), (Voutilainen, 1993), or on a statistical one (Bahl and Mercer, 1976), (Leech et al., 1983), (Merialdo, 1994), (DeRose, 1988), (Church, 1989), (Cutting et al., 1992), there is a debate as to whether more attention should be paid to lexical probabilities rather than contextual ones.

We have used a toolkit developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories (Pereira et al., 1994) which manipulates weighted and unweighted finite-state machines (acceptors or transducers).

(Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995) compare two tagging frameworks for tagging French, one that is statistical, built upon the Xerox tagger (Cutting et al., 1992), and another based on linguistic constraints only.

with other approaches In some sense, this approach is similar to the notion of "ambiguity classes" explained in (Kupiec, 1992) and (Cutting et al., 1992) where words that belong to the same part-of-speech figure together.

(Brill, 1995) presents a rule-based part-of-speech tagger for unsupervised training corpus.
