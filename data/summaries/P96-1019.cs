Recent work includes (Sproat et al., 1994) and (Wang et al., 1992).
C92-4199 P94-1010
In (Wang et al., 1992), a title driven method was used to identify personal names.
C92-4199
This confirms what reported in (Sproat et al., 1994).
P94-1010
This can be done, for instance, by a simple greedy algorithm described in (Sproat et al., 1994).
P94-1010
In (Sproat et al., 1994) a class based model was proposed to identify personal names.
P94-1010
The number reported here is the arithmetic average of recall and precision, as was used in n_~ (Sproat et al., 1994), i.e., 1/2(~-~ + n2), where nc is the number of common words in both segmentations, nl and n2 are the number of words in each of the segmentations.
