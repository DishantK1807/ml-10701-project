Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004).

A similar line of thinking can be applied to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents, resulting in a graph-based ranking model called TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), which can be used for a variety of natural language processing applications where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking/selection decisions.

It is also notable the study reported in (Lin and Hovy, 2003b) discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for summarization, which emphasizes the need of accurate tools for sentence extraction, as an integral part of automatic summarization systems.

For evaluation, we are using the ROUGE evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on Ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (Lin and Hovy, 2003a).

Previous approaches include supervised learning (Teufel and Moens, 1997), vectorial similarity computed between an initial abstract and sentences in the given document, or intra-document similarities (Salton et al., 1997).
