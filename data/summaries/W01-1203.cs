This paper describes the critical challenges that a parser faces in Q&A applications and reports on a number of extensions of a deterministic machine-learning based shift-reduce parser, CONTEX (Hermjakob 1997, 2000), which was previously developed for machine translation applications.

A scenario with a question in multiple variations, as cleverly exploited by the SMU team (Harabagiu, 2000) in TREC9 for maybe about 10% of the 500 original questions, is probably more of an anomaly and can’t be assumed to be typical.

Srihari and Li (2000), has shown that it is important to classify questions with respect to their answer types.

Parse trees [1] and [12] are examples of our system’s structure, whereas [18] and [30] represent the same question/answer pair in the more syntactically oriented structure of the Penn treebank5 (Marcus 1993).
