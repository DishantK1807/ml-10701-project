In (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) a dependency 54 tree kernel is used to detect the Named Entity classes in natural language texts.

The pastc uses the tree kernel function defined in (Collins and Duffy, 2002).

The same idea has been successfully applied to the parse-tree reranking task (Taskar et al., 2004; Collins and Duffy, 2002) and predicate argument classification (Moschitti, 2004).

A refinement of such technique was presented in (Taskar et al., 2004).

Another interesting model for parsing re-ranking based on tree kernel is presented in (Taskar et al., 2004).

These standard features, firstly proposed in (Gildea and Jurasfky, 2002), refer to unstructured information derived from parse trees, i.e.

A viable alternative has been proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002), where convolution kernels were used to implicitly define a tree substructure space.

As referring dataset, we used the PropBank corpora available at www.cis.upenn.edu/∼ace, along with the Penn TreeBank 2 (www.cis.upenn.edu/∼treebank) (Marcus et al., 1993).

For the pastc we used λ = 0.4 (see (Moschitti, 2004)).

The tree kernel used in this article was proposed in (Collins and Duffy, 2002) for syntactic parsing reranking.
P02-1034
The modeling of syntactic/semantic based features should take into account linguistic aspects to detect the interesting context, e.g. the ancestor nodes or the semantic dependencies (Toutanova et al., 2004).
