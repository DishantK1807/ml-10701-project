Using comparable corpora, the named-entities for persons and locations were extracted from the English text; in this paper, the English named-entities were extracted using the named-entity recognizer described in Li et al.(2004), based on the SNoW machine learning toolkit (Carlson et al., 1999).

Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997) assigned a weight for each feature based on entropy and information gain, but the results were even less accurate than the method without weight.

In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao et al., 2006) and apply it to the problem of transliteration.

MRRs of the phonetic transliteration The baseline was computed using the phonetic transliteration method proposed in Tao et al.(2006). In contrast to the method in this study, the baseline system is purely based on linguistic knowledge.
W06-1630
The proposed method is developed from the phonetic method originally proposed in Tao et al.(2006). In contrast to the phonetic method in Tao et al.(2006) constructed on the basis of pure linguistic knowledge, the method in this study is trained using the Winnow machine learning algorithm.

This is quite small compared to previous approaches such as Knight and Graehl (1998) or Gao et al.(2004). In addition, 1500 words were randomly selected from the newspaper in the target languages, and paired with English words in the positive examples.

The pseudo features in this study are same as in Tao et al.(2006). Swan & Smith (2002)’s study covers 25 languages including Asian languages such as Thai, Korean, Chinese and Japanese, European languages such as German, Italian, French and Polish, and Middle East languages such as Arabic and Farsi.

The substitution/insertion/deletion cost for the string alignment algorithm is based on the baseline cost from (Tao et al, 2006).

Using the 495 characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names (Sproat et al., 1996), a sequence of three of more characters from the list was taken as a possible candidate for Chinese.
J96-3004
(Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Gao et al., 2004) — has mostly assumed that one has a training lexicon of transliteration pairs, from which one can learn a model, often a sourcechannel or MaxEnt-based model.

Gildea and Jurafsky (1996) counted the number of features whose values are different, and used them as a substitution cost.
