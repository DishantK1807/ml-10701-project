Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994)'s results are the best reported so far using only classes (for 100% coverage): 79.1%.
H94-1048
4.For reasons of complexity, the complete 4-tuple has not been considered simultaneously except in Ratnaparkhi et a1.(1994).
H94-1048
Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994), instead of using hand-crafted semantic classes, uses word classes obtained via Mutual Information Clustering (MIC) in a training corpus.
H94-1048
Collins and Brooks (1995) reported an accuracy of 84.5% using words alone, a better score than those obtained with other methods tested on the WSJ corpus.
W95-0103
Another method for reducing data sparseness has been introduced recently by Collins and Brooks (1995).
W95-0103
When sentences with PP attachment ambiguities were presented to two human expert judges the mean accuracy obtained was 93.2% using the whole sentence and 88.2% using only the 4-tuple (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994).
H94-1048
Collins and Brooks (1995) showed how serious this problem can be: almost 95% of the 3097 4-tuples of their test set do not appear in their 20801 training set 4tuples.
W95-0103
21418 examples of structures of the kind 'VB N1 PREP N2' were extracted from the Penn-TreeBank Wall Street Journal (Marcus et al.1993). WordNet did not cover 100% of this material.
J93-2004
In Brill and Resnik (1994), for instance, for reasons of run-time efficiency and complexity, rules regarding the classes of both nl and n2 were not permitted.
