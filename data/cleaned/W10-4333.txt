Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to get a 
working definio hat matches pole’s
intuitive tiofgsip andisufi-
ciently precise for computational imle-
mentation. We conducted two experi-
s nvestigatng what ype of conver-
sations people ntuitively understand 
interpret as gosip, and hether they 
could identify three proposed constitu-
ents of gossip conversations: third per-
son focus, pejorative evalution ad sub-
stantiatng behavior. The results show 
that (1) conversations are ery likelyto
be considered gossip if all elements are 
present, no intmate relationships exist 
between the participants, and the person 
in focus isunambiguos. (2) Conversa-
tionthat have at mt ne gosip ele-
ment are not considered gossip. (3)Con-
versations thatlack one or two elements 
or have an ambiguous element lead t 
inconsistent judgments. 
1 Itrodction

We are intrestd in creating believable charac-
ters, i.e. “characters that provide the illusion of 
life” (Bates, 1994). Since people engage exten-
sively in gossip, such characters also need to be 
able to understand and engage in gossip in or-
der to be believable in some situations. To en-
able characters to in gossip, we need a 
computational model of p that can be ap-
plied n the authoring such characters and/or 
by tcharacters themselves. Unfortunately, 
such a model does not yet exist.  
Moreovr, ther isnot yetacler onseus 
on how gossip should be defined, ad mt of
the definitions are to vague or to general o 
be useful. Merriam-Webster onlie dictonary, 
for example, defines gossip as “rumoror eport
of an intmate nature” and “chatty alk”, neiher 
which s specific enough. What we need is a 
working definito tha () matches pole’
intuitive tio fgsiptothe extent sible, 
given that the notion itself is somewhat vague, 
and (b) is sufficiently precise to provide a basis 
for computational implementation. 
More cntdeftions (e.g. Eder an Enke, 
1991;Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallettal., 
2009) have been derived fromanalyzing tran-
scriptions of real gossip conversations. These 
definitonly minor individual differ-
ences and can in essence be formulated as 
“evaluative talk about an absent third person”. 
We have cosen t use thi defino as start-
ingpint ce it currently isthe mt pecific 
one and since it i bad o t obervd struc-
ture of naturally occurring osip conersa-
tios.
This paper reports the results from two ex-
perimenton gossip conversations. The first 
experiment aimed at investigan what typ of
conversations peole intuitively perceive as 
gossip. In the second study we also anted to 
find out whether the subjects ould accept a
given definition and could apply it by identify-
ing three specified gosip elements. 
 The paper is structured as follows. In sec-
tion 2we give a backgrund to gsip wth re-
spectto both its social function as well as is 
conversational structure. Section 3 inroduces
the experimental method. In sections 4 and 5 
we presnt he two experiments and discuss the 
results. In section 6, finally, we give some final 
remarks and suggestions for future work. 
2 Backgroud

Gosip has ben scribed as mechanism for 
social control (e.g. Gluckman, 1963; Fine and 
Rosnow, 1978; Bergmann, 1993; Eggins nd 
193
Slade, 1997) tha maintans “the unity, morals 
and values of social groups” (Gluckman, 1963). 
It has furthermore been suggested that gossip is 
a form of “information-management”, primar-
ily toimprove one’s selfimage and “protect 
individual interests” (Paine, 1967), but also to
fluence thers (Szwed, ; Fine Rs-
now, 1978). Gossip can furthermore be viewed 
as a form of entertainment (Abrahams, 1970) – 
“a satisfying diversion from the edium of rou-
tine activities” (Fine and Rosnw, 1978:164).  
Recent studies have used a sociologicalp-
proach focusing on analyzing the structure of 
gossip conversations (e.g. Bergmann, 1993; 
Eder and Enke, 1991; Eggins and Slade, 1997;
Hallett et al., 209). Rather than observingand 
interviewing peole in a certaincomunity
about their gossip behavior, they have analyzed 
transcripts ofnaturally occurring osip con-
versations. Their studies showthatgossipers 
collaborate in creating the gossip, making it a 
highly interactive genre. They also identified 
two key elements of gosip:  
• Third peson ocus – the idntifcaon 
of an absent third person hat s c-
quainted wih, but emotionally disjoint 
from the other participants (Bergmann 
(1993) refers to his as being “virtually” 
absent, hile Goodwin (1980) labels it 
“symbolically” absent). 
• An evaluation f the person ifcus or
of his or her behavio. Eggins and 
Slde (1997) propose tha the evaluation 
necessarily is pejorative o separat gos-
sip from other types of chat.  
Halet al. (209) found ta te gosipers 
often use implicit evaluations o conceal the 
critique, suggesting that the gossipers either 
speak in general terms about something that 
implicitly isunderstood tobe about a certain 
person, or that the gossipers avoid evaluati
the behavior er the assmption that e 
evaluation is implicit in the behavior itself. In-
stead of specifying the evaluation as being pe-
jorative, they say i is “unsanctoned”. 
In addition to the two elements described 
above, Eggins and Slade (1997) propose a third 
obligatory element: 
• Substantiatng behavior – An elabora-
tion ofthe deviant behavior that can ei-
ther bused asa motivatio foe ega-
tive evaluation, r as a wayto introduce 
gossip in the conversation. Eder ad
Enke (1991) use a different model, but 
the subtantiating behavior component
corresponds roughly to their optional 
Explanation act.  
There seems to be a consensus that gossip 
conversations have third person focus.The 
question is whether a gossip conversation nec-
essarily has both substantiating behavior 
component as wel as pejorativ eluation , and if they do, can they be identi-
fied? In the experiments presented later in this 
paper, we hope to shed ligt on whetr tes 
components are necessary or not. 
3 Method

During th fal 209, we condute two ex-
periments aboutgossip conversations. The aim 
of the experiments was to verify to what extent 
the definition ofgsip accords ithintuitive 
recognition of gossip episodes, and secondly 
whehr pel culd reliaby identify constiu-
ent elements.
The data was collected using online ques-
tionaires
1
 that ere distributed through differ-
ent email-lists mainly targetingresearchersan 
students ithin game design, language technol-
ogy, and related fields, ocated primarily in 
North America nd Europe. Th questionares 
had the followingstructure: e first page con-
sisted of an introduction, incldig istrcis, 
and each page thereafter had a dialogue excerpt 
retrieved from a screenplay followed by the 
question and/or task.  
3.1 Hypotheses
 
Based on t previous studies prsented arlie 
(in particular Bergmann, 1993; Eder and Enke,
1991; and Eggins and Slade, 1997) we had the 
following hypotheses: 
• The more gossip elements present in the 
text, the more likely the conversation 
wil becnsider gosip.
• Third person focus is a necessary (but 
not sufficient) element of gossip.  
• Conversations in which the particnts 
(including the target) are intimately re-
lated will be rated lower than those in 
which al prticants re motionaly 
separated.

I: Identifyig gossip text 
The aim of the first experiment wa to invei-
gate how people intuitively understand in-
terpret gosip conversations.   
4.1 Material
and procedure  
The questionnaire contained 16 different dia-
logue excerpts retrieved from transcriptsofthe 
famous sitcoms Desperate Housewives
2
 and 
Seinfeld
3
. The excerpts were selected to cover 
different combinations of the elements pre-
sented in the previous section (third person fo-
cus, an evaluon, ad a motivation for the 
evaluation), as in the following dialogue
4
: 
B: Tisha. Tisha. Oh, Ican tell by that look 
on yourface you’ve got something good.
Now, come n, do’t b slfish.  
T: Wel, first o yure not friends with

some contextual information, such as the inter-
personal relationship between the speakers and 
other people mentioned in the dialogue, e.g.:

Van de Kamp, is having luch at te club.

Despite h aprently ow agrement, he 
results correspond fairly well ith our expecta-
tions. Te 3 excerpts ith a mean value below 
0.5 had no gossip elements at alland the other 
two excerpts with a edianvalue of 0 had only 
one gossip element. Similarly, the wo excerpts 
rated highest clearly had all gossip elements. 
The rest of the excerpts, however, either lacked 
one element or one elementhat as un-
clear in some regard (see discussion, below). 
Conversations between family members or 
partners also caused higher disagreements, 
which sem to suprt Bergman’s (193) re-
mark:“[…]wecan skwheth wehouldcal 
gossip the conversations between spouses […]
alone. This surely is a borderline case for which 
there is no single anser” (p. 68).  
4.3 Discusin
 
Among the ni excrpts with amen value 
approximately between 1 and 2 (ID #1, 3, 4, 9, 
10, 12, 13, 14, and 16), we made the following 
observations: 3 excerpts lacked one element; n 
2 of them, the gossipers ere family members 
or partners; 3 s had an ambiguous focus, 
among which one also possibly was perceived 
as a warning.  
By “ambiguous focus” we mean tha its un-
clear hether the person in focus is the speaker, 
the addressee or the absent third person. I
stead, the absent third person seems to play a 
sub-ordinate role rather than focused role, for 
instance as part of a self-disclosure or a con-
frontation.If the conversation is the least bit 
confrontational, the addressee tends to go into 
defense raher tn chg a more typica
gossip response, such as support, expansion, or 
challenge (Eder ad Enke, 1991) in order to 
protect the face. Hence, no “gossip fuel” is 
added to the conversation.  
The result of the remaining excerpt
7
 is how-
ever more difficult to explain. One posible 
explanation is that the initiator was unac-
quainted with he target, but perhaps more 
likely isthat some f the subjects interpreted 
the conversation as mcking rather than gosip: 
E: Who’s that? 
D: ThaSam, the new girl in accounting. 
W: at’s with her arms? They just hang 
like slamis. 
D: She alks ike orangutn. 
E: Beter cl the zo.

5 Experiment
I: dentifyig gossip 
lts i a text 
The aim of the second experiment was to inves-
tigate whether the subjects could accept and 
apply a given definition by identifying the ree 
obligatory elements of gossip according to 
Eggins and Slade (1997) (see sectio 2); third 
person focus, pejorative evaluaton, and sub-
stantiatng behavior. In addition to he ele-
ments, we provided the more general definition 
presented in section 1 (“evaluativetalk about 
an absent third person”). 
The results from the first experiment indi-
cated that conversations that seemingly had all 
the elements but in which the prso i fcus 
was ambigos,recivdalowe gip rating
thane havin annambigusthirderso 
focus. So an additional goal was to investigate 
whetrcang herlatioship bewen the 
participants would affect the gossip rating.

which 8also cured inthe first experiment. 
Two of the recurring excerpts were used both 
in their riginal versios asell a in modife 
versions, in which e had removed the emo-
tional conections between the participants. 
The purpose of this as to find out whether 
changing the interpersonal relationship would 
change the gossip rating.  
5.2 Procedure

The subjects were instructed to read the ex-
cerpts and then identify the gossip elements 
according to the following description: 
• The person being talked about (third per-
son focus) – the “arg”, e.g. “Maisy 
Gibons was arrested”  
• Pejorative evaluation. A judgment of the 
target him-/herself or of the target’s be-
havior. This evaluation is n most cases 
negative, e.g. “She’a slut”, “He’s 
werd”

• The deviant behavior that motivates the 
gossip and provides evidence for 
judgment (also called the substantiatng 
behavior stage), e.g. “Maisy Gibbons 
was arestd” 
For ech lment they found, they were 
asked to specify the corresponding line refer-
ence as given in text. They were also in-
structed to say whether they considered the 
conversation to be gossip or not gossip. If their 
rating disagreed ith he definition, i.e. if they 
had found all the elements but stl rated he 
conversation as not gossip, or if one or more 
elements were lacking but the conversation was 
considered gossip anyway, they were asked to 
specify why.  
5.3 Result

We analyzed the results from the 19 subjects 
whocmpletd ratings for al21excerpts. This 
gave a totalof 399 yes/no judgments on 4 at-
tributes. Inter-coder reliability

marked either 4 or 5 excpts anot having 
third ersfs, with the remainingsjects 
notdeviating by much (marking 3, 6, and 7 
excerpts). Moreover, the subjects agree on 
which exrpts have tird person focus: only 
one excerpt getsa subtantial mber fcon-
flictng ratings (see the analysis given below in
secton 5.4), while remaining 20 excerpts 
get consistent ratings from all subjects with 
only occasionaldeviation by one or to of he 
deviant subjects. This accounts for the high 
observed agreement thifeature (94.9%). 
Expected is gh because the corpus 
is not balanced (16 of21 excerpts display third 
person focus), buteven so, chance-corrected 
agreement is high (85.1%), showing that ird 
focus is an attribute that participants can 
readily and reliably identify.
The remaining attries, including gossip, 
are less clear. Agreement on all of themis 
clearly above chance, but is not particularly 
high, showing that these notions are either not 
fully defined, or he excerpts ambigu-
ous. Gossip itself is dentified somewhat more 
reliably than either substantiating behavior or 
pejorative evaluation; this casts doubt about the 
ability to use the latter two as defining features

To test the relationship between the various

is analmost necessary conitio for classifying 
a screenplay conversation as gossip, though it 
is byn means uficient. Tables 4–6 show the 
co-occurrences of individual features to gossip; 
the association s strongestbetween gossip and

5.4 Discusion

We wanted tfid ut whethr te subjects 
woulacp,unersand baloaplya
given definition. The results from the experi-
ment show t sjc ad th 
gidefinition to some extent and managed to 
apply it. When the subjects disagreed they were 
asked to say hy. One of the subjects, for ex-
ample, explicitly disagreed with the definition 
given in the introduction and provided a 
counter definition: “Gossip is idle talk or ru-
mor, especialy bout the personal orprivate 
affairs of others”. Yet another subject was un-
certain about which definition to use: “Depends 
what yu mean by gsip. Itcan eithr mean 
malicous,behind theback lof othepeople
or dle chat.  If you mean ‘idle chat’ with gos-
sip then this ialso gossip”. A possible expla-
nation could be that the subjects refer to differ-
ent forms of gossip (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978) 
and therefore apply different definitions (such 
as the lexical definition presented earlier) than 
the one that was given in the experiment.  
198
Several subjects stated that they judged the 
conversation as gossip even if they did not 
identify an pejorative evaluation, and they 
also questioned whether the evaluation had to 
be negative or even present atall, or as one of 
the subjects put it: “Althoughthere is no pejo-
rative evaluation (at least not clearly) I believe 
this gosip”. These sbjects thus explicitly 
rejectEggins and Slade’s (1997) requirement
that the evaluation has to be pejorative.  
The examples above show that people have 
variable intuitions of gossip and consequently 
the concept f gsip issomewhat vague. Even 
so, the experiment al swed tat peopl t a
large degree are in agreement en the exam-
ples according to the given definition clearly 
are gossip or not gossip. Meaning that even 
though te dfinto des not capture al types 
of (potential) gossip conversations, i capture
thse episodes that mst eole agree to be 
gossip, which for our purpose is sufficient. 
5.5 Effect
ofinterpersonal relations 
In some particular cases, the subjects did not 
choose gossip even if all elements had been 
found. The results from the first experiment 
indicatedthat is deviation either was related
to the interpersonal relatioship betweenthe 
gossip participants or that the focus as am-
biguous. In rder to test whether changing the 
inter-personal relationship beteen the partici-
pants would change the gossirating, we com-
pared the results from conversatons had 
modified wih heir original counterpats. In 
one of the originalexcerpts, the addressee as 
romantically involved with the man that the 
speaker was talking about. The speaker formu-
lated the negative assesent and eviant be-
havior in a ay that for most people would be 
interpreted asa arning, which probably ex-
plains why only 7 of the 19 subjects rad th 
original conversation as gossip. The modified 
version the other hand, as rated as gossip 
by all subjects.   
In the second dialogue, the speaker questions 
the addressee’s choice f person todate, and 
does this by both evaluating the person ega-
tively aswell as providing evidence fr the 
evaluation. It turns out, however, that the ad-
dressee thinks she is going out for a date with 
someone else, so a large partof the conversa-
tion deals with trying toidentify the target. 15 
of 19 subjects rated the originalconversation as 
gossip, hile all subjects rated it as gossip in 
the modified version. These comparisons indi-
cate that the status of the relationship between 
the gosipers and the gosip target affects 
whethr teialoguei cnsidered gossip or 
not. In he original version of both these exam-
ples, tfocus was ambiguous, i.e. he focus 
was amuch onte adres as on the absnt 
third pers.
We ve swn th tir prso fcus ia 
key elementof gossip. Tecorrelation was fr-
thermore confirmed bythe subjects themselves 
in eir ments, where the lack of third per-
son often as listed as a reason for not choos-
ing osip. In one example, the respondent re-
garded the conversation as gossip even if t 
really was an insult directed towards the ad-
dressee, but explained it as its “…almost like 
he’s forgotten he’s talking o he person he’s 
giving this opinion/gossip about”. 
The ghest disagreement concerning third 
person focus was found in the followiex-
cerpt
15
: 
Karen Okay, what is it? 
Grtch: Regin sys everon hates you 
because you’re such a slut. 
Karen: Se said tht? 
Grtch You dn’t hear it from me. 
The dialogue contains an ambiguous focus in 
that it both includes a quote as well as a con-
frontationalinsult. Bysingthe irdperson 
reference, Gretchen avoids taking responsibility 
for the it. In some sense both Karen and 
Regina arefocus, where Karn is the target 
of the pejorative evaluation and Regina can be 
interpreted asbeing the focus fthe substantit-
g behavior component. HowRegina’s role is 
interpreted isdetermined by the respondents’ 
personalattiude towards gossiping in general 
(i.e. whether they interpret Gretchen’s utterance 
as containing an implicit evaluation of Regina’s 
behavior not), and how they perceive the 
interpersonal relationshipbetween Karen and 
Gretch. Gosip a ierntcotraicton
in that it bth hasa fuctio fegtiating the 
accepted way to behave while it at the sam
time often isconsidered aninappropriate activ-
ity that canhave eriousnegative consequences 
forboth the gossipers as well as the gossip tar-
get (see e.g. Gilmore, 1978;Bergmann, 1993; 
Eggins and Slade, 1997; Hallett al., 2009).

6 Final
remarks and future work 
The aim of these sui has been to get a 
workable definition of gossip that people can 
agree upon and that is sufficiently precise to 
provide a basis for computational implementa-
tion.  
Wecondute two experiments to investi-
gate people’s intuiive notion of gossip and the 
results show that (1) conversations in which all 
elements are present, where no intimate rela-
tionship exist between the participants, d in
whicteprson ifocusi nambiguos,are
very lkely to be considered gossip. (2) Conver-
sations hat have at most one p element 
are not considered gossip. (3) Inconsistencies 
mainly found in conversations that lack one 
or two elements or have at least one element 
that is ambiguos, r are takingplace between
gossipers that have an intimate relationship.  
We have suggested that third person focus is 
a necessary, but not suficent, elment of gos-
sip, but the other elements are ess clear even if 
their co-occurrence in a conversation clearly 
affects the gossip score.  In the second experi-
ment this might be du to the instructions, but it
does not explain he unbiased results from he 
first experiment. So on the one hand we can 
clearly see that all three elements are important 
for the understanding of gossip, but on the 
other hand, the subjects’ had trouble in denti-
fying them. This suggests hat we need to fur-
ther investigate these elementstosee how they 
can be specified more clearly.  
We hae tkn afirst eptoward acmputa-
tional accout ogip, by emirically verify-
ing the extento which the given efiniton can 
be applied and the components recognized by 
people. Some of our next steps to further this 
program include authoring content for believ-
able characters that follow this definition, as 
wel astempting toautmaticaly rcogniz 
these elements. 
Among thpsible plitons f sip 
we can think of gm chre ad vrtual
humans tha ar cal of engaging i gossip 
conversations to share ination ancreate 
social bonds with a human user orts avar. 
This involves being able to both ge gos-
sip on basis of the interpersonal relationship 
and selecting content that could be regarded as 
gossip, as well as to automatically detect gossip 
occurring in a conversaton. T latruse 
could also be used for characters that actively 
want o avoid taking part in gossip conversa-
tios.
