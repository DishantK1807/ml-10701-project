For this task, we extended our previous work at Senseval-3 (Bejan et al., 2004) by (1) experimenting with additional features, (2) adding new classi cation sub-tasks to accomplish all the requirements, and (3) integrating these sub-tasks into a pipeline architecture.

The Berkeley FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998) is an ongoing effort of building a semantic lexicon for English based on the theory of frame semantics.
P98-1013
The best feature set in this phase includes the features proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and the FRAME feature.

Element Identification The idea of splitting the automatic semantic role labeling task into FE boundary detection and FE label classi cation was rst proposed in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and then adopted by other works in this task.

Most of these features are from the set proposed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
J02-3001
These represent a subset of features used in previous works (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Florian et al., 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Xue and Palmer, 2004; Bejan et al., 2004; Pradhan et al., 2005) for automatic semantic role labeling and word sense disambiguation.

The sub-tasks TWFD and GFLC are natural extensions of the approach described in (Bejan et al., 2004) for the task of semantic role labeling at Senseval-03.
