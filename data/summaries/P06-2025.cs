Several phoneme-based techniques have been proposed in the recent past for machine transliteration using transformation-based learning algorithm (Meng et al., 2001; Jung et al., 2000; Vigra and Khudanpur, 2003).

(Knight and Graehl, 1998) developed a phoneme-based statistical model using finite state transducer that implements transformation rules to do back-transliteration.

The phonetics-based and spelling-based models have been linearly combined into a single transliteration model in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) for transliteration of Arabic named entities into English.

A spelling-based model is described in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002c) that directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences with associated probability that are trained on a small English/Arabic name list without the need for English pronunciations.
P02-1051 W02-0505
(Stalls and Knight, 1998) adapted this approach for back transliteration from Arabic to English for English names.
