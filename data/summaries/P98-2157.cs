ural language would improve performance of such language models, some researchers tried to use stochastic context-free grammars (CFGs) to produce language models (Wright and Wrigley, 1989; Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991; Stolcke, 1995).

This algorithm enables existing corpus-based estimation techniques (Schabes, 1992) in stochastic TAGs to be used for language modelling.

In specifying the equations, we exploit techniques used in the parsing of incomplete input (Lang, 1988).
C88-1075
Solutions can then be approximated to any degree of precision using standard iterative methods, as for instance those exploited in (Stolcke, 1995).

(Joshi, 1988) and (Joshi and Schabes, 1992) are good introductions to the formalism and its linguistic relevance.
