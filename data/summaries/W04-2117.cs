There are several other approaches such as Ji and Ploux (2003) and the already mentioned Rapp (2002).

Language Resources for a Network-based Dictionary Veit Reuer Institute of Cognitive Science University of Osnabr¨uck Germany vreuer@uos.de Abstract In order to facilitate the use of a dictionary for language production and language learning we propose the construction of a new network-based electronic dictionary along the lines of Zock (2002).

Even though there are some studies that compare the results from statistically computed association measures with word association norms from psycholinguistic experiments (Landauer et al., 1998; Rapp, 2002) there has not been any research on the usage of a digital, network-based dictionary reflecting the organisation of the mental lexicon to our knowledge.

On the one hand a typed relation provides additional information for a user about two connected nodes but on the other hand it seems questionable if a known relation would really help to actually infer the meaning of a connected node (contrary to Zock (2002)).

Contrary to Zock (2002) who suggests this as an analysis step on its own we think that the phonological and morphological similarity can be exploited to form yet another layer in a network-based dictionary.

Resources Zock (2002) proposes the use of only one type of information structure in his network, namely a type of semantic information.

A related approach to spelling correction is the use of so called “tries” for the efficient storage of lexical data (Oflazer, 1996).
