The modified chart method instead allows for the construction of incremental constituents in a manner that most closely relates to tim notion of dependency constituency argued for by Barry & Pickering (1990) (see also Hepple, 1991), although since the modified parser is still a complete parser for L it cannot be viewed as implementing a notion of dependency constituency.

The rules below provide a natural deduction formulation of L (Morrill et al.1990; Barry et al.1991), where dots above a type represent a proof of that type.

Firstly, it excludes the use of the NF systems devised for the calculus (KSnig, 1989; Hepple, 1990a).
