A more radical approacl h however rooted in the traditional model is to fully map the typed unification grammars \[Emele and Zajac, 1990 on the SNAP.

Recent studies on the Classification-Based Parsing \[Kasper, 1989\] and the Systemic Choice Network \[Carpenter and Pollard~ 1991\] assume hierarchical networks to represent varions linguistic constraints, and the search on these networks can be done by marker-passing.

Also, there are many other NLP models (Typed Unification Grammar \[Emele and Zajae, 1990\], SNePS \[Neal and Shapiro, 1987\], and others) which may exhibit high performance and desirable scaling property on SNAP.

The typed unification grammar is based on the Typed Feature Structure (TFS) \[Zajac, 1989\] and HPSG \[Pollard and Sag, 1987\], and represents all objects in TFS.
