Past work demonstrates that PMI is a good estimator of semantic similarity (Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003) and that features based on PMI can be useful for supervised learning (Turney, 2003).

We estimated these probabilities using the Waterloo MultiText System with a corpus of about one terabyte of unlabeled text, collected by a web crawler (Clarke et al., 1995; Clarke and Cormack, 2000; Terra and Clarke, 2003).

The semantic similarity between two words is estimated by their Pointwise Mutual Information, a0a1a2a3 a4a5a6a4a7a8, using Information Retrieval (Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003): a0a1a2a3 a4a5a6a4a7a8 a9 a10a11a12a7 a13a14 a3 a4a5 a15 a4a7a8 a14 a3 a4a5a8 a14 a3 a4a7a8a16 a17 We estimate the probabilities in this equation by issuing queries to the Waterloo MultiText System (Clarke et al., 1995; Clarke and Cormack, 2000; Terra and Clarke, 2003).
