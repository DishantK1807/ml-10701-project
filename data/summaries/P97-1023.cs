We have previously shown (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1995) that in oppositions of gradable adjectives where one member is semantically unmarked, the unmarked member is the most frequent one about 81% of the time.

Given that semantically similar words can be identified automatically on the basis of distributional properties and linguistic cues (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993), identifying the semantic orientation of words would allow a system to further refine the retrieved semantic similarity relationships, extracting antonyms.

Collection For our experiments, we use the 21 million word 1987 Wall Street Journal corpus 4, automatically annotated with part-of-speech tags using the PARTS tagger (Church, 1988).

â€¢ Further analysis of different-orientation pairs in conjunctions other than but shows that conjoined antonyms are far more frequent than expected by chance, in agreement with (Justeson and Katz, 1991).

In linguistic constructs such as conjunctions, which impose constraints on the semantic orientation of their arguments (Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), the choices of arguments and connective are mutually constrained, as illustrated by: The tax proposal was simple and well-received } simplistic but well-received *simplistic and well-received by the public.
