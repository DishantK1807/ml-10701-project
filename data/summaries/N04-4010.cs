There has been a considerable amount of work on English NER yielding good performance (Tjong Kim Sang et al.2002, 2003; Cucerzan & Yarowsky 1999; Wu et al.2003). However, Chinese NER is more difficult, especially on speech output, due to two reasons.

maximum-entropy NER model with postclassification To establish a baseline spoken Chinese NER model, we selected a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach since this is currently the single most accurate approach known for recognizing named entities in text (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2002, 2003, Jing et al., 2003) 1. In the CoNLL 2003 NER evaluation, 5 out of 16 systems use MaxEnt models and the top 3 results for English and top 2 results for German were obtained by systems that use MaxEnt.

To compare our system to the IBM baseline described in (Jing et al.2003), we need to evaluate our system on the same corpus as they used.

Previous work on Chinese textual NER includes Jing et al.(2003) and Sun et al.(2003) but there has been no published work on NER in spoken Chinese.
