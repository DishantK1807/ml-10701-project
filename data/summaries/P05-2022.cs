The HLT corpus was used in the evaluation of word alignment systems described in (Mihalcea & Pederson, 2003).

Moreover, as stressed in previous research, using syntactic dependencies seems to be particularly well suited to coping with the problem of linguistic variation across languages (Hwa et al., 2002).
P02-1050
Mainly dedicated to machine translation, purely statistical systems have gradually been enriched with syntactic knowledge (Wu, 2000; Yamada & Knight, 2001; Ding et al., 2003; Lin & Cherry, 2003).
P01-1067 W03-0302
To derive a set of words that are likely to be useful for initiating the propagation process, we implemented a widely used method of co-occurrence counts described notably in (Gale & Church, 1991; Ahrenberg et al., 2000).
H91-1026
There are basically two kinds of systems working at these segmentation levels: the most widespread rely on statistical models, in particular the IBM ones (Brown et al., 1993); others combine simpler association measures with different kinds of linguistic information (Arhenberg et al., 2000; Barbu, 2004).

5 Precision, recall and f-measure reported by Och and Ney (2003) for the intersection of IBM-4 Viterbi alignments from both translation directions.

In approaches such as Lin and Cherryâ€™s (2003), linguistic knowledge is considered secondary to statistical information even if it improves the alignment quality.

They have been obtained using reference data from an evaluation of word alignment systems (Mihalcea & Pederson, 2003).
W03-0301
It makes the most of dependency relations to produce highly accurate alignments when the same propagation pattern is used in both languages, i.e. when the syntactic structures are identical, as well as in cases of noun/adjective transpositions, even if the category of the words to be aligned varies (Ozdowska, 2004).
W04-2207
If variation across languages is subject to such regularities, as assumed in (Dorr, 1994; Fox, 2002; Ozdowska & Bourigault, 2004), the syntax-based propagation could then be extended to cases of non-correspondence in order to improve recall.
