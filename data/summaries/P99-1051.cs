We preferred the log-likelihood ratio to other statistical scores, such as the association ratio (Church and Hanks, 1990) or ;(2, since it adequately takes into account the frequency of the co-occurring words and is less sensitive to rare events and corpussize (Dunning, 1993; Daille, 1996).

The relative productivity of an alternation for a se20 mantic class can be estimated by calculating the ratio of acquired to possible verbs undergoing the alternation (Aronoff, 1976; Briscoe and Copestake, Z l0 1996): (5) P(acquired\[class) = f (acquired, class) f (class) o We express the productivity of an alternation for o =.

Levin's study on diathesis alternations has influenced recent work on word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996), machine translation (Dang et al., 1998), and automatic lexical acquisition (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Schulte im Walde, 1998).

We used a variant of the method described in Hindle and Rooth (1993), the main difference being that we applied their lexical association score (a log-likelihood ratio which compares the probability of noun versus verb attachment) in an unsupervised non-iterative manner.

We inferred the bracketing by modifying an algorithm initially proposed by Pustejovsky et al.(1993). Given three nouns n 1, n2, n3, if either \[n I n2\] or \[n2 n3\] are in the compound noun dictionary, we built structures \[\[nt n2\] n3\] or \[r/l \[n2 n3\]\] accordingly; if both \[n I n2\] and In2 n3\] appear in the dictionary, we chose the most frequent pair; if neither \[n l n2\] nor \[n2 n3\] appear in WordNet, we computed the G-score for \[nl n2\] and \[n2 n3\] and chose the pair with highest value (p < 0.05).

The threshold values varied from frame to flame but not from verb to verb and were determined by taking into account for each frame its overall frame frequency which was estimated from the COMLEX subcategorization dictionary (6,000 verbs) (Grishman et al., 1994).

We also experimented with a method suggested by Brent (1993) which applies the binomial test on frame frequency data.

Hindle and Rooth (1993) used a partial parser to extract (v, n, p) tuples from a corpus, where p is the preposition whose attachment is ambiguous between the verb v and the noun n.

Several approaches have statistically addressed the problem of prepositional phrase ambiguity, with comparable results (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1998).
