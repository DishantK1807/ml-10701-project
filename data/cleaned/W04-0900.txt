2:77	It aims to: AF re-establish the research community of knowledge-based interpretation of text meaning; AF explicate the implicit treatments of meaning in current knowledge-lean approaches and how they and knowledge-rich methods can work together; and AF emphasize the construction of systems that extract, represent, manipulate, and interpret the meaning of text (rather than theoretical and formal methods in semantics).
3:77	Most, if not all, high-end NLP applicationssuch as machine translation, question answering and text summarizationstand to benefit from being able to use text meaning in their processing.
4:77	But the bulk of work in the field in recent years has not pertained to treatment of meaning.
5:77	The main reason given is the complexity of the task of comprehensive meaning analysis and interpretation.
6:77	Computational linguistics has always been interested in meaning, of course.
7:77	The tradition of formal semantics, logics, and common-sense reasoning system has been continuously maintained for many years.
8:77	But also, much work has been devoted to building practical, increasingly broad-coverage meaning-oriented analysis and synthesis systems.
9:77	Lexical semantics has made significant progress in theories, description, and processing.
10:77	Formal aspects of ontology work have also been studied.
11:77	The Semantic Web has further popularized the need for automatic extraction, representation, and manipulation of text meaning: for the Semantic Web to really succeed, capability of automatically marking text for content is essential, and this cannot be attained reliably using only knowledge-lean, semantics-poor methods.
12:77	While there has recently been a flurry of specialized meetings devoted to formal semantics, lexical semantics, semantic web, formal ontology and others, the number of meetings devoted to knowledge-based text meaning processingcontent rather than formalismhas been much smaller.
13:77	The first Workshop on Text Meaning began to remedy this, and ten papers were presented on implemented systems and on related topics.
14:77	1 The call for papers of the present workshop suggested, without limitation, the following topics to potential contributors to the workshop: AF Implemented systems that extract, represent, or manipulate text meaning.
15:77	AF Broad-coverage semantic analysis and interpretation.
16:77	AF Knowledge-based text synthesis.
17:77	AF The nature of text meaning required for various practical broad-coverage applications.
18:77	AF Manual annotation of text meaning, including interlingual annotations.
19:77	AF Pragmatics and discourse issues as parts of meaning extraction and manipulation.
20:77	AF Ontologies supporting automatic processing of text meaning.
21:77	AF Semantic lexicons.
22:77	AF Microtheories to support text meaning extraction and manipulation: aspect, modality, reference, etc. AF Text meaning representations in semantic analysis.
23:77	1 The proceedings of this workshop are available at http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/W/W03/#W03-0900.
24:77	AF Reasoning to support semantic analysis and synthesis.
25:77	AF Multilingual aspects of meaning representation and manipulation.
26:77	AF Integrating semantic analysis and non-semantic language processing.
27:77	AF Semantic analysis and synthesis systems based on knowledge-lean stochastic corpus-oriented methods.
28:77	The call for papers encouraged discussion of theoretical issues that are relevant to computational applications, including descriptions of processors and static knowledge resources.
29:77	It specifically preferred discussions of content and meaning over discussions of formalisms for encoding meaning, and discussions of decision heuristics in processing over discussions of generic processing architectures and theorem-proving mechanisms.
30:77	Twenty-seven papers were submitted to the workshop, of which fifteen were selected for presentation and are included in these proceedings.
31:77	In addition, two panel sessions were organizedsee descriptions below in this volume.

44:77	What, indeed, is success for an annotation effort?
45:77	What desiderata should annotation efforts conform to in order to maximize chances of success?
46:77	When compromises on the desiderata are required for practical reasons, which desiderata are first to go?
47:77	What is the resulting impact on the effort?
48:77	We propose the following desiderata:  perform annotations that are useful for a wide number of tasks (possibly ones not even foreseen today);  focus on annotations not easily done automatically without having the corpus available as training data;  only annotate when high inter-annotator agreement is possible;  focus on annotation that is fast and cheap (relatively), that doesnt require lots of annotator training, and that doesnt require years to carry out;  ensure that the annotations are theoretically well-founded and acceptable to a large number of people in various projects;  build on previous efforts, and use automated tools to speed up annotation if possible;  pay particular attention to annotation interface design, since this can significantly impact performance.
49:77	In order to meet these desiderata, many annotation efforts have made decisions that may be seen as compromises.
50:77	For example, by using the Penn Treebank texts, one can count on a commonly-understood parse tree syntax.
51:77	However, the Treebank is not a balanced corpus, and hence may negatively influence the results annotations that reflect phenomena not present in that corpus.
52:77	On the panel, members of three semantic annotation projects will describe their work and provide insights as to where they had to make compromises in the light of the desiderata and why they did so:  SALSA (Manfred Pinkal)  PropBank (Martha Palmer)  IL-Annotation (David Farwell and Eduard Hovy) Can we move from sentence meaning to text meaning?
53:77	Convener:Sergei Nirenburg, University of Maryland, Baltimore County Panelists:TBA Text meaning as a whole has not yet attracted widespread attention.
54:77	Recent studies usually concentrate on text-meaning components  propositional meaning within a single sentence or even clause, relations among clauses, or co-reference issues.
55:77	Earlier holistic work on x text-level grammars or plot units did not reach the stage where the main ideas were ripe for judgments of explanatory power or utility.
56:77	One can indeed view text meaning as a combination of the meaning of its clauses plus causal, temporal, rhetorical, and other relevant relations among the clause meanings, plus speaker attitudes expressed in the input text.
57:77	At this level, a central issue is cross-fertilization of heuristic material  how one can use findings in one component of the overall text meaning as heuristics for establishing elements of another component?
58:77	For example, the propositional meaning of a clause can contribute to establishing a coreferential relation between the meaning of a noun phrase within it and a noun phrase in another clause.
59:77	Extracting and manipulating the meaning of an entire text holds the promise of improving the quality of results in information extraction, automatic population of knowledge bases, text summarization, modeling question answering and other intelligent agent systems that communicate with people, and other applications.
60:77	The needs of specific applications effectively define the scope and depth of text meaning in specific projects.
61:77	The spectrum of choices here is very broad  from approximating text meaning through textual collocation (the knowledge-lean end of the spectrum) to including in text meaning the results of reasoning  for example, judgments about speaker goals and beliefs (the knowledge-rich end).
62:77	The choice is made by balancing two conflicting desiderata  real utility and feasibility.
63:77	In this discussion, we will analyze the available choices and assess the practicality and the promise of integrating work on different components of text meaning.
