CONTENT GUIDED ANSWER SEARCH SYSTEM FOR NATURAL LANGUAGES Peter KUmmel Institut fur Informatik Stuttgart University, FRG SUMMARY: Portions of natural language content must be directly related to memory functions in computers.
A system should be selected which does not only fit theoretically but also can be practically 6 applied, due to its "natural" character.
It represents a difficult task to cut away a usable model thesaurus from the huge meaning treasure of natural langus age.
Air Traffic Control Language, restricted to Ground Control, serves this purpose.
Due to severe realtime requirement~ a limitation to conventional comII/12113 puters has been avoideo.
Exclusively 3110 content analoguous memory structures guarantee an automatic answer search, which obeys the realtime obligations of 4-6 syllables/s speech veloscity and 0.5-1.5 s response interval.
GLOSSARY: Agglutination, agglutinated morphology= agglutinated expression structures of language = expression mixed with syn tax particles, answer actualization, answer pool (AP), answer search logic (ASL), content unit = meaning, deuter = SVA which is defined after six sub-criteria, deuter-matcher, deuter-criterion : one of the six sub-criteria of one deuter, deuter string synthesizer DSS, feature extraction, flexion, contentunit = meaning = deuter plus syntagms, isolated morphology = language expression existing mainly of deuter sequences.
key feature of content KFC, KFC-matcher, lemma/ta = word stem, morphology = expression structure of language, progressive agglutination, suffix = preor postponed syllable to word stems, SVA = substantive, verb, or adjective, if possible in lemma shape, syntagm = consisting of syntax particles and syntax rules, syntax particle, syntax rule, twin KFC = a double KFC implemented into a ROM to match potential "input-KFCs" CR Categories: 3.65, 3.71, 3.74, 3.75, 3.81, 5.32, 5.6, 7.3. 1 INTRODUCTION: To substitute one partner n natural language dialogs by a computer, a model dialog should be chosen, which uses besides user utterances also system alerts for input.
These alerts are triggered by the user's action.
The introduced "Standard 80" thesaurus meets these demands.
It concerns ground and ramp control activities in ATCL dialogs between pilots and air controllers.
In those Air ~raffic ~ontrol Language dialogs taxy procedures by the user, in this case the pilot, are in addition monitored by sensors at the apron.
Thus, besides "primary inputs" by pilot utterances also "secondary inputs" by the system help the content guided answer search mechanism.
The ATCL at international airports has been reduced to one --559-particular language English already in the fifties.
In a minimum of time elapse a maximum of information flux between the dialog partners is needed.This postulate causes all grammatical components with a low level efficiency rate to be abolished naturally.
Considering most recent structural evaluations, formalization results of natural 6 language led to the determination of : "key features of content; KFCs~I~y~ ~ a matching procedure of input KFCs with twin KFCs stored in a ROM, prepared answers can be triggered.
But, a match instruction can be also used to trigger a sequence of deuter, which are implemented in a time-analoguous read-only array.The trigger procedure of deuter sequences is faster than that of prepared answers.
Especially if more voluminous thesauri are used But, up to the present, an actualizing of deuter sequences is still missing proper morphological agglutinations.
Automatically triggered deuter sequences appear in isolated morphologies.
For this purpose an "algorithm of proG gressive agglutination" is under consideration, by which syntax particles and additional syntax rules can be mingled into deuter sequences.
For the ATCL however deuter sequences without too many syntagms are quite sufficient.

COMPONENTS AND THEIR TERMINOLOGY 3.1 Content Units (meanings) A natural language L n expression thesaurus can be split into a) a group of substantiva verba, and adjectiva 6,, the SVAs and b) a group of syntagms (Fig.
i). If the SVAs, possibly in lemma shape, are FIG, i ANALYSIS OF " MEANINGS " SVA DEUTER MEANINGS ~.~ S SYNTAGMS y ' SYNTAX SYNTAX PARTICLES |RULES defined after their sub-criteria, the deuter_criteria6,1~hey.
4 are called "deuter" 3.2 The Six Deuter-Criteria: 6 1) Identity: given by DC-enumeration.
2) Age: absolute and relative, also in comparison to dialog cycles.
3) Association: A v and A h, vertical and horizontal, A v is to compare with edges in a directed graph.
4) Frequency: absolute and relative, is in smaller thesauri related to the significance value.
5) Significance: has influence on syntax rules and their deuter, e.g.
No. 9, (2.3) very high value.
6) Truth: also existent in smaller dialogs.
If untrue utterances by the pilot are given as e.g."mercedes benz" after the tower inquiry: "type of aircraft"? or, "profane" utterances like: idiot, nonsense, etc.
They are not permitted and thus "untrue" 3.3 Syntagms 3.3.1 Definition: Syntax Particle Excluding SVA-Lemmata, all suffixes, flexions, and remaining words of an L n thesaurus are considered Syntax Particles.
3.3.2 Definition: Syntax Rule They include rules of word sequences:S/P, S/O/P etc.
and can be directly related to rules of dialog functions.

(4.1f), e) standby instruct.
(4.2a), f) correction to (4.2b), g) correction to (4.2c), and h) correction to (4.2d).
4.4 Determining
the KFCs: Depending from the deuter-criterion:agevalue, the dialog cycles 1-6 from old to new are brought into relation to the sum of all potential partial dialogs, in this case 8.
Among all cycles of the same age, frequency values and redundancies of single deuter are checked.
Only a few deuter among all input data have the "switching ability" to select one of the 8 potential next cycles.
These account for less than 20% of all input data.
They are called "key features of content", KFCs.
5.ANSWER SEARCH LOGIC FOR PREPARED ANSWERS (ASL) 5.1 Match Procedures MPs of KFCs: According to 4.4, all potential KFCs are implemented as "twin-KFCs" in a twin-ROM.
The implementation array is time-analoguos.
As the input-KFCs appear also after the deuter-criterion age-value, a realtime MP will be quite simple.

They are triggered, if KFC match procedures MPs and system internal sensor inputs passed a sequential network AT.
According to the 8 partial dialogs PDs, 7 switching combinations are possible:i) MP of I input KFC (PD6), 2) MP of 2 input KFCs (PDs 1,2,7,8), 3) MP of one among 2 input KFCs (e.g.
in cycles 2-6), 4) interrupt (PD 1), 5) MP of I input-KFC + i of 3 systeminternal alerts No I, 6) like 5) No II, 7) like 5) No III.
5.3 Sequential
Network of AT According to 5.2, for each Partial Dialog 7 potential switching combinations are possible (Fig.
2). 5.4 Components of the ASL The main units consist of a) a ROM for twin-KFCs, b) a KFC-matcher as a comparator device to match input-KFCs with twinKFCs, and c) an AT (Fig, 3).
6 DEUTER
STRING SYNTHESIZER DSS 6.1 Function of a DSS According to functionand memory redundancies in ASLs, (Fig.
3), the units: I) KFC Twin ROM, 2) KFC Matcher 3) Answer Trigger, and 4) Answer Pool for Prepared Answers, are combined in a "DSS-Logic".
Not only twin-KFCs but all potential deuter in all dialogs are stored in the DSS-Logic.
This, in a way, substitutes the Answer Pool for prepared answers.
The read only memory implementation must be in geometric "time logic".
Thus an electrical activation of one matched twin-KFC triggeres a sequence of surrounding stored deuter.
This triggering is executed by a "switsch thru-", a "put through connection" procedure.
Each actualized deuter in such a "switch thru sequence" is simultaneously transformed into an audio output, a synchronous "read out" The "switch thru association" becomes "loud thinking".
This fits a logic answer to the input-KFCs.
Major functions of the DSS are: I) All twin-KFCs serve potential match procedures with input-KFCs.
2) After an input-KFC is matched, the matched twin-KFC is activated as "the first deuter" in a triggered deuter sequence.
3) The length of the sequence will be limited from 3 to I0 deuter.
4) Each connected deuter in a triggered deuter sequence is allocated with 2-3 seconds time, in which the adequate English utterance can be expressed by a speech synthesizer device.
5) The "switch thru connection" to neighbouring deuter in the deuter sequence continues only, after the English word of the last deuter is spoken out.
6.2 Architecture
of a DSS The array of DSS content is divided into dialog cycle sections.
For each of them five or more KFC-Match/Trigger Stations (Mattrigs) are provided.
Structure and organization of function units in all first dialog cycles of the eight model dialogs are shown in Fig.
4: If such sections for the remaining dialog cycles 2-6 of all potential dialogs are compiled in an analoguous way and put together, a further elimination of redundant portions will help to create a complex DSS architecture.

7 Conclusion: Function simulation of one partner in nat.
lango dialogs by a machine demands the following major procedures: I) KFC-matching of Input-KFCs with TwinKFCs implemented in a ROM, 2) Answer Trigger according to KFC match procedures in devices with prepared answers ASLs, and 3) Actualization of Deuter String Outputs in DSSs after KFC matchings.
More than expected, complex evaluations of nat.
lang. phenomena were necessary for memory array purposes.
Among them particularly the six deuter-criteria.
But also a sufficient familiarity with the applied thesaurus was necessary.
