Following Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) we distinguish the cases 134 where preference is part of the particular computation being performed (Wilks 1973, Fass and Wilks 1983, Pereira 1985) from the case where it is a separate process, run after the results of the computation have been obtained (Jensen et al 1983, Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983).
