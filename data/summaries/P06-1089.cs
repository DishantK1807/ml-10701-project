Chieu and Ng (2002) conducted named entity recognition using global features as well as local features.

We also conduct experiments using simulated annealing in decoding, as conducted by Finkel et al.(2005) for information extraction.

Local 3A major method for generating such pseudo unknown words is to collect the words that appear only once in a corpus (Nagata, 1999).

Finkel et al.(2005) proposed a method incorporating non-local structure for information extraction.

The features we use are shown in Table 2, which are based on the features used by Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Uchimoto et al.(2001). The parameters αh in Equation (20) are estimated using all the words in the training data whose POS tags are the open class tags.

These words are called hapax legomena and known to have similar characteristics to real unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996).

Global information is known to be useful in other NLP tasks, especially in the named entity recognition task, and several studies successfully used global features (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Finkel et al., 2005).

(2) Takamura et al.(2005) applied this model to an NLP task, semantic orientation extraction, and we apply it to POS guessing of unknown words here.
P05-1017
There have been many studies on POS guessing of unknown words (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Mikheev, 1997; Chen et al., 1997; Nagata, 1999; Orphanos and Christodoulakis, 1999).

Takamura et al.(2005) proposed a method based on the spin models in physics for extracting semantic orientations of words.

Finkel et al.(2005) used simulated annealing with Gibbs sampling to find a solution in a similar situation.
