In (Gardent, 1996; Gardent et al., 1996) we show that SOEs are advantageously viewed as involving a deaccented anaphor whose semantic representation must unify with that of its antecedent.

{l(j,x) l x e wife} In (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996), we show that HOU can successfully be used to compute the FSV of an utterance.

It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: (Dalrymple et al., 1991) henceforth, DSP show that it allows a treatment of VPEllipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; (Pulman, 1995; Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996) use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; (Gardent et al., 1996) shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, (Pinkal, 1995) uses linear HOU to reconstruct underspecified semantic representations.

In (Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996), we suggest that such cases are SOEs, and thus can be treated as involving a deaccented anaphor (in this case, the anaphor he always takes Sue to _'s mother).
