1. Introduction For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (Carbonell & Brown 1988; Carter 1987; Hobbs 1978; Ingria & Stallard 1989; Lappin & McCord 1990; Lappin & Leass 1994; Mitkov 1994; Rich & LuperFoy 1988; Sidner 1979; Webber 1979).

to similar approaches: comparative evaluation of Breck Baldwin's CogNIAC We felt appropriate to extend the evaluation of our approach by comparing it to Breck Baldwin's CogNIAC (Baldwin 1997) approach which features "high precision coreference with limited knowledge 873 and linguistics resources".

A Our first evaluation exercise (Mitkov & Stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in English (Minolta 1994).

Owing to lack of syntactic information, this preference is somewhat weaker than the collocation preference described in (Dagan & Itai 1990).

For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see Baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule I (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%).

This result is comparable with the results described in (Baldwin 1997).

The latter proposes the ranking "subject, direct object, indirect object" (Brennan et al.1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect objects.

Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or linguistic knowledge (Baldwin 1997; Dagan & Itai 1990; Kennedy & Boguraev 1996; Mitkov 1998; Nasukawa 1994; Williams et al.1996). Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaphora resolution.

In fact, our evaluation shows that the results are comparable to syntax-based methods (Lappin & Leass 1994).
