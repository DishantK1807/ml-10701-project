(Nießen and Ney, 2004) also extend the corpus by annotating each source word with morphological information and building a hierarchical lexicon.

While (Lee, 2004) builds part of speech models to recognize such elements, we use the fact that their corresponding English translations in the BAMA lexicon are empty.
N04-4015
Lexical relationships under the standard IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) do not account for many-to-many mappings, and phrase extraction relies heavily on the accuracy of the IBM word-toword alignment.
J93-2003
While (Lee et al., 2003) develop accurate segmentation models of Arabic surface word forms using manually segmented data, we rely instead on the translated context in the target language, leveraging the manually constructed lexical gloss from BAMA to select the appropriate segmented sense for each Arabic source word.
P03-1051
We optimized separately for both the NIST (Doddington, 2002) and the BLEU metrics (Papineni et al., 2002).
P02-1040
In contrast to (Popovic and Ney, 2004) and (Nießen and Ney, 2004), we do not modify the IBM models, and we leave reordering effects to the decoder.
