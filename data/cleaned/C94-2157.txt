ISSUES IN TEXT-TO-SPEECH FOR FRENCH Evelyne Tzoukermann AT&T Bell Laboratories 600 Mountain Avenue, Murray tlill, N.J. 07974 evelyne@rcsearch, art.corn Abstract This paper reports the progress of the French text-to-speech system being developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories as part of a larger project for multilingual text-to-speech systems, including languages such as Spanish, Italian, German, Russian, and Chinese.
These systems, based on diphone and triphone concatenation, follow the general framework of the Bell Laboratories English TTS system \[?\], \[?\].
This paper provides a description of the approach, the current status of the French text-to-speech project, and some problems particular to French.
1 Introduction
In this paper, the new French text-to-sIieech system being developed at AT&T is presented; several steps have been already achieved while others are still in progress.
First we present a brief' description of the phonetic inventory of French, with a discussion of the approach used to select and segment phonetic units for the system.
Methods for automatic segmentation, and for the choice of diphone and triphone units are presented.
Some comments on durational and prosodic issues follow.
We conclude with some discnssions on directions for fllture improw.'ment, including morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and partial phrasal analysis for the purpose of phrasal grouping.
Phonetic Description of French The French phonetic system consists of 36 phonemes, including 17 consonants, 16 vowels, and 3 semi-vowels.
Table 1 shows the different phonemes; the IPA column contains the phonemes in the standard International Phonetic Alphabi,t; the second column ASCII shows the ascii correspondence of these characters for the text-to-speech system, and the third column shows art example of the phoneme in a French word.

As shown in Table 1, the fourth nasal /de/ has been removed, /07,/ and /g/ being represented by the single phoneme /g/.
The reasons for this change are that (1) /de/ tends to be assimilated to the phoneme/g/, and (2) this nasal vowel occurs in very few words in French.

2.1 Diphone
Structure and Selection of Carrier Word 2.1.1 Structure of Diphones This section discusses the nature, of the diphone set and the manner in which diphones were collected.
Diphones are structured as \[bllows: *V, *C, g*, C*, CV, VC, CO, gV where * is a silence, C a consonant, and V a vowel.
Semi vowels were treated in the same fashion as consonants.
Diphones were recorded following two (lif\[erent strategies: the first one consisted of picking existing words from a dictionary list.
The second consisted of deciding on a neutral phonetic context in using logatornes or nonexisting words.
Logatomes are phonotactiically well-formed strings, which do not exist as words in the current French language.
2.1.2 Selection
of existing words from machine-readable dictionary A word list was extracted from a subset of the Robert French dictionary \[?\] and the pronunciation fields were extracted.
The dictionary contains almost 89,000 entries, of which 85,796 entries conLain a headword, a phonemic transcription, and a part of speech.
The remaining entries are prefixes and suffixes.
The first task consisted of converting and mapping the dictionary phonemic symbols to the ones adopted in our system (shown in table 1).
This was not straightforward since there was not always a one-to-one mapping between the two sets.
For handling symbol mapping, a program was written that converts any set of characters to any other set of characters I.
The program is developed so that characters coded in octal or decimal code not only can he translated in either code, but also can be input in ascii format for being converted 2 Quite often, there was more than one pronunciation in the phonetic field and the.
pattern matching program chose the pronunciation corresponding to the one required.
Moreover, dictionary pro11 am very grateflfl to Mike Tanenblatt who wrote this program and made a succession of changes until complete flexibility of character conversion was obtained.
2 This
tool allowed the conversion of databases originally written on Macintosh, PC, or Unix.
Additionally, we used it to convert all the French textual databases into latin1 8 bit encoding format.
nouneiation fields are often not phonetically linegrained enough for acceptable speech output (see \[?\] for a discussion on machine-readable dictionaries in text-to-speech systems).
Finally, due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nouns and adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of the entries were extracted during dictionary lookup.
Sirnilarly for verbs, only the infinil;iwd forms were used since the dictionary does not list the intleeted forms as headwords.
A program was written to search through the dictionary pronunciation field and select the longest word where the phonenm pairs would be in mid-syllable position in order to avoid the extraction of' phonemes occuring at the beginning or end of words.
In this way, l, he influence of lexicM stress was reduced.
The orthography/prommciation pair \[headword_orth, headwordq~)hon\] was extracted and headword_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording.
Out of 1225 original phonemic pairs, 874 words wet'{'.
found with at least one occurence of the pair.
Be cause 1225 is the number of all phonemic pairs in French whether they are allowed or not, it is interesting to notice that only 874 pairs occur within real words in the Robert dictionary.
2.1.3 Selection
of logatomes For the logato.tes, two phonen,es /a/ attd /t/ were used to encompass the selected diphone, since they appear to be fairly stable from a phonetic-acousLic standpoint.
In order to balance the alternation of vowel and consonant, the words were constructed as follows: Logatome position initial vow.
initial cons.
final vow.
final cons.
COILS. VOW.
VOWel (;ons.
cons.1 cons.2 vow.1 vow.2 Structure Example *V-ta ota *C-ata bata at-V* at() ta-C* Lab ata-CV-ta atabota at-VC-aba atit}ata ata-C,C-ata at.akrata at-VV-ta atoata "Fable 2: Phonotactic structure of logatomes All strings were generated in this way, ewm if they were not phonotaeticMly well-formed for isolated words in the language.
Nonetheless, these R)rms were generated and used since they were necessary for interword phenomena.
Approximately 1225 words were constructed following the ab ow~' model.
978 l.esearchers disagree as to whether to use logatomes or real words for synthesis.
The argmnent for using logatomcs is that it is t)etter to collect non-real words so that the diphone ix recorded as neutrally as possible and does uot undergo any real word stress.
Those against argue thai; the (\[iphone is ov(~r-articulated in a logatome environment and that it reduces l, he naturahmss of the synthesized sl)eech.
The choice is more corn plex in the sense that it greatly depends on the speaker, the articulation, and the comfort in read ing the two diff('.rent sets.
Given the controversy, in the present system, we decided to record the l)houemie t)airs in bot;h environments, so thai we (:ould choose the best ones, 2.2 The other polyphonic units I)ue to the variability of liquids and semi-vowels, synthesis based only on (liphones will uot give good results.
Indeed, such systems have provcu to be insut\[icient.
Researchers \[?\] argue l;ha| di\])holle COllcat(?ll~ttion alolle is llOt a(l(2(ltlate or sl/fticient, particularly for complex transitions.
\[?\] claims that "Meal diphones with perfect (;oncatcnation would giw~ imperf(~ct results".
Complex polypho,~es are not equivalent to concatenated allphones.
Therefore, louger concatcnativ(~ units are necessary.
Polyphones are defined by \['/\] as being a segmental unit where the initial and linal phoneme are not subject to variability, thus, excluding liquids and semi-vowels.
The strategy chosen in the Fre.nch system relies on some phonetic ge.neralities to build a set of tril)honcs.
It was decided a to form a (:lass of triphoues, based on the following transition: I'VC'~, where 1 ) is a phoneme, V a vowel, and Cc a conso naut rel)resenl,ative of the ~trticulatory locations, i.e. one velar, one dental, and one nasal.
The set consisted then of 35 phones x 14 vowels x 3 consonants = t47() triphon(:s.
The same methodology used for building the set of (liptlones was used for the triphon(~'s.
These were inchMe(I in a carrier word for the logatomes and extracted from the dictionary for the real words.
Researchers disagree on which criteria are best for the selection of triphones; should the selectiou rely on phonectic-a<:oustic <widence, or on statistical evidence, related to tl,e fi'equency of occurrence of triphones in the language?
Then, once the (:riteria is defined, which triphones shouhl be selected?
Can candidates of a class (say the phoneme /p/ 3 personal communication with Joe Olive representing all the stops, the phoneme./v/ represeutmg all the fficatiw~s) be picked to rel)resent a class or sit(mid all the phonemes belonging to the class he sekwted?
Resenreh is underway in this a,~a using a phone,,, clustering approach \[':\], \[':\] that allows the sehx:tion of segnwaltal units fi'om a database of I)honemes containing several instances of the same phoneme.
Tim extraction is made at a spectral point common to the pho,wmes.
Finally, he.cause the nnml)er of selected units atfects results, the choi('e of polyphones must be Ilia(h! with care.
'l'aking illto accotlrlt the size limita lion, one has to balanc(~ out the choice of the poly phones considering its frequency in ~he.
language. This brings in the additional complexity of cort)us selection (its language properties, dialects, socio linguisl,ic tyl)e of language, topic, and size).
\[?\] applies a series of rules on phoneum colnbination to exclude inter-word concatenation that would not occur in French.
For example, one cannot lind a glide, in I'~rench that ix not in the left or right cont;ext of a vowel; therefore, the combination consonant-glide-consonant is excluded.
An optimal set of polyphone combinations is computed that re.aches a tmmber of 7725 units.
Calculated from texts, statistics are then run on these illlits to (teterlllille the most freqllellt oc(;iH'elH;es in French, and the numbex of units is lowered to 3000, It remains to be seen whether this al)proacll is successfidl iu a workiug system.
2.3 Construction
of the corpus A carrier sentence "C'est CAI~I~ItgI~_WOnl) qlle JC dis" was selected to fulfill the following require i'qeill.s: • short sentelice~ to record, • ability t() surrourid the' carrier word to avoid selfl, ential accent and effects, • phonetically neutral environment.
2.4 Choice
of a Speaker l?ive male natiw: speakers of Continental French were interviewed for selc'cting tile voice of the lq'eneh synthesizer.
A sample of text representing highly o('(;uring graphemic trigrams wax prepare.d to be used in this task.
The corpus wax run through a greedy algorithm 4 that returned the most frequent words within their sentences 4'|'hanks to .Inn Van Santen for developing and running his greedy algorithm.
979 along with a measure corresponding to the coverage of the graphemic triphone.
Once tile sample was recorded by tire 5 speakers, the natural voices were run through LPC analysis and re-synthesize.d in order to judge the resistance of tile voice to synthesis.
Five subjects were asked to give their judgcrnent on the following criteria: clear articulation: tile voice was carefully listened to evaluate tire articulation of the speaker.
Subjective perceptual judgements were lnade.
2. neutral French accent: the candidate was asked about tile areas of Franc(: where he grew up.
The central area of France "l'Ile de France" is known for its neutral accent and is regarded as being a well-received accent.
Additionally, for French native speakers residing in the USA, particular attention was paid to the influence of English in tire prommcialion of French, especially for English borrowings, such as for example, the company name AT&T to be pronounced/a te re/(the French way) and not; /el t n t/ as in English.
regularity: special attention was given to ensure that the speaker would have a reasonable degree of regularity in uttering French phonemes.
ph:asantness of the voic(.': the subjects doing the evaluation were asked to give their opinion on the pleasantness of the voice, in particular the timber, the level of nasality, and the intonation.
Of course, this is a highly subjective matter but a critical one for success.
2.5 Recording
Conditions The recording was done on four non-consecutive days under the following conditions.
Thc sen tences were recorded directly onto the computer through a 1)AT (Digital audio 'rape) tape recorder, using interactive software allowing easy reading and repetition of the sentences Lo be recorded.
Additional time was devoted to the recording of triphones as well as the re-recording of sentences that were improperly uttered.
The same carrier sentence and a regular prosodic context was carefully maintained so that there was minireal suprasegmental variation.
Once the recording was done, the 48 kHz digitized acoustic signal was downsized to 12 kllz.
2.6 Transcription
of recording lnaterial For the recording, all sentences were transcribed from the phonetic alphabet to an orthographic Ibrrnat.
This was done to allow tile speaker to utter sent(;nees with more naturalness.
Once the recording was dorlc'~ th(" sentences were setniautomatically re-transcribed into phonc%c form.
For some~ utterances, the phon('tic transcription was manually adjusted to the idiosynerasi(;s of the speaker.
For example, it often happened that confusion arises between open and closed vowels, such in the ~ord '~zoologique" zoological that can be pronomtced either/zooloaik/or/zaalosik/.
In case the output was /zooloaik/ instead of the expe(%ed /zaalosik/, the transcription was readjusted.
2.7 Segmentation
Segmentation is presently in progress; efforts are being pursued to adapt an automatic segmentor for English to French and other languages.
In the meantime, rnannal segmentation is being done as a pilot experiment in order to cheek the accuracy of automatic segmentation.
Beyond the scope of this paper are many complex issues raised in segmenting French, such as the segmentation of semivoweds (/j/, /w/, and /q/) and liquids (/l/ and /r/), each of these phonemes being quite unstable f¥om a phonetic-~eoustic standpoint.
These issues will be addressed in hmm; work.
2.8 Integration
of an orthographic transcriber A grapheme-to-phoneme transcriber \[?\] was acquired to convert French orthography to a phone.mie representation.
The software performs some syntactic and partial semantic analysis of the sentence in order to disambiguate the input string.
Once performed, spellings at0.
converted in a series of steps into a phonernic representation.
3 Issues
in Text Analysis We have t)nrsued work in the text analysis of French in order to obtain linguistic data for intonation and prosody; additionally, the output of the work will be used in the translation project.
This aspect of the work has entailed several points: • acquisition of a large French dictionary: lt.obcrt Encyclopedic dictionary (containing 980 over 851¢ ent,rie.s, 80k articles, 160k eitatious, analogical terms (synonyms, hon|onlylns, el,(;), and conjugatiou tables for illOSt l?rerl(;\[l verl)s), • collectiol~ of French corpora: i,'rcneh news from LI'; M()NI)I'; \[?\] I/'retlch news daily <:ompih'.d by the French embassy in Washington DC (24657K byt;es arc now en<:oded, and a monthly update is being done.).

4 Conclusion
The French TTS system is part of a large project of multiliugua\] text-to-sl>eech synthesis ill progress at AT£'T Bell I~ahoratories.
Speech synthesis for French brings a variety of chalh!nges, some of which are specific to French, such as nasalization, liaison, schwa realization, etc.
and some of which are more general issues, such as vowel hmgthen= ing, prosodic cont, ouring, and intonation.
Several systems are.
in exp<!rin|e|d;al stages for other languages, such as Spanish (Castilian as well as South Ame.ri<'ar0, Italian, Chinese, Navajo, German, aud Russian.
Once C, ontinental French is eomph'.ted, 981 we also intend to build a TTS system for Canadian French.
