â€¢/~ similar method reported by Guthrie et al., \[1991\] defined subject-specific neighborhoods of words, using the subject area markings in the machine readable version of LDOCE.

Simulated annealing was applied to parsing by Sampson \[1986\], but since the method has not yet been widely applied to Computational Linguistics or Natural Language Processing, we describe it briefly.

Zernik, Uri, and Paul Jacobs (1990).

Zernik and Jacobs \[1990\] also derive their neighborhoods from a training text which has been sense-tagged by hand.

Recently, promising computational methods have been suggested \[Lesk, 1987; McDonald et al., 1990; Wilks et al., 1990; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Hearst, 1991\] which attempt to use the local context of the word to be disambiguated together with information about each of its word senses to solve this problem.

Although each of these techniques looks somewhat promising for disambiguation, the techniques have only been applied to several words, and the results have been based on experiments which repeatedly disambiguate a single word (or in \[Zernik and Jacobs, 1990\], one of three words) in a large number of sentences.
