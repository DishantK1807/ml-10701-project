While Kuhlmann and Mhl (2006) show that MC-TAGs in which each set has a single lexical anchor induce graph drawings that are outside this class, this extra complexity in the dependency structures does not appear to be utilized.

5.2 Non-Well-Nestedness Kuhlmann and Mhl (2006) show that even a treelocal MC-TAG that allows only substitution can induce a non-well-nested graph drawing.

See Kuhlmann and Mhl (2007) on the relationship between sets of graph drawings and LTAGs.

However, multicomponent extensions of TAG (MC-TAG), argued to be necessary on linguistic grounds, induce dependency structures that do not conform to these two properties (Kuhlmann and Mhl 2006).
P06-2066 W06-1517
The MCextension allows for linguistically satisfying accounts for a number of attested phenomena, such as: English extraposition (Kroch and Joshi 1986), subj-aux inversion in combination with raising verbs (Frank 1992), anaphoric binding (Ryant and Scheffler 2006), quantifier scope ambiguity (Joshi et al.2003), clitic climbing in Romance (Bleam 1994), and Japanese causatives (Heycock 1986).

Kuhlmann and Mhl (2006) report that if an entire MC set is anchored by a single lexical element (the natural extension of ?lexicalization??of TAGs to MC-TAGs), then the class of dependency structures is expanded with respect to both conditions that characterized the TAG-induced graph drawings: MC-TAG induced graph drawings include structures that are not well-nested, have gap degree > 1, or both.

2 TAG-induced Graph Dependencies The next two sections are intended to provide an intuition for the terms defined more formally in Bodirsky et al.(2005) and Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006).
P06-2066 W06-1517
This keeps the corresponding graph drawings within the class of structures identified by Bodirsky et al.(2005) as a model of TAG derivations, and by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) as empirically relevant.

Joshi* + *Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, and + Dept of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104-6228 {chenmain,joshi}@seas.upenn.edu Abstract Recent work identifies two properties that appear particularly relevant to the characterization of graph-based dependency models of syntactic structure 1 : the absence of interleaving substructures (well-nestedness) and a bound on a type of discontinuity (gap-degree ??1) successfully describe more than 99% of the structures in two dependency treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006).
P06-2066 W06-1517
the Structures Remain Well-Nested Since Kuhlmann and Mhl (2006) show that even a MC-TAG that allows only non-auxiliary trees in MC-sets will expand the drawings to include nonwell-nested drawings, there is no way to pare back the MC-TAG via restrictions on the types of trees allowed in MC-sets so as to avoid interleaving.
P06-2066 W06-1517
In related work, Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) evaluate a number of constraints that have been proposed to restrict the class of dependency structures characterizing natural language with respect to two dependency treebanks: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji et al., 2001) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003).

If we suppose that the characterization of dependency structures as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e. the dependency structures for natural language falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree ??1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears to correspond to the wrong class of modeltheoretic dependency structures.
