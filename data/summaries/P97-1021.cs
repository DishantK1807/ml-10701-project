Bod (1993b) shows that DOP can be implemented using context-free parsing techniques.
E93-1006
The DOP method differs from other statistical approaches, such as Pereira and Schabes (1992), Black et al.(1993) and Briscoe (1994), in that it does not predefine or train a formal grammar; instead it takes subtrees directly from annotated sentences in a treebank with a probability proportional to the number of occurrences of these subtrees in the treebank.

In Bonnema (1996) a semantic extension of the DOP parser of Sima'an (1996a) is given.

Implementation details and experimental results can be found in Bonnema (1996), and Bod et al.(1996). We repeat the most important observations: * Data-oriented semantic interpretation seems to be robust; of the sentences that could be parsed, a significantly higher percentage received a correct semantic interpretation (88%), than an exactly correct syntactic analysis (62%).

The model was tested on the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus as analyzed in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.(1993)), achieving better test results than other stochastic grammars (cf.

For an overview of data-oriented language processing, we refer to (Bod and Scha, 1996).
W96-0111
The current implementation is again an extension of Sima'an (1996a), by Bonnema 2.
C96-2215
To select the most probable parse, Bod (1993a) gives a Monte Carlo approximation algorithm.
E93-1006
We first summarize the first fully instantiated DOP model as presented in Bod (1992-1993).

As was shown in Sima'an (1996b), the most likely interpretation of a string cannot be computed in deterministic polynomial time.
