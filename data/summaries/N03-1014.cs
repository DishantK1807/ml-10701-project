The bottom panel of table 1 lists the results for the two lexicalized models (SSN-Freq a1 200 and SSN-Freq a1 20) and five recent statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000; Bod, 2001).

Ratnaparkhi (1999) defines a very general set of features for the histories of a shift-reduce parsing model, but the results are not as good as models which use a more linguistically informed set of features for a top-down parsing model (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

Many statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) are based on a history-based model of parser actions.

For right-branching structures, the left-corner ancestor is the parent, conditioning on which has been found to be beneficial (Johnson, 1998), as has conditioning on the left-corner child (Roark and Johnson, 1999).
J98-4004 P99-1054
Collins and Duffy (2002) define a kernel over parse trees and apply it to re-ranking the output of a parser, but the resulting feature space is restricted by the need to compute the kernel efficiently, and the results are not as good as Collinsâ€™ previous work on re-ranking using a finite set of features (Collins, 2000).
P02-1034
The standard way to handle this problem is to hand-craft a finite set of features which provides a sufficient summary of the history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
A00-2018
Previous approaches have used a hand-crafted finite set of features to represent the parse history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

Experimental Results We used the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) to perform empirical experiments on this parsing model.

We then tested the best models for each vocabulary size on the testing set.4 Standard measures of performance are shown in table 1.5 3We used a publicly available tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to provide the tags used in these experiments, rather than the handcorrected tags which come with the corpus.

Work Most previous work on statistical parsing has used a history-based probability model with a hand-crafted set of features to represent the derivation history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

The concept of lexical head is central to theories of syntax, and has often been used in designing hand-crafted history features (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).
