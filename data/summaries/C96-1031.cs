In this sense, the adequate integration of error detection and correction techniques within mainstream grammm" formalisms has l)een addressed by a nunl|)er of these projects (\[Iolioli eta/., 1992), (Vosse, 1992), ((\]enthia.l ctal., t992), (O(~uthial et al., 1994).

Currently, every project in grammar checking has as its goal the creation of a writing aid rather than a robust man-machine interface (Adriaens, 1994), (llolioli ctal., 1992), (Vosse, 1992).

The interest in the 80's begun to turn considering grammar checking as an enterprise of its own right (Carbonell & Hayes, 1983), (Ilayes & Mouradian, 1981), (Heidorn et al., 1982), (.lensen at al., 1983), though many of the approaches were still in I;t1(: NLU tradition ((\]harniak, 198a), (Granger, 1983), (Kwasny & Sondheimer, 1981), (Weischedel & Black, \]980), (Weisehedel & Sondheimer, 1983).

(Veronis, 1988) claims that native writers are unlikely to produce errors involving morphological features, while (Vosse, 1992) acce.t)ts such morpho-syntactic errors, in spite of tile fact that an examination of texts by the author revealed that their appearance in native writer's texts is not frequent.

In some case.s, these have be.en incorporated to traditional parsing techniques, as it is the case with feature relaxation in the context of unification-based formalisms (Bolioli et al., 1992), or the addition of a set of catching error rules si)ecially handling the deviant constructions (Thurlnair, 1990).
