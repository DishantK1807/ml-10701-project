As (Church and Hanks, 1990), we adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each cooccurrence.

work As they rely on the detection of high-density areas in a network of cooccurrences, (Véronis, 2003) and (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) are the closest methods to ours.

In our case, we chose a more general approach by working at the level of a similarity graph: when the similarity of two words is given by their relation of cooccurrence, our situation is comparable to the one of (Véronis, 2003) and (Dorow and Widdows, 2003); but in the same framework, we can also take into account other kinds of similarity relations, such as the second order cooccurrences.

Hence, it is not very surprising that they were criticized, as in (Harabagiu et al., 1999), for not being suitable for Natural Language Processing.

The second main trend, found in (Schütze, 1998), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Purandare, 2003), represents each instance of a target word by a set of features that occur in its neighborhood and applies an unsupervised clustering algorithm to all its instances.

This method, as the ones presented in (Véronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), relies on the following hypothesis: in the subgraph gathering the cooccurrents of a word, the number of relations between the cooccurrents defining a sense is higher than the number of relations that these cooccurrents have with those defining the other senses of the considered word.

The last trend, explored by (Véronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), starts from the cooccurrents of a word recorded from a corpus and builds its senses by gathering its cooccurrents according to their similarity or their dissimilarity.

From a global viewpoint, these two differences lead (Véronis, 2003) and (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) to build finer senses than ours.
