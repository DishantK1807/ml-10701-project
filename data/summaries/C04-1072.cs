• A natural fit to the existing statistical machine translation framework – A metric that ranks a good translation high in an nbest list could be easily integrated in a minimal error rate statistical machine translation training framework (Och 2003).

For example, a statistical machine translation system such as ISI’s AlTemp SMT system (Och 2003) can generate a list of n-best alternative translations given a source sentence.

To simulate real world scenario, we use n-best lists from ISI’s state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system, AlTemp (Och 2003), and the 2002 NIST Chinese-English evaluation corpus as the test corpus.

Although the idea of using objective functions to automatically evaluate machine translation quality is not new (Su et al.1992), the success of BLEU prompts a lot of interests in developing better automatic evaluation metrics.
