pilot experiment To test whether the addition of clause boundary and functional-syntactic information made morphological disambiguation easier, a finite-state grammar consisting of some 200 syntactic rules \[Koskenniemi et al., 1992\] was written, and a test text 4 was selected.

The first nontrivial finite-state descriptions \[Koskenniemi etal., 1992\] were written by Voutilainen 1991-1992, and currently he is working on a comprehensive English grammar which is expected to reach a considerable degree of maturity by the end of 1994.

The present work is closely connected with two parsing formalisms, Constraint Grammar \[Karlsson, 1990; Karlsson et aI., 1991; Voutilainen et aI., 1992; Karlsson et aI., 1993\] and Finlte-state syntax as advocated by \[Koskenniemi, 1990; Tapanainen, 1991; Koskenniemi et al., 1992\].
