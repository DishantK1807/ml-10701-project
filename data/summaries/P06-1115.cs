We compared our systemâ€™s performance with the following existing systems: the string and tree versions of SILT (Kate et al., 2005), a system that learns transformation rules relating NL phrases to MRL expressions; WASP (Wong and Mooney, 2006), a system that learns transformation rules using statistical machine translation techniques; SCISSOR (Ge and Mooney, 2005), a system that learns an integrated syntactic-semantic parser; and CHILL (Tang and Mooney, 2001) an ILP-based semantic parser.

The above task has some resemblance to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing for which efficient algorithms are available (Stolcke, 1995), but we note that our task of finding the most probable semantic derivation differs from PCFG parsing in two important ways.

Some of the previous work on semantic parsing has focused on fairly simple domains, primarily, ATIS (Air Travel Information Service) (Price, 1990)whosesemanticanalysisisequivalenttofilling a single semantic frame (Miller et al., 1996; Popescu et al., 2004).

Previous work on learning semantic parsers either employ rule-based algorithms (Tang and Mooney, 2001; Kate et al., 2005), or use statistical feature-based methods (Ge and Mooney, 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and Mooney, 2006).
