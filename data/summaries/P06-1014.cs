We considered the three best-ranking WSD systems – GAMBL (Decadt et al., 2004), SenseLearner (Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004), and Koc Table 4: Performance of WSD systems at Senseval-3 on coarse-grained sense inventories.

Work Dolan (1994) describes a method for clustering word senses with the use of information provided in the electronic version of LDOCE (textual definitions, semantic relations, domain labels, etc.).

Vickrey et al.(2005) and Stokoe (2005)), the present performance of the best ranking WSD systems does not provide a sufficient degree of accuracy to enable real-world, language-aware applications.

Recent estimations of the inter-annotator agreement when using the WordNet inventory report figures of 72.5% agreement in the preparation of the English all-words test set at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004) and 67.3% on the Open Mind Word Expert annotation exercise (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002).

To match definitions in a semantic manner we adopted a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm, Structural Semantic Interconnections (SSI, Navigli and Velardi (2004)).

Interestingly, Ng et al.(1999) show that, when a coarse-grained sense inventory is adopted, the increase in interannotator agreement is much higher than the reduction of the polysemy degree.

on Senseval-3 As a first experiment, we assessed the effect of the automatic sense clustering on the English allwords task at Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

The grammar consists of a small number of rules, inspired by the notion of lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).

A different principle for clustering WordNet senses, based on the Minimum Description Length, is described by Tomuro (2001).

Finally, McCarthy (2006) proposes the use of ranked lists, based on distributionally nearest neighbours, to relate word senses.
