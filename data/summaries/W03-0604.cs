Instead, we develop a new scoring criterion, based on Melamed (1997).

We have developed a set of extensions to a probabilistic translation model (Brown et al., 1993) that enable us to successfully merge oversegmented regions into coherent objects.

The first model of Brown et al.(1993), which will be used and expanded in our initial formulation, uses the following approximation to Pra5 fa6ea7 : Pra5 fa6 ea7a11a8 ∑ a Pra5 Ma7 ∏ ja12 1a13a13a13 M Pra5 a j a6 La7 Pra5 f j a6a j a14 ea j a7 (2) where M is the number of French words in f, L is the number of English words in e, and a is an alignment that maps each French word to one of the English words, or to the “null” word e0.

Probabilistic translation models generally seek to find the translation string e that maximizes the probability Pra5 ea6fa7, given the source string f (where f referred to French and e to English in the original work, Brown et al., 1993).

In this paper, we describe our extensions to the probabilistic translation model of Brown et al.(1993) (as in Duygulu et al.(2002)) that enable the creation of structured models of image objects.

We start with the probabilistic translation model of Brown et al.(1993) (as in Duygulu et al., 2002), and extend it to structured shape descriptions of visual data.
