AND PACKING FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURES A functional structure used in the functional grammar formalisms (Kay 1984, Bresnan and Kaplan 1982, Shieber 1985) is in general a directed acyclic graph (dag) rather than a tree.

Finally, in the continuous speech recognition project at CMU (Hayes et al.1986), the on-line parsing algoComputational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 1-2, January-June 1987 45 Masaru Tomita An Efficient Augmented-Context-Free Parsing Algorithm rithm is being extended to handle speech input, to make the speech parsing process efficient and capable of being pipelined with lower level processes such as acoustic/phonetic level recognition (Tomita 1986).

NLMenu (Tennant et al.1983) adopted on-line parsing for a menu-based system but not for typed inputs.

The notation is similar to the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982) and PATR-II (Shieber 1984).

If a grammar is non-LR, its parsing table will have multiple entries; 1 one or more of the action table entries will be multiply defined (Shieber 1983).

It is also desired to produce a functional structure (in the sense of functional grammar formalism (Kay 1984, Bresnan and Kaplan 1982) rather than the context-free forest.
