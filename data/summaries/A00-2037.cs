Acknowledgments also play a role in managing turn-taking in mixed-initiative dialogue; although acknowledgments may preface a new contribution by the same speaker (Novick & Sutton, 1994), often they occur alone as a single-phrase turn that appears to serve the purpose of explicitly declining an opportunity to take a turn (Sacks et al, 1974).

The determination as to whether a particular utterance constituted an acknowledgment or a command was based primarily on word choice and dialogue context; this approach is consistent with definitions of this behavior, e.g., Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997).

These are also called "back channels" or "prompts" (e.g., Chu-Carroll & Brown, 1997), Closely related to acknowledgments are repetitions, in which the conversant provides a stronger signal that a contribution has been understood by repeating part or all of the other's contribution.
