This intermediate representation of text has been used in many natural language processing applications, including automatic summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Silber and McCoy, 2003), information retrieval (Al-Halimi and Kazman, 1998), and intelligent spell checking (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998).

Cohesion is achieved through the use in the text of semantically related terms, reference, ellipse and conjunctions (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).

Morris and Hirst (1991) at first proposed a manual method for computing lexical chains and first computational model of lexical chains was introduced by Hirst and St-Onge (1997).
J91-1002
This method (summing edge weights in selecting the right sense) of WSD before constructing the chain (Gallery and McKeown, 2003) outperforms the earlier methods of Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) and Silber and McCoy (2003) but this method is highly dependent on the lexical cohesion among words in a context.
W97-0703
Later 476 research (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) significantly alleviated this problem at the cost of a worse running time (quadratic); computational inefficiency is due to their processing of many possible combinations of word senses in the text in order to decide which assignment is the most likely.
