The text unit's definition in Hearst (1994, 1997) and Foltz et al.(1998) is generally task dependent, depending on what size gives the best results.
J97-1003 P94-1002
Hearst (1994, 1997) was replicated using the JTextTile (Choi, 1999) Java software.
J97-1003 P94-1002
This combination matches Hearst (1994)'s heuristic of choosing the window size to be the average paragraph length.
P94-1002
Using a vector space method without singular value decomposition, Hearst (1997) reports an F-measure of .70 when detecting topic shifts between paragraphs.
J97-1003
The only existing work on topic segmentation in dialogue, Galley et al.(2003), segments recorded speech between multiple persons using both lexical cohesion and dis971 tinctive textual and acoustic markers.
P03-1071
It may be that Hearst (1994, 1997)’s segmentation criterion, i.e. depth scores, do not translate well to dialogue.
J97-1003 P94-1002
Recall that in monologue, Hearst (1997) reports a much larger F-measure than Foltz et al.(1998), .70 vs.
J97-1003
Hearst (1994) recommends using the average paragraph size as the window size.
P94-1002
A variant of Hearst (1994, 1997) was created by using LSA instead of the standard vector space method.
J97-1003 P94-1002
Thus previous work suggests that the Hearst (1997) method is superior to that of Foltz et al.(1998), having roughly twice the accuracy indicated by F-measure.
J97-1003
The first of these, lexical cohesion, may be used for either linear segmentation (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Hearst, 1997) or hierarchical segmentation (Yarri, 1997; Choi, 2000).

Hearst (1994, 1997) in contrast uses a relative comparison of cohesion, by recasting vector comparisons as depth scores.
J97-1003 P94-1002
window size for Hearst method On the test set, this combination of parameters yielded an F-measure of .14 as opposed to the Fmeasure for monologue reported by Hearst (1997), .70.

In this study we apply the methods of Foltz et al.(1998), Hearst (1994, 1997), and a new technique utilizing an orthonormal basis to topic segmentation of tutorial dialogue.
J97-1003 P94-1002
By using multiple markers and machine learning methods, topic segmentation algorithms may be developed using this second approach that have a higher accuracy than methods using a single marker alone (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).
J97-1005
Both Hearst (1994, 1997) and Foltz et al.(1998) use vector space methods discussed below to represent and compare units of text.
J97-1003 P94-1002
The second major approach to topic segmentation looks for distinctive textual or acoustic markers of topic boundaries, e.g. referential noun phrases or pauses (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997).
J97-1005 P93-1020
(1994, 1997) The JTextTile software was used to implement Hearst (1994) on dialogue.
P94-1002
Ever since Morris and Hirst (1991)’s groundbreaking paper, topic segmentation has been a steadily growing research area in computational linguistics, with applications in summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997), information retrieval (Salton and Allan, 1994), and text understanding (Kozima, 1993).
J91-1002 P93-1041 W97-0703
Hearst likewise chooses a large unit, 6 token-sequences of 20 tokens (Hearst, 1994), but varies these parameters dependent on the characteristics of the text to be segmented, e.g. paragraph size.
P94-1002
The present work differs from Galley et al.(2003) in two respects, viz.
P03-1071
However, Hearst (1994, 1997) and Foltz et al.(1998) differ on how text units are defined and on how to interpret the results of a comparison.
