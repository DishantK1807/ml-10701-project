Nicholson and Baldwin (2006) investigated the prediction of the inherent semanticrelation of agiven compound nominalization using as statistical measure the confidence interval.

Since we are only interested in acquiring new lexical entries for MWEs which are not covered by the grammar, we used the error mining results (Zhang et al., 2006; van Noord, 2004) to only keep those candidates with parsability ≤ 0.1.

This improvement in coverage is largely comparable to the result reported in (Zhang et al., 2006), where the coverage was reported to raise from 5% to 18% with the“word with spaces”approach (see also section 4).

However, the lexical type predictor of Zhang and Kordoni (2006) that we used in our experiments did not generate interesting new entries for them in the subsequent steps, and they were thusdiscarded, as discussed below.

Taking a closer look at the MWE candidates 1039 proposed, wefind that only a small proportion of them can be handled appropriately by the“word with spaces” approach of Zhang et al.(2006). Simply adding new lexical entries for all MWEs can be a workaround for enhancing the parser coverage, but the quality of the parser output is clearly linguistically less interesting.

The top 30 MWE candidates are used in 2The combination of the “word with space” approach of Zhang et al.(2006) with the constructional approach we propose here is an interesting topic that we want to investigate in future research.

We adopted a compositional approach to the encoding of MWEs, using some heuristics to detect the head of an MWE, and this resulted in a smaller grammar than that by Zhang et al.(2006), still achieving a similar increase in coverage and maintaining a high level of accuracy of parses, comparable to that reported by Baldwin et al.(2004). The statistical measures are currently only 1041 item # parsed # avg.

Pearce (2002), Evert and Krenn (2005) and Zhang et al.(2006)). Given the heterogeneousness of the different phenomena that are considered to be MWEs, there is no consensus about which method is best suited for which type of MWE, and if there is a single method that can be successfully used for any kind of MWE.

It is also worth mentioning that Zhang et al.(2006) added 373 new lexical entries for a total of 311 MWE candidates, with an average of 1.2 entries per MWE.

Zhang et al.(2006) tried a simple“word with spaces” approach.

The lexical acquisition technique described in Zhang and Kordoni (2006) was used with this subcorpus in order to acquire new lexical entries for the head words.

Here we concentrate on a single corpus, BNCf, and compare the three statistical measures for MWE identification: Mutual Information (MI), χ2 and Permutation Entropy (PE)(Zhang et al., 2006), to investigate if they order the trigrams in the same fashion.
W06-1206
For that we use 1039 trigrams that are the output of Zhang et al.(2006) error mining system, and frequencies collected from the BNC and from the World Wide Web.

The lexical acquisition model wastrained withthe Redwoodstreebank(Oepen et al., 2002), following Zhang et al.(2006). The lexical prediction model predicted for each occurrence of the head words a most plausible lexical type in that context.

On the other hand, Zhang et al.(2006) looked at MWEs in general investigating the semiautomated detection of MWE candidates in texts using error mining techniques and validating them using a combination of the World Wide Web as a corpus and some statistical measures.

Finally, we perform a qualitative evaluation of the results of adding automatically extracted MWEs to a linguistic resource, taking as basis for the evaluation the approach proposed by Zhang et al.(2006). We argue that such results can improve in quality if a more compositional approach to MWE encoding is adopted for the grammar extension.

MWEs The automatic acquisition of specific types of MWE has attracted much interest (Pearce, 2002; Baldwin and Villavicencio, 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005; Villavicencio, 2005; van der 1035 Beek, 2005; Nicholson and Baldwin, 2006).

Pearce (2002) for collocations and Zhang et al.(2006) for MWEs in general).

As reported in Zhang et al.(2006), this addition to the grammar resulted in a significant increase in grammar coverage of 14.4%.

For instance, Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002) proposed a combination of methodsto extract VerbParticle Constructions (VPCs) from unannotated corpora, that in an evaluation on the Wall Street Journal achieved 85.9% precision and 87.1% recall.

6248 sentences were then extracted from the BNC; these contained at least one of the 311 MWE candidates verified with World Wide Web in the way described in Zhang et al.(2006). For each occurrence of the MWE candidates in this set of sentences, the lexical type predictor proposed in Zhang and Kordoni (2006) predicted a lexical entry candidate.

Unfortunately, the construction of these resources is the manual result of human efforts and therefore likely to contain errors of omission and commission (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).
