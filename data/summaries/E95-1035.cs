This approach improves upon earlier work on discourse structure such as (Lascarides and Asher, 1991) and (Kehler, 1994) in reducing the number of possible ambiguities; it is also more precise than the Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee approach in that it takes into account ways in which the apparent defaults can be overridden and differentiates between events and activities, which behave differently in narrative progression.

The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose' the best among them.

the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the "threads" that sentences continue, we use an implementation of temporM centering (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994).

The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi's discourse grammar (Scha Polanyi 1988; Priist et al 1994).

HPSG implementation of a discourse grammar Following Scha ~ Polanyi (1988) and Priist et al (1994), our model of discourse consists of units called Discourse Constituent Units (ecus) which are related by various temporal and rhetorical relations.

As Kehler (1994) points out, if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences, then the use of "because" in (5) should cause a temporal clash-whereas it is perfectly felicitous.

approach to representing semantic relationships we take is one used by Morris &: Hirst (1991) wherein the words in the lexicon are associated with each other in a thesauruslike fashion and given a rating according to how semantically "close" they are.

Kameyama et al.(1993) confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus.

(b) Other preferences, such as a preference for relating the new DCU to a thread with parallel tense, are employed (See (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) for details), and the resulting ratings are factored into the rating for each thread.

This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al., 1983).
P83-1007
For example, Lascarides Asher (1991) suggest that general knowledge postulates (in the case of (3a): that a pushing can cause a falling) can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading.
