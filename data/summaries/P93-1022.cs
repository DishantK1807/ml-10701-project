Class based models (Brown et al., ; Pereira et al., 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992) distinguish between unobserved cooccurrences using classes of "similar" words.

data recovery task In the second evaluation, the estimation method had to distinguish between members of two sets of 8It should be emphasized that the TWS method uses only a monolingual target corpus, and not a bilingual corpus as in other methods ((Brown et al., 1991; Gale et al., 1992)).

In the first one we achieved a complete scenario of the use of the estimation method, by implementing a variant of the d\[Sambiguation method in (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense selection in machine translation.

The search is based on the property that when computing sim(wl, w2), words that have high mutual information values 5The nominator in our metric resembles the similarity metric in (Hindle, 1990).

The mutual information of a cooccurrence pair, which measures the degree of association between the two words (Church and Hanks, 1990), is defined as (Fano, 1961): P(xly) I(x,y) -log 2 P(x,y) _ log 2 (1) P(x)P(y) P(x) = log 2 P(y\[x) P(Y) where P(x) and P(y) are the probabilities of the events x and y (occurrences of words, in our case) and P(x, y) is the probability of the joint event (a cooccurrence pair).

Statistical data about these various cooccurrence relations is employed for a variety of applications, such as speech recognition (Jelinek, 1990), language generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990), lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), machine translation (Brown et al., ; Sadler, 1989), information retrieval (Maarek and Smadja, 1989) and various disambiguation tasks (Dagan et al., 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Grishman et al., 1986; Dagan and Itai, 1990).

To carry out the evaluation, we implemented a variant of the disambiguation method of (Dagan et al., 1991), for sense disambiguation in machine translation.
