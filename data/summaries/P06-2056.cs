Sun et al.(Sun et al., 1998) uses mutual information (boundary p=91.8%, no report for recall, 1588 Chinese characters), and Feng(Feng et al., 2004) incorporates branching counts in the evaluation function to be optimized for obtaining boundaries (wordprecision=76%, recall=78%, 2000sentences).

Some works are based on in-word branching frequencies formulated in an original evaluation function, as in (Ando and Lee, 2000) (boundary precision=84.5%,recall=78.0%, tested on 12500 Japanese ideogram words).

The current state-of-the-art segmentation software developed by (Low et al., 2005), which ranks as the best in the SIGHAN bakeo (Emerson, 2005), attains word precision and recall of 96.9% and 96.8%, respectively, on the PKU track.

These scoresarealsoutilized especially in previous works on unsupervised segmentation (Ando and Lee, 2000) (Sun et al., 1998).

Kempe (Kempe, 1999) reports a preliminary experiment to detectwordborders in Germanand English texts by monitoring the entropy of successive characters for 4-grams.
