Brill (1995)) seemed to indicate that other methods of unsupervised learning could be more effective (although the work of Banko and Moore (2004) suggests that the difference may be far less than previ112 ously assumed).

Klein and Manning (2001; 2002) recently achieved more encouraging results using an EM-like algorithm to induce syntactic constituent grammars, based on a deficient probability model.

We have shown that, despite previous discouraging results (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Merialdo, 1994), it is possible to achieve good results using EM to learn linguistic structures in an unsupervised way.

These results for English are in line with previous reported results using other supervised learning techniques, e.g. van den Bosch et al.(1998). Since many of the words in the data are monosyllabic (49.1% in German, 61.2% in English) and therefore contain no ambiguous syllable boundaries, we also calculated the multisyllabic word accuracy.

Merialdo (1994) showed that with only a tiny amount of tagged training data, supervised training of an HMM part-of-speech tagger outperformed unsupervised EM training.

Several researchers have worked on unsupervised learning of phonotactic constraints and word segmentation (Elman, 2003; Brent, 1999; Venkataraman, 2001), but to our knowledge there is no previously published work on unsupervised learning of syllable structure.

A number of different supervised machine learning techniques have been applied to the task of automatic syllable boundary detection, including decision-tree classifiers (van den Bosch et al., 1998), weighted finite state transducers (Kiraz and M¨obius, 1998), and PCFGs (M¨uller, 2001; M¨uller, 2002).
