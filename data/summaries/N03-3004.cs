(Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999) describe a method for discriminating among verb senses based on determining which nouns co–occur with the target verb.
E99-1028
The best example of such an approach is (Yarowsky, 1995), who proposes a method that automatically identifies collocations that are indicative of the sense of a word, and uses those to iteratively label more examples.

Bag–of–words feature sets made up of unigrams have had a long history of success in text classification and word sense disambiguation (Mooney, 1996), and we believe that despite creating quite a bit of noise can provide useful information for discrimination.

The objective of this research is to extend previous work in discrimination by (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), who developed an approach using agglomerative clustering.
W97-0322
This idea is based loosely on work by (Niwa and Nitta, 1994), who compare word co–occurrence vectors derived from large corpora of text with co–occurrence vectors based on the definitions or glosses of words in a machine readable dictionary.

19-24 Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003 2 Previous Work The work in this paper builds upon two previous approaches to word sense discrimination, those of (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Sch¨utze, 1998).
W97-0322
We believe that this is an aggressive number of senses for a discrimination system to attempt, considering that (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) experimented with 2 and 3 senses, and (Sch¨utze, 1998) made binary distinctions.
W97-0322
In particular, we use subsets of the line data (Leacock et al., 1993) and the English lexical sample data from the SENSEVAL-2 comparative exercise among word sense disambiguation systems (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001).
H93-1051
Bigrams have recently been shown to be very successful features in supervised word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2001).
