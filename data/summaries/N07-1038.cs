Previous work on sentiment categorization makes an implicit assumption that a single score can express the polarity of an opinion text (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

The effectiveness of these features for recognition of discourse relations has been previously shown by Marcu and Echihabi (2002).

Work Sentiment Classi cation Traditionally, categorization of opinion texts has been cast as a binary classication task (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave et al., 2003).

Representation Ranking Models Following previous work on sentiment classi cation (Pang et al., 2002), we represent each review as a vector of lexical features.

Reviews from this website have been previously used in other sentiment analysis tasks (Higashinaka et al., 2006).

This task is sometimes referred to as ordinal regression (Crammer and Singer, 2001) and rating prediction (Pang and Lee, 2005).
P05-1015
Since this relation can often be determined automatically for a given text (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), we can readily use it to improve rank prediction.
P02-1047
More recent work (Pang and Lee, 2005; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) has expanded this analysis to the ranking framework where the goal is to assess review polarity on a multi-point scale.
