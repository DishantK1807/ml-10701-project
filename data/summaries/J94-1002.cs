Motivated by similar principles and using only a 300-word dictionary, O'Shaughnessy (1989) proposes a somewhat more sophisticated parser for English based on function word identification, number agreement, and suffix identification.

Our earlier work drew on this scheme for predicting phrase boundaries in English: a Markov model was developed to predict phrase breaks by representing the sequence of prosodic groups and breaks as a Markov chain (Veilleux, Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel 1990).

This question incorporates the concept of balancing minor phrase lengths noted by other researchers (Gee and Grosjean 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), and was found to be useful in phrase prediction trees investigated by Wang and Hirschberg (1992).

However, their work has been extended to prosodic phrase prediction for speech synthesis applications by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990), who explicitly find prosodic phrase breaks 30 M.

POS labels were given by Church's tagger (Church 1988) and syntactic constituents by Hindle's parser (Hindle 1987).

Commas (and other punctuation) can be very useful for prosodic boundary prediction when they are available, and they are used in other algorithms (e.g., Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987; O'Shaughnessy 1989; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990).

A more detailed part-of-speech classification is given by Penn Treebank POS tags (Marcus and Santorini 1993), which were obtained automatically using the BBN tagger (Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel 1991).
J93-2004
To assign node indices to prosodic breaks (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), a critical value for separating major and minor phrase breaks is calculated based on an average of the indices associated with the prosodic phrase nodes, where the prosodic phrase nodes are all those created by the Bachenko-Fitzpatrick primary salience rules.
J90-3003
Another approach to syntactic disambiguation using prosodic information is described in Bear and Price (1990) and Ostendorf, Price, Bear, and Wightman (1990), where prosodic breaks are used to constrain grammar rules in a parser.

81). (Alternatively, it has been suggested that either phonological word count or stressed syllable count rather than orthographic word count may be a useful measure of phrase length on the lowest level \[Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990\]).

3 (Again, note that these results are not directly comparable because of the differences in false detection rates, and results for other trees in Wang and Hirschberg \[1992\] suggest that these two algorithms have similar 2 This figure is calculated from the examples in the appendix in Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990), ignoring tertiary boundaries and including sentence-final boundaries as correct.
