especially the determination of all possible logical forms of o~) and the goal of the corresponding generation task is the computation, of all possible strings defined by a grammar of a! given logical form & that are logically equivalent to ~ (see also (Shieber, 1988), (Calder et al., 1989)).

to van Noord (1990), a grammar is reversible if the parsing and generation problem is computable and the relation between strings and logical forms is symmetric.

In (Hovy, 1987), (Finkler and Neumann, 1989) and (Reithinger, 1991) approaches are described how such more flexible components can be achieved.

So most of the currently developed generators and uniform algorithms assume more or less explictly an all-paraphrases strategy (e.g., (Shieber, 1988), (Calder et al., 1989), (Shieber et al., 1989), (Dymetman et al., 1990), (Emele and Zajac, 1990)).

(Newman, 1990), (Dymetman et al., 1990)) and the performing of specific processing strategies (e.g., incremental and parallel generation, (Neumann and Finkler, 1990)).

We follow a sign-based approach for the description of linguistic entities based on Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1987) and the variant described in Reape (1989).

(Hasida and Isizaki, 1987), (Shieber, 1988), (Dymetman et aL, 1990), (Emele and Zajac, 1990)).

With few exceptions (e.g., (Appelt, 1985)) the following two components are assumed: • 'what to say' part (strategic component) • 'how to say it' part (tactical component) But, as it has been demonstrated by some authors ((hppelt, 1985), (Hovy, 1987), (P~ubinoff, 1988), (Neumann, 1991), (Reithinger, 1991))it is not possible to separate the two phases of the generation process completely, e.g., in the case of lexieal gaps, choice between near synonyms or paraphrases.

A major aspect of the BiLD project is that a specific parametrization of the deduction process is represented in the lexicon as well as in the grammar to obtain efficient structures of control (Uszkoreit, 1991).

(van Noord, 1991)).

Meteer and Shaked (1988) propose an approach where during the repeated parse of an ambiguous utterance potential sources of ambiguity can be detected.
