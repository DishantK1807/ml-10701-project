INTRODUCTION In Marcus, Hindle & Fleck (1983), the authors proposed an approach to syntactic tree structures which took the primary structural relation to be remote dominance rather than immediate dominance.

The reason for adopting dE as a description language, rather than the simpler language of Marcus et al.(1983), is that we can now treat the No Upward Branching property ("if x and z both dominate 31 then x dominates z or z dominates x or they are equal,") and the Upwards Inheritance property as generators.

We will see that we can efficiently handle richer notions of description than those in the "classical" D-Theory of Marcus, et al.(1983). D-THEORYANDTREETHEORY DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE We will make use of the following description language,,~.

For example, both Rogers & VijayShanker (1992) and Cornell (1992) present formal treatments of many notions which Marcus et al.(1983) treated only informally and incompletely.

If a description contains only formulas with a basic relation name, we will call it classical, since this is the type of description considered in Marcus et al.(1983). AXIOMS Note that such structures are not guaranteed to be trees.

Both Rogers & Vijay-Shanker (1992) and Cornell (1992) propose to solve the D-Theoretic consistency problem by using essentially Tableau-based approaches.
