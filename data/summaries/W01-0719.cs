Our new feature will be: CCBYA3C1BWBY CRD3D2CUCTD6CTD2CRCT B7CCBYA3 C1BWBY DBD3D6CZD7CWD3D4 B7 CCBY A3 C1BWBY CPD2D2D3D9D2CRCTD1CTD2D8.Giving these linguistic observations we divided the set of features into three groups, as we mentioned also in (Tzoukermann et al., 2001): 1) one associated with the head of the noun phrase; 2) one associated with the whole NP and 3) one that represents the new TF*IDF measure discussed above.

W98-0610
For extracting simple noun phrases we first used Ramshaw and Marcusâ€™s base NP chunker (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).
W95-0107
As considered by Wacholder (1998), the simple NPs are the maximal NPs that contain premodifiers but not post-nominal constituents such as prepositions or clauses.
