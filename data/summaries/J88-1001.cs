As will become evident below, our exercise is complementary in certain respects to that of Pereira and Shieber (1984) and Shieber (1987) and to recent work of Rounds and his associates on the development of a logic for the description of the notions of syntactic category that are embodied in functional unification grammar and PATR II (see Kasper and Rounds (1986), Moshier and Rounds (1987), Rounds and Kasper (1986)).

Kasper and Rounds (1986) refer to the distinction as one of type identity versus token identity.

total GKPS category set is finite, but naturally, it is extremely large (Ristad (1986) calculates that it is in excess of 10774).
P86-1006
There is a familiar technique for encoding lists or stacks in a notation which relies on the fact that lists can be decomposed into an initial element and the residual list (see, for example, Shieber (1984)).
P84-1075
reader interested in pursuing richer approaches should consult Pereira and Shieber (1984) for a domain-theoretic account of the semantics of categories in LFG, PATR II, and GPSG; Ait-Kaci and Nasr (1986), who capture shared values with a coreference relation on the nodes of the tree; Kasper and Rounds (1986), Moshier and Rounds (1987), and Rounds and Kasper (1986) for a finite state automaton-based logic and semantics for categories in FUG and PATR II; and van Benthem (1986a, b) for an interesting foundational discussion and application of such an automatonbased semantics.
P84-1027 P84-1075 P86-1038
This is in fact proposed in the literature by Shieber (1984) and Pollard (1985).
P84-1075
On this interpretation, unification of two sets of categories can be defined as the set of categories each of whose members is the unification of a pair in their Cartesian product (again, see Karttunen (1984) for relevant discussion of this kind of approach).

Note that if a ~_ fl and a satisfies 05, it does ~0T follow in L c that 3 satisfies 05 (compare Rounds and Kasper (1986), Theorem 6).
P86-1038
And, in a discussion of possible enhancements to the PATR II formalism, Karttunen (1984) provides a number of very relevant examples that illustrate the issues that arise when a unification-based formalism is augmented in order to encompass disjunction.
P84-1008
In FUG Kay (1979, 1985), LFG Kaplan and Bresnan (1982), and work by Shieber and others on PATR II Shieber (1984), this traditional distinction disappears almost entirely.
