CRFs have been shown to perform well in a number of natural language processing applications, such as POS tagging (Lafferty et al., 2001), shallow parsing or NP chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003), and named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003).

As mentioned briefly in Section 1, the morphological complexity of these languages opens up different alternative approaches in developing POS taggers for them (Bar-Haim et al., 2004; Diab et al., 2004).
