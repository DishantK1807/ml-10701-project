Given such a TimeML-derived graph for a document, a temporal closure algorithm (Verhagen 2005) carries out a transitive closure of the graph.

In ongoing work, Jerry Hobbs and his colleagues (Pan et al.2006) have developed an annotation scheme for humans to mark up event durations in documents.

While there has been a spurt of recent research addressing the event ordering problem, e.g., (Mani and Wilson 2000) (Filatova and Hovy 2001) (Schilder and Habel 2001) (Li et al.2001) (Mani et al.2003) (Li et al.2004) (Lapata and Lascarides 2004) (Boguraev and Ando 2005) (Mani et al.2006), that research relies on qualitative temporal relations.

The retrieved hits (sentences and fragments of sentences) were then processed with components from the TARSQI toolkit (Verhagen et al.2005) to provide automatic TimeML annotations.

Likewise, time expressions are flagged and their values normalized, based on an extension of the ACE (2004) (tern.mitre.org) TIMEX2 annotation scheme (called TIMEX3).

In particular, we could emulate the approach used in VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel 2004).

A wealth of prior research by (Passoneau 1988), (Webber 1988), (Hwang and Schubert 1992), (Kamp and Reyle 1993), (Lascarides and Asher 1993), (Hitzeman et al.1995), (Kehler 2000) and others, has explored the different knowledge sources used in inferring the temporal ordering of events, including temporal adverbials, tense, aspect, rhetorical relations, pragmatic conventions, and background knowledge.

We obtained a list of achievement verbs from the LCS lexicon of (Dorr and Olsen 1997) 3 . Achievements can be marked as having durations of PTXS, i.e., an unspecified number of seconds.
