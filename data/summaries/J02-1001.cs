This issue is not discussed in Correa (1988), since this paper is strictly focused on syntax and binding.

More specifically, an anaphoric NP can be 9 See, among others, Gawron and Peters (1990), Lappin and Francez (1994), and the discussion in Jacobson (1999).

Also this approach does not account for backward anaphora or crossover cases (Correa 1988, page 127; Ingria and Stallard 1989, page 268).

specification of binding theory for HPSG was tested with a computational implementation using ProFIT (Erbach 1995).

Copy: Leave a copy of A (if NP j is a short-distance reflexive) or B (if it is a pronoun) at the NP j. 3 Correa (1988, page 123) observes that although the integration of binding constraints “into rules which may be used to derive structure that already satisfies the [constraints] is not a straightforward task,” that should be the path to follow, a point also strongly stressed in subsequent elaboration on this issue by Merlo (1993).

Further elaboration by Giorgi, Pianesi, and Satta (1990) and Pianesi (1991) offers a variant in terms of formal language techniques, where the stack copied into pronouns contains the antecedent candidates excluded by Principle B.

Anaphoric Ambiguity A first proposal for improving the exhaustive coindexation-driven methodology is due to Correa (1988), whose goal was to enhance the integration of binding constraints into grammar and obtain a tractable verification procedure.

These advances permit a verification procedure of tractable complexity (Correa 1988, page 127; Giorgi, Pianesi, and Satta 1990, page 5).

Building on Kaplan and Maxwell’s (1988) proposal concerning functional uncertainty, binding equations are designed to encode the uncertainty concerning the long-distance path between the positions of the anaphor and its permissible antecedent in the grammatical structure.

Binding Machines As a proposal for that integration, we designed an extension to the Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory (UDRT) semantics component for HPSG developed by Frank and Reyle (1995).

This algorithm has been given two different implementations, one by Correa (1988), the other by Ingria and Stallard (1989).

As discussed in Correa (1988), this procedure is grossly inefficient: its complexity was shown in Fong (1990) to be of exponential order.

1. Introduction Since the so-called integrative approach to anaphor resolution was developed in the late 1980s (Carbonell and Brown 1988; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Asher and Wada 1989), and its practical viability extensively tested (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997, 1998), it has been common wisdom that factors determining the antecedents of anaphors divide into filters and preferences.
