Echihabi et al.(Echihabi et al., 2003) used Noisy-Channel Models to construct a QA system.

The class labeling system in our experiment is IOB2 (Sang, 2000), which is a variation of IOB (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).

Lita et al.(Lita and Carbonell, 2004) share our motivation to build a QA system only from question-answer pairs without depending on the question types.

Recently, some pioneering studies have investigated approaches to automatically construct QA components from scratch by applying machine learning techniques to training data (Ittycheriah et al., 2001a)(Ittycheriah et al., 2001b)(Ng et al., 2001) (Pasca and Harabagiu)(Suzuki et al., 2002)(Suzuki 215 Table 1: Number of Questions in Question Types of CRL QA Data # of Questions # of Question Types Example 1-9 74 AWARD, CRIME, OFFENSE 10-50 32 PERCENT, N PRODUCT, YEAR PERIOD 51-100 6 COUNTRY, COMPANY, GROUP 100-300 3 PERSON, DATE, MONEY Total 115 et al., 2003) (Zukerman and Horvitz, 2001)(Sasaki et al., 2004).

216 The Maximum Entropy Principle (Berger et al., 1996) is to nd a model p∗ = argmax p∈C H(p), which means a probability model p(y|x) that maximizes entropy H(p).
