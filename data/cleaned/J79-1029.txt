128:492	American Journal of Compatational Linguir ties Microfiche 29 : 25 COMPUTER GENERATION OF SENTENCES BY SYSTEMIC GRAMMAR Department of Information ScienceUniversity ef Melbourne ParkviZle, Victoria, Australia 3052 ABSTRACT The paper describes a colnnuter mdel oC svstemic grammar.
129:492	a penerative prammar for natural lanpuppe.
130:492	P propram is explained which piven the features OF an fterr, determines the structure of that item accordinp to a svsteric Eramar s~ecifiec as 8ata.
131:492	The vrograr thus deaonstrates the ~rinciples of systemic grammar, a brief sursarv of the vechanicg of which is also included.
132:492	Some imvlications of the proarm for systemic grammar itself are discussed.
133:492	In ~articular, jt is shown that ~revious definitions of the oneration of qtructure-huildfnp rules require modification.
134:492	1.
135:492	?ntroduction This paver describes a computer model of s~stsmic grammar, a prammar for natural languages developed by Halliday and colleagues at Universitv College, London (Halliday, 1961, 197fl).
136:492	Svstemic grammar has recentlv been of interest to comoutational grammarians, arimarily as a result of the imn~essive work .of Winograd.
137:492	( 1972 ), who develoaed a natural lanpua~e understandinp system one component of which was stronglv influenced bv the ~rinciples of systemic grammar.
138:492	More recently, Power (1974) has also investigated how svstemic pramnar can be used to,analvse natural language.
139:492	There have, however, been no attempts to use a computer to investi.gate systemic grammar itself.
140:492	As Friedman (1971) says, in introducing her computer model of transformational grammar, adequate natural lanquage grammars are bound to be so complex that some mechanical aid in investigating their ~ro~erties will be mandatory.
141:492	The aims, then, of develo~ing a computer model of svsteric prammar are threefold.
142:492	First, the model enables the Rrammar to be tested, i.e. it enables contradictions, amhip,uities and incomnletenesses in the grammas to be found.
143:492	Pecondlv, the model enables systemic grammar itself to he imnroved, slnce the consequences of adfustinp parameters and rules can be more easilv followed.
144:492	And, thirdly, the model serves as a demonstration of how systemic grammar 'works ' Earlier descri~tions of systemic grammar were somewhat ihcomplete, but that of Hudson (1971) seems sufficientlv ~recise to encourage the feeling that a computer program could be based upon it.
145:492	The progpam described below generates (in the linguistic sense) natural language sentences, i .e. "assigns structural daacri~tions to sentences" (Chomskv, 1965 1.
146:492	It is not concerned directly with understanding or producing sentences : 2.
147:492	The Mechanics of Svstemic Grammap This section brieflu describes the ~enerative apnaratus of systemic grammar for a fuller discussion, and for linguistic justifications of the procgsses, the reader is referred to Hudson (1971), from which tfrc?
148:492	example gripmrnar and generations given later are taken.
149:492	In systemic grgmmar, 'lstructures are entirely medictable from features: given a11 of an item's features, we can predict exactly what its structure.
150:492	will beff (Hudson.
151:492	pg 87).
152:492	In general t'erms, an jtemTs fearures or classes are those categories to which it belongs irres~ective of the articular sentknce to which the item belongs; an item's functions are those categories to which it belongs as a result of its role in a sentence.
153:492	For example, "mustN has the features MODAL-VERB, FINITE-VERB (among others and in the sentence "Must it grow darker"?
154:492	has the functions !PRE-SUBJECT, ! MOOD-FOCUS (among others (A preceding ! will be used to distinguish functions from features).
155:492	An item's structure is defined by its immediate constituents ' functions and the sequence in which they occur, ~iven all the features that an item has, tKe item's structure may be determined, according to systemic hnammar, by the sequential application of rules of four kinds : (1) feature-realisation rules In the simplest case, these rules are of the form "if item has feature x then its structure will contain function yv y is said to be the realisation pf x. Some rules ape conditional in that the realis~tion only holds if certain other features are or are not present.
156:492	Also, some rules specify that tktb functions must be conflated, i.e. bath functions apply to the same immediate constituent.
157:492	(Further details of these an?
158:492	the following rules ape given later when the program is discussed).
159:492	The application of the feature-realisation rules provides an unordered sot of functions, some of which may be conflated.
160:492	(2) structure-buildinp rules These rules expand and arder th?a set of fwnctions to provide the structure of the item.
161:492	Structure-building rules are themselves of four kinds, which in the simplest case are of the following form: (-a) addition rule3: "if function y (or some combination of functions) is present, then so must be function z (oassibly conflated with other Functions 1".
162:492	(b) conflation rules: "if some condition expressed in terms ~ of functions is satisfied then some function must be conflated with certain other functions".
163:492	(c) sequence rules: "if two functicns y and z are resent then y must be canflated with, orecede or not follow z" .
164:492	(dl compatibility rules: "functiops v and z must not be conf lated" . Addition and conflation rules are onlv applicable if the resultant structure does not conflict with a sequence or comatibility rule.
165:492	Structure-building rules are not extrinsically ordered in any wav.

172:492	These networks are equivalent to rules of the form "if feature x is present then so is one (or all) of a set of features, and conversely".

203:492	The progrdm may then generate the features .of the immediate constituents, using the function-realisation rules and sys terns, and then repeat the above process to detemnine the structure of the immediate constituents.
204:492	The first stage of this is indicated above.
205:492	Of course, this is a particularly simple sentence and structure designed to make it easy to see what the pTogram does, and it should be clear that considerably more complicated grammars can also be handled.
206:492	The generative process i8self will not usually Dnvolve such s traightfarward intermediate s,tructbres or proceed so immediately to the final structure.
207:492	For example, the generation of the structure of a sentence such as.

214:492	However, the program also demonstratks that some pule-descriptions require clarif ieation . For examle, feature-realisation and function-realisation rules are impIicitly unordered (since features and functions are unordered), m, more precisely, the rules are to be considered to apply simultaneously.
215:492	This causes problems with those rules which prevent features being introduced (e.g. rules such as Feat-ure-realisation rule 32, which means "if !SUBLTECT is ~resent the realisation 1s as stated, otherwise the first function, i .e. !ACTOR, must not be introduced by any other feature-realis ation rulew).
216:492	The solution seems to be to reapply the rules, recursively, until a structura is produced which is combatible with all the rules.
217:492	More seriously, the expectatiop that the structure obtained is independent of the order of a~plication of structure-building rules is not realised, at least for the grammar specified.
218:492	Polr example, considering t+re second of the above generations and applying rules SQ 1, SQ 2, ADDN 2, SO 1, ADDN 1 (in that order) to the set of functions obtained by the feature-realisation rules, we generate 3 !PIG-SUBJECT ! COPULAR ! ATTRIBUTE -> -> ! MOOD-FOCUS (= !SU&TEm IATTRIBUANT) (2 !FINITE !MODAL !POST-SUBJECT) !PROCESS This strmctuH cannot satis fv both sequence rules, i .e. the generative process is blocked.
219:492	Clearly, either the grammar requires modification or it does matrer which order the s tructure-bailding rules are applied.
220:492	Hudson (personal communi"cation) has concluded that there, are linguistic grounds for ordering e tructure-building rules, s.o thqt ' abnormalT cases precede 'normal' ones, with the latter only applying if the former had not already been applied.
221:492	Whether it ie possible to do sc consistently requires further experimentation.
222:492	Further possible extensions to the work could involve trying to specify a lexicon so that the generative process ends up with a structure with words as leaves, and one could also attempt to apply the rules in reverse, i.e. To start with a string of lords and produce a etructurdl description.
223:492	Both problems are, of course, very d3fficult ones.

271:492	This deep structure would then be converted into a D-net, a t-nrporary C-net, which is then interpreted lexically (i-.e. lexical items are replakcti by their concepts) E integrated into an overall Cpnet.

280:492	Any nondintr!grative semantic theory is forced to cdaim that these -.shews both refer to the same person, or that they are both ambiguous.

286:492	An adequate way of doing this is to build a C-ncr't  the 1st sentence & then integrate tha continuation^ in,to it, as outlined in my [ IXTEGRATIVE].
287:492	A C-det is a directed, labelled graph with orders3 arcs.
288:492	We can represent a C-net by a list of iteps, 1 for each node.
289:492	Each item then consists of: an index number for the node, a label which indicates its rn~~ning, 6 an ordered list of the indices of the nodss it dominates.
290:492	The particular index numbers asslgn~d to the nodes ar~ Interpretation 6 Integrethoa irrelevant, except thirt B H2* ate reserv-ed to designate the speaker E addressee, respectively.
291:492	Indeed, the index numbers are not part of the C-net.
292:492	They are noriled ooly to nake a linear representation of a C-net, such as is corled for computer manipulation.

308:492	To our present knowledge, Kowever, it appears that ths lexical rules can be constrained to operate only once on a C-net (at all appiicstule places sinulataneously) R this constraint will likely requirp soms ordering between the culeslo.
309:492	My working assumptions are that lsxicsl rules can be oril~red so that c4ach can apply only once (everywhere) & that the duplicate-reduction rule operates last.

321:492	When integrated, the "LN disappsazs because the' Lpoint is either identified with a poi-nt in the C-net, or it refers to some extra-cognit iye structure.
322:492	This "I," derives from definite exprsssiocs such as fb& th&Sr kg, Ec.
323:492	This b-net is intsgrated in the only possible way, namely with (i.e. she = Hary) (i.2.
324:492	it = that Susie is coning) (i.e. say 3 tall) Aith the duplicates removed, the only addition is 24 Soft (25) 12.

330:492	There are several possible stratogles for integrating a Dnet, o, which results from a cdnt'inaation sentence into the C-net, C, resulting from accretions from all the previous sentences.
331:492	Basically, some of the nodes in D are found in C, & the D-net is traced -out in C. In general, the D-net wifl contain some nodes not in.
332:492	C, & certain types13 of the codas Interpretation 8 ~nteqration in D may be missing in the C-net.
333:492	The 1st D nodes to be sought in C should hav~ a high information content to make this procedure more effective 5 for this reason wj have chosen to start with the highest nodes in D: those nodes in D which are not dominathd by any other nodes.
334:492	In the examplr above, nodes 29, 28, 30, 24, E 31 are all without domination, but 29, 28, & 31 are all directly predicating on points, which leaves 24 & 30 as highest*.
335:492	Nodes with thss~ labels, Soft (p) & Pcet (g), are sought in C; Ar.
336:492	equivalent for 24 is not found, hut 30 matches 21.
337:492	Then, followinq domination.
338:492	lines downward from 30 & 21, everything matches sxcept for 5 B (6,15) . 8 (x, v) is one of the nodss which can be skipped in intsgrationl4.
339:492	If the highest nodes do not yield an intsgration, the next higbsf are usqd until intsgration is possible.
340:492	Integration is accornpllsh$d by a set of nod?
341:492	equivalences such as explained ahove.
342:492	Once these ar?
343:492	effected, the duplicate reduction ~ule will rmove all th?

346:492	No English speaker can mistake that its ~efe rent is Hary; in reality this 889 is not ambiguous.
