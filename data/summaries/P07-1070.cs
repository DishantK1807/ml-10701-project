In recent years, graph-based ranking algorithms have been successfully used for document summarization (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005; ErKan and Radev, 2004) and keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, lch, wup, path, res, lin and jcn (Pedersen et al., 2004).

More linguistic knowledge (such as syntactic features) has been explored by Hulth (2003).

Such measures as mutual information (Turney 2001), latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998), log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) have been proposed to evaluate word semantic similarity based on the co-occurrence information on a large corpus.

Among these different scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) has been shown to agree with human judgment most (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000), etc.

WordRank is proposed in Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) to make use of only the co-occurrence relationships between words to rank words, which outperforms traditional keyword extraction methods.
W04-3252
Most recently, graph-based ranking methods, including TextRank ((Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005) and LexPageRank (ErKan and Radev, 2004) have been proposed for document summarization.

We used the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) toolkit (i.e.ROUGEeval-1.4.2 in this study) for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation.

SentenceRank is proposed in Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) to make use of only the sentence-tosentence relationships to rank sentences, which outperforms most popular summarization methods.

More recently, Mihalcea and Tarau (2004) propose the TextRank model to rank keywords based on the co-occurrence links between words.
