In general, rules are applied to revise summaries produced by a summarisation system (Mani et al., 1999; Otterbacher et al., 2002).
P99-1072 W02-0404
As already mentioned, information from centering theory was used in text generation to select the most coherent text from several candidates (Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002).
W00-1411
We intend to extend our experiments and test whether a combination of centering theory’s principles, as used in (Kibble and Power, 2000), can lead to better results.
W00-1411
This suggests that for some of the texts the continuity principle is too weak to influence the quality of a summary, and a combination of the continuity principle with the other principles from centering theory, as already used for text generation in (Kibble and Power, 2000), could lead to better summaries.
W00-1411
This is true, but these summaries can be shortened by using aggregation rules like the ones proposed in (Otterbacher et al., 2002), where two sentences referring to the same entity are merged into one.

to ensure local cohesion In the previous section we already mentioned that we are trying to improve the automatic summaries by using the continuity principle defined in Centering Theory (CT) (Grosz et al., 1995).

In order to determine the head of noun phrases we use the FDG tagger (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997) which also provides partial dependency relations between the constituents of a sentence.
A97-1011
The coherence and cohesion were quantified through direct evaluation using a methodology similar to the one proposed in (Minel et al., 1997).
W97-0705
informativeness In order to assess whether information is lost when the context-based method is used to enhance the sentence selection, we used a content-based evaluation metric (Donaway et al., 2000).
W00-0408
Their description can be found in (Kibble and Power, 2000).
W00-1411
Using an approach similar to (Minel et al., 1997) we consider that a discourse rupture occurs when a sentence seems completely isolated from the rest of the text.
W97-0705
The score of a sentence is the sum of words’ scores from that sentence (Zechner, 1996) Indicator phrase method: Paice (1981) noticed that in scientific papers it is possible to identify phrases such as in this paper, we present, in conclusion, which are usually meta-discourse markers.
C96-2166
For informativeness we computed the similarity between the automatic summary and the document as proposed in (Donaway et al., 2000).
