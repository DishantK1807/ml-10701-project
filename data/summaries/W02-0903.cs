These types of models have been used for hyponym discovery (Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998), meronym discovery (Berland and Charniak, 1999), and hierarchy building (Caraballo, 1999).

In the last decade or so research on lexical semantics has focused more on sub-problems like word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), and vocabulary construction for information extraction (Riloff, 1996).

Collocations have been widely used for tasks such as word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Yarowsky, 1995), information extraction (IE) (Riloff, 1996), and named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999).

A possible solution to his problem might be the use of more general morphological rules like those used in part-of-speech tagging models (e.g., 1 2 3 4 530 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 level error RAND BASE Boost_S NNtfidf NB Boost_M Figure 6: Comparison of all models for a129 a48a51a95a66a97a98a97a180a222 .
