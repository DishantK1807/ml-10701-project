Diacritization The performance of many natural language processing tasks, such as shallow parsing (Zhang et al., 2002) and named entity recognition (Florian et al., 2004), has been shown to depend on integrating many sources of information.
N04-1001
In (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004), diacritics in conversational Arabic are restored by combining morphological and contextual information with an acoustic signal.

We report in section 7 a comparative study between our approach and the most competitive diacritic restoration method that uses finite state machine algorithm (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).

As an example, the Arabic white-space delimited word D˚K.A fl contains a verb K.A fl, a third-person feminine singular subject-marker H (she), and a pronoun suffix º (them); it is also a complete sentence meaning “she met them.” To separate the Arabic white-space delimited words into segments, we use a segmentation model similar to the one presented by (Lee et al., 2003).

Section 7 reports a comparison of our approach to the finite state machine modeling technique that showed promissing results in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).

579 The MaxEnt algorithm associates a set of weights (αij)i=1...nj=1...m with the features, which are estimated during the training phase to maximize the likelihood of the data (Berger et al., 1996).
J96-1002
Y. Gal in (Gal, 2002) used a HMM-based diacritization approach.
W02-0504
We use a statistical POS tagging system built on Arabic Treebank data with MaxEnt framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
W96-0213
To estimate the optimal αj values, we train our MaxEnt model using the sequential conditional generalized iterative scaling (SCGIS) technique (Goodman, 2002).
P02-1002
We propose in the following an extension to the aforementioned FST model, where we jointly determines not only diacritics but segmentation into affixes as described in (Lee et al., 2003).
P03-1051
Most recently, a weighted finite state machine based algorithm is proposed (Nelken and Shieber, 2005).
W05-0711
The system they described in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005) uses lexical, segment-based, and morphological information.
W05-0711
Our appoach is based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt henceforth) technique (Berger et al., 1996).
J96-1002
Using the finite state machine modeling technique, we obtain similar results to those reported in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005): a WER of 23% and a DER of 15%.

Segments are often the subject of analysis when processing Arabic (Zitouni et al., 2005).
W05-0709 W05-0709
to other approaches As stated in section 3, the most recent and advanced approach to diacritic restoration is the one presented in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005): they showed a DER of 12.79% and a WER of 23.61% on Arabic Treebank corpus using finite state transducers (FST) with a Katz language modeling (LM) as described in (Chen and Goodman, 1999).
W05-0711
state-of-the-art system evaluated on Arabic Treebank Part 2: in (Nelken and Shieber, 2005) a DER of 12.79% and a WER of 23.61% are reported.
