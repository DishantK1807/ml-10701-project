A new data-oriented version of MORPA (\[Heemskerk, 1993\]) assigns a priority ordering to the set of morphological decomSin a different set of experiments, we successfully applied the IBL approach and two other data-oriented algorithms, analogical modeling and backprop, to the stress assignment problem (see \[Gillis et al., 1992\], \[Daelemans et al., 1993\], but we have not yet tried to combine the two tasks.
