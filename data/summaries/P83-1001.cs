And recent work of Shieber (1983b) shows that there are interesting avenues in natural language parsing to be explored using deterministic context-free parsers that do work in linear time.

It does not affect weak generative capacity; Shieber (1983a) proves that every CFL has an ECPO grammar.

There are also some potentially interesting implications for parsing, studied by Shieber (1983a), who shows that a modified Earley algorithm can be used to parse ID/LP format gr----mrs directlyÂ° One putative challenge to any claim that CFPSG's can be strongly adequate descriptions for human languages comes from Dutch and has been discussed recently by Bresnan, Kaplan, Peters, and Zaenen (1982).

Slocum 1983, who reports an all-paths, bottom-up parser actually running in linear time using a CFPSG with 400 rules and i0,000 lexical entries).
