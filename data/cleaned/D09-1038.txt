Abstract 
Binarization of Synchronous Context Free 
Grammars (SCFG) is essential for achieving 
polynomial time complexity of decoding for 
SCFG parsing based machine translation sys-
tems. In this paper, we first investigate the 
excess edge competition issue caused by a left-
heavy binary SCFG derived with the method 
of Zhang et al. (2006). Then we propose a new 
binarization method to mitigate the problem 
by exploring other alternative equivalent bi-
nary SCFGs. We present an algorithm that ite-
ratively improves the resulting binary SCFG, 
and empirically show that our method can im-
prove a string-to-tree statistical machine trans-
lations system based on the synchronous bina-
rization method in Zhang et al. (2006) on the 
NIST machine translation evaluation tasks. 
1 Introduction

Recently Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) 
systems based on Synchronous Context Free 
Grammar (SCFG) have been extensively investi-
gated (Chiang, 2005; Galley et al., 2004; Galley 
et al., 2006) and have achieved state-of-the-art 
performance. In these systems, machine transla-
tion decoding is cast as a synchronous parsing 
task. Because general SCFG parsing is an NP-
hard problem (Satta and Peserico, 2005), practic-
al SMT decoders based on SCFG parsing re-
quires an equivalent binary SCFG that is directly 
learned from training data to achieve polynomial 
time complexity using the CKY algorithm (Ka-
sami, 1965; Younger, 1967) borrowed from CFG 
parsing techniques. Zhang et al. (2006) proposed 
synchronous binarization, a principled method to 
binarize an SCFG in such a way that both the 
source-side and target-side virtual non-terminals 
have contiguous spans. This property of syn-
chronous binarization guarantees the polynomial 
time complexity of SCFG parsers even when an 
n-gram language model is integrated, which has 
been proved to be one of the keys to the success 
of a string-to-tree syntax-based SMT system. 
However, as shown by Chiang (2007), SCFG-
based decoding with an integrated n-gram lan-
guage model still has a time complexity of  
ùõ© (ùëö 3 ùëá  4(ùëõ ‚àí 1)), where m is the source sentence 
length, and  ùëá   is the vocabulary size of the lan-
guage model. Although it is not exponential in 
theory, the actual complexity can still be very 
high in practice. Here is an example extracted 
from real data. Given the following SCFG rule: 
     VP   ‚Üí   VB  NP  ‰ºö   JJR  , 
               VB  NP  will be  JJR 
we can obtain a set of equivalent binary rules 
using the synchronous binarization method 
(Zhang et al., 2006)  as follows: 
        VP ‚Üí V1  JJR ,   V1  JJR 
            V1 ‚Üí VB  V2 ,   VB  V2 
        V2 ‚Üí NP ‰ºö  ,   NP  will be 
This binarization is shown with the solid lines as 
binarization (a) in Figure 1. We can see that bi-
narization (a) requires that ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù should be 
reduced at first. Data analysis shows that ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù 
is a frequent pattern in the training corpus, and 
there are 874 binary rules of which the source 
language sides are ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù. Consequently these 
binary rules generate a large number of compet-
ing edges in the chart when ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù is matched 
in decoding. To reduce the number of edges pro-
362
posed in decoding, hypothesis re-combination is 
used to combine the equivalent edges in terms of 
dynamic programming. Generally, two edges can 
be re-combined if they satisfy the following two 
constraints:  1) the LHS (left-hand side) non-
terminals are identical and the sub-alignments 
are the same (Zhang et al., 2006); and 2) the 
boundary words 1  on both sides of the partial 
translations are equal between the two edges 
(Chiang, 2007). However, as shown in Figure 2, 
the decoder still generates 801 edges after the 
hypothesis re-combination. As a result, aggres-
sive pruning with beam search has to be em-
ployed to reduce the search space to make the 
decoding practical. Usually in beam search only 
a very small number of edges are kept in the 
beam of each chart cell (e.g. less than 100). 
These edges have to compete with each other to 
survive from the pruning. Obviously, more com-
peting edges proposed during decoding can lead 
to a higher risk of making search errors.

Figure 2: Edge competitions caused by different 
binarizations 
 
The edge competition problem for SMT de-
coding is not addressed in previous work (Zhang 
et al., 2006; Huang, 2007) in which each SCFG 
rule is binarized in a fixed way. Actually the re-
sults of synchronous binarization may not be the 
only solution. As illustrated in Figure 1, the rule 
                                                 
1 For
the case of n-gram language model integration, 
2 √ó (ùëõ ‚àí 1) boundary words needs to be examined. 
can also be binarized as binarization (b) which is 
shown with the dashed lines.  
We think that this problem can be alleviated 
by choosing better binarizations for SMT decod-
ers, since there is generally more than one bina-
rization for a SCFG rule. In our investigation, 
about 96% rules that need to be binarized have 
more than one binarization under the contiguous 
constraint. As shown in binarization (b) (Figure 
1), ‚Äú‰ºö  JJR‚Äù is reduced first. In the decoder, the 
number of binary rules with the source-side ‚Äú‰ºö  
JJR‚Äù is 62, and the corresponding number of 
edges is 57 (Figure 2). The two numbers are both 
much smaller than those of ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù in (a). This 
is an informative clue that the binarization (b) 
could be better than the binarization (a) based on 
the following: the probability of pruning the rule 
in (a) is higher than that in (b) as the rule in (b) 
has fewer competitors and has more chances to 
survive during pruning. 
In this paper we propose a novel binarization 
method, aiming to find better binarizations to 
improve an SCFG-based machine translation 
system. We formulate the binarization optimiza-
tion as a cost reduction process, where the cost is 
defined as the number of rules sharing a common 
source-side derivation in an SCFG. We present 
an algorithm, iterative cost reduction algorithm, 
to obtain better binarization for the SCFG learnt 
automatically from the training corpus. It can 
work with an efficient CKY-style binarizer to 
search for the lowest-cost binarization. We apply 
our method into a state-of-the-art string-to-tree 
SMT system. The experimental results show that 
our method outperforms the synchronous binari-
zation method (Zhang et al., 2006) with over 0.8 
BLEU scores on both NIST 2005 and NIST 2008 
Chinese-to-English evaluation data sets. 
2 Related
Work 
The problem of binarization originates from the 
parsing problem in which several binarization 
methods are studied such as left/right binariza-
tion (Charniak et al., 1998; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 
2004) and head binarization (Charniak et al., 
2006). Generally, the pruning issue in SMT de-
coding is unnecessary for the parsing problem, 
and the accuracy of parsing does not rely on the 
binarization method heavily. Thus, many efforts 
on the binarization in parsing are made for the 
efficiency improvement instead of the accuracy 
improvement (Song et al., 2008). 
Binarization is also an important topic in the 
research of syntax-based SMT. A synchronous 
363
binarization method is proposed in (Zhang et al., 
2006) whose basic idea is to build a left-heavy 
binary synchronous tree (Shapiro and Stephens, 
1991) with a left-to-right shift-reduce algorithm. 
Target-side binarization is another binarization 
method which is proposed by Huang (2007). It 
works in a left-to-right way on the target lan-
guage side. Although this method is compara-
tively easy to be implemented, it just achieves 
the same performance as the synchronous binari-
zation method (Zhang et al., 2006) for syntax-
based SMT systems. In addition, it cannot be 
easily integrated into the decoding of some syn-
tax-based models (Galley et al., 2004; Marcu et 
al., 2006), because it does not guarantee conti-
guous spans on the source language side. 
3 Synchronous
Binarization Optimiza-
tion by Cost Reduction 
As discussed in Section 1, binarizing an SCFG in 
a fixed (left-heavy) way (Zhang et al., 2006) may 
lead to a large number of competing edges and 
consequently high risk of making search errors. 
Fortunately, in most cases a binarizable SCFG 
can be binarized in different ways, which pro-
vides us with an opportunity to find a better solu-
tion than the default left-heavy binarization. An 
ideal solution to this problem could be that we 
define an exact edge competition estimation 
function and choose the best binary SCFG based 
on it. However, even for the rules with a com-
mon source-side, generally it is difficult to esti-
mate the exact number of competing edges in the 
dynamic SCFG parsing process for machine 
translation, because in order to integrate an n-
gram language model, the actual number of 
edges not only depends on SCFG rules, but also 
depends on language model states which are spe-
cific to input sentences. Instead, we have to em-
ploy certain kinds of approximation of it. First 
we will introduce some notations frequently used 
in later discussions. 
3.1 Notations

We use ùê∫ = {ùëÖ ùëñ ‚à∂  ùëã ùëñ ‚Üí ùõº ùëñ ,ùõΩ ùëñ }  to denote an 
SCFG, where ùëÖ ùëñ  is the ùëñ ùë° ‚Ñé  rule in ùê∫ ; ùëã ùëñ  is the 
LHS (left hand side) non-terminal of ùëÖ ùëñ ; ùõº ùëñ  and 
ùõΩ ùëñ  are the source-side and target-side RHS (right 
hand side) derivations of ùëÖ ùëñ  respectively. We use 
‚Ñ¨  ùê∫   to denote the set of equivalent binary 
SCFG of ùê∫ . The goal of SCFG binarization is to 
find an appropriate binary SCFG ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ‚Ñ¨  ùê∫  . For 
ùëÖ ùëñ , ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ  = {ùë£ ùëñ ùëó } ‚äÜ ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ‚Ñ¨  ùê∫   is the set of 
equivalent binary rules based on ùëÖ ùëñ , where ùë£ ùëñ ùëó  is 
the ùëó ùë° ‚Ñé  binary rule in ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ  . Figure 3 illustrates 
the meanings of these notations with a sample 
grammar.

Figure 3: Binarization on a sample grammar 
 
The function ùêø (‚àô ) is defined to map a result-
ing binary rule ùë£ ùëñ ùëó ùúñ ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  to the sub-sequence in ùõº ùëñ  
derived from ùë£ ùëñ ùëó . For example, as shown in Fig-
ure 3, the binary rule ùë£ 13 covers the source sub-
sequence ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù in ùëÖ 1 , so ùêø  ùë£ 13 = "NP ‰ºö ". 
Similarly, ùêø  ùë£ 12 = "VB NP ‰ºö ".  
The function ùêø (‚àô ) is used to group the rules in 
ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  with a common right-hand side derivation for 
source language. Given a binary rule ùë£ ‚àà ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ , we 
can put it into a bucket in which all the binary 
rules have the same source sub-sequence ùêø (ùë£ ). 
For example (Figure 3), as ùêø  ùë£ 12 = "VB NP ‰ºö ", 
ùë£ 12 is put into the bucket indexed by ‚ÄúVB NP ‰ºö ‚Äù. 
And ùë£ 13  and ùë£ 22  are put into the same bucket, 
since they have the same source sub-sequence 
‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù. Obviously, ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  can be divided into a set 
of mutual exclusive rule buckets by ùêø (‚àô ). 
In this paper, we use ùëÜ (ùêø (ùë£ ),ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) to denote the 
bucket for the binary rules having the source sub-
sequence ùêø (ùë£ ). For example, ùëÜ ("ùëÅ ùëÉ  ‰ºö ",ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) de-
notes the bucket for the binary rules having the 
source-side ‚ÄúNP ‰ºö ‚Äù. For simplicity, we also use 
ùëÜ (ùë£ , ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) to denote ùëÜ  ùêø  ùë£  ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  .  
3.2 Cost
Reduction for SCFG Binarization 
Given a binary SCFG ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ , it can be easily noticed 
that if a rule ùë£  in  the bucket ùëÜ (ùë£ , ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) can be ap-
plied to generate one or more new edges in 
SCFG parsing, any other rules in this bucket can 
also be applied because all of them can be re-
duced from the same underlying derivation ùêø (ùë£ ). 
364
Each application of other rules in the bucket 
ùëÜ (ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) can generate competing edges with the 
one based on ùë£ . Intuitively, the size of bucket 
can be used to approximately indicate the actual 
number of competing edges on average, and re-
ducing the size of bucket could help reduce the 
edges generated in a parsing chart by applying 
the rules in the bucket. Therefore, if we can find 
a method to greedily reduce the size of each 
bucket ùëÜ (ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ), we can reduce the overall ex-
pected edge competitions when parsing with ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ . 
However, it can be easily proved that the 
numbers of binary rules in any ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ‚Ñ¨  ùê∫   are 
same, which implies that we cannot reduce the 
sizes of all buckets at the same time ‚Äì removing 
a rule from one bucket means adding it to anoth-
er. Allowing for this fact, the excess edge com-
petition example shown in Section 1 is essential-
ly caused by the uneven distribution of rules 
among different buckets ùëÜ  ‚àô  . Accordingly, our 
optimization objective should be a more even 
distribution of rules among buckets. 
In the following, we formally define a metric 
to model the evenness of rule distribution over 
buckets. Given a binary SCFG ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  and a binary 
SCFG rule ùë£ ‚àà ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ , ùëÑ (ùë£ ) is defined as the cost 
function that maps ùë£  to the size of the bucket  
ùëÜ  ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  : 
ùëÑ  ùë£  =  ùëÜ  ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤    (1) 
Obviously, all the binary rules in ùëÜ  ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤   share a 
common cost value  ùëÜ  ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤   . For example (Fig-
ure 3), both ùë£ 13  and ùë£ 22  are put into the same 
bucket ùëÜ  "ùëÅ ùëÉ  ‰ºö ",ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  , so ùëÑ  ùë£ 13 = ùëÑ  ùë£ 22 = 2. 
The cost of the SCFG ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  is computed by 
summing up all the costs of SCFG rules in it: 
ùëÑ  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  =  ùëÑ (ùë£ )
ùë£ ‚àà ùê∫ ‚Ä≤
 (2) 
Back to our task, we are to find an equivalent 
binary SCFG ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  of ùê∫  with the lowest cost in 
terms of the cost function ùëÑ (. ) given in Equation 
(2): 
ùê∫ ‚àó = argminùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ‚Ñ¨  ùê∫  ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) (3) 
Next we will show how ùê∫ ‚àó  is related to the 
evenness of rule distribution among different 
buckets. Let ùëÜ  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  = {ùëÜ 1,‚Ä¶ ,ùëÜ ùëÄ }  be the set of 
rule buckets containing rules in ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ , then the value 
of ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) can also be written as: 
ùëÑ  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  =   ùëÜ ùëñ  2
1‚â§ ùëñ ‚â§ ùëÄ
 (4) 
Assume ùëå ùëñ =  ùëÜ ùëñ   is an empirical distribution of a 
discrete random variable ùëå , then the square devi-
ation of the empirical distribution is: 
ùúé 2 = 1ùëÄ  ( ùëÜ ùëñ  ‚àí ùëå )2
ùëñ
 (5) 
Noticing that Œ£  ùëÜ ùëñ  =  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤   and ùëå =  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  /ùëÄ , Equ-
ation (5) can be written as: 
ùúé 2 = 1ùëÄ  ùëÑ  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  ‚àí  ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  
2
ùëÄ   (6) 
Since both ùëÄ  and |ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ | are constants, minimizing 
the cost function ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) is equivalent to minimiz-
ing the square deviation of the distribution of 
rules among different buckets. A binary SCFG 
with the lower cost indicates the rules are more 
evenly distributed in terms of derivation patterns 
on the source language side. 
3.3 Static
Cost Reduction 
Before moving on discussing the algorithm 
which can optimize Equation (3) based on rule 
costs specified in Equation (1), we first present 
an algorithm to find the optimal solution to Eq-
uation (3) if we have known the cost setting of 
ùê∫ ‚àó  and can use the costs as static values during 
binarization. Using this simplification, the prob-
lem of finding the binary SCFG  ùê∫ ‚àó  with minim-
al costs can be reduced to find the optimal bina-
rization ‚Ñ¨ ‚àó (ùëÖ ùëñ ) for each rule ùëÖ ùëñ  in ùê∫ . 
To obtain ‚Ñ¨ ‚àó (ùëÖ ùëñ ), we can employ a CKY-
style binarization algorithm which builds a com-
pact binarization forest for the rule ùëÖ ùëñ  in bottom-
up direction. The algorithm combines two adja-
cent spans of ùõº ùëñ  each time, in which two spans 
can be combined if and only if they observe the 
BTG constraints ‚àí their translations are either 
sequentially or reversely adjacent in ùõΩ ùëñ , the tar-
get-side derivation of ùëÖ ùëñ . The key idea of this 
algorithm is that we only use the binarization tree 
with the lowest cost of each span for later com-
bination, which can avoid enumerating all the 
possible binarization trees of ùëÖ ùëñ  using dynamic 
programming. 
Let ùõº ùëùùëû  be the sub-sequence spanning from p 
to q on the source-side, ùë£ [ùëù ,ùëû ] be optimal bina-
rization tree spanning ùõº ùëùùëû , ùëÑ ùë£ [ùëù ,ùëû ] be the cost of 
ùë£ [ùëù , ùëû ], and ùëÑ ùëü [ùëù ,ùëû ] be the cost of any binary 
rules whose source-side is ùõº ùëùùëû , then the cost of 
optimal binarization tree spanning ùõº ùëùùëû  can be 
computed as: 
ùëÑ ùë£ [ùëù , ùëû ] = minùëù ‚â§ ùëò ‚â§ ùëû ‚àí 1(ùëÑ ùëü [ùëù , ùëû ] + ùëÑ ùë£ [ùëù ,ùëò ] + ùëÑ ùë£ [ùëò + 1,ùëû ])

Table 1: Sub-sequences and corresponding costs 
Figure 4 shows an example of the compact 
forest the algorithm builds, where the solid lines 
indicate the optimal binarization of the rule, 
while other alternatives pruned by dynamic pro-
gramming are shown in dashed lines. The costs 
for binarization trees are computed based on the 
cost table given in Table 1. 
The time complexity of the CKY-based bina-
rization algorithm is Œò (n3), which is higher than 
that of the linear binarization such as the syn-
chronous binarization (Zhang et al., 2006). But it 
is still efficient enough in practice, as there are 
generally only a few tokens (n < 5) on the 
source-sides of SCFG rules. In our experiments, 
the linear binarization method is just 2 times 
faster than the CKY-based binarization. 
3.4 Iterative
Cost Reduction 
However, ùëÑ (‚àô ) cannot be easily predetermined in 
a static way as is assumed in Section 3.3 because 
it depends on ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  and should be updated whenever 
a rule in ùê∫  is binarized differently. In our work 
this problem is solved using the iterative cost 
reduction algorithm, in which the update of ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  
and the cost function ùëÑ (‚àô ) are coupled together.

16: return ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  
In the iterative cost reduction algorithm, we 
first obtain an initial binary SCFG ùê∫ 0 using the 
synchronous binarization method proposed in 
(Zhang et al., 2006). Then ùê∫ 0 is assigned to an 
iterative variable ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ . The cost of each binary rule 
in ùê∫ 0 is computed based on ùê∫ 0 according to Equ-
ation (1) (lines 3-4 in the algorithm). 
After initialization, ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  is updated by iteratively 
finding better binarization for each rule in ùê∫ . The 
basic idea is: for each ùëÖ ùëñ  in ùê∫ , we remove the 
current binarization result for ùëÖ ùëñ  from ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  (line 7), 
while the cost function ùëÑ (‚àô )  is updated accor-
dingly since the removal of binary rule ùë£ ‚àà  
‚Ñ¨ (ùëÖ ùëñ ) results in the reduction of the size of the 
corresponding bucket ùëÜ  ùë£ , ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  . Lines 8-10 im-
366
plement the cost reduction of each binary rule in 
the bucket ùëÜ  ùë£ ,ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  . 
Next, we find the lowest cost binarization for 
ùëÖ ùëñ  based on the updated cost function ùëÑ (‚àô ) with 
the CKY-based binarization algorithm presented 
in Section 3.3 (line 11).  
At last, the new binarization for ùëÖ ùëñ  is added 
back to ùê∫ ‚Ä≤  and ùëÑ (‚àô ) is re-updated to synchronize 
with this change (lines 12-15). Figure 5 illu-
strates the differences between the static cost 
reduction and the iterative cost reduction.

Figure 5: Comparison between the static cost 
reduction and the iterative cost reduction 
 
The algorithm stops when ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) does not de-
crease any more. Next we will show that ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ )  
is guaranteed not to increase in the iterative 
process. 
For any ‚Ñ¨ (ùëÖ ùëñ ) on ùëÖ ùëñ , we have 
               ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ] ‚à™  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    
        = 2 √ó ùëÑ  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ   +  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ   + ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ]  
As both  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    and ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ]  are constants with 
respect to ùëÑ (‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ  ), ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ] ‚à™  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    is a li-
near function of ùëÑ (‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ  ), and the correspond-
ing slope is positive. Thus ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ] ‚à™  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    
reaches the lowest value only when ùëÑ (‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ  ) 
reaches the lowest value. So ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ] ‚à™  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    
achieves the lowest cost when we replace the 
current binarization with the new binarization  
‚Ñ¨ ‚àó (ùëÖ ùëñ )  (line 12). Therefore ùëÑ  ùê∫ [‚àí ùëÖ ùëñ ] ‚à™  ‚Ñ¨  ùëÖ ùëñ    
does not increase in the processing on each ùëÖ ùëñ  
(lines 7-15), and ùëÑ (ùê∫ ‚Ä≤ ) will finally converge to a 
local minimum when the algorithm stops. 
4 Experiments

The experiments are conducted on Chinese-to-
English translation in a state-of-the-art string-to-
tree SMT system. All the results are reported in 
terms of case-insensitive BLEU4(%). 
4.1 Experimental
Setup 
Our bilingual training corpus consists of about 
350K bilingual sentences (9M Chinese words + 
10M English words)2. Giza++ is employed to 
perform word alignment on the bilingual sen-
tences. The parse trees on the English side are 
generated using the Berkeley Parser3. A 5-gram 
language model is trained on the English part of 
LDC bilingual training data and the Xinhua part 
of Gigaword corpus. Our development data set 
comes from NIST2003 evaluation data in which 
the sentences of more than 20 words are ex-
cluded to speed up the Minimum Error Rate 
Training (MERT). The test data sets are the 
NIST evaluation sets of 2005 and 2008. 
Our string-to-tree SMT system is built based 
on the work of (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 
2006), where both the minimal GHKM and 
SPMT rules are extracted from the training cor-
pus, and the composed rules are generated by 
combining two or three minimal GHKM and 
SPMT rules. Before the rule extraction, we also 
binarize the parse trees on the English side using 
Wang et al. (2007) ‚Äûs method to increase the 
coverage of GHKM and SPMT rules. There are 
totally 4.26M rules after the low frequency rules 
are filtered out. The pruning strategy is similar to 
the cube pruning described in (Chiang, 2007). To 
achieve acceptable translation speed, the beam 
size is set to 50 by default. The baseline system 
is based on the synchronous binarization (Zhang 
et al., 2006).  
4.2 Binarization
Schemes 
Besides the baseline (Zhang et al., 2006) and 
iterative cost reduction binarization methods, we 
also perform right-heavy and random synchron-
ous binarizations for comparison. In this paper, 
the random synchronous binarization is obtained 
by: 1) performing the CKY binarization to build 
the binarization forest for an SCFG rule; then 2) 
performing a top-down traversal of the forest. In 
the traversal, we randomly pick a feasible binari-
zation for each span, and then go on the traversal 
in the two branches of the picked binarization. 
Table 2 shows the costs of resulting binary 
SCFGs generated using different binarization 
methods. The costs of the baseline (left-heavy)

and right-heavy binarization are similar, while 
the cost of the random synchronous binarization 
is lower than that of the baseline method4. As 
expected, the iterative cost reduction method ob-
tains the lowest cost, which is much lower than 
that of the other three methods.

4.3 Evaluation
of Translations 
Table 3 shows the performance of SMT systems 
based on different binarization methods. The 
iterative cost reduction binarization method 
achieves the best performance on the test sets as 
well as the development set. Compared with the 
baseline method, it obtains gains of 0.82 and 
0.84 BLEU scores on NIST05 and NIST08 test 
sets respectively. Using the statistical signific-
ance test described by Koehn (2004), the im-
provements are significant  (p < 0.05).

The baseline method and the right-heavy bina-
rization method achieve similar performance, 
while the random synchronous binarization me-
thod performs slightly better than the baseline 
method, which agrees with the fact of the cost 
reduction shown in Table 2. A possible reason 
that the random synchronous binarization me-
thod can outperform the baseline method lies in 
that compared with binarizing SCFG in a fixed 
way, the random synchronous binarization tends 
to give a more even distribution of rules among 
buckets, which alleviates the problem of edge 
competition. However, since the high-frequency 
source sub-sequences still have high probabilities 
to be generated in the binarization and lead to the

small improvement. 
4.4 Translation
Accuracy vs. Cost of Binary 
SCFG 
We also study the impacts of cost reduction on 
translation accuracy over iterations in iterative 
cost reduction. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the 
results on NIST05 and NIST08 test sets. We can 
see that the cost of the resulting binary SCFG 
drops greatly as the iteration count increases, 
especially in the first iteration, and the BLEU 
scores increase as the cost decreases.

Figure 7: Cost of binary SCFG vs. BLEU4 (NIST08) 
4.5 Impact
of Beam Size 
In this section, we study the impacts of beam 
sizes on translation accuracy as well as compet-
ing edges. To explicitly investigate the issue un-
der large beam sizes, we use a subset of NIST05 
and NIST08 test sets for test, which has 50 Chi-
nese sentences of no longer than 10 words. 
Figure 8 shows that the iterative cost reduction 
method is consistently better than the baseline 
method under various beam settings. Besides the 
experiment on the test set of short sentences, we 
also conduct the experiment on NIST05 test set. 
To achieve acceptable decoding speed, we range 
the beam size from 10 to 70. As shown in Figure 
9, the iterative cost reduction method also out-
performs the baseline method under various 
beam settings on the large test set. 
Though enlarging beam size can reduce the 
search errors and improve the system perfor-
mance, the decoding speed of string-to-tree SMT 
drops dramatically when we enlarge the beam 
size. The problem is more serious when long

sentences are translated. For example, when the 
beam size is set to a larger number (e.g. 200), our 
decoder takes nearly one hour to translate a sen-
tence whose length is about 20 on a 3GHz CPU. 
Decoding on the entire NIST05 and NIST08 test 
sets with large beam sizes is impractical. 
 
Figure 8: BLEU4 against beam size (small test set) 
 
 
Figure 9: BLEU4 against beam size (NIST05) 
 
Figure 10 compares the baseline method and 
the iterative cost reduction method in terms of 
translation accuracy against the number of edges 
proposed during decoding. Actually, the number 
of edges proposed during decoding can be re-
garded as a measure of the size of search space. 
We can see that the iterative cost reduction me-
thod outperforms the baseline method under var-
ious search effort.  
 
Figure 10: BLEU4 against competing edges  
 
The experimental results of this section show 
that compared with the baseline method, the iter-
ative cost reduction method can lead to much 
fewer edges (about 25% reduction) as well as the 
higher BLEU scores under various beam settings. 
4.6 Edge
Competition vs. Cost of Binary 
SCFG 
In this section, we study the impacts of cost re-
duction on the edge competition in the chart cells 
of our CKY-based decoder. Two metrics are 
used to evaluate the degree of edge competition. 
They are the variance and the mean of the num-
ber of competing edges in the chart cells, where 
high variance means that in some chart cells the 
rules have high risk to be pruned due to the large 
number of competing edges. The same situation 
holds for the mean as well. Both of the two me-
trics are calculated on NIST05 test set, varying 
with the span length of chart cell. 
Figure 11 shows the cost of resulting binary 
SCFG and the variance of competing edges 
against iteration count in iterative cost reduction. 
We can see that both the cost and the variance 
reduce greatly as the iteration count increases. 
Figure 12 shows the case for mean, where the 
reduction of cost also leads to the reduction of 
the mean value. The results shown in Figure 11 
and Figure 12 indicate that the cost reduction is 
helpful to reduce edge competition in the chart 
cells.  
 
Figure 11: Cost of binary SCFG vs. variance of 
competing edge number (NIST05) 
 
 
Figure 12: Cost of binary SCFG vs. mean of 
competing edge number (NIST05) 
 
We also perform decoding without pruning 
(i.e. beam size = ‚àû ) on a very small set which 
has 20 sentences of no longer than 7 words. In 
this experiment, the baseline system and our iter-
ative cost reduction based system propose 
14,454M and 10,846M competing edges respec-
tively. These numbers can be seen as the real 
numbers of the edges proposed during decoding 
instead of an approximate number observed in 
the pruned search space. It suggests that our me-
thod can reduce the number of the edges in real 
search space effectively. A possible reason to

this result is that the cost reduction based binari-
zation could reduce the probability of rule mis-
matching caused by binarization, which results in 
the reduction of the number of edges proposed 
during decoding. 
5 Conclusion
and Future Work 
This paper introduces a new binarization method, 
aiming at choosing better binarization for SCFG-
based SMT systems. We demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of our method on a state-of-the-art 
string-to-tree SMT system. Experimental results 
show that our method can significantly outper-
form the conventional synchronous binarization 
method, which indicates that better binarization 
selection is very beneficial to SCFG-based SMT 
systems. 
In this paper the cost of a binary rule is de-
fined based on the competition among the binary 
rules that have the same source-sides. However, 
some binary rules with different source-sides 
may also have competitions in a chart cell. We 
think that the cost of a binary rule can be better 
estimated by taking the rules with different 
source-sides into account. We intend to study 
this issue in our future work.
