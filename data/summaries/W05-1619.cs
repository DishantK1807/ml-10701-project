However, corpus-based components, and in particular statistical surface realizers [Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 2000; LangkildeGeary, 2002] have focused attention on a number of problems facing symbolic NLG systems that until now have been generally considered future work: large-scale, data-robust and languageand domain-independent generation.

For instance, the HALOGEN statistical realizer [LangkildeGeary, 2002] underwent the most comprehensive evaluation of any surface realizer, which was conducted by measuring sentences extracted from the Penn TreeBank [Marcus et al., 1993], converting them into its input formalism, and then producing output strings.

Most reusable deep surface realizers [Elhadad, 1991; Bateman, 1995; Lavoie and Rambow, 1997; White and Caldwell, 1998 ] have been symbolic, hand-written grammar-based systems, often based on syntactic linguistic theories such as Halliday’s [Halliday, 1976] systemic functional theory (FUF/SURGE and KPML) or Mel’cuk’s [Mel’cuk, 1988] Meaning-Text Theory (REALPRO).

Since text planners cannot generate either the requisite syntactic variation or quantity of text, [Langkilde-Geary, 2002] developed an evaluation strategy for HALOGEN employing a substitute: sentence parses from the Penn TreeBank [Marcus et al., 1993], a corpus that includes texts from newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal, and which have been hand-annotated for syntax by linguists.

The error rate of the Penn TreeBank annotation is a reasonably well-known quantity, and there is a specialized literature describing automatic correction methods (e.g., [Dickinson and Meurers, 2003]).

While we present the results of a manual analysis of the data in the next section, it is important to remember that the large majority of syntactic constructions, punctuation and morphology worked flawlessly in the evaluation of FUF/SURGE as described in [Callaway, 2004].

In a recent experiment, we compared the performance of HALOGEN relative to the grammar-based FUF/SURGE surface realizer on the identical corpus and with a similar methodology [Callaway, 2003; 2004].
