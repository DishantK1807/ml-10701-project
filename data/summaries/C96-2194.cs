For non-separated languages such as Japanese, Korea, Chinese and Thai, the more task in morphological analyzer is needed, i.e, segmenting an input sentence into the right words (Nobesawa et.al, 1994; Seung-Shik Kang et.al, 1994).

Especially, for Thai and Japanese written in Hirakana (Nobesawa,1994), a word is a stream of characters.

Many researchers have used a corpus based approach to POS tagging such as trigram model (Charniak, 1993); feature structure tagger (Kemp,1994), to word segmentation, such as Dbigram (Nobesawa et.al, 1994), to both POS tagging and word segmentation (Nagata, 1994) and to spelling error detection as well as correction (Araki et.al, 1994; Kawtrakul, et.al, 1995(b)).
