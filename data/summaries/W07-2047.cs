(Mihalcea, 2002) used the monosemous relatives technique for bootstrapping the automatic acquisition of large sense tagged corpora.

For the fine-grained All Words sense tagging task, which has always used WordNet, the system performance has ranged from our 59% to 65.2 (Senseval3, (Decadt et al., 2004)) to 69% (Seneval2, (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002)).

We created the feature set a1a3a2a9a8 by adding this new feature to a1a3a2a10a6 . In the end we applied a greedy feature selection algorithm to features in a1a3a2a10a8 inspired by (Mihalcea, 2002).

The idea of using supervised machine learning for WSD is not new and was used for example in (Ng and Lee, 1996).

An effort to alleviate the training data bottleneck is the Open Mind Word Expert (OMWE) project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) to collect sense-tagged data from Internet users.

The approach we present here is inspired by (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso et al.2005; Dagan et al.2006; McCarthy 2002).

So we created a greedy feature selection algorithm based on the performance of the SVM classifier (Mihalcea, 2002).

After an initial set of experiments the algorithm performance was enhanced using a greedy feature selection algorithm similar to one in (Mihalcea, 2002).
