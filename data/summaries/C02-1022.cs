Prominent representatives include Fass' program met* (1991), which makes use of formal definitions of several kinds of metonymic relations, Sowa's conceptual graphs (1992), in which an a priori unspecific relation is inserted between a concept of the type expected and the concept appearing on the surface, and the TACITUS system (Hobbs et al.1993) which treats metonymy as a special case of reference resolution, in a uniform abduction process to “find the best explanation for the observables”.

Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon (1991) addresses the first aspect.
J91-4003
Stallard (1993) indirectly addresses the second aspect by taking into account scoping relations and impacts on pronominal reference.
