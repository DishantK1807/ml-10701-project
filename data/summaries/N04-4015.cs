5. Related Work Automatic induction of the desired linguistic knowledge from a word/morpheme-aligned parallel corpus is analogous to (Yarowsky et al.2001). Word segmentation and merge/deletion analysis in morphology is similar to parsing and insertion operation in syntax by (Yamada and Knight 2001).

Translation qualities are measured by uncased BLEU (Papineni et al.2002) with 4 reference translations, sysids: ahb, ahc, ahd, ahe.

Symmetrization of linguistic structures can also be found in (Niessen and Ney 2000).

Translation Model For phrase translation models (Och and Ney 2002), we induce additional merge/deletion analysis on the basis of base noun phrase parsing of Arabic.

2. Word Segmentation We pre-suppose segmentation of a word into prefix(es)-stem-suffix(es), as described in (Lee et al.2003) The category prefix and suffix encompasses function words such as conjunction markers, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and all inflectional morphemes of the language.

1. Introduction Translation of two languages with highly different morphological structures as exemplified by Arabic and English poses a challenge to successful implementation of statistical machine translation models (Brown et al.1993). Rarely occurring inflected forms of a stem in Arabic often do not accurately translate due to the frequency imbalance with the corresponding translation word in English.
