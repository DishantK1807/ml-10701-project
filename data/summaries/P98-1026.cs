Dependency Unification Grammar (DUG, Hellwig (1986)) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses.
C86-1046
An important benefit is that the proposal is lexicalized without reverting to lexical ambiguity to represent order variation, thus profiting even more from the efficiency considerations discussed by Schabes et al.(1988). It is not yet clear what the generative capacity of such lexicalized discontinuous DGs is, but at least some index languages (such as anbnc n) can be characterized.
C88-2121
This result has recently been critizised to apply only to impoverished DGs which do not properly represent formally the expressivity of contemporary DG variants (Neuhaus & Br6ker, 1997).

Other lexicalized grammars collapse syntactic and ordering information and are forced to represent ordering alternatives by lexical ambiguity, most notable L-TAG (Schabes et al., 1988) and some versions of CG (Hepple, 1994).
C88-2121 C94-2201
Not only do all linguistic theories refer to some reformulation of the traditional notion of valency (in the form of 0grid, subcategorization list, argument list, or extended domain of locality); there is a growing number of parsers based on binary relations between words (Eisner, 1997; Maruyama, 1990).
P90-1005
Neuhaus & BrSker (1997) have shown that recognition and parsing of such grammars is A/'7~-complete.
