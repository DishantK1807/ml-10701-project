Hearst (1992) used seven lexico-syntactic patterns, for example �such NP as {NP,}*{(or|and)} NP� and �NP {, NP}*{,} or other NP�.

Setup We used Minipar (Lin 1994), a broad coverage parser, to parse 3GB of newspaper text from the Aquaint (TREC-9) collection.
C94-1079
We compared our system with the concepts in WordNet and Fleischman et al.�s instance/concept relations (Fleischman et al.2003). Table 6 shows the percentage of correct answers in the top-1 and top-5 returned answers from each system.

Work There have been several approaches to automatically discovering lexico-semantic information from text (Hearst 1992; Riloff and Shepherd 1997; Riloff and Jones 1999; Berland and Charniak 1999; Pantel and Lin 2002; Fleischman et al.2003; Girju et al.2003). One approach constructs automatic thesauri by computing the similarity between words based on their distribution in a corpus (Hindle 1990; Lin 1998).

Mann (2002) and Fleischman et al.(2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involing proper nouns.

Such broad-coverage lexical resources are extremely useful in applications such as word sense disambiguation (Leacock, Chodorow and Miller 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu 2001).

Mutual information is commonly used to measure the association strength between two words (Church and Hanks 1989).
P89-1010
Berland and Charniak (1999) used similar pattern-based techniques and other heuristics to extract meronymy (part-whole) relations.
