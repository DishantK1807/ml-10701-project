Automatic Generation of Translation Dictionaries Using Intermediary Languages Kisuh Ahn and Matthew Frampton ICCS,SchoolofInformatics EdinburghUniversity K.Ahn@sms.ed.ac.uk,M.J.E.Frampton@sms.ed.ac.uk Abstract Wedescribeamethodwhichusesoneormore intermediary languages in order to automatically generate translation dictionaries.
Such a method could potentially be used to efficiently create translation dictionaries for language groups which have as yet had little interaction.
For any given word in the source language,ourmethodinvolvesfirsttranslating into the intermediary language(s), then into thetargetlanguage,backintotheintermediary language(s) and finally back into the source language.
The relationship between a word andthe numberof possibletranslations in anotherlanguageismostoften1-to-many,andso at each stage, the number of possible translationsgrowsexponentially.Ifwearrivebackat the same starting point i.e. the same word in the sourcelanguage,thenwe hypothesisethat the meanings of the words in the chain have not diverged significantly.
Hence we backtrack through the link structure to the target language word and accept this as a suitable translation.

1 Introduction
In this paper we describe a method which uses one or moreintermediarylanguagestoautomaticallygenerate a dictionary to translate from one language, a0,toanother, a1. The method relies on using dictionaries that canconnect a0 to a1 andbackto a0 viatheintermediary language(s),e.g.
a0 a2 a4 a6, a4 a6 a2 a1, a1 a2 a4 a6, a4 a6 a2 a0,where a4 a6 is an intermediarylanguage such as English.
The resources required to exploit the method are not difficult to find since dictionaries already existthattranslatebetweenEnglishandavastnumberof otherlanguages.
Whereas at present theproductionof translationdictionariesismanual(e.g.
(Serasset1994)), ourmethodisautomatic.
Webelievethatprojectssuch as(Boitet et al.2002)and(Wiktionary),whicharecurrentlygeneratingtranslationdictionariesbyhandcould benefitgreatlyfromusingourmethod.
Translationdictionariesare usefulnot onlyforend-userconsumption but also for various multilingual tasks such as crosslanguage question answering (e.g.
(Ahn et al.2004)) andinformationretrieval(e.g.
(Argawet al.2004)).We have applied our method to automatically generate a Spanish-to-Germandictionary.Wechosethislanguage pairbecausewewereabletofindanonlineSpanish-toGermandictionarywhichcouldbeusedtoevaluateour result.
The structure of the paper is as follows.
In section 2.1, we describe how if we translate a word from a source language into an intermediary language, and then into a target language, the number of possible translationsmaygrowdrastically.
Someofthesetranslations will be ‘better’ than others, and in section 2.2 we givea detailed description of ourmethodforidentifyingthese‘better’translations.
Havingidentifiedthe ‘better’translationswecanthenautomaticallygenerate a dictionary that translates directly from the source to the target language.
In section 3 we describe how we used our method to automatically generate a Spanishto-German dictionary, and in section 3.3, we evaluate the result.
Finally, in section 4, we conclude and suggestfuturework.
2 Translating
Via An Intermediary Language 2.1 The Problem Consider the problem of finding the different possible translationsforaword a11 fromlanguage a0 inlanguage a1 when there is no available a0 a2 a1 dictionary.
Let us assume that there are dictionaries which allow us to connect from a0 to a1 and back to a0 via an intermediary language a4 a6 i.e. dictionaries for a0 a2 a4 a6, a4 a6 a2 a1, a1 a2 a4 a6 and a4 a6 a2 a0,asshowninfigure1.
If there was only ever a18 suitable translation for any givenword in anotherlanguage, then it would be trivial to use dictionaries a0 a2 a4 a6 and a4 a6 a2 a1 in order to obtain a translation of a11 in language a1 .However, this is not the case forany given word a11 in language a0 the a0 a2 a4 a6 dictionary will usually give multiple possibletranslations a23 a24 a26 a28 a30 a30 a30 a24 a26 a34 a36,someofwhichdiverge morethanothersinmeaningfrom a11 .The a4 a6 a2 a1 dictionarywillthenproducemultiplepossibletranslations foreach of a23 a24 a26 a28 a30 a30 a30 a24 a26 a34 a36 to give a23 a39 a28 a30 a30 a30 a39 a42 a36 where a44 a45 a47 a49 . Again, some of a23 a39 a28 a30 a30 a30 a39 a42 a36 will diverge more than oth41 DictionaryDictionary X −> IL Dictionary IL −> Y Y −> IL Dictionary IL −> X Figure1: Thecycleofdictionaries ers in meaning from their source words in a23 a24 a26 a28 a30 a30 a30 a24 a26 a34 a36 . Hence we have a44 possible translations of the word a11 fromlanguage a0 inlanguage a1 .Someofa23 a39 a28 a30 a30 a30 a39 a42 a36 will havedivergedless in meaningthan others from a11,and socanbeconsidered‘better’translations.
Theproblem thenishowtoidentifythese‘better’translations.
2.2 Using
The Link Structure To Find ‘Better’ Translations Our method for identifying the ‘better’ translations is tofirstusedictionary a1 a2 a4 a6 toproduce a23 a24 a26 a1 a28 a30 a30 a30 a24 a26 a1 a2 a36, themultiplepossibletranslationsofeach of a23 a39 a28 a30 a30 a30 a39 a4 a36, where a6 a45 a47 a7 . Next we use dictionary a4 a6 a2 a0 to give a23 a11 a1 a28 a30 a30 a30 a11 a1 a9 a36, the multiple translations of each of a23 a24 a26 a1 a28 a30 a30 a30 a24 a26 a1 a2 a36,wherea11 a45 a47 a6 . Wethenselecteachofthe membersof the set a23 a11 a1 a28 a30 a30 a30 a11 a1 a9 a36 which are equal to the originalword a11 . We hypothesisethat to have returned to the same starting word, the meanings of the words thathaveformedachainthroughthelinkstructurecannot have diverged significantly, and so we retrace two stepstothewordin a23 a39 a28 a30 a30 a30 a39 a4 a36 andacceptthisasasuitable translation of a11 . Figure 2 represents a hypothetical case in which two members of the set a23 a11 a1 a28 a30 a30 a30 a11 a1 a9 a36 are equal to the original word a11 . We retrace ourroute from these through the links to a39 a28 and a39 a13, and we accepttheseassuitabletranslations.

If we apply the method described here to a large numberof words from language a0 then we can automaticallygeneratealanguage a0 -to-language a1 dictionary.
Herewehaveconsideredusingjustoneintermediary language, but provided we have the dictionaries to complete a cycle from a0 to a1 and back to a0,then wecanuseanynumberofintermediarylanguages,e.g.

3 The
Experiment We have applied the method described in section 2 in order to automatically generate a Spanish-to-German dictionary using Spanish-to-English, English-toGerman, German-to-English and English-to-Spanish dictionaries.
We chose Spanish and German because we were able to find an online Spanish-to-German dictionary which could be used to evaluate our automatically-generateddictionary.
3.1 Obtaining
The Data We first collected large lists of German and English lemmas from the Celex Database, ((Baayen and Gulikers1995)).
We also gathered a short list of Spanish lemmas, all starting with the letter ‘a’ from the Wiktionary website (Wiktionary) to use as our starting terms.
We created our own dictionaries by making use of online dictionaries.
In order to obtain the English translations for the German lemmas and vice versa, we queried ‘The New English-German Dictionary’ site of The Technical Universiy of Dresden 1 . ToobtaintheEnglishtranslationsfortheSpanishlemmas and vice versa, we queried ‘The Spanish Dict’ website 2 . Finally, we wanted to compare the performance of our automatically-generated Spanish-toGerman dictionary with that of a manually-generated Spanish-to-German dictionary, and for this we used a website called ‘DIX: Deutsch-Spanisch Woerterbuch’ 3 .Tablea18 gives information about the four dictionaries which we created in order to automatically generate our Spanish-to-Germandictionary.
The fifth is the manually-generateddictionaryusedforevaluation.

It contained a14 a14 a15 Spanish terms, all starting with the letter ‘a’.
To storeandoperateonthedata,weusedtheopensource database program PostgresSQL, version a23 a30 a22 a30 a15 .Starting with the Spanish-to-English dictionary, at each of stages a18 a0 a22,we produceda newdictionarytablewith an additional column to the right for the new language.
We did this by using the appropriate dictionary to look up the translations for the terms in the old rightmost column, before inserting these translations into a new rightmost column.
For example, to create the Spanish-to-English-to-German(SEG) table, we used the English-to-German dictionary to find the translations for the English terms in the Spanish-toEnglish(SE)table,andtheninsertedthesetranslations into a new rightmostcolumn.
We kept producingnew tablesinthisfashionuntilwehadgeneratedaSpanishto-English-to-German-to-English-to-Spanish(SEGES) table.
Instage a15,thefinalstage,weselectedonlythose rows in which the starting and ending Spanish terms were the same.
Important characteristics of these dictionarytablesaregivenintable a1 . Stages Dicts Ents Trans Trans/term 0 SE a14 a14 a15 a18 a1 a16 a1 a18 a30 a18 1 SEG a14 a22 a18 a14 a24 a14 a14 a18 a18 a30 a16 2 SEGE a20 a14 a18 a1 a15 a16 a18 a1 a15 a1 a30 a22 3 SEGES a20 a14 a14 a22 a18 a16 a16 a1 a14 a23 a30 a18 4 SEGES a20 a22 a22 a15 a22 a18 a22 a18 a30 a18 Table 2: Constructing Dictionary; Ents = number of entries, Trans = number of translations, Trans/term = averagenumberoftranslationsgivenperentry.
Table a1 shows that the number of translations-perterm grew and grew from a18 a30 a18 translations in the startingSpanish-to-Englishdictionarytoanenormous a14 a23 a30 a18 translationsper term in the SEGES table afterstage a22 . However,afterstage a15,havingselectedonlythoserows with matchingfirst andlast entriesforSpanish,we reducedthenumberoftranslationsbackto a18 a30 a18 perterm.
3.3 Evaluation
Having automatically generated the Spanish-toGerman dictionary containing a20 a22 a22 unique Spanish terms, we then compared it to the manually-generated Spanish-to-German dictionary (see section 3.1).
We gave the same initial a14 a14 a15 Spanish terms to the manually-generated dictionary but received translationsforonly a14 a18 a16 . The results are summarised in table a22 . We observe thatwhenweregardthemanually-generateddictionary astheGold-standard,ourautomatically-generateddictionarymanagedto producea relativelyadequatecoverage of some a23 a22 a30 a14 a2 (a22 a24 a1 out of a20 a22 a22 ) with respect Auto SG Man SG Overlap Entries a20 a22 a22 a14 a18 a16 a22 a24 a1 a23 a23 a22 a30 a14 a2 a36 Total Trans a15 a22 a18 a22 a22 a18 a1 a14 a18 a20 a23 a23 Trans/Entry a18 a30 a18 a20 a30 a18 a15 a30 a16 a23 a23 a18 a30 a15 a2 a36 Table3: Result: SGautomaticvsSGmanual to main entries overlap between the two dictionaries.
When we look at the numberof translations per term, wefindthatourdictionarycoveredmostofthetranslations found in the manually-generated dictionary (a15 a30 a16 out of a20 a30 a18 average or a23 a18 a30 a15 a2 ) for which there was a correspondingentryinourdictionary.
Infact, ourdictionary produced more translations-per-term than the manually-generated one.
An extra translation may be anerrororitmaynotappearinthemanually-generated dictionary because the manually-generated dictionary istoosparse.
Furtherevaluationisrequiredin orderto assesshowmanyoftheextratranslationswereerrors.
In conclusion, we find that our automaticallygenerated dictionary has an adequate but not perfect coverage and very good recall for each term covered withinourdictionary.
Asfortheprecisionofthetranslationsfound,weneedmoreinvestigationandperhaps a more complete manually-generated comparison dictionary.
The results might have been even better had it not been for several problems with the four starting dictionaries.
Forexample,atranslationforaparticular word could sometimes not be foundas an entry in the next dictionary.
This might be because the entry simplywasn’tpresent,orbecauseofdifferentconventions e.g. listing verbsas “to Z” whenanothersimply gives “Z”.
Another cause was differences in font encoding e.g. with German umlauts.
Results might also have improved had the starting dictionaries provided more translations per entry term, and had we used part-ofspeech information this was impossible since not all ofthedictionarieslistedpart-of-speech.Allinallgiven the fact that the quality of data with which we started was far from ideal, we believe that our method shows greatpromiseforsavinghumanlabourintheconstructionoftranslationdictionaries.
4Conclusion In this paper we have described a method using one or more intermediary languages to automatically generate a dictionary to translate from one language, a0, to another, a1 . The method relies on using dictionaries that can connect a0 to a1 and back to a0 via the intermediarylanguage(s).
We appliedthe methodto automatically generate a Spanish-to-German dictionary, anddesptitethelimitationsofourstartingdictionaries, the result seems to be reasonablygood.
As was stated insection a22 a30 a22,wedidnotevaluatewhethertranslations we generated that were not in the gold-standard manual dictionary were errors or good translations.
This is essential futurework.
We also intend to empirically 43 testwhathappenswhenfurtherintermediarydictionariesareintroducedintothechain.
We believe that our method can make a great contributiontotheconstructionoftranslationdictionaries.
Evenifadictionaryproducedbyourmethodisnotconsidered quite complete or accurate enough for general use, it can serve as a very goodstarting point, thereby saving a great deal of human labour human labour thatrequiresalargeamountoflinguisticexpertise.
Our methodcouldbeusedtoproducetranslationdictionaries for relatively unconnected language groups, most likely by using English as an intermediary language.
Suchtranslationdictionariescouldbeimportantinpromotingcommunicationbetweentheselanguagegroups andanevermoreglobalisedandinterconnectedworld.
A final point to make regards applying our method more generally outside of the domain of translation dictionary construction.
We believe that our method, whichmakesuseoflinkstructures,couldbeappliedin differentareasinvolvinggraphs.
