Whereas language generation has benefited from syntax [Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 2000], the performance of statistical phrase-based machine translation when relying solely on syntactic phrases has been reported to be poor [Koehn et al., 2003].

We view our use of part-ofspeech patterns as a natural extension to the introduction of structural elements to statistical machine translation by Wang [1998] and Och et al.[1999]. 165 Our empirical results suggest that the use of partof-speech pattern correspondences to enhance existing translation resources does not damage machine translation performance.

The inclusion of phrases longer than three words in translation resources has been avoided, as it has been shown not to have a strong impact on translation performance [Koehn et al., 2003].
