This word string is further processed by a robust parser (Ward, 1990) or call router (Gorin et al, 1997) to be converted in a semantic interpretation.
H90-1027
The apparent reasons for this are the up-front cost and additional delays of collecting domain-specific utterances to properly train the SLM (not to mention semantic tagging needed to train the call router) (Hemphill et al, 1990; Knight et al, 2001; Gorin et al, 1997).

This practical application of (Ward, 1990; Knight et al, 2001; Rayner et al, 2005; ten Bosch, 2005) is cast as an upgrade problem which must obey the following constraints.
H90-1027
This paper exploits techniques known since the 90â€™s (SLM with robust parsing, (Ward, 1990)) and applies them to build robust speech understanding into existing large scale directed dialog grammarbased applications.
