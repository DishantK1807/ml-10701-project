The University of Maryland SENSEVAL-3 System Descriptions Clara Cabezas, Indrajit Bhattacharya, and Philip Resnik University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 USA clarac@umiacs.umd.edu, indrajit@cs.umd.edu, resnik@umd.edu Abstract For SENSEVAL-3, the University of Maryland (UMD) team focused on two primary issues: the portability of sense disambigation across languages, and the exploitation of real-world bilingual text as a resource for unsupervised sense tagging.
We validated the portability of our supervised disambiguation approach by applying it in seven tasks (English, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Romanian, Spanish, and “multilingual” lexical samples), and we experimented with a new unsupervised algorithm for sense modeling using parallel corpora.
1 Supervised
Sense Tagging for Lexical Samples 1.1 Tagging Framework For the English, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Romanian, Spanish, and “multilingual” lexical samples, we employed the UMD-SST system developed for SENSEVAL-2 (Cabezas et al., 2001); we refer the reader to that paper for a detailed system description.
Briefly, UMD-SST takes a supervised learning approach, treating each word in a task’s vocabulary as an independent problem of classification into that word’s sense inventory.
Each training and test item is represented as a weighted feature vector, with dimensions corresponding to properties of the context.
As in SENSEVAL-2, our system supported the following kinds of features: a0 Local context.
For each a1 = 1, 2, and 3, and for each word a2 in the vocabulary, there is a feature a3a5a4a7a6a8a2 representing the presence of word a2 at a distance of a1 words to the left of the word being disambigated; there is a corresponding set of features a9a10a4a10a6a11a2 for the local context to the right of the word.
a0 Wide context.
Each word a12 in the training set vocabulary has a corresponding feature indicating its presence.
For SENSEVAL-3, wide context features were taken from the entire training or test instance.
In other settings, one might make further distinctions, e.g. between words in the same paragraph and words in the document.
We also experimented with the following additional kinds of features for English: a0 Grammatical context.
We use a syntactic dependency parser (Lin, 1998) to produce, for each word to be disambiguated, features identifying relevant syntactic relationships in the sentence where it occurs.
For example, in the sentence The U.S. government announced a new visa waiver policy, the word government would have syntactic features like DET:THE, MOD:U.S., and SUBJ-OF:ANNOUNCED.
a0 Expanded context.
In information retrieval, we and other researchers have found that it can be useful to expand the representation of a document to include informative words from similar documents (Levow et al., 2001).
In a similar spirit, we create a set of expandedcontext features a13a15a14a8a16a17a6a18a13 by (a) treating the WSD context as a bag of words, (b) issuing it as a query to a standard information retrieval system that has indexed a large collection of documents, and (c) including the nonstopword vocabulary of the top a19 documents returned.
So, for example, in a context containing the sentence The U.S. government announced a new visa waiver policy, the query might retrieve news articles like “US to Extend Fingerprinting to Europeans, Japanese” (Bloomberg.com, April 2, 2004), leading to the addition of features like EXT:EUROPEAN, EXT:JAPANESE, EXT:FINGERPRINTING EXT:VISITORS, EXT:TOURISM, and so forth.
Association for Computational Linguistics for the Semantic Analysis of Text, Barcelona, Spain, July 2004 SENSEVAL-3: Third International Workshop on the Evaluation of Systems Lexical Sample Coarse (prec/rec) Fine (prec/rec) UMD-SST 0.643/0.643 0.568/0.568 UMD-SST-gram 0.600/0.600 0.576/0.576 UMD-SST-docexp 0.541/0.542 0.516/0.491 Table 1: UMD-SST variations on the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task As described by Cabezas et al.(2001), we have adopted the framework of support vector machines (SVMs) in order to perform supervised classification.
Because we used a version of SVM learning designed for binary classification tasks, rather than the multi-way classification needed for disambiguating among a0 senses, we constructed a family of SVM classifiers for each word a2 — one for each of the word’s a0a2a1 senses.
All positive training examples for a sense a3 a4 of a2 were treated as negative training examples for all the other senses a3a5a4, a6a8a7a9 a1. Table 1 shows the performance of our approach on the English lexical sample task from the previous SENSEVAL exercise (SENSEVAL-2), including the basic system (UMD-SST), the basic system with grammatical features added (UMD-SSTgram), and the basic system with document expansion features added (UMD-SST-docexp).
(We have not done a run with both sets of features added).
The results showed a possible potential benefit for using grammatical features, in the fine-grained scoring.
However, we deemed the benefit too small to rely upon, and submitted our official SENSEVAL-3 runs using UMD-SST without the grammatical or document-expansion features.
1.2 SENSEVAL-3 Lexical Sample Tasks For SENSEVAL-3, the modularity of our system made it very easy to participate in the many lexical sample tasks, including the multilingual lexical sample, where the “sense inventory” consisted of vocabulary items from a second language.1 Indeed, we participated in several tasks without having anyone on the team who could read the language.
(Whether or not this was a good idea remains to be seen).
For Basque, Catalan, and Spanish, we used the lemmatized word forms provided by the task organizers; for the other languages, including English, we used only simple tokenization.
Table 2 shows the UMD-SST system’s official 1Data format problems prevented us from participating in the Italian lexical sample task.

In unofficial runs, we also experimented with the grammatical and document-expansion features.
Table 3 shows the results, which indicate that on this task the additional features did not help and may have hurt performance slightly.
Although we have not yet reached any firm conclusions, we conjecture that value potentially added by these features may have been offset by the expansion in the size of the feature space; in future work we plan to explore feature selection and alternative learning frameworks.
2 Unsupervised
Sense Tagging using Bilingual Text 2.1 Probabilistic Sense Model For the past several years, the University of Maryland group has been exploring unsupervised approaches to word sense disambiguation that take advantage of parallel corpora (Diab and Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003).
Recently, Bhattacharya et al.(2004) (in a UMD/Montreal collaboration) have developed a variation on this bilingual approach that is inspired by the central insight of Diab’s work, but recasts it in a probabilistic framework.
A generative model, it is a variant of the graphical model of Bengio and Kermorvant (2003), which groups semantically related words from the two languages into “senses”; translations are generated by probabilistically choosing a sense and then words from the sense.
Briefly, the model of Bhattacharya et al.uses probabilistic analysis and independence assumptions: it assumes that senses and words have certain occurrence probabilities and that the choice of the word can be made independently once the sense has been decided.
Here interaction between different words arising from the same sense comes into play, even if the words are not related through translations, and this interdependence of the senses through common words plays a role in sense disambiguation.
The model takes as its starting point the idea of a “translation pair” — a pair of words a13 and a0 that are aligned in two sentences (here “English” and “nonEnglish”) that are translations of each other.
For example, in the English-Spanish sentence pair Me gusta la ciudad/I like the city, one would find the translation pairs a1a3a2a5a4a7a6 a13a9a8, a1a3a10 a1a12a11 a13a13a4a15a14a17a16 a3 a16a19a18a20a8, a1 a16a7a21 a13a13a4a22a10a3a18a23a8, and a1a3a24 a1 a16a19a25a26a4a22a24 a1 a16a28a27a17a18a29a27a29a8 .2 Those familiar with statistical machine translation (MT) models will note that a translation pair is equivalent to a link in a word-level alignment, and in fact we obtain translation pairs from sentence-aligned parallel text by training a statistical MT model (using GIZA++, (Och and Ney, 2003)) and using the word-level alignments that result.
The probabilistic sense model makes the assumption that the English word a2a31a30 and the non-English word a2a33a32 in a translation pair share the same precise sense, or, in other words, that the set of sense labels for the words in the two languages is the same and may be collapsed into one set of senses that is responsible for both English and non-English words.
Thus the one latent variable in the model is the sense label a34 generating both words, represented by variables a35 a30 and a35a36a32 . The model also makes the assumption that words in both languages are conditionally independent given the sense label.
The generative parameters a37 for the model are the prior probability a38a39a1 a16a22a8 of each sense a16 and the conditional probabilities a38a39a1 a2a40a30a42a41a16a7a8 and a38a39a1 a2a40a32a5a41a16a22a8 of each word a2a40a30 and a2a40a32 in the two languages given the sense.
The generation of a translation pair by this model may be viewed as a two-step process that first selects a sense according to the priors on the senses, and then selects a word from each language using the 2Speakers of both Spanish and English will observe that translation pairs may well include words that are not exactly translations of each other.
conditional probabilities for that sense.
This may be imagined as a factoring of the joint distribution: a38a39a1a43a35a44a30a45a4a46a35a47a32a23a4a15a34a48a8 a9 a38a39a1a49a34a48a8a19a38a39a1a43a35a44a30a50a41a34a48a8a19a38a39a1a43a35a36a32a51a41a34a48a8 . Given WordNet as a sense inventory, the set of English senses is as defined in the WordNet database.
Since the model assumes the sense labels for the two languages are the same, it must use the same WordNet labels for the non-English words as well.
Rather than considering all possible words in the non-English vocabulary for each WordNet sense a16, we permit an association between non-English word a2a40a32 and WordNet sense a16 if a2a31a32 is the translation of any English word a2 a30 in a16 ’s synonym set.
We use the popular EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to estimate the model’s parameters from a set of translation pairs derived from a parallel corpus.
3 Using
the Model for WSD Like Diab’s system, the sense model of Bhattacharya et al.requires a parallel corpus in order to estimate its parameters, and as currently implemented it can only assign sense tags to words in parallel text.
In order to perform WSD experiments on English test items, therefore, two steps are necessary: obtaining translation pairs from an English-F parallel corpus in order to create a model, and translating test items from English into F in order to obtain word-level alignments that can be used as the basis for disambiguation.
In order to accomplish these steps, Bhattacharya et al.(2004) used the pseudo-translation approach of Diab and Resnik (2002): they created the model using an English-Spanish parallel corpus constructed by using Systran to translate a large collection of English text, and they obtained parallel Spanish text for the test items in the same fashion.
On the nouns (only) in the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task, they obtained precision and recall of 0.624 and 0.616, respectively, improving on Diab’s precision and recall of 0.618 and 0.572.3 Our goal for SENSEVAL-3 was to investigate the use of human-translated text, rather than pseudotranslated text, in creating the model.
To that end, we used three sources of sentence-aligned parallel text: a0 Spanish-English: A set of 107,222 sentence pairs sampled from modern Bible translations, 3Their paper includes a refinement of the probabilistic model that improves performance further, to precision and recall of 0.672 and 0.651.

a0 French-English: a set of 1,008,591 sentence pairs from the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2003) a0 Chinese-English: a set of 440,223 sentence pairs from FBIS.
In order to tag new test sentences, we used machine translation from English test items into each of Spanish, French, and Chinese.
We used Systran for Spanish and French, and for Chinese we used an implementation of the alignment template framework for statistical MT (Kumar and Byrne, 2003).
Once having obtained the translations for test sentences, we used GIZA++ to create word-level alignments within which translation pairs could be identified.
We used the probabilistic model only for WSD of nouns, where nouns were identified using an automatic part-of-speech tagger.
For other parts of speech, we used the first-listed WordNet sense.
Time limitations prevented us from completing SENSEVAL-3 runs in time for this writing.
Table 4 shows the performance of the system on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task.
This performance level places the approach in the middle group of performers on this task at the time of SENSEVAL2 (with scores roughly in the range of 0.44-0.46), as contrasted to the top group (with scores in the range of 0.56-0.69).
In the near future, we hope to repeat the experiment with the SENSEVAL-3 English allwords and lexical sample test data, and also to explore evidence combination from multiple language pairs.
4 Conclusions
Our precision and recall in the SENSEVAL-3 lexical sample tasks was in all cases very close to the median reported by the task organizer, thus demonstrating an ability to obtain credible performance with a simple, robust approach.
Additionally, we explored the use of additional features, and we experimented with applying a new unsupervised probabilistic model using human-translated rather than pseudo-translated parallel text, with equivocal results for the various extensions beyond the basic system.
In the future we plan to focus our attention more heavily on the learning paradigm and probabilistic modeling, with the particular aim of more effectively exploiting local and document-level context for both sense disambiguation and lexical selection.
