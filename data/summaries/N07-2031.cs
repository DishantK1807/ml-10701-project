Accuracy for XLE is not given, because the results reported by Kaplan et al.(2004) compare labeled functional dependencies drawn from LFG f-structures with equivalents derived automatically from Collins outputs.

Until very recently, goal (b) ruled out stochastic parsers, but new results (McClosky et al.2006) suggest this may no longer be the case.
P06-1043
The second comparison is with the fast stochastic parser by Sagae and Lavie (2005).
W05-1513
The extrapolation to XLE, a mature unification-based parser that uses a disambiguating statistical post-processor, is drawn from Kaplan et al.(2004). Results are given for both the full grammar and a reduced version that omits less likely rules.
N04-1013
The feasibility of such post-parse deepening (for a statistical parser) is demonstrated by Cahill et al (2004).
P04-1041
It is actually a full parser that produces a tree of chunks, plus identification of (sometimes alternative) typed dependencies among the chunk heads (Ait-Mokhtar et al.2002, Gala 2004).
W04-2007
Also, Frank et al.(2003) use a German topological field identifier to constrain an HPSG parser.
P03-1014
Daum et al.(2003) use chunks to constrain a WCDG grammar for German, reducing parse times by about 2/3 (but the same results are obtained using a tagger alone).
