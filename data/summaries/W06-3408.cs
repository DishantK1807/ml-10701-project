Much of the work on computational analysis of dialogue has focused on automatic topic segmentation of conversational data, and in particular, using features of the discourse to aid in segmentation (Galley et al, 2003; Stolcke et al., 1999; Hirschberg & Hakatani, 1996.).

We evaluated WLMâ€™s performance on the ICSI meeting corpus (Janin et al, 2003) by comparing our segmentation results to the results obtained by implementing LCSeg (Galley et al., 2003).

Traditionally, algorithms for segmentation have relied on textual cues (Hearst, 1997; Miller et al.1998; Beeferman et al, 1999; Choi, 2000).

Topic segmentation algorithms generally rely on a lexical cohesion signal that requires smoothing in order to eliminate noise from changes of word choices in adjoining statements that do not indicate topic shifts (Hearst, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).

Many state of the art techniques use a sliding window for smoothing (Hearst, 1997; Miller et al.1998; Galley et al., 2003).

A subset of these meetings were hand coded for topic segments (Galley, et al., 2003).
