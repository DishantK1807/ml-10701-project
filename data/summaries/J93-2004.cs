The POS-tagged corpus has also been used to train a number of different POS taggers including Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel (1991), and the skeletally parsed corpus has been used in connection with the development of new methods to exploit intonational cues in disambiguating the parsing of spoken sentences (Veilleux and Ostendorf 1992).

During the early stages of the Penn Treebank project, the initial automatic POS assignment was provided by PARTS (Church 1988), a stochastic algorithm developed at AT&T Bell Labs.

Fidditch, a deterministic parser developed by Donald Hindle first at the University of Pennsylvania and subsequently at AT&T Bell Labs (Hindle 1983, 1989), is used to provide an initial parse of the material.

A few examples already in print: a number of projects investigating stochastic parsing have used either the POS-tagged materials (Magerman and Marcus 1990; Brill et al.1990; Brill 1991) or the skeletally parsed corpus (Weischedel et al.1991; Pereira and Schabes 1992).
