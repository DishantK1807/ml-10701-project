For the training samples, the nugget matching component within POURPRE was employed to compute the nugget score—this value quantified the “goodness” of a particular sentence in terms of nugget content.1 Due to known issues with the vital/okay distinction (Hildebrandt et al., 2004), it was ignored for this computation; however, see (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006b) for recent attempts to address this issue.

However, the recent introduction of POURPRE, an automatic evaluation metric for the nugget-based evaluation methodology (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005), fills this evaluation gap and makes possible the work reported here; cf.

Relationship questions are significantly different from definition questions, which can be paraphrased as “Tell me interesting things about x.” Definition questions have received significant amounts of attention recently, e.g., (Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Prager et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004; Cui et al., 2005).

These are difficult challenges, but recent work on applying semantic models to QA (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006a) provide a promising direction.
