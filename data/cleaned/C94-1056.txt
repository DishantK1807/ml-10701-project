ABSTRACT GENERATION BASED ON RHETORICAL STRUCTURE EXTRACTION Kenjl Ono, Kazuo Sumlta, Seijl Miike Research and Development Center Toshiba Corporation Komukai-Toshiba-cho 1, Saiwai-ku, Kawmsaki, 210, Japan ono@isl.rdc.toshiba.co.jp 1 ABSTRACT We have developed an automatic abstr~mt generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction.
The system first extracts the rhetorical structure, the compound of the rhetorical relations between sentences, and then cuts out less important parts in the extracted structure to generate an abstract of the desired length.
Evaluation of the generated abstract showed that it contains at maximum 74% of the most important sentences of the original text.
The system is now utilized as a text browser for a prototypicaI interactive document retrieval system.
2 INTRODUCTION
Abstract generation is, like Machine Translation, one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing.
IIowever, since conventional word-frequencybased abstract generation systems(e.g.
\[Kuhn 58\]) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts.
On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g.
\[behnert 801, \[Fum 86\]), owe their success to the li,nitation of the domain, and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects, such,as popular scientific magazine.
To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system, a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established.
ltobbs developed a theory in which lie arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint \[Hobbs 79\].
Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse: linguistic structure, intention, and attention \[C, rosz et al.86\]. l,itman and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participanUs plans \[Litman et al.87\]. 'l'hese theories all depend on extra-linguistic knowledge, the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer.
Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse \[Cohen 87\], yet did not provkle a concrete identification procedure for 'evidence' relationships between sentences, where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships.
Also, since only relationships between successive sentences were considered, the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectives are detected.
Mama and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance \[Mann et al.87\]. llowever, no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper.
We have developed a computational rnodel of discourse for Japanese expository writings, and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure\[Sumita 92\].
In our model, discourse structure is deiined,as the rhetorical structure, i.e., the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text.
Abstr~t generation is realized ~s a suitaMe application of the extracted rhetorical structure.
In this paper we describe briefly our discourse model and discuss the abstract generation system based on it.
344 3 RHETORICAl, STRUCTURE Rhetorical structure represents relations between varions chunks of sentences in the body of each section.
In this paper, the rhetorical structure is represented by two layers: intra-paragraph and inter-paragral)h structures.
An intra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences, and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs.
In text, various rhetorical patterns art,.
used to clarify the principle of argument.
Among them, co,> nectivc expressions, which state inter-sentence relationships, are the most significant.
The tyl)ieal grantmatical categories of the connective expressions are connectives and sentence predicates.
They can I>c divided into the thirty four categories which are exernplified in Table 1.

is described) The rhetorical relation of a sentence, which is the relationship to the preceding part of the text., can be extracted in accordance with the connective expression in the sentence.
For a sentence without any explicit connective exl)ressions, extension relation is set to the sentence.
The relations exemplitied in Table 1 are used for representing the rhetorical structure.
Fig. 1 shows a paragral)h from an article titled "A Zero-Crossing late Which Estimates the Frequency of a Speech Signal," where underlined words indicate connective exl)ressions.
Although the fourth and fifth sentences are clearly the exemplification of the first three sentences, the sixth is not.
Also the sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for the first five.
Thus, tile rhetorical structure for this text can be represented by a binary-tree as shown in Fig.
2.This structure is also represented as follows: \[\[\[1 <EZ> 2\] <gs> \[3 <E(\]> \[4 <EX> 5\]\]\] <sa> 6\] 1: In tile context of discrete-time signals, zerocrossing is said to occur if successive samples have dilfereut algebraic signs.
2: Tile rate at which zero crossings occur is a simple measure of tile frequency content of st sig,ml.
3: This is .particularly true of narrow band signals.
4: For example, a si,msoidal signal of frequency P0, sanll)led at a rate fs, h,'~s i'~/t"~ samples per cycle of the siue wave.
5: Each cycle has two zero crossings so that the hmg-term average rate of zero-crossings is z = 2F0/s;;.
6: Thus, tile average zero-crossing rate gives a reasonable way to estinmte the frequency of a sine wave.

Figure 1 : Text example 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure 2: Rhetorical structure for the text in l,'ig.1 The rhetorical structure is represented by a binary tree on the analogy of a syntactic tree of a natural language sentence.
Each sub tree of the rhetorical structure forms an arg,rnentative constituent, just as each sub-tree of tile syntactic tree forms a gram,natical constituent.
Also, a sub-tree of the rhetorical structure is sub-categorlzed by a relation of its parent node as well as a syntactic tree.

346 that case the system cuts out terminal nodes from the last sentences, which are given the same penalty score.
If the text is written loosely, tile rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNuelevs relations (e.g., parallel(marc(and, also)), and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentences smoothly.
After sentences of each paragraph are reduced, inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance ju~lgement on the inter-paragraph rhetorical structure.
If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig.
2, each penalty score is calculated as shown ill Fig.
3. In Fig.
3 italic numbers are the penalties the system imposed on each node of tile structure, and broken lines are the boundary between the nodes int-posed different penalty scores.
The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three, that sentence three has two, that sentence one and two have one, and that sentence six has no penalty score.
In this ease, the system selects sentence one, two, three and six for the longest abstract, and and also could select sentence one, two and six as a shorter abstract, and also could select sentence six as a still more shorter abstract.
After the sentences to be included in tile al)stract are determined, the system alter,atcly arranges the sentences and the connectives from which the relations were extracted, and realizes the text of tile abstr~t.
The important feature of the generated abstr,'mts is that since they are composed of the rhetoriealy consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure, the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which can,ot be understood alone.
For example, in the abstract generation mentioned above, seutence two does not al> pear solely in the abstract, but appears ahvays with sentence one.
If sentence two apl)eared alone in the abstract withont sentence one, it wouhl be difficult to understand the text.
6 EVALUATION
The generated abstracts were evaluated from the point of view of key sentence coverage.
30 editorial articles of"Asahi Shinbun", a Japanese newspaper, and 42 technical papers of "Toshiba Review", a journal of Toshiba Corp.
which publishes short expository papers of three or four pages, were selected and three subjects judged tile key sentences and tile most important key sentence of each text.

As for the technical l)apcrs, they were 60% and 80 % resl)ectlvely.
Then tile abstracts were generated and were compared with the selected key sentences.
The res,lt is shown in Table 3.
As for the technical papers, tile average length ratio( abstract/original ) w;~s 24 %, and tile coverage of tl,e key sentence and the most important key sentence were 51% and 74% respectively.
Whereas, ~s for the editorials, tile average length ratio( abstract/original ) was 30 %, and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 41% and 60% respectively.
The reason why the compression rate and the kc.y sentence coverage of the technical papers were higher than that of the editorials is considered as follows.
The technical papers contains so many rhetorical expressions in general as to be expository.
347 That is, they provide many linguistic clues and the system can extract the rhetorical structure exactly.
Accordingly, the structure can be reduced further and the length of the abstract gets shorter, without omitting key sentences.
On the other hand, in the editorials most of the relations between sentences are supposed to be understood semantically, and are not expressed rhetorically.
Therefore, they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract the rhetorical structure exactly.

The rhetorical structure provkles a natural order of importance among senteuces in the text, and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract, according to the desired length of the abstract.
The rhetorical structure also provkles the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences, and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them.
Abstract generation b~sed on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits.
First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g.
\[Kuhn 58\]), the geuerated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text.
Second, once the rhetorical structure is obtained, varions lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily.
This can be done by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract.
Third, unlike conventional knowledge or script-b`ased abstr,~t generation systems(e.g.
\[Lehnert 80\], \[Fum 86\]), the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original text, aud can be used for texts of any domain, so long as they contain enongh rhetoricM expressions to be expository writings.
Fourth, the generated abstract is composed of rhetoriealy consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure, so the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone.
The limitations of the system are mainly due to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation, the evalnation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structure analysis carried out previously( \[Sumita 92\] ) showed 74%.
Also, to make the length of the abstract shorter, It, is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysis and to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract generation b,~sed on it.
The anaphora-resolution and the toplc-sul)l)leineutation must also be realized in the analysis.
The system is now utilized,as a text browser for a prototypical interactive document retrieval system.
