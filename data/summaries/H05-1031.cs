For example, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) deals predominantly with local salience (local attentional status), and the givenness hierarchy (information status) of Prince (1992) focuses on how a referent got in the discourse model (e.g.

Multi-document summarization has been an active area of research over the past decade (Mani and Maybury, 1999) and yet, barring a few exceptions (Daum·e III et al., 2002; Radev and McKeown, 1998), most systems still use shallow features to produce an extractive summary, an age-old technique (Luhn, 1958) that has well-known problems.

Siddharthan et al.(2004) observed that in DUC’04 and DUC’03 data2, news reports contain on average one appositive phrase or relative clause every 3.9 sentences, while the human summaries contain only one per 8.9 sentences on average.

It has been observed (Siddharthan et al., 2004) that on average these constructs occur 2.3 times less frequently in human summaries than in machine summaries.

Nenkova and McKeown (2003) have studied this distinction for references to people in summaries and how it can be used to automatically rewrite summaries to achieve better uency and readability.

This is not necessarily true for the full range of cognitive status distinctions; for example Poesio and Vieira (1998) report lower human agreement on more ne-grained classi cations of de nite descriptions.

Intuitively, pronominalization indicates that an entity was particularly salient at a speci c point of the discourse, as has been widely discussed in attentional status and centering literature (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Gordon et al., 1993).
