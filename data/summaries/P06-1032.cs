A detailed description of the system can be found in (Menezes & Quirk 2005) and (Quirk et al., 2005).

2 1 These constructions are also problematic for handcrafted MT systems (Bond et al., 1994).

In this paper, we show that a noisy channel model instantiated within the paradigm of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993) can successfully provide editorial assistance for non-native writers.

Rather than learning how strings in one language map to strings in another, however, “translation” now involves learning how systematic patterns of errors in ESL learners’ English map to corresponding patterns in native English 2.2 A Noisy Channel Model of ESL Errors If ESL error correction is seen as a translation task, the task can be treated as an SMT problem using the noisy channel model of (Brown et al., 1993): here the L2 sentence produced by the learner can be regarded as having been corrupted by noise in the form of interference from his or her L1 model and incomplete language models internalized during language learning.

N-best results for phrasal alignment and ordering models in the decoder were optimized by lambda training via Maximum Bleu, along the lines described in (Och, 2003).

Some researchers have begun to apply statistical techniques to identify learner errors in the context of essay evaluation (Chodorow & Leacock, 2000; Lonsdale & Strong-Krause, 2003), to detect non-native text (Tomokiyo & Jones, 2001), and to support lexical selection by ESL learners through first-language translation (Liu et al., 2000).

Similar alternations are rife in bilingual data, e.g., ne…pas in French (Fox, 2002) and separable prefixes in German (Collins et al.2005). As SMT models become more adept at modeling long-distance effects in a principled manner, monolingual proofing will benefit as well.
