Labels were placed using the GUI-based annotation tool REFEREE (DeCristofaro et al., 1999).

len.: median length of sequences of co-specifying referring expressions with Cohen's n (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996).

Their factors are taken from Ge et al.(1998), with two exceptions.

There has been no comparison between corpusbased approaches for anaphora resolution and more traditional algorithms based on focusing (Sidner, 1983) or centering (Grosz et al., 1995) except for Azzam et al.(1998). However, their comparison is flawed by evaluating a syntax-based focus algorithm on the basis of insufficient syntactic information.
J95-2003 P98-1011
Cardie & Wagstaff (1999) describe an unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution.
W99-0611
Yeh & Mellish (1997) propose a set of handcrafted rules for the generation of anaphora (zero and personal pronouns, full NPs) in Chinese.
J97-1007
eg. Agresti (1990) or Kessler et al.(1997)). In this model, the value of the binary target variable is predicted by a linear combination of the predictor variables.
P97-1005
For pronoun generation, the original centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) provides a rule which is supposed to decide whether a referring expression has to be realized as a pronoun.
J95-2003
Ge et al.(1998) describe a supervised probabilistic pronoun resolution algorithm which is based on complete syntactic information.

However, we suspect that the crucial factor at play here is discourse structure (McCoy & Strube, 1999).
