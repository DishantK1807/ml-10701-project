GRAMMAR The original work on Slot Grammar was done around 1976-1978 and appeared in McCord (1980).

Recently, a new version (McCord 1989b, 1990) was developed in a logic programming framework, in connection with the machine translation system LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989c, 1989d).

And the shell contains a system for evaluating parses, extending Heidorn's (1982) parse metric.

See McCord (1984) and Lappin et al.(1989) for earlier systems that compute deep grammatical roles from PEG's surface parse structures.

A more detailed presentation of the filter algorithm is given in Lappin and McCord (1990).

Mechanisms of this kind are required for implementations of Chomsky's binding theory in Government Binding-based parsers, such as those described in Correa (1988) and Ingria and Stallard (1989).

In this paper 1 we present algorithms for handling three different sorts of anaphora within Slot Grammar (McCord 1980, 1989b, 1990).

See Lappin and McCord (1990) for comparisons between the pronominal anaphora filter in Slot Grammar and recent implementations of Chomsky's binding theory in GB-based parsers.

See McCord (1989b) for more discussion of the relation of Slot Grammar to other systems.
