It is worth noting that this corresponds to the FRAME1 configuration described in our previous study.(Snider and Diab, 2006) Finally, only active verbs are included in this study, rather than attempt to reconstruct the argument structure of passives.

It is worth noting that comparing our current results to those obtained in Snider & Diab (2006), we show a significant improvement given the same precision oriented metric.

Following a technique suggested by Merlo and Stevenson(2001), we take advantage of this tendency by adding a feature that is the number of times each verb occurs with a pronominal subject.

This error analysis uses the error metric from Snider & Diab (2006) that allows us to test just the HYP verbs that match the GOLD set.

WeshowedinSnider & Diab (2006) that soft clustering performs best on this task compared to hard clustering, therefore we employ soft clustering techniques to induce the verb classes here.

Contrary to the result in Snider & Diab (2006), subject animacy has a significant positive contribution (p < .002).

Merlo and Stevenson (2001) found that this feature improved their English verb clusters, but in Snider & Diab (2006), we found this feature to not contribute significantly to Arabic verb clustering quality.

This paper is an extension of our previous work in Snider and Diab (2006), which found a preliminary effect of syntactic frames on the precision of MSA verb clustering.

The AG corpus is morphologically disambiguated using MADA.5 MADA is an SVM based system that disambiguates among different morphological analyses produced by BAMA.(Habash and Rambow, 2005) We extract the lemma forms of all the words in AG 5http://www.ccls.columbia.edu/cadim/resources 798 andusethemfortheLSAalgorithm.

No796 tably the work of Merlo and Stevenson (2001) attempts to induce three main English verb classes on a large scale from parsed corpora, the class of Ergative, Unaccusative, and Object-drop verbs.

This project is inspired by previous approaches to automatically induce lexical semantic classes for English verbs, which have met with success (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde, 2000), comparing their results with manually created Levin verb classes.
