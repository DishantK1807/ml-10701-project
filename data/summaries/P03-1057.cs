However, they can be utilized not only as developers’ aids but also for automatic tuning of MT systems (Su et al., 1992).

For example, Su et al.(1992), Yasuda et al.(2001), and Akiba et al.(2001) measure similarity between MT results and the references by DP matching (edit distances) and then output the evaluation scores.

Evaluation of MT Quality We utilize BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for the automatic evaluation of MT quality in this paper.

There are two approaches to overcoming incorrect/redundant rules: • Selecting appropriate rules in a disambiguation process during the translation (on-line processing, (Meyers et al., 2000)).

Another current topic of machine translation is automatic evaluation of MT quality (Papineni et al., 2002; Yasuda et al., 2001; Akiba et al., 2001).
P02-1040
Ambiguities, which occur during parsing or mapping, are resolved by selecting the rules that minimize the semantic distance between the input words and source examples (real examples in the training corpus) of the transfer rules (Furuse and Iida, 1994).
