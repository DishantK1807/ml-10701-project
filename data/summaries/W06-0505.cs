The problem can be considered as a constrained optimization problem, where we have to find a set of parameters which maximizes the log likelihood of the conditional distribution (McCallum, 2003).

Mihalcea and Moldovan (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999) use the semantic density between words to determine the word sense.

VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) seems a more promising resource to use when classifying verbs, and we will also investigate the use of other lexical databases, such as ThoughtTreasure (Mueller, 1998), Cyc (Lenat, 1995), Openmind Commonsense (Stork, 1999) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

This task is closely related to both named entity recognition (NER), which traditionally assigns nouns to a small number of categories and word sense disambiguation (Agirre and 1http://class.inrialpes.fr/ Rigau, 1996; Yarowsky, 1995), where the sense for a word is chosen from a much larger inventory of word senses.

The sentences in the training and testing sets were already (perfectly) POS-tagged and noun chunked, and that in a real-life situation additional preprocessing by a POS-tagger (such as the LT-POS-tagger4) and noun chunker (such as described in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995)) which will introduce additional errors.

As reported in (McCarthy et al., 2004), a baseline approach that ignors context but simply assigns the most likely sense to a given word obtains a accuracy of 67%.
W04-0837
Wilks and Stevenson (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998) use a combination of knowledge sources and achieve an accuracy of 92%3.

Furthermore, CRFs have been used successfully in information extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), named entity recognition (Li and McCallum, 2003; McCallum and Li, 2003) and sentence parsing (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
