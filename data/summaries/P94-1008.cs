In 2These examples have been taken or adapted from Kehler (1993b).

In a previous paper (Kehler, 1993b), five contexts for VP-ellipsis were examined to determine whether the representations retrieved are syntactic or semantic in nature.

291): lZThese examples have been adapted from several in Kehler (1993b).
E93-1025 P93-1009
In Kehler (1993b), we presented an analysis of VPellipsis that distinguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel.
E93-1025 P93-1009
The analysis accounts for the range of data given in Kehler (1993b), although one point of departure exists between that account and the current one with respect to clauses conjoined with but.

resolution to an account of discourse structure and coherence, namely our previous account (Kehler, 1993b) and the accounts of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993).
E93-1025 P93-1009
This process is reliant on performing comparison and generalization operations on the corresponding representations (Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Hobbs, 1990; Priist, 1992; Asher, 1993).

This constraint rules out cases where VP-ellipsis obtains syntactically mismatched antecedents, such as example (19) and other non-parallel cases given in Kehler (1993b).

Ellipsis and Interclausal Coherence It has been noted in previous work that the felicity of certain forms of ellipsis is dependent on the type of coherence relationship extant between the antecedent and elided clauses (Levin and Prince, 1982; Kehler, 1993b).
E93-1025 P93-1009
We illustrate the relevant syntactic and semantic properties of these forms using the version of Categorial Semantics described in Pereira (1990).
J90-1001
In future work we will address other forms of ellipsis and event reference, as well as integrate a previous account of strict and sloppy ambiguity into this framework (Kehler, 1993a).
