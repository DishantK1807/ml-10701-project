1990; Kitani |994), except Kitani's work, they do not clearly show how to lind the referents in computa.tionally i)lausible ways for a large amount of data, suc, h as a newst)aper database.
In this l)aper 1, we determilm the referents of dousha and their locations I)y hand, and then propose one simph" and two heuristic methods which use SClllantic information in text,';uc.h as collll)ally ilalllC8 and their patterns, so as to I,est these three methods on how accurately they lind t.he correct referents.
Dousha is f(mnd with several l)artich~s such as "\]~e", "ga", "*to", and "go" in neWSl)al)er artMes.
Those which co-occur with ha and ga arc choseu for the data since they are l.hc. two most fre(luent particles when dousha is in the sul)jeet position in a sentenc(:, q'ypically, ha marks the topic of the sentence and ga marks the subject of tim sellt(~l/(;e.
A typical use of dousha is as follows: Nihon Kentakii I'~Hraido (;hikin ha, Japan Kentucky Fried (;hicken ha, sekai s;d(lai no piza chien, world's largesl, pizza chain store, Piza Ilatto to teikei wo musul)i, Pizza llut to tie-up estal)lish, kotoshi gogatsu kara zenkoku de starting May t, his year, nation-wide, takuhai piza chien no tenkai wo pizza, deliw?l'y chain store extension l,|,his paper was written wheu the author was at the (;mnl)uting lescm'ch t~&bot';d.ol'y of New Mcxi(:(,.~tld.e (Jnlwwslty.

1134 1,'or doush(~ with ga (Table 1), the referred coinpany nan'les, mr the referents appear in non-sul/ject positions fi:om time to time, especially if the referent appears in the same sentence as dousha does.
For dousha with ha (Table 2), compared with Table 1, very l>w referents are located in the same sentence, and most of the referents are in the subject position.
For both occurrences of dousha, a considerable number of the referellts appear two or more sentelice8 beR)re, and a few of them show up even two or three paragraphs before.
3 THREE
HEURISTIC METHODS TESTED 3.1 Three Heuristic Methods Oile simple and two heuristic iilethods to fill(I the rcl L erents of dousha are described below.
The lirst, the simple method, is to take the closest COml/any name, (the one which appears most recently before dousha), as its referent (SilnI)le Closest Method or SCM).
It is used ill this paper to indicate the t)~Lseline pcrlbrmance tbr reference resolution of dousha.
The second method is a modified Siml)le Closest Method for dousha with ca.
It is basically the same as SCM except that: • if there is (tile or there, conlpany liaine hi the sairie seiltellce before the dousha, take |.lie closest COllipally nanw.
as the referent.
• if there is a conipany llaille inllnediately followed by ha, ca, deha, or niyorulo somewhere bel5re dousDa, use the closest such company name as the referent.
• if the previous sentence ends with a cOral)any ll;_~llle, thus l)utting aii enlphasis on the COlllpally liaine, make it the rcl\]2relit.
• if there is a pattern "COlilpaily liame lie hlllliali lialIle title"...
(equivalent to <'title hiilllaii lialno of cOUll)any elaine"... in I'\]nglish) in the proveOils SOlltellce, then iiso the COllipaliy n~iliie as tim reforelit.
Typical titles are sh.achou (president) alld kaichou (Chairinan uP I/oard).
The theM heuristic method is used t~r dousha with ha cases.
It is also based on SCM except the following points: • if there is a company name innnediately tbL lowed by ha, ga, deha, or uiyoruto somewhere.
before dousha, use the closest such colnl)any name as the referent.
* if the previous sentence ends with a company name, thus putting an eniphasis Oil the coinliany nalne, make it the reli'~rent.
• if there is a pattern "coral)any nanie no human name title"...
(equivalent to "title human name of company name"... in English) in the provemils seiltelice~ theil /ise the cowilialiy Ilanie as the refi;rent.
The third method is in fact a set of the second method, and both of them use semantic information (i.e.
company name, human name., title), syntactic patterns (i.e.
where a conll)any name, a human name, or a title appears in a sentence) and several specific lexical items which come immediately after tim company Ilallies.
3.2 Test
Results The three lnethods haw'.
heen tested on the developmerit data from which the lnethods were produced and on the set.
of unseen test data.
3.2.1 Against
the dew;lolmient data As mentioned in section two, there are 42 cases of dousha with ga and 66 cases of dousha with ha.
For the dousha with ga rases, the Simple Closest Method identifie.s the referents 67% correctly (27 correct out of 42), and the second inethod does so 90% (38 out of 42) ccorrectly.,qCM misses a number of referents whMi appear iii previous sentences, and most of those which appear two or inore sentelices previously.
For the cases of dousha with ha, SCM identities the referents correctly only 52% (34 correct out of 66), however, the third heuristic method correctly ideiltilies 94% (62 out of 66).
3.2.2 Against
the test; data The test data was taken front Japanese newspaper articles on micro-electronics.
There are 1078 arti-c.les, and 51 cases of dousha with ga and 250 cases of dousha with ha.
The test has been conducted against the.
all get cases (51 of them) and the first t O0 Bet cases.
For the dousha with ga cases, the Simple Closest Method identifies the referents 80% correctly (4 I correct out of 51), and the second method does so 96% (49 out of 51) correctly.
For the c~Lses of dousha with ha, SCM identifies the referents correctly only 83% (83 correct out of 100), however, tl,e third heuristic method correctly ide.ntifies 96% (96 out of 100).
The following table, Table 3, shows the summary of the test.
results. 1135 Table 3 Summary of'rest Results \[ Development Data Test Dat_a dousha with ga SCM I 67% 80% 2ndmethod I 90% 96% dousha with ha SCM 52% 83 % 3rdmethod 94% 96% 4 DISCUSSION Tile second and third heuristic methods show high accuracy in finding the referents of dousha with ga and ha.
This means that partial semantic parsing (in which key semantic information such as company name, human name, and title is marked) is snflicient for reference resolution of important referential expressions such as dousha in Japanese.
Moreover, since the two modified methods are simple, they will be easily implemented by computationally inexpensive finite-state pattern matchers (Hobbs el aL 1992; Cowie ct al.
1993). Therefore, they will be suitable for large scale text processing (Jaeobs 1992; Chinchor el al.
1993). One important point to realize is that the second and third methods, although they are simple to implement, achieve something that is rather complicated and may be computatlonally expensive otherwise.
For example, in order to find the correct referent of a given dousha, you may have to skip one entire paragraph and find the referent two paragraphs before, or you may have to choose the right company name from several possible company names which appear before the given dousha.
The modified methods do this correctly most of the time without worrying about constructing sometimes complicated syntactic structures of the sentences in the search window for the possible referent.
Another important point is that the modified methods make good use of post-nominal particles, especially ha and ga.
For example, if the referent is located two sentences or more before, then the referent (the company name) comes with ha ahnost all the time (35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha).
It seems that if tile referent of the dousha in consideration is more than a certain distance before, two sentences in this case, then tile referent is marked with ha most of the time.
Kitani also uses this ha or ga marked company names as key information in his reference resolution algorithm for dousha (Kitani 1994).
5 CONCLUSION
The locations and contexts of tile referents of dousha in Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined by hand.
Three henristic methods are proposed and tested.
The methods which use semantic information in the text and its patterns show high accuracy in finding the referents (96% for dousha with ga and 96% for dousha with ha for the unseen test data).
The high success rates snggest that a semantic patternmatching approach is not only a valid method but also an ef\[icicnt method for reference resolution in the newspaper article domains.
Since the Japanese language is highly case-inflected, case (particle) infof mation is used effectively in these methods for reference resolution.
-How much one can do with semantic pattern matching for reference resolution of similar expressions such as "the company" or "tile Japanese company" in English newspaper articles is a topic for fllture research.
