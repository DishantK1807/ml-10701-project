This package was a consolidation of work carried out in a series of early applications (Power and Scott, 1998; Piwek et al., 2000; Bouayad-Agha et al., 2002), requiring a very restricted linguistic coverage, especially as regards the range of clausal and nominal patterns.

Wysiwym (What You See Is What You Meant) is a user-interface technology through which a domain expert can formally encode knowledge by structured editing of an automatically generated feedback text (Power and Scott, 1998).
P98-2173
Elsewhere (Evans and Power, 2003) we have described a library package for developing Wysiwym applications.
E03-2005
The system has been implemented as an extension to our Wysiwym library (Evans and Power, 2003), using a wide-coverage grammar based on the subcategorisation frames found in the XTAG (Doran et al., 1994) categories, and deployed in the domain of medical informatics.
