The inclusion of the LIG-class in the DI-class is proper, since L 3 above is not a LIG-language, or to give a more simple example: Lw= {analnla2nlbln2b2n2b n \[ n = nl + n2} is according to (Vijay-Shanker, Weir and Joshi, 1987) not in TAL, hence not in LIL.

in (Weir and Joshi, 1988)) called linear indexed granunars (LIG's), using index stacks in which only one nonterminai on the right-hand-side of a rule can inherit the stack from the left-hand-side, i.e. the rules of a LIG G=(N,T, F, P, S) with N,F,T,S as above, are of the Form i.

If for each n~_>l composition rules of the form (x/y) (...(Yllzll)12....Inzn)--, (...(XllZll)12....Inzn) and (...(YllZll)12....Inzn) (x\y)~ (...(XllZll)12....Inzn) are permitted, the generative power of the resulting grammars is known to be stronger than TAGs (Weir and Joshi, 1988).

Composition and Combinatory Categorial Grammars The relation of DI-granunars to Steedman's Combinatory Categorial Grammars with Generalized Composition (GC-CCG for short) in the sense of (Weir and Joshi, 1988) is not so easy to determine.

Stabler, 1987) in order to delimit the new territory, can be shown to be inadequate for this purpose, since it is provable that the class of languages generable by XGs coincides with Type 0 (i,e.

Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir (Joshi, VijayÂ°Shanker, and Weir, 1989; Weir and Joshi, 1988) have shown that LIGs, Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG), Tree Adjoinig Grammars (TAGs), and Head Grammars (HGs) are weakly equivalent.
