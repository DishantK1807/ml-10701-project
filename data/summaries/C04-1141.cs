The comparison to the t-test is especially interesting because it was found to achieve the best overall precision scores in other studies (see Evert and Krenn (2001)).

Lin (1998) acquires a lexical dependency database by assembling dependency relationships from a parsed corpus.
P98-2127
Using an automatically constructed similarity thesaurus, Lin (1999) then separates compositional from non-compositional collocations by taking into account the second linguistic property described in Section 1, viz.

4Cf. also Evert and Krenn (2001) for empirical evidence justifying the exclusion of low-frequency data.

This is in contrast to the findings reported by Krenn and Evert (2001), which gave the t-test an edge.6 As can be clearly seen, however, our linguistic modifiability measure substantially outperforms all other measures at all points in the ranked list.

Almost all of these measures can be grouped into one of the following three categories: a0 frequency-based measures (e.g., based on absolute and relative co-occurrence frequencies) a0 information-theoretic measures (e.g., mutual information, entropy) a0 statistical measures (e.g., chi-square, t-test, log-likelihood, Dice’s coefficient) The corresponding metrics have been extensively discussed in the literature both in terms of their mathematical properties (Dunning, 1993; Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999) and their suitability for the task of collocation extraction (see Evert and Krenn (2001) and Krenn and Evert (2001) for recent evaluations).

The corpus was first processed by means of the TNT partof-speech tagger (Brants, 2000).

Work Although there have been many studies on collocation extraction and mining using only statistical approaches (Church and Hanks, 1990; Ikehara et al., 1996), there has been much less work on collocation acquisition which takes into account the linguistic properties typically associated with collocations.

Thus, ‘gut’ in ‘to spill gut’ cannot be substituted by ‘intestine’ (see also Lin (1999)).

Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990).
P90-1032
Smadja (1993), which is the classic work on collocation extraction, uses a two-stage filtering model in which, in the first step, n-gram statistics determine possible collocations and, in the second step, these candidates are submitted to a syntactic valida7Of course, lexical material is always at least partially dependent on the domain in question.
