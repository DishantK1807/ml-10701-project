classes. McMahon and Smith also use the bigram statistics of a corpus to find the hierarchical clusters (McMahon, 1996).

Also bigrams are used with greedy algorithm to form the hierarchical clusters of words (Brown, 1992).

In our paper named "A Method for Improving Automatic Word Categorization"(Korkmaz&Uqoluk, 1997) such a method, using a modified greedy-type algorithm supported by the notions of fuzzy logic, has been proposed.

For the researched presented in our previous paper (Korkmaz&0~oluk, 1997) Manhattan Metric was the only metric used for the distance function.

Though this top-to-bottom method seems theoretically possible, in the presented work (Korkmaz~Uqoluk, 1997) a different approach, which is bottom-up, is used.
