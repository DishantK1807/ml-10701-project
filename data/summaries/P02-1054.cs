Substituting the probabilities in the PMI formula with the previously introduced Web statistics, we obtain: a15a17a16a25a18a26a11a22a21 Qspa49a6a50a22a51a6a52 Aspa24 a15a17a16a25a18a26a11a22a21 Qspa24a56a55a57a15a33a16a19a18a26a11a6a21 Aspa24 a55 a38 a1a6a39a17a34a40a1a8a41a45a43a46a11 Maximal Likelihood Ratio (MLHR) is also used for word co-occurrence mining (Dunning, 1993).
