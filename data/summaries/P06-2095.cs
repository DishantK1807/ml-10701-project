Identification of semantically similar situations can be also improved by the use of segment-matching algorithms as employed in Example-Based MT (EBMT) and translation memories (Planas and Furuse, 2000; Carl and Way, 2003).

The proposed model looks similar to some implementations of statistical machine translation (SMT), which typically uses a parallel corpus for its translation model, and then finds the best possible recombination that fits into the target language model (Och and Ney, 2003).
