This is where our approach differs strongly from (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996).

Given this item, we start the opposite process, called “descent”, which use the available data gathered by the climbing (the derivation starting nodes, the argumental position marked by an index on nodes in TAG gram8The first phase is the generation of the set of rules, (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993), and the second one is the forest traversal (Lang, 1992).

148 the conjoin operation defined in (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996) involves merging nodes from different trees while the tree anchored by a coordinator acts similarly to an auxiliary tree with two foot nodes.

We first briefly discuss the linguistic motivations behind the resolution mechanism we propose, then introduce the fusion operation and show how it can be compared to the analysis of (Dalrymple et al., 1991) and (Steedman, 1990) and we show how it differs from (Sarkar and Joshi, 1996).
C96-2103
We show how to generate a derivation forest described by a set of context free rules (similar to (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993)) augmented by a stack of current adjunctions when a rule describes a spine traversal.

Following (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993; Lang, 1991), each tree anchored by the elements of the input sentence is described by a set of rewriting rules.
