There has been recent interest in determining anaphoricity before performing anaphora resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Uryupina, 2003), but results have not been entirely satisfactory.

In particular, we plan to use additional lexical and relational features derived from knowledge sources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) which should be especially helpful in distinguishing mediated from new entities, the most difficult decision to make.

A third of the corpus is syntactically parsed as part of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) 2This type corresponds to Prince’s (1981; 1992) inferrables.

Postolache et al.(2005) have recently shown that learning information structure with high accuracy is feasible for Czech.

We had based our decision of emphasising the importance of the NP type on the linguistic evidence that different syntactic realisations reflect different degrees of availability of discourse entities (Giv´on, 1983; Ariel, 1990; Grosz et al., 1995).

Recently, (Postolache et al., 2005) have reported experiments on learning information structure in the Prague TreeBank.

Since it correlates with word order and pitch accent (Lambrecht, 1994; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), for instance, incorporating knowledge on information status would be helpful for natural language generation, and in particular text-tospeech systems.

The tag mediated was instead used whenever an entity that is newly mentioned in the dialogue can be inferred by the hearer thanks to prior or general context.2 Typical examples of mediated entities are generally known objects (such as “the sun”, or “the Pope” (L¨obner, 1985)), and bridging anaphors (Clark, 1975; Vieira and Poesio, 2000), where an entity is related to a previously introduced one.

Ourannotationofinformationstatusmainlybuilds on (Prince, 1992), and employs a distinction into old, mediated, and new entities similar to the work of (Strube, 1998; Eckert and Strube, 2001).

Inter-annotator agreement was measured using the kappa (K) statistics (Cohen, 1960; Carletta, 1996) on 1,502 instances (three Switchboard dialogues) marked by two annotators who followed specific written guidelines.
