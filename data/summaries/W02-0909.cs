The second method considers the means and variance of the distance between two words, and can compute flexible collocations (Smadja, 1993).

Edmonds and Hirst (2002 to appear) developed a lexical choice process for natural language generation (NLG) or machine translation (MT) that can decide which near-synonyms are most appropriate in a particular situation.

I-Saurus, a prototype implementation of (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002 to appear), uses a small number of hand-built clusters of near-synonyms.

For each cell in the contingency table, the expected counts are: mi j = ni+n+ jn++ . The measures are calculated as (Pedersen, 1996): χ2 = Σi;j (ni j mi j) 2 mi j LL = 2 Σi;j log2 n 2i j mi j Log-likelihood ratios (Dunning, 1993) are more appropriate for sparse data than chi-square.

Our evaluation was partly inspired by Evert and Krenn (2001).
