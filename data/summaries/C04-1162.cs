Another related line of work is the word sense disambiguation algorithm proposed in (Veronis and Ide, 1990), where a large neural network is built by relating words through their dictionary definitions.

(2) Global context – where the semantic measures are employed to derive lexical chains, which are threads of meaning often drawn throughout an entire text (Morris and Hirst, 1991).
J91-1002
We are using a subset of the SemCor texts (Miller et al., 1993) – five randomly selected files covering different topics: news, sports, entertainment, law, and debates – as well as the data set provided for the English all words task during SENSEVAL-2.

Automatically or semiautomatically acquired selectional preferences, as means for constraining the number of possible senses that a word might have, based on the relation it has with other words in context (Resnik, 1997).

These methods consist of simple rules that can reliably assign a sense to certain word categories: one sense per collocation (Yarowsky, 1993), and one sense per discourse (Gale et al., 1992).
H92-1045 H93-1052
One solution is to use simulated annealing, as proposed in (Cowie et al., 1992).
C92-1056
Depending on the size of the context they span, these measures are in turn divided into two main categories: (1) Local context – where the semantic measures are used to disambiguate words additionally connected by syntactic relations (Stetina et al., 1998).
W98-0701
The most closely related method is perhaps the lexical chains algorithm (Morris and Hirst, 1991) – where threads of meaning are identified throughout a text.
