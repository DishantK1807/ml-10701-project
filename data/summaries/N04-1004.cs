One such alternative is the use of constraints: rules that eliminate candidates from the list of possible antecedents (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988).

Of the systems that are more relevant to the specific problem of gesture-speech alignment (Cohen et al., 1997; Johnston and Bangalore, 2000; Kettebekov and Sharma, 2001), evaluation is always conducted from an HCI perspective, in which participants act as users of a computer system and communicate in short, grammatically-constrained multimodal commands.

Salience weights may be defined by hand, as in (Lappin and Leass, 1994), or learned from data (Mitkov et al., 2002).

Mitkov showed that a salience-based approach can be applied across genres and without complex syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis (Mitkov, 1998).

Ge, Hale, and Charniak propose a data-driven approach to anaphora resolution (Ge et al., 1998).
W98-1119
Johnston and Bangalore describe a multimodal parsing algorithm that is built using a 3-tape, finite state transducer (FST) (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).
C00-1054
One approach to anaphora resolution is to assign a salience value to each noun phrase that is a candidate for acting as a grounding referent, and then to choose the noun phrase with the greatest salience (Lappin and Leass, 1994).
