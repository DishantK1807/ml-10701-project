Six project members have applied a total of seven different systems to this task, most of them in the context of the combination paper Tjong Kim Sang et al.(2000). Daelemans applied the decision tree learner C5.0 to the task.

The first work on this topic was done back in the eighties (Church, 1988).

The data set that has become standard for evaluation machine learning approaches is the one first used by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
W95-0107
Tjong Kim Sang (2000b) tested different configurations of combined memory-based learners (MBL).
A00-2007 C00-2124 W00-0726 W00-0733
The original Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) publication evaluated their NP chunker on two data sets, the second holding a larger amount of training data (Penn Treebank sections 02-21) while using 00 as test data.

For every class the weights of the active features are combined and the best scoring class is chosen (Berger et al., 1996).
J96-1002
Tjong Kim Sang (2000a) has applied a combination of memory-based learners to this data set and obtained Fa25a33a26a29a28 = 94.90, an improvement on Ramshaw and Marcusâ€™s 93.3. 3.3 NP bracketing Finding arbitrary noun phrases was the shared task of CoNLL-99, held in Bergen, Norway in 1999.

Ongoing work has focused on applying random field technology (maximum entropy) to MDL-based grammar learning (see Osborne (2000a) for some of the issues involved).
C00-1085 W00-0731
We have applied MDL to the task of learning broad-covering definite-clause grammars from either raw text, or else from parsed corpora (Osborne, 1999a).
W99-0708
Hammerton (2001) predicted NP chunks with the connectionist methods based on self-organising maps (SOM).
W01-0702
The project provided a data set for this task at the CoNLL-2000 workshop (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000)1.
A00-2007 C00-2124 W00-0726 W00-0733
In the course of this project we have evaluated another combination method: BEST-N MAJORITY VOTING (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).

tion. The best result at the workshop was obtained with Support Vector Machines (Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000).
W00-0730
Standard data sets for machine learning approaches to this task were put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
W95-0107
Osborne (1999b) used a Definite Clause Grammar learner based on Minimum Description Length for finding noun phrases in samples of Penn Treebank material (MDL).
W99-0708
The industrial partner, Xerox, focused on more immediate applications (Cancedda and Samuelsson, 2000).
W00-0702
When we applied best-3 majority voting to the standard test set, we obtained Fa25a27a26a29a28 = 93.65 which is close to the best result we know for this data set (Fa25a33a26a29a28 = 93.86) (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).
A00-2007 C00-2124 W00-0726 W00-0733
The preliminary results are encouraging though not as good as advanced statistical parsers like those of Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000).
A00-2018
Koeling (2000) evaluated a maximum entropy learner while using different feature combinations (ME).
W00-0729
Tjong Kim Sang (2000a) detected noun phrases with a bottom-up cascade of combinations of memory-based classifiers (MBL).
A00-2007 C00-2124 W00-0726 W00-0733
And finally, TAGPAIR uses classification pair weights based on the probability of a classification for some predicted classification pair (van Halteren et al., 1998).
P98-1081
Osborne (2000b) used a maximum entropy-based part-of-speech tagger for assigning chunk tags to words (ME Tag).
C00-1085 W00-0731
It consists of sections 15-18 of the Wall Street Journal part of the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1993) as training data (211727 tokens) and section 20 as test data (47377 tokens).
J93-2004
We applied majority voting to the output of the six systems while using the same approach as Tjong Kim Sang (2000b): combining start and end positions of chunks separately and restoring the chunks from these results.
A00-2007 C00-2124 W00-0726 W00-0733
Chunking was the shared task of CoNLL-2000, the workshop on Computational Natural Language Learning, held in Lisbon, Portugal in 2000 (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).
