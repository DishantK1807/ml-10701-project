Many recent works have attempted this approach (Stolcke et al., 2000; Webb et al., 2005).

Although this alternative is proposed in (Stolcke et al., 2000), no experimental results are given.

Similar to other NLP problems (like speech recognition and understanding, or statistical machine translation), an alternative data-based approachhasbeendevelopedinthelastdecade(Stolcke et al., 2000; Young, 2000).

This proportion was adopted so that our results could be compared with the results in (Stolcke et al., 2000), where similar training and test sizes were used.

As expected, the utterance accuracy results are a bit worse than those presented in (Stolcke et al., 2000).

models The statistical annotation model that we used initially was inspired by the one presented in (Stolcke et al., 2000).

The results presented in (Stolcke et al., 2000) are very promising.

Most of these strategies are rule-based, i.e., the dialogue strategy is defined by rules that are usually defined by a human expert (Gorin et al., 1997; Hardy et al., 2003).

Although many proposals have been made (Walker et al., 1997; Fraser, 1997; Stolcke et al., 2000), there is no real agreement in the NLP community about the evaluation technique to apply.
