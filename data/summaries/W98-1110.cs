The error-corrector is a rule-based transformer (Brill, 1992), and it corrects the mis-tagged morphemes by considering the lexical patterns and the necessary contextual information.

Our statistical tagging model is adjusted from standard bi-grams using the Viterbi-search (Cutting et al., 1992) plus on-the-fly extra computing of lexical probabilities for unknown morphemes.

The POS disambiguation has usually been performed by statistical approaches mainly using hidden markov model (HMM) (Cutting et al., 1992; Kupiec.

1994). Some systems even perform the POS tagging as part of a syntactic analysis process (Voutilainen, 1995).

Instead, we adopted Brill's approach (Brill, 1992) to auto.

performance is usually no better than the statistical counterparts (Brill, 1992).

The training is leveraged (Brill, 1992) so the error-correcting rules are gradually learned as the statistical tagged texts are corrected by the rules learned so far.
