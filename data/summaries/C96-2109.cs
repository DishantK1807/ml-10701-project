There are around a dozen different implementations of DATR in existence and largescale DATR lexicons have been designed for use in a number of natural language processing applications (Cahill and Evans, 1990; Andry et al., 1992; Cahill, 1994).
A94-1045 J92-3001
A denotational semantics for DATR that covers all of the major constructs has been presented in (Keller, 1995).

This fulfills one of the original objectives of the DATR programme, as set out in (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a; Evans and Gazdar, 1989b), to provide the language with an explMt theory of inference.
E89-1009
The original publications on DATR sought to provide the language with (1) a formal theory of inference (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a) and (2) a model-theoretic semantics (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b).
E89-1009
Consider for eXaml)le the following rule of in%rence, adapted from (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a).

In more recent work, DATR has been used to provide a concise, inheritance-based encoding of Lexiealized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Evans et al., 1995).
P95-1011
in DATR The probh'm of constructing an explicit theory of infhrence for DATR was originally addressed in (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a).
E89-1009
Because the proof rules of (Evans and C, azdar, 1989a) just talk about DATR sentences, which do not make explicit reii'~rence to contexl., it is not possible to give.
E89-1009
The formalism has been applied to a wide variety of problems, including inflectional and derivational morphology (Gazdar, 1992; Kilbury, 1992; Corbett and Fraser, 1993), lexical semantics (Kilgariff, 1993), morphonology (Cahill, 1993), prosody (Gibbon and Bleiching, 1991) and speech (Andry et al., 1992).
E93-1012 J92-3001
DATR was originally introduced by Evans and Gazdar (1989a; 1989b) as a simple, nonmonotonic language for representing lexical inheritance hierarchies.
