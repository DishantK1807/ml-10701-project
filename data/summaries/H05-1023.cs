The block extraction procedure is based on the procedures in (Tillmann, 2003).

IBM Model-4 is trained with GIZA++ using the best reported settings in (Och and Ney, 2003).

Today’s statistical machine translation systems rely on high quality phrase translation pairs to acquire state-of-the-art performance, see (Koehn et al., 2003; Zens and Ney, 2004; Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002 N03-1017 N04-1033
A monotone decoder similar to (Tillmann and Ney, 2003) with a trigram language model3 is set up for translations.

Typically, they share a similar architecture of phrase level segmentation, reordering, translation as in (Och and Ney, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Yamada and Knight, 2001).

Word alignments traditionally are based on IBM Models 1-5 (Brown et al., 1993) or on HMMs (Vogel et al., 1996).

We report case sensitive Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002)scoreBleuCforallexperiments.

In this respect, it resembles bilingual bracketing (Wu, 1997), but our model has more lexical items in the blocks with many-to-many word alignment freedom in both inner and outer parts.

For example, (Marcu and Wong, 2002) for a joint phrase based model, (Huang et al., 2003) for a translation memory system; and (Watanabe et al., 2003) for a complex model of insertion, deletion and head-word driven chunk reordering.

We collect bidirectional (bi) refined word alignment by growing the intersection of Chinese-to-English (CE) alignments and English-to-Chinese (EC) alignments with the neighboring unaligned word pairs which appear in the union similar to the “final-and” approaches (Koehn, 2003; Och and Ney, 2003; Tillmann, 2003).
J03-1002 J03-1005 N03-1017 W03-1001
This is similar to the approach in (Toutanova et al., 2002), in which the null word model is part of an extended HMM using left context only.
