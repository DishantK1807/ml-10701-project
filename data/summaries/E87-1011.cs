Independently, an algorithm has been developed for analysing the semantic content proper of the dictionary entries by converting the definition texts in LDOCE into fragments of semantic networks (Alshawi, 1987); this opens opportunities for building a comprehensive and robust semantic component which could then be incorporated into any of the projects mentioned above.

Thus IBM's WordSmith system (Byrd and Chodorow, 1985) is concerned primarily with providing a browsing functionality which supports retrieval of words ~close ~ to a given word along the dimensions of spelling, meaning and sound, while a group at Bell Labs has several large dictionaries on-line used only for research on stress assignment (Church, 1985).

For example, subcategorisation information is often specified in a rather elliptical form in LDOCE, for the sake of human readability; this must be made explicit by a parsing process, as described in Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).
J87-3002
Just one example, from a number of projects currently under way in Cambridge, illustrating this point is the work of Alshawi (1987), who has analysed definition texts across an entire dictionary to produce a ~definition grammar ~ together with an associated technique for parsing the natural language descriptions of words into semantic structures.

The fourth, subcategorisation, is indicated by a complex and highly discriminatory set of codes; the extraction of these codes from the elliptical form in which they occur in LDOCE is described in Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).

Alshawi et al.(1985) have used a machine-readable source directly for syntactic analysis of texts; however, the approach taken there -namely that of simple pro-indexing by orthography -does not generalise easily for applications which require the rapid locating and retrieval of entries satisfying more than one selection criterion.

The machine-readable source of LDOCE serves as the bottom layer of the database after undergoing a 65 "lispification s process described in detail in Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).

The database manager was easily repackaged to reflect the model of one server catering for several clients over a network; the Remote Procedure Call Protocol (XSIS, 1981) provided the necessary functionality to incorporate the manager into a dictionar!t server node (of the kind discussed by Kay, 1984) -this bypassed the need for costly flleservers and proved the integrity of the design.
