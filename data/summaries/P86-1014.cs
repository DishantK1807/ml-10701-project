Pullum (1984b) likewise heaped scorn on my argument that English reshmuplicative constructions show non-CFness, but he accepted (1984a; 1984b) Culy's (1985) argument about noun reduplication in Bambara and Shieber's (1985) one about Swiss German cross-serial constructions of causative and perception verbs and their objects.

Two new arguments, Higginbotham's (1984) one involving such that relativization and Postal and Langendoen's (1984) one about sluicing were dismissed on grounds of descriptive inadequacy by Pullum (1984a), who, however, suggested that the Langendoen and Postal (1984) argument about the doubling relativization construction may be correct (all these arguments deal with English).
