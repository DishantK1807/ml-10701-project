bustness features competes with algorithnfic approaches to robustness where parsing algorithms, (usually chart parsers except in Tomabechi and Tomita (1988) where LR(k) parsing is advocated) are extended to inelude robustness features (Mellish 1989, Long 1988) and/or heuristics to handle defect cases (Banger 1990, Stock et al.1988). Maybe the most critical issue in robust parsing is ambigatity, which emerges when constituency is loosened to some cf substring analysis.

Grammar based robustness tools have been explored in a variety of formalisms, e.g. the metarule device within the ATN formalism (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1898), entity data structures in a case frame approach (Hayes 1984) or the weak description approach in unification based grammars (Kudo et al.1988, Goeser 1990).

On the other hand, there are spoken language constructions (Lindgren 1987, Goeser 1991, Langer 1990) and various kinds of "fragmentary utterances" (Cnrbonell and ltnyes 1983) that definitively show configurational properties.
