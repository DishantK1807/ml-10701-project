This is the model presented in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003).
N03-2036
In this paper, we present a phrase-based unigram system similar to the one in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003), which is extended by an unigram orientation model.
N03-2036
Our baseline model is the unigram monotone model described in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003).
N03-2036
In recent years, phrase-based systems for statistical machine translation (Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003; Venugopal et al., 2003) have delivered state-of-the-art performance on standard translation tasks.
N03-1017 P03-1041 W99-0604
The orientation model is related to the distortion model in (Brown et al., 1993), but we do not compute a block alignment during training.
J93-2003
We use a DP-based beam search procedure similar to the one presented in (Tillmann and Xia, 2003).
N03-2036
(Wu, 1996; Zens and Ney, 2003) present re-ordering models that make use of a straight/inverted orientation model that is related to our work.
