The explanation-based learning method is recently attracting researcherâ€™s attention (Xia, 1999; Chiang, 2000) because their parsers are comparative to the state-of-the-art parsers in terms of precision and recall.

It should be also noted that Kiyono and Tsujii (1993) exemplified the grammar extraction approach using offline parsing in the 3Although the size of the grammar becomes very large, the extracted rules can be found by a hash algorithm very efficiently.

Studies of robust parsing within unification-based grammars have been explored by many researchers (Douglas and Dale, 1992; Imaichi and Matsumoto, 1995).

Without removing them, extracted rules cannot be triggered until when completely the same strings appear in a text.4 6 Performance Evaluation We measured the performance of our robust parsing algorithm by measuring coverage and degree of overgeneration for the Wall Street Journal in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

As other researchers pursued efficient default unification (Bouma, 1990; Russell et al., 1991; Copestake, 1993), we also propose another definition of default unification, which we call lenient default unification.
P90-1021 P91-1028
Default unification has been investigated by many researchers (Bouma, 1990; Russell et al., 1991; Copestake, 1993; Carpenter, 1993; Lascarides and Copestake, 1999) in the context of developing lexical semantics.
