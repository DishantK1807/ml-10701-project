First, it has been shown that Model 4 produces a very good alignment quality in comparison to various other alignment models (Och and Ney, 2000b).

This would be more difficult in the HMM alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996).

In this paper we use the so-called Model 4 from (Brown et al., 1993).

For a detailed description for Model 4 the reader is referred to (Brown et al., 1993).

We only know of the work by (Wang and Waibel, 1997) dealing with heuristic functions for search in statistical machine translation.

Search algorithms We evaluate the following two search algorithms: beam search algorithm (BS): (Tillmann, 2001; Tillmann and Ney, 2000) In this algorithm the search space is explored in a breadth-first manner.

Model 4 Various statistical alignment models of the form Pr(fJ1 ;aJ1jeI1) have been introduced in (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2000a).

They developed a simple heuristic function for Model 2 from (Brown et al., 1993) which was non admissible.

Many statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2000b) try to model word-to-word correspondences between source and target words.
