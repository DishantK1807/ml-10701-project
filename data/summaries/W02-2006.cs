Others have exploited the automatic transfer of some already existing annotated resource in a different medium or language (such as the translingual projection of part-of-speech tags, syntactic bracketing and inflectional morphology in Yarowsky et al.(2001), requiring no direct supervision in the foreign language).

AF Paradigmatic cross-context tag modeling is performed as in Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2000) when sufficiently large unannotated corpora are available.

Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) observed that an often more practical measure of the degree of supervision is not simply the quantity of annotated words, but the total weighted human labor and resource costs of different modes of supervision (allowing manual rule writing to be compared directly with active learning on a common cost-performance learning curve).

However, through weighted-Levenshtein-based iterative alignment models, such as described in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), one can perform a probabilistic string match from all lexical tokens actually observed in a monolingual corpus, as z->c destrozan destrocé destrozé V-pres-3pl V-pret-1sg V-subj-3pl destrozen destrocen destrozan destrozar/V z->c destruo destruí destruen V-pres-1sg V-pres-1sg V-pret-1sg destrue destruí destruyo destruye destruyen destruir/V V-pres-3sg ->y ->y φ φ ->y V-pres-3pl V-pret-3pl doler/V dormir/V V-pres-1sg dormenV-pres-3pl dormo dolen dolió o->ue o->ue dolió duelen duermen duermo dormió dormían dormían durmió V-pret-3pl V-imprf-3pl o->ue o->u Observed Rootword Dictionary Corpus Regular Words Inflection Generation φ Figure 3: Inflectional analysis induction via weighted string alignment to noisy generations from dictionary roots under regular paradigms in the right side of Figure 3 2 . For example, when looking for a potential analysis path for the Spanish irregular inflection destrocen, the closest string match is the regular hypothesis destrozar/V B0 destrozen/V-pres_subj-3pl.

Some have assumed only partially tagged training corpora (Merialdo, 1994), while others have begin with small tagged seed wordlists (such as Collins and Singer (1999) and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) for named-entity tagging).
