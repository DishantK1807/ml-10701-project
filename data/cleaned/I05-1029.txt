Abstract. One generally accepted hallmark of creative thinking is an ability to 
look beyond conventional labels and recategorize a concept based on its behav-
iour and functional potential. So while taxonomies are useful in any domain of 
reasoning, they typically represent the conventional label set that creative think-
ing attempts to look beyond. So if a linguistic taxonomy like WordNet [1] is to 
be useful in driving linguistic creativity, it must support some basis for recate-
gorization, to allow an agent to reorganize its category structures in a way that 
unlocks the functional potential of objects, or that recognizes similarity between 
literally dissimilar ideas. In this paper we consider how recategorization can be 
used to generate analogies using the HowNet [2] ontology, a lexical resource 
like WordNet that in addition to being bilingual (Chinese/English) also provides 
explicit semantic definitions for each of the terms that it defines. 
1   Introduction 
Analogy is a knowledge-hungry process that exploits a conceptual system’s ability to 
perform controlled generalization in one domain and re-specialization into another. 
The result is a taxonomic leap within an ontology that transfers semantic content from 
one term onto another. While all taxonomies allow vertical movement, a system must 
fully understand the effects of generalization on a given concept before any analogy 
or metaphor can be considered either deliberate or meaningful. So to properly support 
analogy, a taxonomy must provide a basis of abstracting not just to conventional cate-
gories, like Person, Animal or Tool, but to categories representing the specific causal 
behaviour of concepts such as think-agent, pain-experiencer, cutting-instrument, and 
so on. Thus, a surgeon can be meaningfully described as a repairman since both occu-
pations have the function of restoring an object to an earlier and better state; a foot-
baller can be meaningfully described as a gladiator or a warrior since each exhibits 
competitive behaviour; and a scalpel can be compared to a sabre, a sword or a cleaver 
since each has a cutting behaviour; and so on. 
Theories of metaphor and analogy are typically based either on structure-mapping 
[3,4] or on abstraction e.g., [5,6,7,8,9,10]). While the former is most associated with 
analogy, the latter has been a near-constant in the computational treatment of meta-
phor. Structure-mapping assumes that the causal behaviour of a concept is expressed 
in an explicit, graph-theoretic form so that unifying sub-graph isomorphisms can be

found between different representations. In contrast, abstraction theories assume that 
analogous concepts, even when far removed in ontological terms, will nonetheless 
share a common hypernym that captures their causal similarity. Thus, we should ex-
pect an analogous pairing like surgeon and butcher to have different immediate hy-
pernyms but to ultimately share an abstraction like cutting-agent (see [8,9]).  
However, the idea that a standard ontology will actually provide a hypernym like 
cutting-agent seems convenient almost to the point of incredulity. The problem is, of 
course, that as much as we want our ontologies to anticipate future analogies and 
metaphors with these pro-active categorizations, most ontologies simply do not pos-
sess terms as prescient as these. This is the question we address in this paper: if we 
assume that our ontologies lack these structures, can we nonetheless enable them to 
be added via automatic means?  We argue that we can, by generalizing not on the 
basis of a concept’s taxonomic position but on the basis of the specific relations that 
define its causal behaviour.  
Clearly then, this approach to analogy requires a resource that is rich in causal rela-
tions. We find this richness in HowNet [2, 11], a bilingual lexical ontology for Chi-
nese and English that employs an explicit propositional semantics to define each of its 
lexical concepts.  
With this goal in mind, the paper observes the following structure: in section two 
we offer a concise survey of the considerable research that has, in the past, been dedi-
cated to abstraction theories of analogy and metaphor. In section three we then com-
pare and contrast WordNet [1] and HowNet as candidate resources for the current 
abstraction approach to analogical reasoning. In section four, having established an 
argument as to why HowNet is to be preferred, we indicate how HowNet’s semantic 
definitions can be transformed in the service of analogical recategorization. The per-
formance and competence of this recategorization ability is then evaluated in section 
five. Speculation about further possible contributions of HowNet to analogical re-
search is reserved for the closing remarks of section six. 
2   Abstraction Theories of Analogy 
That analogy and metaphor operate across multiple levels of conceptual abstraction 
has been well known since classical times. Aristotle first provided a compelling taxo-
nomic account of both in his Poetics (see [5], for a translation), and computationalists 
have been fascinated by this perspective ever since. While the core idea has survived 
relatively unchanged, one must discriminate theories that apparently presume a static 
type-hierarchy to be sufficient for all abstraction purposes (e.g., [6]), from theories 
that posit the need for a dynamic type hierarchy (e.g., [7, 8]). One must also differen-
tiate theories that have actually been implemented (e.g., [6,8,9]) from those that are 
either notional or that seem to court computational intractability (e.g., [5,6]). Perhaps 
most meaningfully, one must differentiate theories and implementations that assume 
hand-crafted, purpose-built ontologies (e.g., [6]) from those that exploit an existing 
large-scale resource like WordNet (e.g., [8,9]). In the former, one has the flexibility to 
support as many functional abstractions like cutting-agent as are believed necessary, 
but at the cost of appearing to anticipate future analogies by hand-crafting them into 
the system.

Fig. 1. Analysis of the WordNet gloss for {Athena} suggests that the word-form “wisdom” has 
analogical potential, since it is alignable with another use in {Ganesh}. This leads to the con-
struction of the dynamic sense {Wisdom_deity} which can be used to make analogical leaps 
between these concepts. 
This current work follows the latter course. We intend to automatically construct a 
new taxonomy of analogically-useful abstractions like cutting-agent, by analysing the 
semantic content of the definitions assigned to each word-sense in HowNet. Past work 
(e.g., [8]) has attempted this automatic construction of analogically-friendly taxono-
mies from WordNet, resulting in an approach that involves as much information-
extraction from free text as it does semantic inference. This is because WordNet’s 
glosses, unlike the semantic definitions of HowNet, are free-form sentences designed 
for human, rather than machine, consumption. For instance, Figure 1 above illustrates 
how features can be lifted from WordNet glosses to create new intermediate 
taxonyms, or dynamic types, from which subsequent abstraction-based analogies can 
be generated. 
The explicitly-structured semantic forms that one finds in HowNet definitions will 
clearly make this lifting of features more logical and less heuristic. In general, this 
makes HowNet an ideal knowledge-source for a computational model of metaphor 
and analogy (e.g., see [10] for a topical perspective). 
3   Comparing WordNet and HowNet 
Generalization can be considered “controlled” if, when moving to a higher level of 
abstraction in a taxonomy, a conceptual system is able to precisely quantify that 
meaning which is lost. In this sense at least, most large-scale taxonomies do not pro-
vide a significant degree of control. Perhaps nowhere is this observation more keenly 
felt than in weak lexical ontologies like Princeton WordNet (PWN). In PWN [1], 
generalization of a concept/synset does not generally yield a functional or behavioural 
abstraction of the original concept. This is so because WordNet’s taxonomy is de-
signed not to capture common causality, function and behaviour, but to show how 
 Analogy as Functional Recategorization: Abstraction with HowNet Semantics 329 
existing lexemes relate to each other. For example, the common abstraction that 
unites {surgeon, sawbones} and {tree_surgeon} is not a concept that captures a 
shared sense of repair, improvement or care, but {person, human}. To be fair, much 
the same must be said of other taxonomies, even that of HowNet [2,11], a Chi-
nese/English semantic dictionary, and Cyc [12]. However, as we shall demonstrate, 
HowNet contains the necessary basis for such abstractions in its relational semantic 
definitions.  
PWN and HowNet have each been designed according a different theory of seman-
tic organization. PWN is differential is nature: rather than attempting to express the 
meaning of a word explicitly, PWN instead differentiates words with different mean-
ings by placing them in different synsets, and further differentiates synsets from one 
another by assigning them to different positions in its ontology. In contrast, HowNet 
is constructive in nature, exploiting sememes from a less discriminating taxonomy 
than PWN’s to compose a semantic representation of meaning for each word sense.  
Nonetheless, HowNet compensates strongly with its constructive semantics. For 
example, HowNet assigns the concept surgeong163g3482g33479the following definition:  
 {human|g2673:HostOf={Occupationg163g13856g34483},domain={medicalg163g3482}, 
{doctorg163g3482g35600g97agent={~}}} 
which can be glossed thus: “a surgeon is a human with an occupation in the medical 
domain who acts as the agent of a doctoring activity.” The {~} serves as a self-
reference here, to mark the location of the concept being defined in the given seman-
tic structure. The oblique reference offered by the tilde construct serves to make the 
definition more generic (thereby facilitating analogy), so that many different concepts 
can conceivably employ the same definition. Thus, HowNet uses the above definition 
not only for surgeon, but for medical workers in general, from orderlies to nurses to 
internists and neurologists. 
4   Extracting Functional Structure 
Our scheme for converting HowNet’s constructive definitions into a more differential 
form hinges on the use of the tilde as a self-reference in relational structures. For 
instance, consider the semantic definition that HowNet gives to repairmang163g33680g32723g31796:  
{human|g2673:HostOf={Occupationg163g13856g34483}, {repairg163g33680g32723:agent={~}}} 
Noting the position of {~} here, we can infer that a repairman is the agent of a repair-
ing activity, or in differential terms, a repair-agent. Now, since HowNet defines re-
pair|g2883g8450 as a specialization of the reinstatement activity resume|g5484g3809, we can further 
establish repair-agent as a specialization of resume-agent.

This double layer of abstraction establishes a new taxonomy that organizes word-
concepts according to their analogical potential, rather than their formal ontological 
properties. For instance, as shown in Figure 2, resume-agent encompasses not only 
repair-agent, but doctor-agent, since HowNet also defines the predicate doctorg163g3482g35600g71
as a specialization of the predicate resumeg163g36200g3809g85 
In general, given a semantic fragment F:role={~} in  a HowNet definition, we cre-
ate the new abstractions F-role and F’-role, where F’ is the immediate hypernym of F.  
The role in question might be agent, instrument, location, patient, or any other role 
that HowNet supports. By way of example, Figure 3 illustrates a partial hierarchy 
derived from the HowNet semantics of various form-altering tools:

5   Evaluating Analogical Competence 
We evaluate the analogical potential of the newly derived functional taxonomy using 
four criteria: topology –  the branching structure of the new taxonomy dictates its 
ability to generate analogies; coverage – the percentage of unique HowNet definitions 
that can be functionally re-indexed in the new taxonomy; recall – the percentage of 
unique definitions for which at least one analogy can be found using the new taxon-
omy; and parsimony– the percentage of abstractions in the new taxonomy that can be 
used to generate analogies. 
5.1   Topological Characteristics of the New Functional Taxonomy 
The new functional taxonomy contains 1579 mid-level abstractions and 838 upper-level 
abstractions. In total, the taxonomy contains only 2219 unique abstractions, revealing 
that in 8% of cases, the upper-level abstraction of one concept serves as the upper-level 
abstraction of another. 
Analogies will be generated only if two or more unique concept definitions are co-
indexed under the same mid-level or upper-level abstraction in the new functional 
taxonomy. For example, knightg163g20581g33360 and gladiator.g163g35643g32439g34751 are both co-indexed 
directly under the mid-level abstraction fight-agent. Likewise, gladiatorg163g35643g32439g34751g71is 
indexed under HaveContest-agent via fight-agent, while footballerg163g35082g31930g12588g2172g2604 is 
indexed under HaveContest-agent via compete-agent. The upper-level of abstraction, 
represented here by HaveContest-agent, is necessary to facilitate analogy between 
semantically distant concepts.  
Nonetheless, we note that a certain degree of metaphoric licence has already been 
exercised by HowNet’s designers in assigning semantic structures, so that even se-
mantically distant concepts can still share the same mid-level abstraction. Creative 
analogies like “Death is an assassin” can, as shown in Figure 4, be understood via a 
single generalization.

Fig. 4. Semantic diversity among concepts with the same mid-level abstraction 
Furthermore, because HowNet contains 95,407 unique lexical concepts (excluding 
synonyms) but only 23,507 unique semantic definitions, these definitions must be 
under-specified to the extent that many are shared by non-identical concepts (e.g., 
cartg163g35754g17722 and bicycleg163g2345g17722, are simply defined as manual vehicles).  
5.2   Analogical Coverage 
Since this new taxonomy is derived from the use of {~} in HowNet definitions, both 
the coverage and recall of analogy generation crucially depend on the widespread use 
of this reflexive construct. However, of the 23,505 unique definitions in HowNet, just 
6430 employ thus form of self-reference. The coverage of the new taxonomy is thus 
27% of HowNet definitions. 
5.3   Analogical Recall 
A majority of the abstractions in the new taxonomy, 59%, serve to co-index two or 
more HowNet definitions. Overall, analogies are generated for 6184 unique HowNet 
definitions, though these individual definitions may have many different lexical reali-
zations. The recall rate thus is 26% of HowNet’s 23,507 unique definitions, or 96% of 
the 6430 HowNet definitions that make use of {~}. The most productive abstraction is 
control_agent, which serves to co-index 210 unique definitions. 
5.4   Parsimony of Recall 
Overall, 1,315 of the 2219 nodes in the new taxonomy prove useful in co-indexing 
two or more unique definitions, while 904 nodes serve to index just a single defini-
tion. The parsimony of the new taxonomy is thus 59%, which reveals a reasonable, if 
not ideal, level of representational uniformity across HowNet’s semantic definitions. 
6   Conclusions and Future Work 
While just 27% of HowNet’s definitions are sufficiently structured to support anal-
ogy, we are encouraged that almost all of this generative potential can be achieved 
with a new functional taxonomy that is straightforward and efficient to construct. 
Furthermore, though 27% may seem slim, these analogically-friendly {~} structures 
are concentrated in the areas of the HowNet taxonomy that can most benefit from 
analogical re-description. As revealed in Table 1 below, some areas of HowNet are 
clearly more amenable to analogical reasoning than others.

But the analogical potential of HowNet resides not just in its explicit propositional 
semantics, but in its use of Chinese orthography. Consider that most Chinese entries 
in HowNet are multi-character terms, where each character is not so much a letter as a 
morpheme. . For instance, g33693g7427g32360, meaning “scalpel”, is a composite not just of char-
acters but of ideas, for g33693g7427means “surgery” and g32360 means “knife”. This logographic 
compositionality affords a kind of semantic transparency on a scale that alphabetic 
writing systems (like that of English) simply can not match Thus, g35424g4679g31446, which 
translates as “philosopher”, can be seen via HowNet as a composition of g35424g4679g71(“phi-
losophy”) and g31446 (“specialist” or “scientist”). In turn, philosophyg163g35424g4679 is organized 
by HowNet as a specialization of knowledgeg163g35212g16794, as is logicg163 g4679g17789 , mathematicsg163
g6297g4679, lexicographyg163g16801g34899g4679 and even midwiferyg163g1147g31812g4679. By decomposing com-
pound terms in this way and generalizing the extracted modifiers, yet another three-
level taxonomy can be constructed. For instance, from these examples the partial 
taxonomy of Fig. 5 can be derived.

The analogical potential of this ontologization becomes clear when one notices that 
it supports the classical analogy of philosopher as midwife. Clearly, then, we have 
just scratched the surface of what can usefully be derived from the lexico-semantic 
content of HowNet. Our current investigations with HowNet suggest that the full 
semantic richness of Chinese orthography may yet play a considerable role in sup-
porting creative reasoning at a linguistic level, if only because it opens a window onto 
a different cultural perspective on words and concepts.
