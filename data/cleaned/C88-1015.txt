TWO-COMPONF~ TEACHING SYSTEM THAT UNDERSTANDS ~ CORRECTS MISTAKES Elena BORISSOVA Institut Russkogo yazyka imP~shkina Moscow Abstract This paper presents a computer-tool teaching system supplied by a language processor.
Its aim is to correct mistakes in texts written by foreign students learning Russian as a second language.
Since a text may include grammar mistakes, the system cannot use morphological analysis to fool extent.
So one must compile a programm capable of finding and correcting mistakes without traditional means of analysis.
To solve this problem we prepone a system that includes a vocabalary and rules of finding and re-writing words.
So the process consists of finding word stems and than correcting word endings. Semantic and syntactic information("a model of ruling"/Mel'~uk 1974/~ necessary for that is written in the vocabulary of verbs as a frame.
The slots of this frame contain semantic and morphological information about words that depend on this vord~.
The vocabulary containing now approximately 200 lexemes is enough for beginners I • Introduction As a rule, computer-tool teaching programs ca~ do without language processors.
That gives us an opportunity to use Personal computers and other available and in~ expensive means.
But such programs can be used only for several types of exercises: mostly those that include substitution or insertion of listed words and endings in a sentence.
68 USSR Such exercises train the student to use correct\]F ~rds and expressions° It is im~ possible to modell exercises of the so cal~ led communicative type / Kostemarov et ale 1982/ that form the skills of spontaneous speech ( a pupil constructs some sentences expressing his thoughts on a definite toy pic).
While doing such exercises one cannot deal with a limited list of variants as th6~ re exists an infinite number of them(they are innamerable if a pupil has mastered even an elementary course).
That is why we need a language aualisis processor in a computer-assisted teaching program aimed to teach somebody t%s~ the language~ to ' c emm~uic ate '.
There exists a lot of language analysis and synthesis programs of Russian applied in Automatic translation, Natural langu~ age dialogue systems etc.
Nevertheless it is impossible to ase them in computer as~ sisted teaching programms.0n the one hand the majorit~ of them are oriented to the scientific or technological language.
On the other and more importantly as a rule they cannot deal with texts containing mistakes.
Those systems that'under~ stand' a text with mistakes do net notice them or they correct them only printing them on a display/Carbonell,Hayes "198#/ So it is necessary to compile a program capable of finding and correcting mistakes° This problem is new for computational linguistics.
2~ Description of language processor To solve the problem we propose a twocompone~tt language processor that provl~des morphological, synt~.actic and (to some extent) semantic analysis of a text with mistakes, ~d then it synthesises correct sentences which express identical meaning to the analysec~ ones.
This processor deals with separated ~:entences but some information must be used while analysing subsequent sentences of the given text (e.g.
information about the sex of a speaker as in a Russian text tlds information is necessary for ag~ reement of a predicate in the Past and a subject expressed by the pronoun of the 1st person singular: ya chodil~I was going, The 1st ste~.
The processor executes a morphological analysis of a sentence by means of a stem vocabulary which includes variants of the stems of each verb (e.g.CHOD-, CHOJ~ of the verb CHODIT' ~to goOetc.), noun~ adverb, adjective, pronoun.
This list lacludes the typical incorrect variants oZ these stems (e.g.
ZOV-, ZAVof the verb ZVAT'~to cal~; a typical mistake is ZAVU instead of ZOVU).
The first task of the processor is to find a verb and to identify it in the vocabulary.
The 2rid ste~ . The system uses syntactic information of the vocabulary.
Every verb stem is supplied with information of the morphological, syntactic and semantic features of words w~ch are ruled by the verb (e.g.
JIT' ~to live~v chem 'place').
Since all the nouns in the vocabulary are supplied with semantic information as well (eog; DOM(a house~'place'), that enables the s~stem to find appropriate nouns for the verb.
Then in accordance with the morphological information the system eynthesises a correct case form of the noun (e.g.
V DOME) which is compared with the form written by the pupil.
The difference is marked as a mistake that can be commented on by the list of explanations (e.g.
a pupil: Jivu dom, a correct rect form, synthesised by the system is Jivu v dome, mistake: "a wrong case form") The3d step.
Then the system accomplishes agreement of subject and predicate (e.g.
Student sg,m~ sg.m rA student live~) according to the semantic information the verb is supplied with (e.g; JIT' 'person' STUDENT 'person') and morphological information of the subject.
The temporal and aspectual characteristics of verbs depend on adverbs (e.g.
vchera CyesterdayOpast jilAtlived~past) and some other facts.
According to this information the system synthesises verbal forms and compares them with those written by the pupil.
The 4th step.
The agreement between adjectives and nouns is executed in the same way as the previously by finding words accor~ ding to the semantic features (e;g; no~ Cnew~'thing','place'... dom~a hoase~,place,) and then by changing of the forms according to the morphological information (e.g.
dom m novyi m) 3.Some notes on system exploating The result of this system's work should be a correct text with the correction of mistakes.
A system based on the same principles but more complex should correct some syntactic mistakes in word order, usage if conjunctions etc.
If the result of the correction allows two possible variants of a text, the computer prints:"De you want to say""... or 69 "..."?
(Possible variants in inverted commas).
If a sentence is not admissible by the given system, a computer prints: "I do not understand you, say it another w~".
The system can ask other questions as well.
In particular, if a pupil prints a personal name unknown to the system it asks:"Is it a male or female"? and then this name is inserted into the vocabulary with morphological characteristics fe~m.
or mas__cc.
Besides the grammatical information the vocabulary should include some encyclopaedi~ cal information important for a pupil.
E.g. if a foreign pupul has come to Moscow al~ ready then the phrase Ja priedu v ~oskva ~I'll come to Moscow~is wrong.
In order to correct such mistakes one inserts into the morphological and syntactic information an inscription : PRIYEHAT' ~I ~pastv Moskvurto M~scow which means that a prase about 1 p.sg. and Moscow is correct only in the past.
Prelimenary input of proper names which a learner ma~ have occasion use in a text is desireable as well.
Otherwise mistakes of the type Ya priehal iz kuba (instea~ of s Kuby) woul6 not be corrected.
The system is intended both for testing compositions and dialogues.
Since systems for advanced students would be too sophisticated and would have to include complete information about the language, nowadays we restrict ourselves to a system for beginners (150 lexemes in the vocabulary).
The system will be realised on the IBM-PC References Mel'~uk I.A ~ 0pyt teorii lingulstlceskih• .v modeley 'Smysl~=~Text,.
