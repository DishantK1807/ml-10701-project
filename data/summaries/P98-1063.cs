The approach of Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) disambiguates the text using XT and ENGCG independently; then the ambiguities remaining in ENGCG are solved using the resuits of XT.

Comparing the results of Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) with ours, we see that they achieve 98.5% recall combining 1.02-1.04 readings from ENGCG and 96% accuracy in XT, while we begin with 1.13-1.14 readings, the quality of our stochastic tagger is less than 90% and our result is better than 96%.

Oflazer and "FOr (1997) use simple statistical information and constraint rules.

Disambiguation There are two kinds of methods for morphological disambiguation: on one hand, statistical methods need little effort and obtain very good results (Church, 1988; Cutting etal., 1992), at least when applied to English, but when we try to apply them to Basque we encounter additional problems; on the other hand, some rule-based systems (Brill, 1992; Voutilainen et aL, 1992) are at least as good as statistical systems and are better adapted to free-order languages and agglutinative languages.

methods There have been some approaches to the combination of statistical and linguistic methods applied to POS disambiguation (Leech et al., 1994; Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1994; Oflazer and Tiar, 1997) to improve the accuracy of the systems.

The logical conclusions of these experiments are: â€¢ the statistical approach might not be a good approach for agglutinative and free-order languages -as pointed out by Oflazer and KuruOz (1994).

Unlike Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994), we think that training on the output of the CG the statistical disambiguation works quite better 10, at least using such a small training corpus.
