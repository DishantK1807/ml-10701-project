\[Cahill, 1990b\] discussed some possible ways to restrict the language to have context dependencies adjacent to the alternation being defined and to only permit reference to the initial, second, final and penultimate syllables, for example.

\[Cahill, 1990b\] suggested that this was too narrow a view, even for the rather impoverished inflection displayed by English.

Thus, the following would define the alternation: <peak pres> == ii <peak past> == â€¢ However, in the account of English verbs in \[Cahill, 1990b\], such verbs were grouped together with a large number of other verbs which did not exhibit this precise alternation, with the peak alternation being dependent on the original peak.

As mentioned above, \[Cahill and Gazdar, 1990\] defined a formal semantics for the MOLOSC language which permitted the definition of phonological features at any level in the structure, although the implementation and examples did not make use of feature definitions except at terminal nodes.
C90-3009
The formal semantics of MOLUSC (\[Cahill and Gazdar, 1990\]) defined the structures as having sets of feature definitions at each node.

An analysis along these lines using MOLOSE was given in \[Cahill, 1990b\], and it could be translated into the framework described above in the same way as the English fragment has been.

\[Cahill, 1990b\] showed that a view of morphological alternations as mappings between tree-structured syllables permitted a natural and succinct way of defining such Mternations.

MOI_USC (\[Cahill, 1990a\],\[Cahill, 1990b\],\[Cahill and Gazdar, 1990\]), is a formal language for defining morphological alternations as mappings between sequences of tree-structured syllables.

An account of English verbal morphology was discussed in \[Cahill, 1990b\] which was expressed in a combined DATR/MOI_USC lexicon fragment.
C90-3009
In this paper we assume a knowledge of DATR and refer the reader to the introductions in \[Cahill and Evans, 1990\] and \[Evans and Gazdar, 1990\].
