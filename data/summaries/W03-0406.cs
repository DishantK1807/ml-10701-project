Yarowsky proposed the unsupervised learning method for WSD(Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
To overcome this problem, unsupervised learning methods using huge unlabeled data to boost the performance of rules learned by small labeled data have been proposed recently(Blum and Mitchell, 1998)(Yarowsky, 1995)(Park et al., 2000)(Li and Li, 2002).
