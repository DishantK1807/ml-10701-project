If the alignments are not available, they can be automatically generated; e.g., using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).

The modified Powellâ€™s method has been previously used in optimizing the weights of a standard feature-based MT decoder in (Och, 2003) where a more efficient algorithm for log-linear models was proposed.

For example, hierarchical (Chiang, 2005) and syntax-based (Galley et al., 2006) systems have recently improved in both accuracy and scalability.

This approach is similar to the multi-engine MT framework proposed in (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994) which is not capable of re-ordering.

The NIST BLEU-4 is a variant of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and is computed as a49a51a50 a2a16a52a53a6 a0a9a8a10a0a12a11a54a13a55a15 a26a57a56a33a58a60a59 a43 a61a63a62 a64 a65a67a66a69a68 a28a71a70a46a72a74a73 a65 a6 a0a9a8a10a0a3a11a54a13a19a75a77a76 a6 a0a9a8a10a0a3a11a54a13 (2) where a73 a65 a6 a0a78a8a10a0a3a11a54a13 is the precision of a79 -grams in the hypothesis a0 given the reference a0 a11 and a76 a6 a0a78a8a10a0a3a11a54a13a81a80 a43 is a brevity penalty.

Combined with the latest advances in phrase-based translation systems, it has become more attractive to take advantage of the various outputs in forming consensus translations (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006).

So far, confusion networks have been applied in MT system combination using three different alignment procedures: WER (Bangalore et al., 2001), GIZA++ alignments (Matusov et al., 2006) and TER (Sim et al., 2007).
