For the examples discussed in this paper, we can use the hierarchy of grammatical relations given by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), in which the grammatical subject is ranked above all other grammatical relations (object, object2, and so forth).

The BFP Algorithm Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987, henceforth BFP) describe an algorithm for pronoun interpretation based on centering principles, which is also utilized in Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994, henceforth WIC).

In Section 3, we discuss a particular utilization of these rules for pronoun interpretation proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).
P87-1022
Following Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), we refer to the highest-ranked forward-looking center as Cp(U,).

Note that passage (7) with follow-on (7d') contradicts BFP's (page 157) and WIC's (page 223) claim that constraints based on structural parallelism, such as Kameyama's (1986) property-sharing constraint, are epiphenomena of BFP's ordering of the Cf and preference for Continue interpretations, since such constraints predict that Bill Clinton is the referent of him, not Bob Dole.

1. Introduction A central claim of centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995 henceforth GJW) is that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others, and that this property imposes constraints on a speaker's use of different types of expressions to refer to them.

This work has led to several analyses employing centering theory and extensions of it, particularly in the area of pronoun interpretation (Kameyama 1986; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Di Eugenio 1990, 1996; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996, inter alia; see also citations within GJW, forthcoming papers in Walker, Joshi, and Prince in press, and psycholinguistic studies described in Hudson-D'Zmura 1989, Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993, and Brennan 1995).

Suri and McCoy (1994) also provide minimal pairs that are problematic for BFP, which their algorithm correctly handles.
