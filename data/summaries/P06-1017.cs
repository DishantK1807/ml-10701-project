Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this problem, e.g., supervised learning algorithms (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), semi-supervised learning algorithms (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zhang, 2004), and unsupervised learning algorithms (Hasegawa et al., 2004).

Bootstrapping Currently most of works on the RDC task of ACE focused on supervised learning methods Culotta and Soresen (2004; Kambhatla (2004; Zhou et al.(2005). Table 5 lists a comparison on relation detection and classification of these methods.

Zhou et al.(2005) reported the best result as 63.1%/49.5%/55.5% in Precision/Recall/F-measure on the relation subtype classification using feature based method, which outperforms tree kernel based method by Culotta and Soresen (2004).

In the future, we would like to use more effective feature sets Zhou et al.(2005) or kernel based similarity measure with LP for relation extraction.
