This process is similar to the idea of registering signatures (Goldsmith, 2001; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002).

These approaches can be further categorized into ones that use conditional entropy between letters to detect segment boundaries (Harris, 1955; Hafer and Weiss, 1974; DÂ´ejean, 1998; Monson et al., 2004; Bernhard, 2006; Keshava and Pitler, 2006; Bordag, 2006), approaches that use minimal description length and thereby minimize the size of the lexicon as measured in entries and links between the entries to constitute a word form (Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2006).

Only very few approaches have addressed word internal variations (Yarowski and Wicentowski, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002).

A few approaches also take into account syntactic and semantic information from the context the word occurs (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Bordag, 2006; Yarowski and Wicentowski, 2000; Jacquemin, 1997).

Morphological segmentation has been shown to be beneficial to a number of NLP tasks such as machine translation (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005), speech recognition (Kurimo et al., 2006), information retrieval (Monz and de Rijke, 2002) and question answering.

The original RePortS algorithm assumes morphology to be concatenative, and specializes on prefixation and suffixation, like most of the above approaches, which were developed and implemented for English (Goldsmith, 2001; Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Yarowski and Wicentowski, 2000; Gaussier, 1999).

A popular and effective approach for detecting inflectional paradigms and filter affix lists is to cluster together affixes or regular transformational patterns that occur with the same stem (Monson et al., 2004; Goldsmith, 2001; Gaussier, 1999; Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Yarowski and Wicentowski, 2000; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Jacquemin, 1997).

The evaluation on this task is motivated by the fact that (Demberg, 2007) showed that good-quality morphological preprocessing can improve g2p conversion results.
