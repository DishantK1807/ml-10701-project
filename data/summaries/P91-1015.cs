In the analysis of the Australian free word-order language Guugu Yimidhirr, Mark Johnson uses a 'combine' predicate in a DCG-like grammar that corresponds to the union of words (Johnson, 1985).

Note though that a simple generalization of the algorithm presented below handles the general case (along the lines of Shieber et al.(1989; 1990)by treating rules that introduce extra lexical material as nonchain-rules).
J90-1004 P89-1002
In (Proudian and Pollard, 1985) a head-driven algorithm based on active chart parsing is described.
P85-1021
The first thing to note is that the words introduced by this lexical entry should be part of the input string, because of the nonerasure requirement (we use the string as a 'guide' (Dymetman ef al., 1990) as in a left-corner parser, but we change the way in which lexical entries 'consume the guide').
C90-3017
The semantic-head-driven generation strategy (van Noord, 1989; Calder ef al., 1989; Shieber et al., 1989; van Noord, 1990a; Shieber et al., 1990) faces problems in case semantic heads are 'displaced', and this displacement is analyzed using threading.

The algorithm is closely related to head-driven generators (van Noord, 1989; Calder et al., 1989; Shieber et al., 1989; van Noord, 1990a; Shieber et ai., 1990).
C90-2052 E89-1032 J90-1004 P89-1002
The parser is a generalization of the left-corner parser (Matsumoto et al., 1983) and can be used for grammars written in powerful formalisms such as non-concatenative versions of HPSG (Pollard, 1984; Reape, 1989).
E89-1014
It is easier to define generation algorithms if the semantics is built in a systematically constrained way (van Noord, 1990b).
