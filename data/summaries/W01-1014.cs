(Androutsopoulos et al., 1998; Nelken and Francez, 2000) focus on queries in English with temporal expressions, with a specialized semantic representation language that can handle temporality.

In Figure 1, we slightly modified the semantics in (Nelken and Francez, 2000; Nelken and Francez, 1999) for the convenience of translation.

(Nelken and Francez, 2000) use an intermediate representation because the compositional construction of formulae during parsing becomes easier.

For example, query 6a is translated into 6b with the intermediate representation C4 BTD0D0CTD2 (Nelken and Francez, 1999; Toman, 1996), and into 6c with the SQL/Temporal expressions (Nelken and Francez, 2000).

Since it is difficult to disambiguate the senses only with database information, we may utilize co-occurrence information between the collocated words such as (old,shoes) and (old,car) (Park and Cho, 2000; Lee et al., 1999).
C00-2086
The inference module, however, can be complemented by disambiguation using co-occurrence information (Park and Cho, 2000) and disambiguation of domaindependent word senses with consideration for the context-dependent information such as information structure (Steedman, 2000).

Figure 1 shows the translation process from the query 6a to the form 6b which is in C4 BTD0D0CTD2 . Since we are only showing the possibility of translation, we use an example from (Nelken and Francez, 2000).

Although we propose to construct the system without an intermediate representation language, we show that our Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) framework is compatible with the approaches with an intermediate representation (Nelken and Francez, 2000; Androutsopoulos et al., 1998; Klein et al., 1998).

Table 2 shows the CCG reduction rules proposed for Korean (Park and Cho, 2000).

We show the translation into both languages with examples (Nelken and Francez, 2000).
C00-2161
The intermediate representations are usually notated as logic expressions such as a quasi-logical form (Klein et al., 1998) and a customized language (Androutsopoulos et al., 1998; Nelken and Francez, 2000).
C00-2161 W98-0606
The system in (Klein et al., 1998) interprets noun phrase queries such as 5 in German: (5) Ersatzzeiten wegen Kindererziehung (Exemption times because of child raising) While the system can analyze noun phrases with various adverbial phrases, it is not reported to handle more complex noun phrase queries such as those with subordinate or coordinate constructions.
W98-0606
(Park and Cho, 2000; Lee et al., 1999) proposed to use the co-occurrence information during parsing and lexical selection.
C00-2086
In this paper, we propose a disambiguation method with the database information and cooccurrence information (Park and Cho, 2000; Palmer et al., 1999) for the interpretation of natural language queries (Lee and Park, 2001) in multilingual query interpretation.
