Malouf (2002) and Sha and Pereira (2003) show that gradient-based algorithms, particularly limited memory variable metric (LMVM), require much less time to reach convergence, for some NLP tasks, than the iterative scaling methods (Della Pietra et al., 1997) previously used for log-linear optimisation problems.

Unlexicalized parsers, on the other hand, achieved accuracies almost equivalent to those of lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Specifically, we use the open-source Toolkit for Advanced Discriminative Modeling (TADM:2 Malouf, 2002) for training, using its limited-memory variable metric as the optimization method and determining best-performing convergence thresholds and prior sizes experimentally.

Given an English sentence, we parse it with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and then generate paraphrases using the following syntactic transformations: 1.

Work Klein and Manning presented an unlexicalized PCFG parser that eliminated all the lexicalized parameters (Klein and Manning, 2003).

Much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003).

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Dictionary Compatability The last kind of semantic information we use is valency information, taken from the Japanese side of the Goi-Taikei Japanese-English valency dictionary as extended by Fujita and Bond (2004).This valency dictionary has detailed information about the argument properties of verbs and adjectives, including subcategorization and selectional restrictions.

Collins parser for Chinese The Collins parser is a state-of-the-art statistical parser that has high performance on English (Collins, 1999) and Czech(Collins et al.1999). There have been attempts in applying other algorithms in Chinese parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel 2002; Levy and Manning 2003), but there has been no report on applying the Collins parser on Chinese.

In recent empirical studies on maximum entropy models and CRFs, limited memory variable metric (LMVM) has proven to be the most efficient method (Malouf, 2002; Wallach, 2002); accordingly, we have used LMVM for CRF estimation.

The grammar is an HPSG implementation (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002), which provides a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations.

In many cases, the combination of these approaches has been shown to improve the performance of a single approach both for controlled indexing (Aronson et al., 2004) and free text indexing (Byrne and Klein, 2003).

Similarly, MeSH terms are crucial to the GO category, which are used by top-performing teams (Dayanik et al., 2004; Fujita, 2004) in TREC Genomics 2004.
