Carreras, Marquez and Padro (2002) have approached the shared task by using AdaBoost applied to xed-depth decision trees.

However, incorporating a list of person names in the training process did not help (Spanish test set: F =1 =73.66;; Dutch test set: F =1 =68.08) Jansche (2002) employed a rst-order Markov model as a named entity recognizer.

The data consists of words, entity tags and partof-speech tags which have been derived by a Dutch part-of-speech tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996).

They found that the transformation-based method consistently outperformed the decision trees (Spanish test set: F =1 =67.49;; Dutchtestset:F =1 =56.43) Tsukamoto, Mitsuishi and Sassano (2002) used a stacked AdaBoost classi er for nding named entities.

Their nal system consisted of a cascade of ve learners eachofwhich performed 10,000 boosting rounds (Spanish test set: F =1 =71.49;; Dutch test set: F =1 =60.93) Malouf (2002) tested dierent models with the shared task data: a statistical baseline model, a Hidden Markov Model and maximum entropy models with dierent features.
W02-2019
The categorization process was trained separately from the extraction process but that did not seem to have harmed overall performance (Spanish test set: F =1 =73.89;; Dutch test set: F =1 =69.68) Patrick, Whitelaw and Munro (2002) present SLINERC, a language-independent named entity recognizer.
W02-2022
McNamee and May eld (2002) have applied support vector machines to the data of the shared task.
W02-2020
Stages use the output of previous stages for obtaining an improved performance (Spanish test set: F =1 =73.92;; Dutch test set: F =1 =71.36) Tjong Kim Sang (2002) has applied a memory-based learner to the data of the shared task.
W02-2025
Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) approached the shared task by using word-internal and contextual information stored in character-based tries.
W02-2007
A boosted decision tree method obtained the best performance on both data sets (Carreras et al., 2002).
W02-2004
Florian (2002) employed three stacked learners for named entity recognition: transformation-based learning for obtaining base-level non-typed named entities, Snow for improving the quality of these entities and the forward-backward algorithm for nding categories for the named entities.
W02-2010
Burger, Henderson and Morgan (2002) have evaluated three approaches to nding named entities.
W02-2003
Wu, Ngai, Carpuat, Larsen and Yang (2002) have applied AdaBoost.MH to the shared task data and compared the performance with that of a maximum entropy-based named entity tagger.
W02-2035
Black and Vasilakopoulos (2002) have evaluated two approaches to the shared task.
W02-2002
The tagging scheme is a variant of the IOB scheme originally put forward by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
