During our participation in different international evaluation campaigns such as the TREC Genomics track (Hersh, 2005), the BioCreative initiative (Hirschman et al., 2005), as well as in our attempts to deliver advanced search tools for biologists (Ruch, 2006) and healthcare providers (Ruch, 2002) (Ruch, 2004), we were more concerned with domain-specific information retrieval in which systems must return a ranked list of MEDLINE records in response to an expertâ€™s information request.
