There are several works that try to learn paraphrase pairs from parallel or comparable corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003).

One of the studies is a series of works by Edmonds et al.and Inkpen et al (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002; Inkpen and Hirst, 2001).

The procedure of the method is as follows: 1 (step 1) Paraphrase pairs of predicates 2 are learned from a dictionary using a method proposed by (Kaji et al., 2002).
P02-1028
Predicate Paraphrase Pairs Kaji et al.proposed a method of paraphrasing predicates using a dictionary (Kaji et al., 2002).

Although a large number of studies have been made on learning paraphrases, for example (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), there are only a few studies which address the connotational difference of paraphrases.

In respect of automatically collecting corpora which have a desired style, Tambouratzis et al.proposed a method of dividing Modern Greek corpus into Demokiti and Katharevoua, which are variations of Modern Greek (Tambouratzis et al., 2000).

There are no similar attempts, although a variety of applications have been discussed so far, for example question-answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002; Duclaye and Yvon, 2003) or text-simplification (Inui et al., 2003).
W03-1602
Bulyko et al.also collected spoken language corpora from the Web (Bulyko et al., 2003).

Therefore, only reliable part of the parse result is used in the same way as Kawahara et al.did. See (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001) for the details.
