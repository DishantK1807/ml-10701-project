Grouping the highly polysemous verb senses in WordNet (on average reducing the >16 senses per verb to 8) provides an important first step a more flexible granularity for WordNet senses that improves both inter-annotator agreement (71% to 82%) and system performance (60.2% to 69%) (Dang & Palmer, 2002).

We have been training automatic WSD systems on the English sense-tagged training data based on WordNet that we supplied to SENSEVAL2 (Dang & Palmer, 2002).

The automatic semantic role labelers we are building use features that are very similar to our WSD system features, and we find that semantic role label features improve WSD while sense tag features improve semantic role labeling (Gildea & Palmer, 2002).
