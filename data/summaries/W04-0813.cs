Our group used directly the output of the parser (Aduriz et al., 2000), which includes some additional features: number, determiner mark, ambiguous analyses and elliptic words.
C00-1001
Following the relevance formula presented in (Magnini and CavagliÂ´a, 2000), we defined 2 feature types: (1) the most relevant domain, and (2) a list of domains above a predefined threshold 3 . Other experiments using domains from SUMO, the EuroWordNet 1 The PoS tagging was performed with the fnTBL toolkit (Ngai and Florian, 2001).
N01-1006
We tried to represent this information in local features, relying on the analysis of a deep morphological analyzer developed in our group (Aduriz et al., 2000).
C00-1001
We also obtain salient bigrams in the context, with the methods and the software described in (Pedersen, 2001).
N01-1011
NB: We applied a simple smoothing method presented in (Ng, 1997), where zero counts are replaced by the probability of the given sense divided by the number of examples.

The Decision List (DL) algorithm is described in (Yarowsky, 1995b).
P95-1026
and Parameters DL: On Senseval-2 data, we observed that DL improved significantly its performance with a smoothing technique based on (Yarowsky, 1995a).
