The paradigm for Fung ~: Church (1994); Fung & McKeown (1994) is based on two main steps find a small bilingual primary lexicon, use the text segments which contain some of the word pairs in the lexicon as anchor points for alignment, align the text, and compute a better secondary lexicon from these partially aligned texts.

We have previously shown that using a vector representation of the frequency and positional information of a high frequency word was an effective way to match it to its translation (Fung & McKeown 1994).

Previous alignment methods we used such as Church (1993); Fung & Church (1994); Fung & McKeown (1994) would bin the anchor points into continuous blocks for a rough alignment.

Dynamic Time Warping, a pattern recognition technique, was proposed as a good way to match these 1This was found to be the case in the Japanese translation of the AWK manual (Church et al.1993). The Japanese AWK was also found to contain different programming examples from the English version.

Dynamic Time Warping was found to be a good way to match word vectors of shifted or warped forms (Fung & McKeown 1994).

Our proposed algorithm for bilingual lexicon acquisition bootstraps off of corpus alignment procedures we developed earlier (Fung & Church 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994).

However, sentence alignment (Brown et al.1991; Kay & RSscheisen 1993; Gale & Church 1993; Church 1993; Chen 1993; Wu 1994) is not always practical when corpora have unclear sentence boundaries or with noisy text segments present in only one language.

Existing lexicon compilation methods (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al.1993; Wu & Xia 1994) all attempt to extract pairs of words or compounds that are translations of each other from previously sentencealigned, parallel texts.

difference vectors According to our previous findings (Fung& McKeown 1994), a word and its translated counterpart usually have some correspondence in their frequency and positions although this correspondence might not be linear.

This is a considerable improvement from our previous algorithm (Fung & McKeown 1994) which found only 32 pairs of single word translation.

Apart from single Word to single word translation such as Governor/~ and prosperity/~i~fl¢~, we also found many single word translations which show potential towards being translated as compound domain-specific terms such as follows: • finding Chinese words: Chinese texts do not have word boundaries such as space in English, therefore our text was tokenized into words by a statistical Chinese tokenizer (Fung & Wu 1994).

We previously used some frequency difference constraints and starting point constraints (Fung & McKeown 1994).
