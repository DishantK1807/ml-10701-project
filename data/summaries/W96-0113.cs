Nagata (1996) recently proposed a generalized forward-backward algorithm that is a character synchronous method for unsegmented languages.

On this point, I agree with Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994).

However, Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994) have criticized methods of estimation from an untagged corpus based on the maximum likelihood principle.

In this formulation, the tagger searches for the best sequence that maximizes the probability (Nagata, 1994): (1~ r, T) = arg maxp(W, TIS ) = arg maxp(W, T) (1) W,T W,T where W is a word sequence (wl,w2,...,Wn), T is a tag sequence (tl,t2,...,tn) and S is an input sentence.

Kupiec (1992) has proposed an estimation method for the N-gram language model using the Baum-Welch reestimation algorithm (Rabiner et al., 1994) from an untagged corpus and Cutting et al.(1992) have applied this method to an English tagging system.

and Future Work Merialdo (1994) and Elworthy (1994) have insisted, based on their experimental results, that the maximum likelihood training using an untagged corpus does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy.
