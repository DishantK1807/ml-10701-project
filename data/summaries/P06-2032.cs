The approach based on tree descriptions (often called, the metagrammar approach) obviates the procedural character of the non-monotonic approach by taking tree descriptions rather than trees to be the basic units (Candito, 1996; Xia et al., 1999; Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992).

We show in particular, that it integrates: • a convenient way of managing identifier scope based on import/export declarations inspired from standard Object Oriented Programming techniques (section 2.3.1); • an alternative means of identifying feature values based on the use of unification • polarity(here called colour-) based node identification as first proposed in (Muskens and Krahmer, 1998) and later used in (Duchier and Thater, 1999; Perrier, 2000).

The semantic formula and the tree are distinct objects but in the approach to semantic construction described in (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003), they share some semantic indices.

Nevertheless, this is the option that is adopted in most grammar formalisms and grammar compilers (Candito, 1996; Xia et al., 1999; Gaiffe et al., 2002).

The tree fragment approach is advocated in (Evans et al., 1995) which proposes to encode lexicalised TAGs using the DATR representation language1.

Moreover, as (Candito, 1996) remarks, nonmonotonicity may result in an information loss which makes it impossible to express the relation existing for instance between an active object and the corresponding passive subject.

tree-based grammars Whilst the development of standard unificationbased grammars is well supported by the design of formalisms such as PATR-II, Ale or TDL (Krieger and Schafer, 1994), the situation is less well established for Tree-Based Grammars such as Tree Adjoining Grammars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997), Tree Description Grammars (Kallmeyer, 1996) or Interaction Grammars (Perrier, 2003).
C94-2144
This formalism has been implemented within the XMG system and successfully used to encode both a core TAG for French (Crabbe, 2005; Gardent, 2006) and a core Interaction Grammar (Perrier, 2003).
