The priorities are used for disambiguating interpretation in the incremental understanding method (Nakano et al., 1999b).

Disjunctive feature descriptions are also possible; WIT incorporates an efficient method for handling disjunctions (Nakano, 1991).
P91-1040
The understanding module utilizes ISSS (Incremental Significant-utterance Sequence Search) (Nakano et al., 1999b), which is an integrated parsing and discourse processing method.
P99-1026
WIT features an incremental understanding method (Nakano et al., 1999b) that makes it possible to build a robust and real-time system.
P99-1026
Since the language generation module works in parallel with the language understanding module, utterance generation is possible even while the system is listening to user utterances and that utterance understanding is possible even while it is speaking (Nakano et al., 1999a).
P99-1026
The recent great advances in speech and language technologies have made it possible to build fully implemented spoken dialogue systems (Aust et al., 1995; Allen et al., 1996; Zue et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000).

For example, speech repairs, particle omission, and fillers can be dealt with in the framework of unification grammar (Nakano et al., 1994; Nakano and Shimazu, 1999).
C94-2164 P99-1026
WIT has been implemented in Common Lisp and C on UNIX, and we have built several experimental and demonstration dialogue systems using it, including a meeting room reservation system (Nakano et al., 1999b), a video-recording programming system, a schedule management system (Nakano et al., 1999a), and a weather information system (Dohsaka et al., 2000).

They can also shift the dialogue 2The notion of the initiative in this paper is different from that of the dialogue initiative of Chu-Carroll (2000).
