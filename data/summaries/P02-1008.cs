Ellison (1994) exploited such properties to give a production algorithm for finite-state OT.

Following Eisner (1997), each candidate (x;z) is also represented as a string y.
P97-1040
Primitive OT (Eisner, 1997) already restricts OT to something like a bare minimum of constraints, allowing just two simple constraint families that are widely used by practitioners of OT.
P97-1040
Much computational work on OT has been conducted within a finite-state framework (Ellison, 1994), in keeping with a tradition of finite-state phonology (Johnson, 1972; Kaplan and Kay, 1994).4 4The tradition already included (inviolable) phonological Finite-state OT is a restriction of the formalism discussed above.

directionality. [Adapted from (Eisner, 2000).] C1 is some high-ranked constraint that kills the most faithful candidate; NOCODA dislikes syllable codas.

Autosegmental representations too can be encoded as strings (Eisner, 1997).
P97-1040
Simply use the construction of (Frank and Satta, 1998; Karttunen, 1998), composed with a hard constraint that the answer must have K violations.

More generally, different constraints can usefully be applied with different H’s (Eisner, 2000).
C00-1038
These finite-state assumptions were proposed (in a different and slightly weaker form) by Ellison (1994).

That much was previously shown by Markus Hiller and Paul Smolensky (Frank and Satta, 1998), using similar examples.

A side benefit of our construction is a far simpler implementation of directional OT (Eisner, 2000).

For example, we obtain a transparent algebraic version of Eisner’s (2000) unbearably technical automaton construction for his proposed formalism of “directional OT.” Computational Linguistics (ACL), Philadelphia, July 2002, pp.

T can be applied efficiently to any input string x, whereas Ellison (1994) or Eisner (1997) requires a fresh automaton construction for each x.

Their empirical adequacy has been defended by Eisner (1997).

2. To consider recent constructions that cut through this problem (Frank and Satta, 1998; Karttunen, 1998; Eisner, 2000; Gerdemann and van Noord, 2000).

(This is to be expected since rewrite-rule 8Ellison (1994) was able to construct PRODUCE(x) from x.

Eisner (2000) proved that o> was a regular operator for directional H, by making use of a rather different insight, but that machine-level construction was highly technical.
