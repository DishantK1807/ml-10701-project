We develop a b,'~eline segmentation algorithm based on cue words, using a simplification of one of the features shown by Hirschberg and Litman (1993) to identify discourse usages of cue words.

Percent agreement, defined in (Gale et al., 1992), is the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion to possible agreements with the majority opinion.
P92-1032
Hirschberg and Litman (1993) examine a large set of cue words proposed in the literature and show that certain prosodic and structural features, including a position of first in prosodic phrase, are highly correlated with the discourse uses of these words.
J93-3003 W93-0216
However, previous studies have shown that the smallest unit subjects use in similar tasks corresponds roughly to a breath group, prosodic phrase, or clause (Chafe, 1980; Rotondo, 1984; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992).

RELIABILITY The correspondence between discourse segments and more abstract units of meaning is poorly understood (see (Moore and Pollack, 1992)).
J92-4007
Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) derived a discourse structure for each text in their study, by incorporating the structural features agreed upon by all of their subjects.
H92-1089
The output is a set of boundaries B, represented as ordered pairs of adjacent phrases (P,,P,*+I), such that the first item in P,*+I is a member of the set of cue words summarized in Hirschberg and Litman (1993).
J93-3003 W93-0216
A number of alternative proposals have been presented which directly or indirectly relate segments to intentions (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), RST relations (Mann et al., 1992) or other semantic relations (Polanyi, 1988).
J86-3001
Intention was explained in common sense terms and by example (details in (Litman and Passonneau, 1993)).

Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) asked subjects to structure three AP news stories (averaging 450 words in length) according to the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986).

The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena: cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen, 1984); lexical cohesion (Morris and Hirst, 1991); plans and intentions (Carberry, 1990; Litman and Allen, 1990; Gross and Sidner, 1986); prosody (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Gross, 1992; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986); reference (Webber, 1991; Gross and Sidner, 1986; Linde, 1979); and tense (Webber, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1992; Song and Cohen, 1991).

While studies of other tasks have achieved stronger results (e.g., 96.8% in a word-sense disambiguation study (Gale et al., 1992)), the meaning of percent agreement in isolation is unclear.

PAUSES Grosz and Hirschberg (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992) found that in a corpus of recordings of AP news texts, phrases beginning discourse segments are correlated with duration of preceding pauses, while phrases ending discourse segments are correlated with subsequent pauses.
