In particular, the algorithm presented in \[Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985\] can be seen to corresponds to the approach involving the use of cfg to encode derivations, whereas, the algorithm of \[Vijay-Shanker and Weir, in pressb\] 392 uses lig in this role.

The work described here is intended to provide a general framework that can be used to study and compare existing tag parsing algorithms (for example \[Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, in pressb; Schabes and Joshi, 1988\]).
