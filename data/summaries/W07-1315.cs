SENTS. WORDS Evaluation Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging: inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.
N03-2015
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.

Often trie similarities are used as a first step followed by further processing to identify morphemes (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).
N01-1024
The WORDNET 1.6 test set consists of several cross-validation sets of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP training set used by Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a supersense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.
N03-2015
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET's hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.

There have also been a number of papers focusing on the detection of semantic non-compositional items in recent years beginning with the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2001).
N01-1024
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
N03-2015
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.

Results We have used the WORDNET 1.6 test set to experiment with different parameter settings and have kept the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set as a final comparison of best results with Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

Goldsmith (2001) uses morphemes to efficiently encode a corpus, but he first groups morphemes into paradigm like structures he calls signatures.
J01-2001
Our results significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised.
N03-2015
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.
N03-2015
We intend to extend our experiments beyond the Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) set to include previous and more recent versions of WORDNET to compare their difficulty, and also perform experiments over a range of corpus sizes to determine the impact of corpus size on the quality of results.

Brent et al.(1995), Goldsmith (2001), and Creutz (2006) emphasize the building block nature of morphemes when they each use recurring word segments to efficiently encode a corpus.
J01-2001
Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

Using this approach we have significantly outperformed the supervised multi-class perceptron Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

entity chunking results methods Our feature representation is a slight modification of a simpler configuration (without any gazetteer) in (Zhang and Johnson, 2003), as shown in Figure 2.
