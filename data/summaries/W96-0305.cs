5. Other approaches Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) proposed a so-caUed Dictionary Correlation Kit (DCK) in a dialog-based environment for correlating word senses across pairs of MRDs, LDOCE and LLOCE.
A92-1011
Krovetz (1992) observed that LDOCE indicates sense shifts via direct reference (links indicated by a capitalized word with a sense number) and deictic reference (implicit links to the previous sense created by this, these, that, those, its, itself, such a, such an).

Recently, various approaches (Dolan 1994; Luk 1995; Yarowsky 1992; Dagan et al.1991 ;Dagan and Itai 1994) to word sense division have been used in WSD research.

Dolan (1994) described a heuristic approach to forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in a MRD.

For simplicity, we adapted the method proposed by Churchl(1988) to tag the definition sentence.

Yarowsky (1992) described a WSD method and an implementation based on Roget' s Thesaurus and the training material of the 10-rnillion-word Grolier' s Encyclopedia.

and Evaluation An experiment was carried out using a test set 3 containing 12 polysemous words used in recent WSD experiments (Yarowsky 1992; Luk 1995).

1. Introduction Treatment of lexical ambiguity such as WSD has been found useful in many NLP applications, including information retrieval (McRoy 1992; Krovetz and Croft 1992) and machine translation (Brown et al.1991; Dagan et al.1991; Dagan and Itai 1994).
J92-1001 J94-4003 P91-1017 P91-1034 P92-1054
Those relations between the sense and its defining words are reflected in semantic dusters that are termed categorical, functional, and situational clusters in McRoy (1992).
J92-1001
Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994).
C94-2125 J92-1001
Dolan (1994) observed that sense division in MRD is frequently too free for the purpose of WSD.

4.2. Zero derivation Dolan (1994) pointed out that it is helpful to identify zero-derived noun/verb pairs for such tasks as normalization of the semantics of expressions that are only superficially different.
