This result is consistent with a more thorough evaluation (Swanson and Gordon, 2006) on a different corpus with a set of different target verbs, which showed the Charniak parser performed the best among three parsers (including the Stanford parser and MINPAR) for labeling semantic roles.

The ESG (English Slot Grammar) parser (McCord, 1980) is a rule-based parser based on the slot grammar where each phrase has a head and dependent elements, and is also marked with a syntactic role.

Although there exists some automatic semantic role taggers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006), most of them were trained on PropBank (Palmer et.

For our task, the correctness of the prepositional phrase attachment is especially important for extracting accurate semantic role patterns (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

The Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) is an unlexicalized statistical syntactic parser that was trained on the same corpus as the Charniak parser (the Penn TreeBank).

This approach has achieved a high performance for a text categorization task when combining extracted keywords with the full text (Hulth and Megyesi, 2006).

These kinds of errors on prepositional phrase attachment in MINIPAR were also mentioned in (Pantel and Lin, 2000).

The metric we used is the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996), which factors out the agreement that is expected by chance: )(1 )()( EP EPAP − − =κ where P(A) is the observed agreement among the raters, and P(E) is the expected agreement, i.e., the probability that the raters agree by chance.

for Parsing We first used the Charniak parser (2000) to parse the original skill statements.
