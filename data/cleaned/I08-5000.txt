1:20	IJCNLP-08Workshop On NERforSouthandSouth EastAsianLanguages ProceedingsoftheWorkshop 12January2008 IIIT, Hyderabad,India c2008 Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing ii Introduction Welcome to the IJCNLP Workshop on Named Entity Recognition for South and South East Asian Languages, a meeting held in conjunction with the Third International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing at Hyderabad, India.
2:20	The goal of this workshop is to ascertain the state of the art in Named Entity Recognition (NER) specifically for South and South East Asian (SSEA) languages.
3:20	This workshop continues the work started in the NLPAI Machine Learning Contest 2007 which was focused on NER for South Asian languages.
4:20	NER was selected this time for the contest as well as for this workshop because it is one of the fundamental and most important problems in NLP for which systems with good accuracy have not been built so far for SSEA languages.
5:20	The primary reason for this is that the characteristics of SSEA languages relevant for NER are different in many respects from English, on which a lot of work has been done with a significant amount of success in the last few years.
6:20	An introductory article further explains the background of and motivation for this workshop.
7:20	It also presents the results of an experiment on a reasonable baseline and compares the results obtained by the participating teams with the results for this baseline.
8:20	The workshop had two tracks: One track for regular research papers on NER for SSEA languages and the second track on the lines of a shared task.
9:20	The workshop attracted a lot of interest, especially from the South Asian region.
10:20	Participation from most of the research centers in South Asia working on NER ensured that the workshop met its goal of ascertaining and advancing the state of the art in NER for SSEA languages.
11:20	Another major achievement was that a good quantity of named entity annotated corpus was created in five South Asian languages.
12:20	The notable point about this effort was that this was done almost informally on a voluntary basis, without funding.
13:20	This is an important point in the context of SSEA languages because lack of annotated corpora has held back progress in many areas of NLP so far in this region.
14:20	Each paper was reviewed by three reviewers to ensure satisfactory quality of the selected papers.
15:20	Anothermajorfeatureoftheworkshopisthatitincludestwoinvitedtalksbyseniorresearchersworking on the NER problem for South Asian languages.
16:20	The only drawback of the workshop was that there was no paper on any South East Asian language.
17:20	We would like to thank the program committee members for all the hard work that they did during the reviewing process.
18:20	We would also like to thank all the people involved in organizing the IJCNLP conference.
19:20	We hope that this workshop will help in creating interest in NER for SSEA languages and we will soon be able to achieve results comparable to those for languages like English.
