First, we formalize the task of identifying Japanese compound functional expressions in a text as a machine learning based chunking problem.
Next, against the results of identifying compound functional expressions, we apply the method of dependency analysis based on the cascaded chunking model.
The results of experimental evaluation show that, the dependency analysis model achieves improvements when applied after identifying compound functional expressions, compared with the case where it is applied without identifying compound functional expressions.
1 Introduction
In addition to single functional words, the Japanese language has many more compound functional expressions which consist of more than one word including both content words and functional words.
They are very important for recognizing syntactic structures of Japanese sentences and for understanding their semantic content.
Recognition and understanding of them are also very important for various kinds of NLP applications such as dialogue systems, machine translation, and question answering.
However, recognition and semantic interpretation of compound functional expressions are especially difficult because it often happens that one compound expression may have both a literal (i.e.
compositional) content word usage and a non-literal (i.e.
non-compositional) functional usage.
For example, Table 1 shows two example sentences of a compound expression ‚Äút(ni)mMo (tsuite)‚Äù, which consists of a post-positional particle ‚Äút(ni)‚Äù, and a conjugated form ‚ÄúmMo(tsuite)‚Äù of a verb ‚ÄúmX(tsuku)‚Äù.
In the sentence (A), the compound expression functions as a case-marking particle and has a non-compositional functional meaning ‚Äúabout‚Äù.
On the other hand, in the sentence (B), the expression simply corresponds to a literal concatenation of the usages of the constituents: the postpositional particle ‚Äút(ni)‚Äù and the verb ‚ÄúmMo (tsuite)‚Äù, and has a content word meaning ‚Äúfollow‚Äù.
Therefore, when considering machine translation of these Japanese sentences into English, it is necessary to judge precisely the usage of the compound expression ‚Äút(ni)mMo(tsuite)‚Äù, as shown in the English translation of the two sentences in Table 1.
There exist widely-used Japanese text processing tools, i.e. combinations of a morphological analysis tool and a subsequent parsing tool, such as JUMAN 1 + KNP 2 and ChaSen 3 + CaboCha 4. However, they process those compound expressions only partially, in that their morphological analysis dictionaries list only a limited number of compound expressions.
Furthermore, even if certain expressions are listed in a morphological analysis dictionary, those existing tools often fail in resolving the ambigui1 http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ nl-resource/juman-e.html 2 http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ nl-resource/knp-e.html 3 http://chasen.naist.jp/hiki/ChaSen/ 4 http://chasen.org/Àútaku/software/ cabocha/ 65 ÔøΩ(watashi)x(ha) t(kare)t(ni)mMo(tsuite)ÔøΩ`h(hanashita) (A) (I)(TOP)(he)(about)(talked) (I talked about him.) ÔøΩ(watashi)x(ha) t(kare)t(ni)mMo(tsuite) ÔøΩlh(hashitta) (B) (I)(TOP)(he)(ACC)(follow)(ran) (I ran following him.)

This is mainly because the framework of these existing tools is not designed so as to resolve such ambiguities of compound (possibly functional) expressions by carefully considering the context of those expressions.
Actually, as we introduce in the next section, as a first step towards studying computational processing of compound functional expressions, we start with 125 major functional expressions which have noncompositional usages, as well as their variants (337 expressions in total).
Out of those 337 expressions, 111 have both a content word usage and a functional usage.
However, the combination of JUMAN+KNP is capable of distinguishing the two usages only for 43 of the 111 expressions, and the combination of ChaSen+CaboCha only for 40 of those 111 expressions.
Furthermore, the failure in distinguishing the two usages may cause errors of syntactic analysis.
For example, (1) of Figure 1 gives an example of identifying a correct modifiee of the second bunsetsu segment 5 ‚Äúr> ÔøΩq`o(as a means for solution)‚Äù including a Japanese compound functional expression ‚Äúq`o(as)‚Äù, by appropriately detecting the compound functional expression before dependency analysis.
On the other hand, (2) of Figure 1 gives an example of incorrectly indicating an erroneous modifiee of the third bunsetsu ‚Äú`o‚Äù, which actually happens if we do not identify the compound functional expression ‚Äúq`o(as)‚Äù before dependency analysis of this sentence.
Considering such a situation, it is necessary to develop a tool which properly recognizes and semantically interprets Japanese compound functional expressions.
This paper proposes an approach of processing Japanese compound functional expressions by identifying them and analyzing their dependency relations through a machine learning technique.
The overall flow of processing compound functional expressions in a Japanese sentence is il5 A Japanese bunsetsu segment is a phrasal unit which consits of at least one content word and zero or more functional words.
