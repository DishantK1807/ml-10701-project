Example scenario with 12 vehicles 3 The Best-First Procedure The basic mechanism of the best-first search algorithm is a generalization of the incremental version: instead of successively adding attributes to the full expression generated so far, all intermediate results are accessible for this operation, producing an optimal solution, if completed – see (Horacek 2003) for details.

Therefore, van Deemter (2002) has extended the set of descriptors to boolean combinations of attributes, including negations.

• Specifications may contain some disjunctions, frequently causing the production of structurally ambiguous expressions (Gardent 2002) – “trucks and sportscars which are white or in the center” referring to x1, x5, x11 (Figure 1).

Mediating between these two extreme search paradigms, we have developed a best-first searching algorithm that avoids the major deficit of the incremental approach (Horacek 2003).

This deficit disappeared using an exhaustive search (Gardent 2002), but run-time then increases considerably.

Identifying sets of objects originally followed the incremental algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995), as in (Bateman 1999), (Stone 2000) and (Krahmer et al.2003), with limited coverage, since only few attributes typically apply to all intended referents and to none of the potential distractors.
