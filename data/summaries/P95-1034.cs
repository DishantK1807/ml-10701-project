This system translates Japanese into representations whose terms are drawn from the SENSUS ontology (Knight and Luk, 1994), a 70,000-node knowledge base skeleton derived from resources like WordNet (Miller, 1990), Longman's Dictionary (Procter, 1978), and the PENMAN Upper Model (Bateman, 1990).

In 7See also (Dagan and Itai, 1994) for a study of the use of lexical co-occurrences to choose among open-class word translations.

We built a language model 4See also (Harbusch et al., 1994) for a thorough discussion of defaulting in NLG systems.
C94-1058
We use a version of the N-best algorithm (Chow and Schwartz, 1989), a Viterbistyle beam search algorithm that allows extraction of more than just the best scoring path.
H89-2027
This approach addresses the problematic aspects of both pure knowledge-based generation (where incomplete knowledge is inevitable) and pure statistical bag generation (Brown et al., 1993) (where the statistical system has no linguistic guidance).

P81-1033
Although robustness has been heavily studied in natural language understanding (Weischedel and Black, 1980; Hayes, 1981; Lavie, 1994), it has received much less attention in NLG (Robin, 1995).
