For resource-rich languages, one may use a parse tree and look for mutual information statistics in head-complement collocations, and also compare it with other "similar" collocations to determine if something is unusual about a given construct (Lin, 1999).

We used the Giza++ tool kit (Och and Ney, 2000), based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, to calculate these probability measures.

constituents. How these structures are to be encoded in a computational lexicon is a complex matter that takes us beyond CP identification (Villavicencio et al.2004). But while rule-based identification of such constructs is problematic, we feel that POS-tag projection holds considerable promise in this direction.

Parallel corpus based approaches to inducing monolingual part-of-speech taggers, base noun-phrase bracketers, named-entity taggers and morphological analyzers for French, Chinese and other languages have shown quite promising results (Yarowsky et al., 2001).
