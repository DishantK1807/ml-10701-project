More recently, the corpus has also been used to develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004b).

The MATE ‘meta-scheme’ for anaphora annotation (Poesio et al., 1999) is one of the annotation schemes developed as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al., 2001), whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for different types of dialogue annotation.

In addition, work such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indirect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the CB.

The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al., 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karamanis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004b).

2.1 Coreference, Anaphora and Discourse Modeling The MATE scheme differs from the best-known scheme for annotating ‘coreference,’ MUCCS (Hirschman, 1998) both in the conceptualization underlying the annotation (i.e., what type of information should be annotated) and in the way this information is marked up.
M98-1029
As van Deemter and Kibble (2000) point out, however, the result is rather ad hoc; the IDENT relation as defined by the instructions doesn’t capture any coherent definition of ‘coreference’.
J00-4005 W00-1411
van Deemter and Kibble (2000) assume the definition of ‘reference’ typically found in formal semantics, but in functional linguistics, the term ‘referring expression’ is used to indicate expressions that introduce new discourse entities in a discourse model or that denote an old one (see, e.g., (Gundel et al., 1993)).
J00-4005 W00-1411
Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and definites in general (Poesio, 2004).
C00-1045 J04-3003
One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging references is quite hard.
J98-2001
More substantial differences are the decision not to use standoff, and the introduction of new elements necessary for the study of salience, such as elements that could be used to investigate the notion of UTTERANCE used in Centering (Poesio et al., 2004c).
J04-3003
These results, and the annotated corpus, were applied to the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms with the application of these empirical results to natural language generation, from sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001), to aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis, 2003).
C00-1045 N01-1002 P00-1051 W00-1411
GNOME was concerned with the empirical investigation of the aspects of discourse that appear to affect generation, especially salience (Pearson et al., 2000; Poesio et al., 2000; Poesio and Di Eugenio, 2001; Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio et al., 2004c).
J04-3003 P00-1051
The remaining differences between the schemes have then mostly to do with the instructions to annotators–for example, which types of anaphoric relations to be considered as cases of ’identity’ (see (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) for some problems with the choices made in MUCCS).

J98-2001
The main new aspect of the markup scheme, especially as far as our studies of salience were concerned, are the elements used to annotate potential utterances in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995).
J95-2003
Reaching agreement on this information involved several discussions between annotators and more than one pass over the corpus (Poesio, 2000a).
P00-1051
As in the MUC scheme, it is as1van Deemter and Kibble (2000) give a stricly textual definition of ‘anaphora’ which is very distant from the common use of the term ‘anaphora resolution’ in computational linguistics, typically used to indicate the interpretation of (parts of) the meaning of an expression with respect to the discourse model.
J00-4005 W00-1411
The scheme has served as the basis for a number of annotation projects, such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus of anaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio et al., 2004a).
J04-3003 P00-1051
The approach taken in MATE was then to design a general markup scheme (the ‘meta-scheme’) and then to show its basic building blocks could be used to implement different types of anaphoric annotation, including some of the most popular schemes for ’coreference annotation,’ such as the MUC scheme (MUCCS) (Hirschman, 1998), Passonneau’s DRAMA scheme (1997), and the scheme used for annotation of references to landmarks in the MapTask corpus.
M98-1029
The empirical side of the project involved both psychological experiments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme based on the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed annotation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whose instructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio, 2000a).
