Lexicalized rules in fact have proven useful in other areas of natural language statistical modeling, such as POS tagging (Brill, 1995) and parsing (Collins, 1996).
J95-4004 P96-1025
NP constituents, referred to as BASENPs, are automatically identified using Collins' (1996) lexical dependency parser.

• The GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION of a referring expression reflects the local attentional status of the referent, i.e., subject position generally holds the highest ranking member of the forward-looking centers list (Cf list), while direct object holds the next highest ranking member of the Cf list (Grosz et al., 1995; Kameyama, 1985).

These interactions can be formally expressed in the framework of attentional modeling by the following principles of interpretation: • The LEXICAL FORM OF A REFERRING EXPRESSION indicates the level of attentional processing, i.e., pronouns involve local focusing while full lexical forms involve global focusing (Grosz et al., 1995).

Broad class tags are derived using Brill's (1995) part-of-speech tagger, and word lemma information is produced by NewTTS (Sproat, 1997).
J95-4004
Coreferential relations are coded by two labelers using DTT (Discourse Tagging Tool) (Aone and Bennett, 1995).
P95-1017
Expert discourse structure analyses are used to derive CONSENSUS SEGMENTATIONS, consisting of discourse boundaries whose coding all three labelers agreed upon (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).
P96-1038
The theory describes for the first time the interacting contributions to accent prediction made by factors related to the local and global attentional status of discourse referents in a discourse model (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

focusing features The local attentional status of baseNPs is represented by two features commonly used in centering theory to compute the Cb and the Cf list, GRAMMATICAL FUNCTION and FORM OF EXPRESSION (Grosz et al., 1995).
J95-2003
We propose a new theory of the relationship between accent and attention, based on an enriched taxonomy of given/new information status provided by both the LOCAL (centering) and GLOBAL (focus stack model) attentional state models in Grosz and Sidner's discourse modeling theory (1986).
