4 Lexico-Semantic Patterns In SCISOR \[Jacobs and Rau, 1990\], MUC \[Jacobs et al., 1991; Krupka et al., 1991\], and other applications, we have found that lexically-driven pre-processing serves as a complement to parsing and semantic interpretation, both in identifying portions of relevant text and in marking the input text to make it easier to process.

Like Construe/TIS \[Hayes and Weinstein, 1990\], the work derives from, and coordinates with, NLP efforts, but the system primarily uses a lexicosemantic pattern matcher for categorization \[Jacobs et al., 1991\].

The context of this research is a commerciallydeveloped system \[Rau and Jacobs, 1991\] that automatically assigns categories to news stories for "custom clipping" and other markets.
