Two different alignments were used: (a) the one provided in the definition of the task and (b) one obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to train an IBM’s model 4.
J03-1002
This concept of alignment has been also used for tasks like authomatic vocabulary derivation and corpus alignment (Dagan et al., 1993).
W93-0301
Different models have been presented in the literature, see for instance (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2004; Vidal et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996).
C96-2141 J04-4002 J93-2003
Some of the properties of these alignments are studied in (Zens and Ney, 2003).
P03-1019
This model shares some similarities with the stochastic inversion transduction grammars (SITG) presented by Wu in (Wu, 1997).
J97-3002
4 IBM’s model 1 IBM’s model 1 is the simplest of a hierarchy of five statistical models introduced in (Brown et al., 1993).
