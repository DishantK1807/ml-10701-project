The task of a human generating a summary generally involves three subtasks (Brandow et al.(1995); Mitra et al.(1997)): (1) understanding a text; (2) ranking text pieces (sentences, paragraphs, phrases, etc).

coherence structures 3.1.1 Discourse segments Discourse segments can be defined as nonoverlapping spans of prosodic units (Hirschberg & Nakatani (1996)), intentional units (Grosz & Sidner (1986)), phrasal units (Lascarides & Asher (1993)), or sentences (Hobbs (1985)).

Carlson et al.(2001), Corston-Oliver (1998), Mann & Thompson (1988), Ono et al.(1994)). We will present one coherence-based approach that assumes trees as a data structure for representing discourse structure, and one approach that assumes less constrained graphs.

Carlson et al.(2001); Ono et al.(1994)). However, Jing et al.(1998) argue that such measures are inadequate because they only distinguish between hits and misses or false alarms, but do not account for a degree of agreement.

Inter-annotator agreement was determined for six pairs of two annotators each, resulting in kappa values (Carletta (1996)) ranging from 0.62 to 0.82 for the whole database (Carlson et al.(2003)). No kappa values for just the 15 texts we used were available.
