MMVC Model The Mixture Maximum Variance Correction classifier (MMVC henceforth) (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2002) is a two step classifier.

In the experiments presented in van Halteren et al.(1998), this method was the best performer among the presented methods.

A very common technique for combination in such a case is by voting (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 1998; Sang et al., 2000).

For Spanish, an minimally supervised tagger (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 2000) was used.

Pedersen (2000) presents experiments with an ensemble of Na√Øve Bayes classifiers, which outperform all previous published results on two ambiguous words (line and interest).

An electronically available transformation-based POS tagger (Ngai and Florian, 2001) was trained on standard labeled data for English (Penn Treebank), Swedish (SUC1 corpus), and Basque.

Classifier combination has been extensively studied in the last decade, and has been shown to be successful in improving the performance of diverse NLP applications, including POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 2001), base noun phrase chunking (Sang et al., 2000), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999) and word sense disambiguation (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).

Lemmatization was performed using an existing trie-based supervised models for English, and a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000) for all the other languages.
P00-1027
Stevenson and Wilks (2001) presented a classifier combination framework where 3 disambiguation methods (simulated annealing, subject codes and selectional restrictions) were combined using the TiMBL memory-based approach (Daelemans et al., 1999).

Discriminative Models Two discriminative models are used in the experiments presented in Section 5 a transformationbased learning system (TBL henceforth) (Brill, 1995; Ngai and Florian, 2001) and a nonhierarchical decision lists system (DL henceforth) (Yarowsky, 1996).

An alternative method for estimating the parameters AL CZ is to approximate them with the performance of the CZ th classifier (a performance-based combiner) (van Halteren et al., 1998; Sang et al., 2000) AL CZ B4DCBNCSB5BPC8 B4BV CZ _is_correctCYDCBNCSB5 (4) therefore giving more weight to classifiers that have a smaller classification error (the method will be referred to as PB).

In a second pass, the sense whose variance exceeds a theoretically motivated threshold is selected as the final sense label (for details, see Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002)).
