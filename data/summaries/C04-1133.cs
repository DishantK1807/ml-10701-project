Agirre et al (2002) and Yamashita et al.(2003) report resulting improvement in precision.

Stevenson and Wilks (2001) propose a somewhat related technique to handle WSD, based on integrating LDOCE classes with simulated annealing.

However, following the work of Yarowsky (1992), Yarowsky (1995), many supervised WSD systems use minimal information about syntactic structures, for the most part restricting the notion of context to topical and local features.
C92-2070 P95-1026
Some recent work (Stetina et al.(1998); Agirre et al.(2002); Yamashita et al.(2003)) attempts to change this situation and presents a directed e ort to investigate the impact of using syntactic features for WSD learning algorithms.

Semantic classes assigned to predicate arguments in subcategorization frames are either derived automatically through statistical clustering techniques (Rooth et al.(1999), Light and Grei (2002)) or assigned using hand-constructed lexical taxonomies such as the WordNet hierarchy or LDOCE semantic classes.
P99-1014
Much of the work on inducing selectional preferences for verbs from corpora deals with predicates indiscriminately, assuming no di erentiation between predicate senses (Resnik (1996); Abney and Light (1999); Ciaramita and Johnson (2000); Rooth et al.(1999)). Those approaches that do distinguish between predicate senses or complementation patterns in acquisition of selectional constraints (Korhonen (2002); Korhonen and Preiss (2003)) do not use corpus analysis for verb sense classi cation.

Overwhelmingly, WordNet is chosen as the default resource for dealing with the sparse data problem (Resnik (1996); Abney and Light (1999); Ciaramita and Johnson (2000); Agirre and Martinez (2001); Clark and Weir (2001); Carroll and McCarthy (2000); Korhonen and Preiss (2003)).

In recent years, a number of approaches have been proposed for dealing computationally with selectional preference acquisition (Resnik (1996); Briscoe and Carroll (1997); McCarthy (1997); Rooth et al.(1999); Abney and Light (1999); Ciaramita and Johnson (2000); Korhonen (2002)).
