The algorithm in question (based on that of Shieber et al.(1989)), though among the most permissive currently available, excludes certain classes of parsable analyses.

It is the second of these which the present paper chiefly addresses, though we also remark, in the next section, on some enhancements to the Shieber et al.(1989) algorithm that have been incorporated in the ELU generator.

3. The Generator in ELU In this section we describe the generation algorithm in ELU, and discuss in what respects it differs from that described by Shieber et al.(1989). 3 Two notions central to this method of generation are that of the 'pivot', and that of partitioning the grammar intO 'chaining' and 'noD-chaining ' rules.

Constraints imposed by Wedekind (1988) and van Noord (to appear) exclude certain linguistic analyses from generation.

This paper reports on experience arising from the addition of a generator component to the FLU 2 environment; the algorithm is a variant of that proposed in Shieber et al.(1989). We first consider general aspects of adapting unification grammars initially developed for parsing to their use in generation.
P89-1002
The most permissive of the current proposals appears to be Shieber et al.'s (1989) revision of the Shieber (1988) algorithm, yet several plausible grammatical analyses handled by the parser me beyond the capacity of even approach.

categorial treatment proposed in Baschung et al.(1987) not only makes use of order of arguments, but also codes each clitic for all possible combinations.

Recall that the generator operates by partitioning the rules of the grammar 1o This problem is alluded to in Shieber et al.(1989, fn.4) and is discussed in a draft of an expanded version of the paper.

For example, if the sentence John kicked the bucket receives the semantic representation die(John), it is i Parsing and generation need not employ different algorithms or control strategies; see Shieber (1988) for discussion.

Though unification based systems have been in use for parsing for a number of years, generation has until recently not attracted comparable attention; Wedet-lnd (1988), Dymetmaun & lsabelle (1988) and Shieber (1988) describe tluee systems of note.

As Shieber et al.(1989, fn.4) observe, failure to choose the right daughter as the starting point for recursive generation may prevent tenuinafion.
