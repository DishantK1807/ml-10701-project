A part of a text can be considered important in relation to other segments of the same text according to several criteria: it embodies knowledge necessary to understand other parts of the text (van Dijk, 1977; Kintsch and van Dijk, 1978); it is relevant to the topic of discourse (Lehnert 1982 and 1984); it is useful to clarify the relations that make discourse coherent (Hobbs, 1982); it relates to the topic-focus articulation (Haji~ova' and Sgall, 1984); it refers to objects or relations in the subject domain that are judged to be important a-priori (Schank, 1979); it is unusual, new, or abnormal in the subject domain (Schank, 1979); it generates surprise (van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983); it is relevant to some specific reader's goal or need (Fum, Guida, and Tasso, 1982).
