Entropy Model We use the Maximum Entropy (ME) Model (Berger et al., 1996) for our classification task.

Though taggers based on dependency networks (Toutanova et al., 2003), SVM (Gimenez and M`arquez, 2003), MaxEnt (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), CRF (Smith et al., 2005), and other methods may reach slightly better results, their train/test cycle is orders of magnitude longer.

Note that this decoding is an equivalent formulation to a uniformly weighted logarithmic opinion pool, as described in Smith et al.(2005). Of the three decoding methods, Standalone has the lowest complexity, requiring only a binary Viterbi decoding for each weak learner.

An identical approach was used in (Tapanainen, 1994) for English.

Several existing language models are based on this assumption ??(Brill, 1998) for tagging English, (Borin, 2000) for tagging German and (Vidova-Hladka, 2000) for tagging inflective languages.

The conditional log-linear feature combination framework (Berger, Della Pietra and Della Pietra, 1996) is remarkably simple and effective in practice.

There have been attempts at solving this problem for some of the highly inflective European languages, such as (Daelemans, 1996), (Erjavec, 1999) for Slovenian and (Haji?c, 2000) for five Central and Eastern European languages.

This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.(2006), but we use a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to determine parser actions, which makes parsing extremely fast.

Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt) (Berger et al., 1996) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) were used to build the classifiers in our solution.

Also (Bick, 2000) uses manually written disambiguation rules for tagging Brazilian Portuguese, (Karlsson, 1985) and (Koskenniemi, 1990) for Finish and (Oflazer, 1997) reports the same for Turkish.

At current state two linguistic resources have been analyzed and adapted in order to be incorporated into the ADVICE project: Brill tagger, Brill (1992), and EuroWordNet, Vossen et al.(1998). The paper is structured as follows: next section focuses on a brief description of the NL module of ADVICE project; section 3 is devoted to explain how the corpus study has influenced the customization of the lexical resources; sections 4 and 5 outline the Brill tagger and EuroWordnet extension to cover specific domain peculiarities and, finally, in section 6 some conclusions and future work are presented.
