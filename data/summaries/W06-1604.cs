For example, Bos et al.(2004) build semantic representations from the parse derivations of a CCG parser, and the English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Toutanova et al., 2005) provides a semantic representation using minimal recursion semantics.

Due to space constraints, we omit details about the algorithm for converting a parse into an RC, but Moldovan et al.(2003) describe a method similar to ours.

Numerous systems, including QuestionAnswering systems like MULDER (Kwok et al., 2001), PiQASso (Attardi et al., 2001), and Moldovan et al.â€™s QA system (2003), use parsing technology as a key component in their analysis of sentences.

It relies on TextRunner and KnowItNow (Cafarella et al., 2005) to quickly find possible answers, given the relational conjunction (RC) of the question.
