The parser, T~earl, is a time-asynchronous I)ottom-ul) chart parser with Earley-tyl)e tol)-down prediction which l)ur sues the highest-scoring theory iu the chart, where the score of a theory represents tim extent to which the context of the sentence predicts that interpretation.
This parser dilrers front previous attemi)ts at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of conditional prol)alfilities I)ased on context to l)rediet likelihood.

The solution which many people have proposed is to use stochastic models to grain statistical grammars automatically from a large corpus.
Attempts in applying statistical techniques to natura, I iangt, age parsi,lg have exhibited varying degrees of success.
These successful and unsuccessful attempts have suggested to us that: . Stochastic techniques combined with traditional linguistic theories can (and indeed must) provide a solull|on to the natural language understanding problem.
* In order for stochastic techniques to be effective, they must be applied with restraint (poor estimates of context arc worse than none\[7\]).
Interactive, interleaved architectvres are preferable to pipeline architectures in NLU systems, because they use more of the available information in the decision-nmkiug process.
Wc have constructed a stoch~tic parser,/)earl, which is based on these ideas.
The development of the 7~earl parser is an effort to combine the statistical models developed recently into a single tool which incorporates all of these models into the decisiou-making component of a parser, While we have only attempted to incorporate a few simple statistical models into this parser, ~earl is structured in a way which allows any nt, mber of syntactic, semantic, and ~other knowledge sources to contribute to parsing decisions.
The current implementation of "Pearl uses ChurclFs part-of-speech assignment trigram model, a simple probabilistic unknown word model, and a conditional probability model for grammar rules based on part-of-speech trigrams and parent rules.
By combining multiple knowledge sources and using a chart-parsing framework, 7~earl attempts to handle a number of difficult problems.
7%arl has the capability to parse word lattices, an ability which is useful in recognizing idioms in text processing, as well as in speech processing.
The parser uses probabilistic training from a corpus to disambiguate between grammatically ac(-i:ptal)h', structures, such ;m determining i)repo -15sitional l)hrase attachment and conjunction scope.
Finally, ?earl maintains a well-formed substring I,able within its chart to allow for partial parse retrieval.

• Parsing algorithnls which accumulate I)rol)abilities of parse theories by simply multiplying the,n overpenalize infrequent constructs.
?earl avoids the first pitfall" by t,sing a contextsensitive conditional probability CFG, where cot ttext of a theory is determi,ted by the theories which predicted it and the i)art-of-sl)eech sequences in the input s,ml,ence.
To address the second issue, Pearl scores each theory by usi.g the geometric mean of Lhe contextl,al conditional probalfilities of all of I.he theories which have contributed to timt theory.
This is e(lt, ivalent to using the sum of the logs of l.hese probal)ilities.

CFG with context-sensitive conditional probabilities In a very large parsed corpus of English text, one finds I, Imt, I,be most freq.ently occurring noun phrase structure in I, Iw text is a nomt plu'asc containing a determiner followed by a noun.
Simple probabilistic CFGs dictate that, given this information, "determiner noun" should be the most likely interpretation of a IlOUn phrase.
Now, consider only those noun phrases which occur as subjects of a senl,ence.
In a given corpus, you nlighl, liml that pronouns occur just as fre(luently as "lletermincr nou,,"s in the subject I)ositiou.
This type of information can easily be cai)tnred by conditional l)robalfilities.
Finally, tmsume that the sentence begins with a pronoun followed by a verb.
In l.his case, it is quite clear that, while you can probably concoct a sentence which fit, s this description and does not have a pronoun for a subject, I,he first, theory which you should pursue is one which makes this hypothesis.
The context-sensitive conditional probabilities which ?earl uses take into account the irnmediate parent of a theory 3 and the part-of-speech trigram centered at the beginning of the theory.
For example, consider the sentence: My first love was named ?earl.
(no subliminal propaganda intended) A theory which tries to interpret "love" as a verb will be scored based ou the imrl,-of-speecll trigranl "adjective verb verb" and the parent theory, probably "S --+ NP VP".
A theory which interprets "love" as a noun will be scored based on the trigram "adjective noun w~rl)".
AIl,llo.gll Io.xical prollabilities favor "love" as a verb, I, he comlitional i)robabilities will heavily favor "love" as a noun in tiffs context.
4 Using
the Geometric Mean of Theory Scores According to probability theory, the likelihood of two independent events occurring at the same time is the product of their individual probabilities.
Previous statistical parsing techniques apply this definition to the cooceurrence of two theories in a parse, and claim that the likelihood of the two theories being correct is the product of the probabilities of the two theories.
3The parent of a theory is defined as a theory with a CF rule which co.tains the left-hand side of tile theory.
For instance, if "S ---, NP VP" and "NP --+ det n" are two grammar rules, the first rule can be a parent of tile second, since tl,e left-hand side of tile second "NP" occurs in the right-hand side of the first rule.
4In fact, tile part-of-speech tagging model which is Mso used in ~earl will heavily favor "love" as a noun.
We ignore this behavior to demonstrate the benefits of the trigram co.ditioni.g. 16'l?his application of probal)ility theory ignores two vital observations el)out the domain of statistical parsing: • Two CO,lstructs .occurring in the same sentence are,lot n,:ccssa,'ily indel)cndc.nt (and frequ~ml.ly are not).
If the indel)el/de//e,, ;msuniption is violated, then tile prodl,ct of individual probabilities has no meaning with,'espect to the joint probability of two events.

Theory Length Independence This scoring function, although heuristic in derivation, provides a nlethod Ibr evaluating the value of a theory, regardless of its length.
When a rule is first predicted (Earleystyh;), its score is just its raw score, which relireseuts how uiuch {,lie context predicts it.
llowever, when the parse process hypothesizes interpretations of tile senteuce which reinforce this theory, the geornetric nlean of all of the raw scorn of the rule's subtree is used, rcllrescnting the ow,rall likelihood or I.he i.heory given the coutcxt of the sentence.
Low-freqlteltcy Ew:nts AII.hol,gll sonic statistical natural language aplili('ations enllAoy backing-off e.stimatitm tcchni(lues\[ll\]\[5\] to handle low-freql,eney events, "Pearl uses a very sintple estilnation technique, reluctantly attributed to Chl,rcl,\[7\].
This technique estiniatcs the probability of au event by adding 0.5 to every frequency count.
~ Low-scoring theories will be predicted by the Earley-style parscr.
And, if no other hypothesis is suggested, these theories will be pt, rsued.
If a high scoring theory advauces a theory with a very low raw score, the resulting theory's score will be the geonletric nlean of all of the raw scores of theories contained in that thcory, and thus will I)e nluch higher than the low-scoring theory's score.
Example of Scoring Function As an example of how the conditional-probability-b<~sed scoring flinction handles anlbiguity, consider the sentence Fruit, flies like a banana.
i,i the dontain of insect studies.
Lexical probabilities should indicate that the word "flies" is niore likely to be a plural noun than an active verb.
This information is incorporated in the trigram scores, llowever, when the interliretation S --+ . NP VP is proposed, two possible NPs will be parsed, NP ~ nolnl (fruit) all d NP -+ noun nouu (fruit flies).
Sitlce this sentence is syntactically ambiguous, if the first hypothesis is tested first, the parser will interpret this sentence incorrectly.
ll0wever, this will not happen in this donlain.
Since "fruit flies" is a common idiom in insect studies, the score of its trigram, noun noun verb, will be much greater than the score of the trigram, noun verb verb.
Titus, not only will the lexical probability of the word "flies/verb" be lower than that of "flies/noun," but also tile raw score of "NP --+ noun (fruit)" will be lower than 7We are not deliberately avoiding using,'ill probability estinlatioll techniques, o,,ly those backillg-off techaiques which use independence assunlptions that frequently provide misleading information when applied to natural liillgU age.
17that of "NP -+ nolln nolln (fruit flies)," because of the differential between the trigram score~s.
So, "NP -+ noun noun" will I)e used first to advance the "S --+ NI ) VP" rid0..
Further, even if the I)arser a(lva.llCeS I)ol,h NII hyliol,h(++ses, I,he "S --+ NP . VI'" rule IlSilig "N I j ---+ liOllll iiOlln" will have a higher s(:ore l, hau the "S --+ INIP . Vl )'' rule using "NP -+ notul".

T'earl's Capabilities Besides nsing statistical methods to guide tile parser l,hrough I,h,' I)arsing search space, Pearl also performs other functions which arc crucial to robustly processing UlU'estricted uatural language text aud speech.
Handling Unknown Words Pearl uses a very simple I)robal)ilistic unknown word model to hypol.h(nsize categories for unknown words.
When word which is unknown to the systenl's lexicon, tile word is assumed to I)e a.ny one of the open class categories.
The lexical i)rol);d)ility givell a (-atcgory is the I)rol)ability of that category occurring in the training corpus.
Idiom Processing and Lat, tice Parsing Since the parsing search space can be simplified by recognizing idioms, Pearl allows tile input string to i,iclude idioms that span more than one word in tile sentence.
This is accoml)lished by viewing the input sentence as a word la.ttice instead of a word string.
Since idion}s tend to be uuand)igttous with respect to part-of-speech, they are generally favored over processing the individual words that make up the idiom, since the scores of rules containing the words will ten(I to be less thau 1, while a syntactically apl)rol)riate, unambiguous idiom will have a score of close to 1.
The ahility to parse a scnl.epce wil, h multiple word hyl)otlmses and word I)oulidary hyl)othcses makes PeaH very usehd in the domain of spoken language processing.
By delayiug decisions about word selection I)ut maintaining scoring information from a sl)eech recognizer, tlic I>a.rser can use granmlaticai information in word selection without slowing the speech recognition pro(~ess.
Because of Pearl's interleaved architecture, one could easily incorporate scoring information from a speech rccogniz, cr into the set of scoring functions used in tile parser.
Pearl could also provide feedback to the specch recognizer about the grammaticality of fragnmitt hypotheses to guide the recognizer's search.
Partial Parses The main advantage of chart-based parsiug over other parsing algorithms is that the parser can also recognize well-formed substrings within the sentence in the course of pursuing a complete parse.
Pearl takes fidl advantage of this characteristic.
Once Pearl is given the input sentence, it awaits instructions a.s to what type of parse should be attempted for this i,lput.
A standard parser automatically attempts to produce a sentence (S) spanning tile entire input string.
llowever, if this fails, the semantic interpreter might be able to (Icriw-' some mealfiug from the sentence if given 18aon-ow'.rhq~pirig noun, w~.rb, and prepositional phrases.
If a s,,nte,,ce f~tils I,o parse,, requests h)r p;trLial parses of the input string call be made by specifying a range which the parse l.ree should cover and the category (NP, VI', etc.).

Prepositional Phrase Attachment Acc0rately determining prepositional phrase attachnlent in general is a difficult and well-documented problem, llowever, based on experience with several different donmins, we have found prel)ositional phrase attachment to be a domain-specific pheuomenon for which training ca,t I)e very helpfld.
For insta,tce, in the dirccl.ion-li,ldi,,g do,lmin, from aml to prepositional phrases generally attach to the preceding verb and not to any noun phrase.

Future Work The "Pearl parser takes advantage of donmin-depen(lent information to select the most approi)riate interpretation of an inpul,.
Ilowew'.r, i,he statistical measure used to disalnbiguate these interpretations is sensitive to certain attributes of the grammatical formalism used, as well as to the part-of-si)eech categories used to laI)el lexical entries.
All of the exl)erimcnts performed on T'carl titus fa," have been using one gra.linrla.r, one pa.rl.of-speech tag set, and one donlaiu (hecause of availability constra.ints).
Future experime.nl,s are I)lanned to evalua.l,e "Pearl's i)erforma.nce on dii\[cre.nt domaius, as well as on a general corpus of English, arid ott dig fi~rent grammars, including a granunar derived fi'om a nlanually parsed corl)us.
Conclusion The probal)ilistic parser which we have described provides a I)latform for exploiting the useful information made available by statistical models in a manner which is consistent with existing grammar formalisms and parser desigus.
7)carl can bc trained to use any context-free granurlar, ;iccompanied I)y tile al)l)ropriate training matc,'ial.
Anti, the parsing algorithm is very similar to a standard bottom-t,I) algorithm, with the exception of using theory scores to order the search.
More thorough testing is necessary to inclosure 7)carl's performance in tcrms of i)arsing accuracy, partof-sl)eech assignnmnt, unknown word categorization, kliom processing cal)al)ilil.ies, aml even word selection in speech processing.
With the exception of word selection, preliminary tesl.s show /)earl performs these ttLsks with a high degree of accuracy.
