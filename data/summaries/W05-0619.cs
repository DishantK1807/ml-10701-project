Carletta et al.(1997). This metric showed that the human annotators distinguish the four categories with a reproducibility of K=.925 (N=44775, k=2; where K is the kappa coefficient, N is the number of tokens and k is the number of annotators).

Robinson et al.(1999) and Strassel et al.(2003). The inter-annotator fscore agreement calculated this way for MUC-7 and Hub 4 was measured at 97 and 98 respectively.
W03-1507
We use a conditional Markov model (CMM) tagger (Klein et al., 2003; Finkel et al., 2005) to train two different models on the same data by splitting the feature set.

McCallum and Nigam (1998), Osborne and Baldridge (2004).
N04-1012
While reusability of selective samples for other learning algorithms has been explored (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004), no effort has been made to quantify the effect of selective sampling on annotator performance.

The f-complement has been suggested for active learning in the context of NP chunking as a structural comparison between the different analyses of a committee (Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000).
