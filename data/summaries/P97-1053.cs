A treatment for ellipsis interpretation which uses a form of higher-order unification has been proposed in (Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991) and extended to other kinds of parallel constructions by (Gardent, Kohlhase, and van Leusen, 1996; Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996).

of the grammar, time-constraints for parsing, and most importantly the kind of incompleteness, uncertainty, and inconsistency, coming with spoken input are coming more into the focus of semantic processing (Bos et al., 1996; Pinkal, 1995).
C96-1024
Several aspects of underspecification have been focussed upon, motivated mainly by computational considerations: the ambiguity and openness of lexical meaning (Pustejovsky, 1995; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995), referential underspecification (Asher, 1993), structural semantic underspecification caused by syntactic ambiguities (Egg and Lebeth, 1995), and by the underdetermination of scope relations (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Reyte, 1993).
