The functional tags for Chinese and English PropBanks are to a large extent similar and more details can be found in (Xue and Palmer, 2003).

There are several other annotation projects, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), Salsa (Ellsworth et al., 2004), and the Prague Tectogrammatics (Hajicova and Kucerova, 2002), that share similar goals.

I PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is an annotation of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994) with ‘predicate-argument’ structures, using sense tags for highly polysemous words and semantic role labels for each argument.

It takes a practical approach to semantic representation, adding a layer of predicate argument information, or semantic roles, to the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank (Palmer et al., 2005).

BerkeleycjkA1AFs FrameNet project, (Baker et al., 1998; Fillmore and Atkins, 1998; Johnson et al., 2002) is committed to producing rich semantic frames on which the annotation is based, but it is less concerned with annotating complete texts, concentrating instead on annotating a set of examples for each predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives), and attempting to describe the network of relations among the semantic frames.
P98-1013
There is a pressing need for a consensus on a taskoriented level of semantic representation that can enable the development of powerful new semantic analyzers in the same way that the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) enabled the development of statistical syntactic parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001).

The PropBank annotation philosophy has been extended to the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2003).
W03-1707
The PropBank Frameset distinctions, which can be made consistently by humans and systems (over 90% accuracy for both), are surprisingly compatible with the groupings; 95% of the groups map directly onto a single PropBank frameset sense (Palmer et al., 2004).
W04-2807
These groupings were previously shown to reconcile a substantial portion of the tagging disagreements, raising inter-annotator agreement from 71% in the case of fine-grained WordNet senses to 82% in the case of grouped senses for the Senseval 2 English data (Palmer et al., to appear), and currently to 89% for 93 new verbs (almost 12K instances) (Palmer et al., 2004).
