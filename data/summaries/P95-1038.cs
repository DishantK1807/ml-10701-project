Once all classes in the two clusterings have been accounted for, calculate the precision, recall, and F-measure as explained in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993).

Several researchers (Lang and Hirschman, 1988; Rau et al., 1989; Pustejovsky, 1992; Grishman and Sterling, 1993; Basili et al., 1994), either directly or indirectly, have addressed issues that assist in making it easier to move an NLP system from one domain to another.

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) duster adjectives into partitions and present an interesting evaluation to compare the generated adjective classes against those provided by an expert.
P93-1023
We have adopted the F-measure (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Chincor, 1992).
P93-1023
provide such semantic classes (Resnik, 1993; Basili et al., 1994) to assist in text understanding.
