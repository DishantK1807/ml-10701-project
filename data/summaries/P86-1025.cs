For example, as noted above, we suspect on the basis of recent work on English (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986) that some of the characteristics that we have identified with the utterance in the present model are actually reflections of discourse structure rather than features specific to a well-defined type of unit within the hierarchy of prosodic phrases.

This is consistent with a view in which the surface representations are merely descriptions of the phonetic form, in a spirit similar to what Marcus et al.(1983) have proposed for surface syntactic representation.
