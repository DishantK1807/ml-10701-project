The notion of "salience" for the purposes of centering theory is most commonly defined according to a hierarchy of grammatical roles: SUBJECT > DIRECT OBJECT > INDIRECT OBJECT ~> OTHERS (see e.g., Brennan et al 1987)• For alternative approaches see e.g., (Strube and Hahn 1999), (Walker et al 1994).

This approach was suggested by Kibble (1999), proposing that text and sentence planning should be driven by the goal of realising the designated topic in positions where it will be interpreted as the Cb.

Our implementation incorporates two extensions which have implications for more structured discourse: Strube and Hahn's (1999) "cheapness" principle, which favours transitions that introduce a new topic • in.

in Text Planning Text Planning is one of the distinct tasks identified in Reiter's "consensus" architecture for Natural Language Generation (Reiter 1994, Reiter and Dale 1997): Text Planningdeciding the content of a message, and organising the component propositions into a text tree; Sentence Planning aggregating propositions into clausal units and choosing lexical items corresponding to concepts in the knowledge base; Linguistic realisation surface details Such as agreement, orthography etc.

Kibble (1999) dubbed these principles cohesion and salience respectively.

215. With a few exceptions (e.g., Mittal et al 1998, Kibble 1999, Kibble and Power 1999, Cheng 2000) NLG researchers have interpreted CT as a theory of pronominalisation only (e.g., Dale 1992).

However, as McCoy and Strube (1999) observe, few researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms for pronoun generation.

Stage 1 of the planning procedure is described elsewhere (Power, 2000); we focus here on stages 2 and 3, in which the text planner enumerates the possible assignments of centers and evaluates which is the best.
