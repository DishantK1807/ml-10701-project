Our aspectual class system is not entirely settled yet, but we expect to have one similar to that of \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\].

to Reichenbach Researchers concerned with higher-level discourse structure, e.g., Webber \[1987; 1988\], Passonneau \[1988\] and Song and Cohen \[1991\], have almost invariably relied on some Reichenbach \[1947\]-1ike conception of tense.

The second approach emphasizes inference based on world knowledge, e.g., \[Hobbs, 1985\] and \[Lascarides and Asher, 1991; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992\].

Work on discourse structure, e.g., \[Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Allen, 1987\], has so far taken a rather coarse, high-level view of discourse, mostly treating sentences or sentence-like entities ("utterance units,.... contributions," etc).

As has been pointed out by Webber \[1987; 1988\] and others, many subnarratives introduced by a past perfect sentence may continue in simple past.

Webber \[1987\] has proposed independent temporal focusing principles similar to those in \[Grosz and Sidnet, 1986\] for discourse.
