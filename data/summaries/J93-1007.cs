Many collocations retrieved in Church and Hanks (1989) were of this type, as they retrieved doctors-dentists, doctors-nurses, doctorbills, doctors-hospitals, nurses-doctor, etc., which are not collocations in the sense defined above.

Other works such as Church and Hanks (1989) simply focus on an evaluation of the correlation of appearance of a pair of words, which is roughly equivalent to condition (C1).

Stochastic part-of-speech taggers such as those in Church (1988) and 6 This fact is being seriously challenged by current research (e.g., Abney 1990; Hindle 1983), and might not be true in the near future.

Church and Hanks (1989) describe a different set of techniques to retrieve collocations.

Preliminary results obtained with parts of Xtract have been described in the past (e.g., Smadja and McKeown 1990); this paper gives a complete description of the system and the results obtained.

Hindle and Rooth (1990) later refined this approach by using bigram statistics to enhance the task of prepositional phrase attachment.

We preprocessed the corpus with a stochastic part-of-speech tagger developed at Bell Laboratories by Ken Church (Church 1988).

Aside from the work we present in this paper, most of the work carried out within the lexical approach has been done in computer-assisted lexicography by Choueka, Klein, and Neuwitz (1983) and Church and his colleagues (Church and Hanks 1989).

Speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and text compression (e.g., Bell, Witten, and Cleary 1989; Guazzo 1980) have been of long-standing interest, and some new applications are currently being investigated, such as machine translation (Brown et al.1988), spelling correction (Mays, Damerau, and Mercer 1990; Church and Gale 1990), parsing (Debili 1982; Hindle and Rooth 1990).

As in Church and Hanks (1989), the words can appear in any order and they can be separated by an arbitrary number of other words.
H89-2012 P89-1010
Church et al.(1989, 1991) have yet another approach; they consider questions such as what does a boat typically do?
H89-2012 P89-1010
The second limitation is that many collocations identified in Church and Hanks (1989) do not really identify true collocations, but simply pairs of words that frequently appear together such as the pairs "doctor-nurse," "doctor-bill," "doctor-honorary," "doctors-dentists," "doctors-hospitals," etc.

Using Ana (Kukich 1983) as a deep generator, Cook is implemented in FUF (Elhadad 1990), an extended implementation of FUG, and uniformly represents the lexicon and syntax as originally suggested by Halliday (1966).

This stage is comparable to Church and Hanks (1989) in that it evaluates a certain word association between pairs of words.

Also, these collocations have been used by an automatic parser in order to resolve attachment ambiguities (Hindle and Rooth 1990).
