Models that can handle non-independent lexical features have given very good results both for part-of-speech and structural disambiguation (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1998).

In agreement with recent resuits on parsing with lexicalised probabilistic grammars (Collins, 1997; Srinivas, 1997), we find that statistics over lexical, as opposed to structural, features best correspond to human intuitive.judgments and to experimental findings.

Current 140 LTAG part-of-speech taggers, called supertaggets (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994; Srinivas, 1997) assign a set of elementary trees to each word, in effect chunking the text.

In agreement with recent results on parsing with lexicalised probabilistic grammars (Collins, 1997; Srinivas, 1997; Charniak, 1997), our main result is that statistics over lexical features best correspond to independently established truman intuitive preferences and experimental findings.

Some current meth139 ods have a generate and filter approach (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995): all constructic,ns are generated and then filtered based on a sl~atistical model.

Refinements in this direction of the annotation of the grammar used by the XTAG system (Doran et al., 1994) are actually tinder way.

Similar conclusions are being reached in (Roland and Jurafsky, 1998), who compare different corpora.
