The method consists of automatically mapping WordNet senses to top level, numbered entries in the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE, (Soanes and Stevenson, 2003)).

More recently researchers have begun to employ deeper syntactic analysis, such as dependency parsing (Yangarber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Sudo et al., 2001; Sudo et al., 2003; Yangarber, 2003).

Traditionally, SRL systems have been trained on either the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005) ??for two years, the CoNLL workshop (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) has made this their shared task, or the FrameNet corpus ??Senseval-3 used this for their shared task (Litkowski, 2004).

This amounts to the automatic induction of ne-grained semantic similarity from corpus data, a notoriously dif cult problem (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003; Schulte im Walde, 2003).

(Pradhan et al., 2004) use a SVM classifier for the semantic role labeling of nominalizations in English and Chinese based on the FrameNet database and the Chinese PropBank respectively.

Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.

This task is a more advanced and realistic version of the Automatic Semantic Role Labeling task of Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004).

A crucial difference from similar approaches, such as SRL with PropBank roles (Pradhan et al., 2004) is that by identifying relations as part of a frame, you have identi ed a gestalt of relations that enables far more inference, and sentences from the same passage that use other words from the same frame will be easier to link together.

Approaches evaluated so far make use of dictionaries with semantic annotation (Piao et al., 2006), WordNet (Pearce, 2001), automatically generated thesauri (Lin, 1999; McCarthy et al., 2003; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006), vector-based methods that measure semantic distance (Baldwin et al., 2003; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006), translations extracted from parallel corpora (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006) or hybrid methods that use machine learning techniques informed by features coded using some of the above methods (Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005).

This task has been the subject of a previous Senseval task (Automatic Semantic Role Labeling, Litkowski (2004)) and two shared tasks on semantic role labeling in the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Carreras & Marquez (2004) and Carreras & Marquez (2005)).
