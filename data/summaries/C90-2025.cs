Thus, apart fl-om introducing spurious ambiguity into the grammar (see Wittenburg 1987 for detailed discussion), the operation of type-raising, when used unconstrained, can also lead to considerable inefficiency in generation.

It turns out that the processing strategy that Partee and Rooth suggest can be stated declarativcly as part of the grammar, if the operation of type-raising is incorporated into a supercombinator (in the sense of Wittenburg 1987,89) that combines type-raising and functional application into a single operation.

Grammatical knowledge is expressed in the fi'amework of categorial unifieation-qrammars developed by Karttunen (1986), Wittenburg (1986), Uszkoreit (1986), and Zeevat et.
C86-1016 C86-1045
The principle of type-raising as necessary which follows fi'om minimal type assignment has been implemented using Wittenburg's (1987,1989) idea of supereombinators.

2. The Grammar Formalism: Categorim Unification Grammar The grammatical formalism that we adopt for categorial unification grammar is similar to that proposed in Uszkoreit (1986).
