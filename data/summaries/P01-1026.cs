To resolve this problem, Fujii and Ishikawa (2000) used a language model to filter out descriptions with low perplexity.

A sample of these includes methods to extract linguistic resources (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000; Resnik, 1999; Soderland, 1997), retrieve useful information in response to user queries (Etzioni, 1997; McCallum et al., 1999) and mine/discover knowledge latent in the Web (Inokuchi et al., 1999).

4.1 Overview Encyclopedias generated through our Web-based method can be used in a number of applications, including human usage, thesaurus production (Hearst, 1992; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988) and natural language understanding in general.

Although Harabagiu et al.(2000) proposed a knowledge-based QA system, most existing systems rely on conventional IR and shallow NLP methods.

P (d) ≈ P L (d) (4) Statistical approaches to language modeling have been used in much NLP research, such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) and speech recognition (Bahl et al., 1983).

However, Moldovan and Harabagiu (2000) found that each of the TREC questions can be recast as either a single axis or a combination of axes.

In fact, a number of QA systems targeting the TREC QA collection have recently been proposed (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Moldovan and Harabagiu, 2000; Prager et al., 2000).

In addition, since word senses are often associated with domains (Yarowsky, 1995), word senses can be consequently distinguished by way of determining the domain of each description.

1 http://www.google.com/ The first rule is based on Japanese linguistic patterns typically used for term descriptions, such as “X toha Y dearu (X is Y).” Following the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), we semi-automatically produced 20 patterns based on the Japanese CD-ROM World Encyclopedia (Heibonsha, 1998), which includes approximately 80,000 entries related to various fields.

Specifically, we enhance the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), which extracts encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., term descriptions) from the Web.

In principle, the remaining two modules (“retrieval” and “extraction”) are the same as proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000).

Among a number of existing categorization methods, we experimentally used one proposed by Iwayama and Tokunaga (1994), which formulates P (c|d) as in Equation (2).
