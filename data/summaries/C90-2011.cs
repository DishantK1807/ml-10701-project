However, all of them are primarily strictly from left-to-right, thus with relatively limited applications for cases in which other strategies such as island-driven (Hayes, 1986) or even right-to-left are more useful (Huang, 1988), for example, corrupted word lattice with extra, missing or erroneous phones in speech recognition (Ward, 1988).

Furthermore, in some other approaches to increase the flexibility of the slot and filler principle, such as island parsing (Stock, 1988) and discontinuous segmented parsing (Hellwig, 1988), the augmented chart proposed here can also be easily extended and applied.
