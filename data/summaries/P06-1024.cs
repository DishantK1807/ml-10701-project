COMMUNICATOR (Walker et al., 2001)).

CFS subset evaluation (Rieser and Lemon, 2006)) on in order to determine which contextual features this suggests are important.
P06-2085
We use 2 user simulations learned from COMMUNICATOR data (Walker et al., 2001; Georgila et al., 2005b) to explore the effects of different features on learned dialogue strategies.
P01-1066
These simulations also simulate ASR errors since the probabilities are learned from recognition hypotheses and system behaviour logged in the COMMUNICATOR data (Walker et al., 2001) further annotated with speech acts and contexts by (Georgila et al., 2005b).
P01-1066
correlation-based feature subset (CFS) evaluation (Rieser and Lemon, 2006)) on the COMMUNICATOR data (Georgila et al., 2005a; Walker et al., 2001) in order to identify additional context features that it may be effective to represent in the state.
P01-1066 P06-2085
We used two baselines for comparison: â€¢ The performance of the original COMMUNICATOR systems in the data set (Walker et al., 2001).
