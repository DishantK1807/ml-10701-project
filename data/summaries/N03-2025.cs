[Cucchiarelli & Velardi 2001] discussed boosting the performance of an existing NE tagger by unsupervised learning based on parsing structures.

In order to improve the bootstrapping performance, we use the heuristic one tag per domain for multiword NE in addition to the one sense per discourse principle [Gale et al 1992].

The tag propagation/elimination scheme is adopted from [Yarowsky 1995].

[Cucerzan & Yarowsky 1999], [Collins & Singer 1999] and [Kim et al.2002] presented various techniques using co-training schemes for NE extraction seeded by a small list of proper names or hand-crafted NE rules.
