In the categoriai semantic framework developed by Fernando Pereira (Pereira, 1990; Pereira and Pollack, 1991; Pereira, 1991), syntactic structures are directly associated with interpretations (or their types), and syntactic configurations license the combination of these interpretations in a semantic derivation.

There are several ways of ensuring the needed result: the valence of tire verb can be reflected in its semantic type; f-structures can be typed, with this rule applying only to intransitive f-structures (Zajac and Emele, 1990); or the PROD and its arguments can be separately specified, with the argumarts of the PRED specified as a list which can be mntched against, as in recent work by John Maxwell, Ron Kaplan, and others.

Many of these rules are modifications and extensions of rules originally described in Pereira (1990), though Pereira's system appeals to phrase structure configurations rather than f-structures to conACRES DE COLING-92.

In this, the approach differs from other recent approaches to semantic interpretation in LFG (Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988), in which the interpretation of an fstructure is represented as a directed graph, and semantic derivation proceeds principally by unification of semantic representations.

The lexical entries involved in the derivation of sentence (1) are: John NP (I PRED)= 'John' I~ = \[OP/\] crashed V (T PILED)= 'crash(suBJ}' (, TENSE) = PAST (T PRED)a : \[O \[Ax.crash(z)\] The notation f~, stands for the interpretation of an f-structure f, often referred to as the semantic projection of f (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988).

This is indicated in the second condition by the regular expression TOPIC OF*; this expression involves functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988) and requires that the relative pronoun relp must appear at the end of a path that is a member of the language described by the regular exprestmn.

(4) G:\[o~-M\] The sequent '\[a ~ M\]' is a pair consisting of a set of assumptions a, somewhat analogous to a 'quantifier store' (Cooper, 1983), and a matrix term M in which free variables introduced by the asstutlptions in a may occur (Pereira, 1990; Pereira, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1991).
