The treebanks (Haji c et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2003; Bcurrency1ohmov·a et al., 2003; Kromann, 2003; van der Beek et al., 2002; Brants et al., 2002; Kawata and Bartels, 2000; Afonso et al., 2002; D zeroski et al., 2006; Civit Torruella and Mart· Anton· n, 2002; Nilsson et al., 2005; O azer et al., 2003; Atalay et al., 2003) provided for the CoNLL shared task(Buchholz et al., 2006) were converted to a set of instances each of which consists of the attributes of a candidate word pair with a classi cation that indicates the existence, direction and type of the dependency link between the pair.

GPA was picked for this problem because it has proven to be fairly ef cient and robust in the presence of irrelevant or redundant attributes in previous work such as morphological disambiguation in Turkish (Yuret and Ture, 2006) and protein secondary structure prediction (Kurt, 2005).
