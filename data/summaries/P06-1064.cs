A number of wide-coverage TAG, CCG, LFG and HPSG grammars (Xia, 1999; Chen et al., 2005; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a; O’Donovan et al., 2005; Miyao et al., 2004) have been extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), and have enabled the creation of widecoverage parsers for English which recover local and non-local dependencies that approximate the underlying predicate-argument structure (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark and Curran, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005; Shen and Joshi, 2005).

The annotation scheme used in Tiger is an extension of that used in the earlier, and smaller, German Negra corpus (Skut et al., 1997).

Similar algorithms have been developed by Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002a) to create CCGbank, a corpus of CCG derivations (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2005) from the Penn Treebank, by C¸akıcı (2005) to extract a CCG lexicon from a Turkish dependency corpus, and by Moortgat and Moot(2002) toinduce atype-logical grammar for Dutch.

However, many corpora (B¨ohomv´aetal., 2003; Skut et al., 1997; Brants et al., 2002) use dependency graphs or other representations, and the extraction algorithms that have been developed for Penn Treebank style corpora may not be immediately applicable to this representation.

Good lexical coverage is essential for the performance of statistical CCG parsers (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a).
P02-1043
However, Dubey and Keller (2003) have demonstrated that lexicalization does not help a Collins-style parser that is trained on this corpus, and Levy and Manning (2004) have shown that its context-free representation is a poor approximation to the underlying dependency structure.
