In (Hana et al., 2004), Czech data is used to develop a morphological analyzer for Russian.

root-based clustering of Arabic (De Roeck and 61 Al-Fares, 2000)), may be used instead of, or in addition to, distribution-based clustering.

Parallel corpora have also been used to infer morphological analyzers, POS taggers, and noun phrase bracketers by projections via word alignments (Yarowsky et al., 2001).

Taggers have been developed for a variety of languages, including Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) (Khoja, 2001; Diab et al., 2004).

Tagging is often the first step towards parsing or chunking (Osborne, 2000; Koeling, 2000), and knowledge of POS tags can benefit statistical language models for speech recognition or machine translation (Heeman, 1998; Vergyri et al., 2004).

Many approaches for POS tagging have been developed in the past, including rule-based tagging (Brill, 1995), HMM taggers (Brants, 2000; Cutting and others, 1992), maximum-entropy models (Rathnaparki, 1996), cyclic dependency networks (Toutanova et al., 2003), memory-based learning (Daelemans et al., 1996), etc.

Several different clustering algorithms could in principle be used; here we utilize Brown’s clustering algorithm (Brown and others, 1992), which iteratively merges word clusters with high mutual information based on distributional criteria.

As an extension, we allow the interpolation weights to be a function of the current tag: λ(ti), since class-dependent interpolation has shown improvements over basic interpolation in applications such as language modeling (Bulyko et al., 2003).
