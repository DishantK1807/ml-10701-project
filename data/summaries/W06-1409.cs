Perhaps the most interesting account of overspecification so far is the one proposed by Horacek (2005), where logically redundant properties enter the descriptions generated when the combined certainty of other properties falls short of what is contextually required.
W05-1606
In corpus-based studies, it has been shown that logically redundant properties tend to be included when they fulfill one of a number of pragmatic functions, such as to indicate that a property is of particular importance to the speaker, or to highlight the speakerâ€™s awareness that the referent has the property in question (Jordan 2000).

Since hierarchies involve relations, the first algorithm that comes to mind is the one proposed by Dale and Haddock (1991).

(Cf., Edmonds 1994 for a related set of problems.) 2 Hierarchical domains Existing work on GRE tends to focus on fairly simple domains, dominated by one-place properties.

Let us compare the predictions made by our algorithms with those made by Dale and Haddock (1991).
E91-1028
When relations (i.e., two-place properties) are taken into account at all (e.g., Dale and Haddock 1991, Krahmer and Theune 2002), the motivating examples are kept so small that it is reasonable to assume that speaker and hearer know all the relevant facts in advance.
