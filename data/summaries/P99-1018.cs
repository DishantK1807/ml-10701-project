We use a part-of-speech tagger \[Brill 1992\] and a finite-state grammar to extract simplex NPs.

All domain-specific markup was removed, and the text was processed by the MXTERMINATOR sentence boundary detector \[Reynar and Ratnaparkhi 1997\] and Brill's part-of-speech tagger \[Brill 1992\].

\[Knight and Hatzivassiloglou 1995\] and \[Langkilde and Knight 1998\] have proposed models for incorporating statistical information into a text generation system, an approach that is similar to our way of using the evidence obtained from corpus in our actual generator.

In our MAGIC system, aggregation operators, such as conjunction, ellipsis, and transformations of clauses to adjectival phrases and relative clauses, are performed to combine related clauses together and increase conciseness \[Shaw 1998a; Shaw 1998b\].

Corpus We used two corpora for our analysis: hospital discharge summaries from 1991 to 1997 from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, and the January 1996 part of the Wall Street Journal corpus from the Penn TreeBank \[Marcus et al.1993\]. To facilitate comparisons across the two corpora, we intentionally limited ourselves to only one month of the WSJ corpus, so that approximately the same amount of data would be examined in each case.

On the other hand, recent computational work on sentence planning \[Bateman et al.1998; Shaw 1998b\] indicates that generation research has progressed to a point where hard problems such as ellipsis, conjunctions, and ordering of paradigmatically related constituents are addressed.

Computational corpus studies related to adjectives were performed by \[Justeson and Katz 1991; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997\], but none was directly on the ordering problem.

Yet, general lexicons such as WordNet \[Miller et al.1990\] and COMLEX \[Grishman et al.1994\], do not store such information.

In the future, we will experiment with semantic (rather than positional) clustering of premoditiers, using techniques such as those proposed in \[Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1993; Pereira et al.1993\]. The qualitative analysis of the output of our clustering module shows that frequently positional and semantic classes overlap, and we are interested in measuring the extent of this phenomenon quantitatively.
