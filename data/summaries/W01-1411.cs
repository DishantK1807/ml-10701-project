Work The most common approach to deriving translation lexicons from empirical data (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, 1989; Gale and Church, 1991; Fung, 1995; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Wu and Xia, 1994; Melamed, 1995) is to use some variant of the following procedure: 1 AF Pick a good measure of the degree of association between words in language C4 BD and words in language C4 BE in aligned sentences of a parallel bilingual corpus.

Our overall approach to machine translation is a deep-transfer approach in which the transfer relationships are learned from a parallel bilingual corpus (Richardson et al., 2001).

We use the terms “coverage” and “accuracy” in essentially the same way as Melamed (1996, 2000).

The improvements in end-to-end performance due to these additions in a French-to-English translation task are described elsewhere (Pinkham and Corston-Oliver, 2001).

important work of Brown et al.(1993) is not directly comparable, since their globally-optimized generative probabilistic model of translation never has to make a firm commitment as to what can or cannot be a translation pair.

As a measure of association, we use the loglikelihood-ratio statistic recommended by Dunning (1993), which is the same statistic used by Melamed to initialize his models.

As Melamed later (1996, 2000) pointed out, however, this technique is hampered by the existence of indirect associations between words that are not mutual translations.

This is manifestly not the case, as is shown by the following list of translation pairs selected from our corpus: base de donn´ees/database mot de passe/password sauvegarder/back up annuler/roll back ouvrir session/log on Some of the most sophisticated work on this aspect of problem again seems to be that of Melamed (1997).
