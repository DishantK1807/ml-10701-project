As the next step, an implementation based on a classical pronoun resolution algorithm (Lappin and Leass, 1994) was applied to the texts.

A multitude of different techniques has been applied to this end, some of the more remarkable of them being (Marcu, 1997; Mani et al.1998; Teufel and Moens, 2002; Elhadad et al., 2005), to name just a few.

Finally, these anaphoric noun phrases were resolved using a modified version of (Lappin and Leass, 1994), adjusted to finding antecedents of nouns.

It must be mentioned that several researchers looked into determining automatically various semantic properties of verbs, such as (Siegel, 1998; Merlo et al., 2002).

The system was implemented in Java, within the GATE framework, using Connexor Machinese Syntax parser (Tapanainen and JÃ¤rvinen, 1997).

To this end, the GATE Gazetteer (Cunningham et al., 2002) was used, and only entities recognized by it automatically were considered.

Relatively few attempts have been made at summarizing less structured genres, some of them being dialogue and speech summarization (Zechner, 2002; Koumpis et al.2001). The issue of summarizing fiction remains largely untouched, since a few very thorough earlier works (Charniak, 1972; Lehnert, 1982).

These researchers worked on various text genres: scientific and popular scientific articles (Marcu, 1997; Mani et al., 1998), texts in computational linguistics (Teufel and Moens, 2002), and medical texts (Elhadad et al., 2002).
