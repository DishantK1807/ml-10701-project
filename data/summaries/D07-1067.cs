644 • Shannon’s Entropy of x(bj) computed by using a language model as described in Genzel & Charniak (2003).
W03-1009
Experimental evaluation on datasets used previously on this task (Sporleder & Lapata, 2004) shows improvement over the state-of-the art methods on APS.

• Shannon’s Entropy of the Paragraph: The motivation for including features encoding the entropyofthesentencesistheobservationthatthe entropy of paragraph initial sentences is lower than the others (Genzel & Charniak, 2003).
W03-1009
These are sentence level features, which we adapt from Genzel(2005)andSporleder& Lapata (2004) 2.
W04-3210
There is psycholinguistic evidence as cited by Sporleder & Lapata (2004) showing that insertion of paragraph breaks could improve the readability.
W04-3210
Previous methods such as Sporleder & Lapata (2004); Genzel (2005); Filippova & Strube (2006) treat the problem as a binary classification task, where each sentence is labeled as the beginning of a paragraph or not.
