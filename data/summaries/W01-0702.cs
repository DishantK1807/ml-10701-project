This is provided to give a more direct comparison with the results in (Daelemans et al., 1999a).

To investigate whether the method is less risky than the memory editing techniques used in (Daelemans et al., 1999b), a re-analysis of their data in performing the same task, albeit with lexical information, was performed to find out the exact drop in the chunk tag accuracy.

task: Base NP chunking The task is base NP chunking on section 20 of the Wall Street Journal corpus, using sections 15 to 18 of the corpus as training data as in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).

A promising technique here is memory-based learning1 (MBL) (Daelemans et al., 1999a), where a task is redescribed as a classification problem.

The system is tested on base noun-phrase (NP) chunking using the Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).

In the best case with the editing techniques used by (Daelemans et al., 1999b), the drop in performance was 0.66% in the chunk tag accuracy with 50% usage (i.e.

However, Daelemans et al (1999b) claim that, in language learning, pruning the training items is harmful.
