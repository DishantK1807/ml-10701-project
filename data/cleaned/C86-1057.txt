Introduction The study of text understanding and knowlegde extraction has been actively done by many researchers.
The authors also studied a method of structured information extraction from texts without a global text analysis.
The method is available for a comparatively sbort text such as a patent claim clause and an abstract of a technical paper.
This paper describes tile outline of a method of knowledge extraction from a longer text which needs a global tex analysis.
The kinds of texts ~e expository texts ~) or explanation texts-'.
Expository texts described here mean those which have various hierarchical headings such as a title, a heading of each section and sometimes an abstract.
In this deEinJtion, most of texts, including technical papers reports and newspapers, are expository.
Texts of this kind disclose the main knowledge in a top-down manner and show not only the location of an attribute value in a text but also severn\[ key points of the content.
This property of expository texts contrasts with that of novels and stories in which an unexpected development of the plot is preferred.
This paper pays attention to such characteristics of expository texts and describes a method of anal yzing texts by referring to information contained in the intersentential relations and the headings of texts and then extracting requested knowledge such as a summary from texts in an efficient way.
2. Analysis of intersententia\] relations Tile global sentential analysis is performed by using the information contaJ ned in the intersentential relations and the headings of a text by a method combining both the bottom-up and the top-down manner.
Various kinds of intersentential relations\]\]~ve been proposed so far by many linguists "--.
By referring to these proposals, intersentential relations are class\] lied tentatively into about 8 items.
They are a detail, an additional, a parallel, a rephrase, an example, a temporal succession, a cansal and a reasoning relation as described in the following subsections.
Detail relations If a term t 2 is the topic term J n a sentence S 2 and i\[ I: is a complementary term of the topLc term t\] in the preceding sentence $I as shown in Expr.(1), S,.
is called the detail of ~1" S • (PRE~' p, K • t., K,~" t~, K "t ).
\]" ' 1 l\]" =t Iz" z rl " rl $5: (PRED: p~, K,,,: t., K ~: t,,) (I) Z Z Z\] ~Z rz rZ S " 3" "''''~'''" where K:t represents a pair of a ease label and a term, and the term w:ith a double underline denotes a topic.
The sentence level of S I to that of S 2 depends on the property of the sentence S 3 following to S 2 and the relation among the terms contained in the sentences S 1 S 2 and S..
If the sentence S 3 is connected to S 1 more closely than $2, for example, if the sentence S 3 has the topic term tl of the sentence S\] as the topic, it is considered that the principal sentence is S and the sentence level of S~ is lower than that of ~..
0 z " t n the other hand, if S I is an introductory sentence of a term t 2 and the articles related to t 2 are described in some sentences following to $I, or I :if t~ is the ~,lobal topic of the section, the z sentence S is considered the principal sentence.
\]'he global 2 topic can be easily identified by inspecting the headings of the section the title and the like, whatever it :i s an attribute name or an attribute value without reading through the whole text.
If the term t 2 in the sentence S.
belongs to a kind of pronouns such as "in the following ones" or "as follows", the sentence S J s set at the same 2 level as that of $I.
At the summarization stage, the system tries to s~orten the part consisting of S 1 and S^ by replacing the pronoun t~ in S.
by the main g z I content given :in S 2, namely, the main part consisting of t. and p . \[Example I\] r2 2 (a) S\]: SGS receives an ordered triple from a user.
$2: Tile triple's form is category, input-frames, conditions on the sentence.
$3: SGS regards tile ordered triple as a goal.
S O describes; the content of a term "ordered triplg" in S\], and S~ has tile topic term "SGS" in S Heine S is the ~e-a\[l of S,and S is the i: . . ' 2 " " " \] 1 " pr:l ncl.pa£ sengence.
(b) S\]: In th:is section, the overview of LFG is described.
$2: LFG is an extension of context free grammar an(\] has the following two structures.
$3: One is a c-structure which represents the surface word and phrase configurations, and tile other is a f-structure ......
S\] is an introductory sentence of a term "LFG" which Js the global topic in a section taken from a text.
S has a kind of pronoun "tile following two 2 . " structures whose contents are described Jn S 3.
Hence, S is tile principal sentence and tile sentence 2 .... level of S_ is the same as that of S^ z " " As a sl)ecial case of detail relations, there are a rephrase relation and an example relation.
These intersententJal relations between sentences S t and S 2 can be identified by referring to their sentent:ial constructions and sentence modifying adverbs such as "in other words" and "for example" . The principal sentence of them is, in most cases, the sentence S 1 Jn an expository text.
Additional relations If the current sentence has the same sentential topic t.
as that of the preceding \].
sentences and describes another attributes or 241 functions of the topic, the current sentence is called an additional sentence to the preceding sentences.
The sentential form of the relation is S~:~ (PRED:p~,± K.:t.,l =z Krl:tl) S : (PRED:p, K.:i., K " ~ (2) 2The level~ ofJbT~h t~ 't2) sentences S and S 9 are l generally assumed to be the same except-for the case that the global topic is put in a predicate part of them.
It can be also considered that additional relations hold among various sentential groups of the same \].eve\].
such as chapters sections or paragraphs under a global topic contained in a title.
3£~ Other sententJal relations There are other intersentential relations.
They are roughly classified into a serial and a concurrent or an extended parallel relation.
A serial relation such as a temporal succession a caasal or a reasoning relation has tile same physical locatioa of focus or the same logical object while it has a time shift or a logical inference step shift between adjacent sententia\] groups.
A concurrent relation has the same t:i.me instant of the event occurrences or the same stages of logical inference while Jt has a distance or a spatial positional shift hetween the physical or tile logical objects described in the adjacent sentential groul)s.
The level number of a sentence to the adjacent sentential groups in these relations is assigned ill a similar way to that of the detail or the additional relation by referring to the intersentential relations and the global topics.
In usual cases, the difference between a principal sentence level and the adjacent sentence level is usually set within one level.
As seen in the above, a sentence or a sentential group has an intersentential relation to some adjacent sentences or sentential groups.
The intersentential relation between adjacent sentences is sinlilar to a relation between adjacent words or word groups combined through rewriting rules of a sentence.
The intersentential relations are classified into two classes.
One of them Js a relation such as a detail relation which holds between a principal sentence and the auxiliary or modifying sententJal group with a lower level than the principal sentence as shown :in Fig.\].(a).
The other is a juxtaposition relation like an additional relation which holds among several coherent sentences with the same level in usual as shown in FJg.l(b). n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 ........ n m (a) (b) Fig.11ntersentential relations In these diagrams a leaf node represents a sentence of a text and an intermediate node denotes a representative sentence of the direcL descendents or the principal parts of them.
A name r attached to an arc bridging over several branches denotes an intersentential relation.
3__~.Textgnalysis An expository text has a title and consists 242 of several sections.
The title shows tile main topics of the text.
The heading of each section shows local topics of each section and constitutes the attributes of the main top:ics.
Each of maJ n sections sometimes has ~ln introductory remark followed by the main part.
The content of tile main part is almost covered with the subframe predetermined by tile heading and the title.
The global cohesion of a section is assured by a relation J n which each maia part of the section shares some items of Lhe same subframe with other main parts.
Based on the above idea of text construction, a text anelysJ.s Js (lone after parsing of each sentence.
First, each pronoun is replaced by the antecedent noun word with tile aids of an anaphora analysis.
Thea, tile interlnediate expressJ on of each sentence of the text is transformed into the normal form in which each topic term J s :inherJ ted together with a double under\] ined nlark.
The expressions to be nornla\]ized are object-apposition expressions ~ obj ec.t-conlponent expressions predicate-cause expressi.ons, expressions which, have ~) a term consisting of a case label, and others . After normalization, the part of top:ics and the content of each sentence are first: identified° Second, intersentent i a\] relatJ ons between two adjacent sentences are identified JndetermJrlistJcally based on the assumptions of two classes of intersentential relations inentJoned in section 2.
Third, tile ma:ia sentence is identified by referring to tile intersentential relations and the heading o\[ the section under tile main topics of tile title.
The lower \]eve\] sentence :is indented as a modifier of the main sentence.
Sometimes, tile know\].edge of the specific field :is required for better understanding of the relations among main sententia\] groups and various headings of the text.
A case :frame of a knowledge base for the specific field is provided in which each slot is filled with the most general term Jn the specific field.
Fourth, a subframe name is prefixed to each nlail\] sent_ential group by referring to the category of the main predicate term of tile main sentence and the subframe designated by the heading of the section and the title of the text.
The basic subframe names are, for example, FUNCTION, COMPOSITION and PROPERTY in descript:ion of actions and physical objects.
As seen in the above, the main work of the text analysis is to :identify the main senl:entJal groups and to assign to thenl a staadard attribute name of a subirame in a specified field.
These frames and attribute names are used as a key of a specific field for efficJ ently storing and retrieving the knowledge contained in texts.
The next example of text analysis J s taken from a technical paper Jn language processing.
