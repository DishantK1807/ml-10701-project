To allow a language model to adapt to its recent context, some researchers have used techniques to update trigram statistics in a dynamic fashion by creating a cache of the most recently seen n-grams which is smoothed together (typically by linear interpolation) with the static model; see for example (Jelinek et al., 1991; Kuhn and de Mori, 1990).
