BiFrameNet ontology induction Ploux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model for matching semantic values between French and English.

Ngai et al.(2002) employed a word-vector based approach to create the alignment between WordNet and HowNet classes without any manual annotation.

Inspired by previous work on syntax-driven semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Fleischman et al., 2003), and syntax-based machine translation (Wu, 1997; Cuerzan and Yarowsky, 2002), we postulate that syntactically similar sentences with the same predicate also share similar semantic roles.

2.1. FrameNet and HowNet The Berkeley FrameNet database consists of frame-semantic descriptions of more than 7000 English lexical items, together with example sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker et al., 1998).

Current automatic semantic parsing algorithms (Gildea and Jurafsky 2003, Fleischman et al., 2003) are all based on syntactic parse trees showing a close coupling of semantic and syntactic structures.

We use two state-of-the-art POS taggers—a maximum entropy based English POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and an HMM based Chinese POS tagger.

The current FrameNet contains on average 30 annotated example sentences per predicate, which is still inadequate for automatic semantic parsing systems (Fleischman et al., 2003).

BiFrameNet lexicon and example sentence induction The linguists-defined ontologies–-FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000), and bilingual dictionaries are the basis for the induction of the mapping.

Consequently, cognitive scientists and computational linguists alike have been interested in the study of semantic mapping between languages (Ploux and Ji, 2003, Dorr et al., 2002, Ngai et al., 2002, Boas 2002, Palmer and Wu, 1995).
