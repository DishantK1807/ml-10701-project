Joshi (1987) described the relevance of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi, 1985; Schabes, Abeille &5 Joshi, 1988) to Natural Language Generation.

â€¢ The methodology which we describe allows sentence generation to proceed in a semantic head-driven fashion (Shieber, Van Noord, Pereira ~ Moore, 1990).

Mumble-86 is one of the foremost sentence generation systems and it (or its predecessors) has been used as the sentence generation components of a number of natural language generation projects (e.g., (McDonald, 1983; McCoy, 1989; Conklin & McDonald, 1982; Woolf& McDonald, 1984; Rubinoff, 1986)).
P82-1030
Mumble-86 (McDonald & Pustejovsky, 1985; Meteer et al., 1987) is a sentence generator based on TAG that is able to take more than just the logical form representation into account.
P85-1012
Shieber and Schabes (1990) describe a generation algorithm which "parses" an input logical form string recording the adjoining and substitution operations necessary to build the string from its elementary components.
J90-1004
We argue in (McCoy, Vijay-Shanker & Yang, 1990) that it is more practical to replace the use of such realization operators with a more formal grammatical system (and that the use of such a system is perfectly consistent with the tenets of systemic linguistics).

In order for this methodology to work, (McDonald & Pustejovsky, 1985) point out that they have to make some strong assumptions about the logical form input to their generator.
