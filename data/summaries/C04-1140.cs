To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tagging study that reaches a 98% accuracy level for a data-driven tagger (which must be distinguished from linguistically backuped taggers which come with ‘heavy’ parsing machinery (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997)).

We first pick up off-the-shelf technology, in our case the rule-based Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) and the statistically-based TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), both trained on newspaper data, and run it on medical text data.

It implements the Viterbi algorithm for second-order Markov models (Brants, 2000), in which states of the model represent tags and the output represents words.

This is most prominently evidenced by the PENN TREEBANK (Marcus et al., 1993).

By evaluating the English version of Brill’s rule-based tagger (Brill, 1995), they conclude that taggers trained on general-purpose language resources, such as newspaper corpora, are not suited to medical narratives but rather need timely and costly retraining on manually tagged medical corpora.

Second, several tagging experiments on newspaper language, whether statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Brants, 2000) or rule-based (Brill, 1995), report that the tagging accuracy for unknown words is much lower than the overall accuracy.2 Thus, the lower percentage of unknown words in medical texts seems to be a sublanguage feature beneficial to POS taggers, whereas the higher proportion of unknown words in newspaper language seems to be a prominent source of tagging errors.

Tagging with Off-the-shelf Technology For the first series of experiments, we chose two representatives of the currently prevailing datadriven tagging approaches, Brill’s rule-based tagger (Brill, 1995) and TNT, a statistical tagger (Brants, 2000).

The Brill tagger comes with an English default version also trained on general-purpose language corpora like the PENN TREEBANK (Marcus et al., 1993).

The best automatically learned POStagging result reported so far (97.24%) is Toutanova et al.(2003)’s feature-based cyclic dependency network tagger.
