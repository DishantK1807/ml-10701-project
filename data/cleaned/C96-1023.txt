(3) nan-hiki 'how many animals' (Int).
The resulting numeral-classifier noun phrase can modify another noun phrase, either linked by no 'of' 'XC-no-N', or 'floating' elsewhere in the sentence, typically directly after the noun phrase it modifies 'NXC'.
It can also occur on its own, with anaphoric or deictic reference.
Asahioka, Hirakawa, and Amano (1990) identify seven different patterns of use.
In order to concentrate on the translation of classifiers and number, we will restrict our discussion to noun phrases of the type 'XC-no-N' and not discuss the problems of resolving anaphoric reference and floating quantifiers.
Semantically, each classifier relates to a class of nouns (Kuno, 1973, 25), often fairly arbitrarily.
For example -hiki '(small) animal' is used to count small animals excluding rabbits, which are counted with -wa 'bird'.
There is a default classifier -tsu 'piece' which can be used to count almost anything.
2.2 English
'Classifiers' In English, numerals can directly modify countable nouns 'X N'.
In order to enumerate uncountable nouns, either the uncountable nouns have to be reclassified as countable nouns, or embedded in a partitive construction: two beers or two cans of beer 'X N' or 'X C of N' (Quirk et al., 1985, 249).
This partitive construction is similar to the Japanese quantifying construction 'XC-no-N'.
Quirk et al.(1985, 249-51) divide partitive nouns into three main categories QUALITY PARTITIVES, QUANTITY PARTITIVES, and MEASURE PARTITIVES.
QUANTITY PARTITIVES are further divided into three cases, the first where the embedded noun phrase is uncountable, the second where it is plural, and the third where it is singular and countable.
All the partitive nouns themselves are fully countable.
QUANTITY PARTITIVES where the embedded noun phrase is headed by an uncountable noun, the first case, are then divided into GENERAL PARTITIVES such as piece which serve only to quantify and TYPICAL PARTITIVES such as grain which are more descriptive.
2There are some examples of words that can be either a common noun or josftshi: for example gy5 'line' or hako 'box', which can follow a numeral or stand alone.
These nouns can be handled in two ways: (a) as a lexical class that combines the properties of common nouns and josftshi, or (b) as two separate lexical entities.
ALT-J/E follows option (b), such nouns are entered into the lexicon twice, once as a common noun and once as a jos~ishi.
3 A
Bilingual Analysis of classifiers As there is no direct fit between English and Japanese, it is necessary to categorize the Japanese and English classifiers and to define rules which will enable effective machine translation.
We divide classifiers into four major types: IIN\]T (Section 3.1), METRIC (Section 3.2), GROUP (Section 3.3) and SPECIES (Section 3.4).
The main criteria for the analysis are the restrictions placed, in English, on the countability and number of the embedded noun phrase in a partitive construction.
Whether a noun is a classifier, and if so which type, is marked in the lexicon for each Japanese/English noun pair.
We distinguish between five major different noun countability preferences, based on the analysis of Allan (1980), adapted for use in machine translation by Bond, Ogura, and lkehara (1994).
'Fully countable' nouns, such as knife, have both singular and plural forms, and cannot be used with determiners such as much.
'Uncountable' nouns, such as furniture, have no plural form, and can be used with much.
Between these two extremes are nouns such as cake, which can be used in both countable and uncountable noun phrases.
They have both singular and plural forms, and can also be used with much.
We divide such nouns into two groups: 'strongly countable', those that are more often used to refer to discrete entities, such as cake, and 'weakly countable', those that are more often used to refer to unbounded referents, such as beer.
The fifth major type of countability preference is 'pluralia tanta': nouns that only have a plural form, such as scissors.
3.1 Unit
classifiers UNIT classifiers are the prototypical classifiers.
A UNIT classifier will be realized in Japanese a~ a josshi.
However, there are three possible translations of a Japanese noun phrase of the form ~XCno-N', where C is a unit classifier: Individuate: Translate as 'X N', where the classifier C is not translated and the numeral directly modifies the countable English noun phrase: 1-hiki-no-inu 'l-piece of dog' --+ 1 dog.
Part: Translate as 'X C of N', where the classifier is translated by its translation equivalent (from the transfer dictionary) and N is uncountable (headed by a bare singular noun): 1-tsubu-no-kome 'l-grain of rice' -+ 1 'grain of rice.
Default: Translate as 'X C of N' where the classifier is replaced by a default that depends on the embedded noun and N is uncountable.
The default is normally piece, but this can be over-ridden by an explicit entry for N's default classifier in the lexicon: 126 Table 1: Unit Classifiers Noun Type General Typical Special Fully Countable Strongly Countable Weakly Countable Uncountable Pluralia Tanta (pair) 1 (log 1 cake 1 hair 1 piece of information 1 pair of scissors 1 dog 1 crumb of cake 1 strand of hair 1 grain of information 1 pair of scissors 1 slice of dog 1 slice of cake 1 slice of hair 1 slice of information 1-tsu-no-kagu 'l-piece of furniture' -~ 1 piece of furniture.
The three types of UNIT classifier are summarized in Table 1.
a Having established three possible translations of the 'XC-no-N' construction, we can proceed to divide UNH' classifiers into three types, depending on which of the above alternatives is most suitable.
The first, OI,'NEItAL classifiers, are those that have no special meaning of their own, but are used only to quantify the denotation of a noun.
Typical examples are tsu 'piece' and -ko 'piece'.
If N is fully, strongly or weakly countable, then the classifter is not translated (individuate).
If N is uncountable, then the classifier is translated as the default (default).
The second type of classifer, TYPICAL, consists of those classifiers which are descriptive in their own right, such as -teki 'drop'.
If N is fully countable, then the classifier will not be translated (individuate), otherwise the classifier is translated (part).
The final type of classifier, SPECIAl,, is rare: classifiers which force an uncountable interpretation of even countable nouns, for example -kire 'slice'.
N is always parted: 1-kireno-inu 'l-slice of dog' -+1 slice of dog.
The translation of classifiers is complicated by the fact that classifiers and their relationships to nouns are both arbitrary and language dependent.
Consider the Japanese classifier -mai 'sheet', which is used for counting fiat objects.
This has no direct English equivalent.
As a default, it is entered in the dictionary as a GI.'NEIAL classifier with the translation piece.
There are however several fiat, objects for which piece is inappropriate in English: food-stuffs (slice); paper, glass, cloth and leather (sheet); bacon (rasher); and financial contracts (contract).
The selection of an appropriate translation is not dependent on this analysis and can be left, to the normal machine translation process.
In ALT-J/E it is done by examining the semantic category of the embedaIf N's countability preference is pluralia tanta then N will never be individuatcd.
If N is parted or defaulted there axe two possibilities: either, if the dictionary entry for N has the default classifier pair then it will be used as the classifier or, if N has no default classifier, then a different translation is searched for in the dictionary and used instead.
If there is no nonpluralia tanta translation equivalent, then the translation will default to 'X C of N' as above, but with N headed by a bare plural noun.
ded noun.
Once an appropriate translation of the classifier has been found, knowledge of its type allows the system to decide the appropriate form of the final translation.
3.2 Metric
classifiers The next overall category is METRI() classifiers: A noull phrase of the form 'XC-no-N', where C is a METRI(; classifier will be translated as 'X C of N', where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully countable or pluralia tanta noun.
We fllrther subdivide METI/,IC classifiers depending on whether the resulting English noun phrase will have singular verb agreement (MEASURI'; classifiers), or plural verb agreement (CONTAINFat classifiers) as its default.
(4) 2-kg-no-kami-ha jgbun da '2 kg of paperTOP enough is' -~ 2 kg of paper is enough (5) 2-hako-no-kami-ha jubun da '2 box of paper-TOP enough is' -+ 2 boxes of paper" are enough In fact both (4) and (5) could be translated with singular or plural verb agreement.
The differentiation into MEASURE and CONTAINER provides a graceful default.
Examples are given in Table 2.
3.3 Group
classifiers GROUP classifiers combine with plural or uncountable noun phrases to make a countable noun phrase representing a group or set.
A noun phrase of the form 'XC-no-N', where C is a GROUP classifier will be translated as 'X C of N', where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully or strongly countable noun or a pluralia tanta.
Noun phrases of the form 'N-no-C', where C is a GROUP classifier (but not a jos~shi) will also be translated as 'C of N' where N will be plural if it is headed by a fully or strongly countable noun or a pluralia tanta.
This allows us to give a uniform treatment of noun phrases such as (6) and (7) during English generation, even though their Japanese structure is very different.
(6) 2-hako-no-pen '2 box of pen' 2 boxes of pens 'XC-no-N' (7) pen-no-hako 'box of pen' a box of pens 'N-no-C' 127 Table 2: Container and Measure Classifiers Noun Type Container Measure Fully Countable Strongly Countable Weakly Countable Uncountable Pluralia Tanta 1 box of clogs 1 box of cake l box of beer \] box of fllrniture I box of scissors l kg of ants 1 kg of cake 1 kg of beer 1 kg of flHniture I kg of scissors Table 3: Group and Species Classifiers Noun Type Group Species (Si) Species (Pl) lqflly Countable Strongly Countable Weakly Countable Uncountable Pluralia Tanta 1 set of dogs 1 set of cakes l set of beer 1 set of information 1 set of scissors 1.
kind of dog 1 kind of c}~ke 1 kind of beer 1.
kind of infbrmation 1 kind of scissors 2 kinds of clogs 2 kinds of cakes 2 kinds of beer 2 kinds of informal;ion 2 kinds of scissors Whether a notln is a GIll)UP classifier or not carl also be used to help determine the Irtlmber of ascriptive and appositive noun phrases.
For example, in ALT-J/E the countability and number of two at)positive noun phrases are made to match each other, unless one element is plural and the other is a GIOUP classifier.
For example, many insects, a whole swarm, ...
as opposed to many insects, bees I think, ...
(Bond, Ogura, and Kawaoka, 1995).
Examples of (;Rein, classifiers are given in Table 3.
3.4 Speeies
classifiers The last type of classifier is sP,,;cn,;s classifiers.
SI'ECII:S classifiers are partitives of quality and (;an occur with countable or uneo,lnt&ble llOlln phrases.
The embedded noun phr~se will agree in number with the head noun phrase if flflly or strongly countable: a kind of car, 2 kinds of cars; a kind of equipment, 2 kinds of equipment.
Exalnples of SPE(:mS classifier's are given in Table 3.
4 When
is a Classifier a Classifier?
In the analysis given above for Japanese noun phrases of the form 'XC-no-N', we have given no consideration 1;o the denotation of N, except for when choosing the at)propi'iate translation for C.
Thus we assume that 'XC~no-N' will be translated as 'X C of N' or just 'X N' if N is countable, as in (8) or (9).
(8) 1-pal-no mizu 'l-cup of water' --> 1 e?Lp of wateÂ°f (CONTAINFI/).
(9) i-tsu-no koppu 'l-piece of cup' --+ 1 C~tp (GENEI/AI,) However if N is a noun that denotes an attribute, such as PRICE or WEIGIIT, then the translation process becomes more complicated.
In the simplest case the noun phrase 'XC-no-N' should be.
translated as though the classifier' were a norreal noun, giving 'the N of X C', for examph'.
(10), (ll).
(10) 1-pal-no nedan 'l-cup of price' the price of lcv, p (11) 1-tsu-no ncda'n \[-ha lOen da\] 'l-piece of t)riee \[-'cop 1(\] yen is\]' -> the price of 1 (thing) fis 10 yen\] In other words, if N has the attribute AMOUNT then the noun phrase should normally be translated as though C were not a classifier.
The interpretation of C is, however, ambiguous.
C could be used as a elassiiier with the amount N in its scope (12), or C could have anaphoric reference (13).
ALT-J/E chooses the interpret~tion shown in example (13) as its defmflt.
(12) 1-sh'ili-no 'n, edan '1 kind of price' -~ 1 kind of price (13) 1-st\]u-no neda'n, '1 kind of price' -~ th.e price of .l kind/of something\] Further, when N is an attribute and C measures the same attribute, the interpretation is again different.
N)r exainple, if C measures N's attribute then the resulting noun phrase will be indefinite by default: a height of lore or a price of 10 yen.
Ilowever if the noun phrase is used ascriptively then it; should be converted (;ither to an adjective it is lore high or a prel)osit;ional pin'as(; it is lO yen in price.
Finally, if a noun phrase of this type is used to modify at\]other noun then it line(is to lm converted to an adjective a .lOre high building or a post modifying prepositional phrase a chocolate 10 yen in price.
The coml)inatio\]ls of nouns and classifiers mentioned above can all be translated by the machine translation systerit ALT-J/E using the analysis of classifiers presented in this paper ill combination with a semantic hierarchy of 2,800 categories common to all nouns, as described in Ikeharaetal.
