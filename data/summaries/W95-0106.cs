A number of empirical studies have found bracketing to be a useful type of corpus annotation (e.g., Pereira & Schabes 1992; Black et al.1993). Bracketed corpora have been available for some time in English, and to some extent other European languages, the best-known example being perhaps the Penn Treebank (Marcus 1991).

The translation lexicon was automatically learned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994).

Numerous experiments have shown parallel bilingual corpora to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al.1990; Gale & Church 1991 ; Gale et al.1992; Church 1993; Brown et al.1993; Dagan et al.1993; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994).

More sophisticated "parse-parse-match" procedures postpone ambiguity resolution until the matching stage (Kaji et al.1992; Matsumoto et al.1993; Grishman 1994).

It is interesting to constrast this method with the "parse-parse-match" approaches that have been reported recently for producing parallel bracketed corpora (Sadler & Vendelmans 1990; Kaji et al.1992; Matsumoto et al.1993; Cranias et al.1994; Gfishman 1994).
