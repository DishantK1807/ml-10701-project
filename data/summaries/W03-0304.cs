This contrasts with alternative alignment models such as those of Melamed (1998) and Wu (1997), which impose a “one-to-one” constraint on alignments.

Yet, the very nature of these alignments, as defined in the IBM modeling approach (Brown et al., 1993), lead to descriptions of the correspondences between sourcelanguage (SL) and target-language (TL) words of a translation that are often unsatisfactory, at least from a human perspective.

Since the pioneering work of the IBM machine translation team almost 15 years ago (Brown et al., 1990), statistical methods have proven to be valuable tools in approaching the automation of translation.

Word Alignment Brown et al.(1993) define a word alignment as a vector a = a1...am that connects each word of a sourcelanguage text S = s1...sm to a target-language word in its translation T = t1...tn, with the interpretation that word taj is the translation of word sj in S (aj = 0 is used to denote words of s that do not produce anything in T).

Word alignments (WA) play a central role in the statistical modeling process, and reliable WA techniques are crucial in acquiring the parameters of the models (Och and Ney, 2000).

Results were evaluated in terms of alignment precision (P), recall (R), F-measure and alignment error rate (AER) (Och and Ney, 2000).
P00-1056
Thenagain, the methods proposed here are not dependent on the underlying translation model, and similar WA methods could be based on more elaborate models, such as Models 3–5, or the HMM-based models proposed by Och et al.(1999) for example.
