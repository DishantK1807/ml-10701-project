There is a variety of methods that have been used in NE recognition, such as HMM, Maximum Entropy Models, Decision Trees, Boosting and Voted Perceptron (Collins, 2002), Syntactic Structure based approaches and WordNet-based approaches (Magnini et al., 2002; Arévalo, 2002).

Finally, there is another approach that identifies them after the tagging process, allowing the correction of some tagging errors (Leech et al., 1994).
