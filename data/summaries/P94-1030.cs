Also, semantic-head-driven generation (Shieber el al., 1989; van Noord, 1990) and head-corner parsing ivan Noord, 1991; Sikkel and op den Akker, 1993) can be seen as head-driven derivation, when the semantic-head/syntactic-head is moved to the leftmost position in the body of each rule and the argument representing the semantic-feature/headfeature is moved to the first position in the argument list of each formula.

As Pereira and Warren (1983) pointed out, there is a strong connection between parsing and deduction.
