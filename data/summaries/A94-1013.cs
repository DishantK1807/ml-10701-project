Although the systems of Wasson and Riley (1989) report slightly better error rates, our approach has the advantage of flexibility for application to new text genres, small training sets (and hence fast training times), (relatively) small storage requirements, and little manual effort.

Labeling of sentence boundaries is a necessary prerequisite for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988), (Cutting et al., 1991), and sentence alignment (Gale and Church, 1993), (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993).

Our implementation uses a slightlymodified version of the tokenizer from the PARTS part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988) for this task.

Riley (1989) determined that in the Tagged Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982) about 90% of pe78 riods occur at the end of sentences, 10% at the end of abbreviations, and about 0.5% as both abbreviations and sentence delimiters.

This is in contrast to Riley's method (Riley, 1989) which requires probabilities to be found for every lexical item (since it records the number of times every token has been seen before and after a period).
