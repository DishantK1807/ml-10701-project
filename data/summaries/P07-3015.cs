This finding is similar to the one mentioned by Silber and McCoy (2002).

Work Morris and Hirst (1991) provide the theoretical background behind lexical chains and demonstrate how they can be constructed manually from Roget’s thesaurus.

We have observed significant differences between reported functions on our data and achieved best results with the formula produced by Barzilay and Elhadad (1997): (2)      LCt LCt tfreq tfreq LC LCScore )() )( || 1()( Here, |LC| is the length of the chain and freq(t) is the frequency of the term t in the document.

We use ChineseWhispers (Biemann, 2006), a special case of MCL that performs the iteration in a more aggressive way, with an optimized linear complexity with the number of graph edges.

Lexical chains, introduced by Morris and Hirst (1991), have been studied extensively in the last decade, since large lexical databases are available in digital form.

If several chains are possible, Morris and Hirst (1991) choose the chain to whose overall score the term contributes the most.

Cohesive Strength Lexical cohesion is the property of lexical entities to “stick together” and function as a whole (Morris and Hirst, 1991).

The algorithm was reimplemented as soon as digital WordNet and Roget’s became available (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997) and its complexity was improved (Silber and McCoy, 2002; Galley and McKeown, 2003).
