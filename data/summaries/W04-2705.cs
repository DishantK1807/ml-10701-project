Using techniques similar to those described in (Meyers et al., 1998) in combination with our work on GLARF (Meyers et al., 2001a; Meyers et al., 2001b), we expect to build a hand-coded PROPBANKER a program designed to produce a PropBank/NomBank style analysis from Penn Treebank style input.

Finally, it is unlikely that there is an empty category that is an argument of a predicate noun unless the empty category is linked to some real NP.8 WRONG-POS We use procedures that are part of our systems for generating GLARF, a predicate argument framework discussed in (Meyers et al., 2001a; Meyers et al., 2001b), to detect incorrect parts of speech in the Penn Treebank.

While previous programs with similar goals (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) were statistics-based, this tool will be based completely on hand-coded rules and lexical resources.
