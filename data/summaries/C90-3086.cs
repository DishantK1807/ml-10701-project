This will partly be based on another important step in the process, namely the construction of constituents, in particular noun phrases and prepositional phrases (Church 1988, Kfillgren 1984c), and partly on a more general algorithm that for pairs or longer sequences of tags calculates the relative probability of alternative tag assignments.

Cf.
