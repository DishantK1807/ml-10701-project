Other researchers have developed models for detecting agreement and disagreement in meetings, using models that combine lexical features with prosodic features (e.g., pause, duration, F0, speech rate) (Hillard et al., 2003) and structural information (e.g., the previous and following speaker) (Galley et al., 2004).

Features Previous research has studied lexical differences (i.e., occurrence counts of N-grams) between various aspects of speech, such as topics (Hsueh and Moore, 2006), speaker gender (Boulis and Ostendorf, 2005), and story-telling conversation (Gordon and Ganesan, 2005).
