These rates of agreement cannot be sensibly compared to those found in studies of (nonembedded) segmentation agreement (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Hearst, 1994) because our assessment of RDA reliability differs from this work in several key ways.

This approach synthesizes ideas which were previously thought incompatible from two theories of discourse structure, the theory proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) proposed by Mann and Thompson (1988).

While some specific issues concerning cue usage have been resolved (e.g., the disambiguation of discourse and sentential cues (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)), our concern is to identify general strategies of cue selection and placement that can be implemented for automatic text generation.

To investigate their distribution, we began with the proposal of Elhadad and McKeown (1990).
C90-3018
Work by Moore and Pollack (1992) modified the RST assumption that these palrwise relations are unique, demonstrating that intentional and informational relations occur simultaneously.
J92-4007
The technique of representing an analysis in a database and then using database queries to test hypotheses is similar to work using RST analyses to investigate the form of purpose clauses (Vander Linden et al., 1992).
P92-1050
Moser and Moore (1993) point out the correspondence between the relation of dominance among intentions in Grosz and Sidner and the nucleussatellite distinction in RST.
W93-0225
RDA is a synthesis of ideas from two theories of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Mann and Thompson, 1988).

Previous research (Hobbs, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990) suggests that these factors include structural features of the discourse, intentional and informational relations in that structure, givenness of information in the discourse, and syntactic form of discourse constituents.
C90-3018 J86-3001
Much of the work on cue usage, e.g., (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990; Millis etal., 1993; Schiffrin, 1987; Zukerman, 1990) has focused on pairs of text spans, and this has led to the development of heuristics for cue selection that take into account the relation between the spans and other local features of the two relata (e.g., relative ordering of core and contributor, complexity of each span).
C90-3018
Elhadad and McKeown (1990) claim that the two cues differ with respect to what Ducrot (1983) calls "polyphony", i.e., whether the subordinate relatum is attributed to the hearer or to the speaker.
C90-3018
Discourse cues play a crucial role in many discourse processing tasks, including plan recognition (Litman and Allen, 1987), anaphora resolution (Gross and Sidner, 1986), and generation of coherent multisentential texts (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990; Roesner and Stede, 1992; Scott and de Souza, 1990; Zukerman, 1990).
