Feature-unification notation, as in D-PATR, has been proposed and even implemented in a number of morphology systems for constraining morphotactic dependencies (Karttunen, 1984; Karttunen, 1986; Bear, 1986; Kataja and Kbskenniemi, 1988; Beesley et al., 1989; Trost, 1990).

The theory and practical use of finite-state variation rules are well documented (Koskenniemi, 1983; Karttunen, 1983; Antworth, 1990; Karttunen and Beesley, 1992; Sproat, 1992; Karttunen, 1994) and will not be dealt with here.

Xerox applications have traditionally intersected all the role transducers into a single transducer; and because the lexicon also compiles into a transducer, it can be composed together with the rules into a single data object called a LEXlCAL TRANSDUCER (Karttunen et al., 1992; Karttunen, 1994).

Morphotactics Arabic and other Semitic languages are most notable for having a partially non~concatenative morphotactics wherein STEMS are formed by the interdigitation of ROOTS and PATTERNS, a process naturally formalized in finite-state morphology as intersection (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley, 1996; Beesley, 1998).
