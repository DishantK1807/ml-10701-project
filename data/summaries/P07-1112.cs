Qualia structures have been originally introduced by (Pustejovsky, 1991) and are used for a variety of purposes in natural language processing (NLP), such as for the analysis of compounds (Johnston and Busa, 1996) as well as co-composition and coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991), but also for bridging reference resolution (Bos et al., 1995).

posteriori Evaluation In order to check whether the automatically learned qualia structures are reasonable from an intuitive point of view, we also performed an a posteriori 893 evaluation in the lines of (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2005).

Acquiring Qualia Structures Our approach to learning qualia structures from the Web is on the one hand based on the assumption that instances of a certain semantic relation can be acquired by matching certain lexico-syntactic patterns more or less reliably conveying the relation of interest in line with the seminal work of Hearst (Hearst, 1992), who defined patterns conveying hyponym/hypernym relations.

Structures In the Generative Lexicon (GL) framework (Pustejovsky, 1991), Pustejovsky reused Aristotleâ€™s basic factors (i.e.

Work Instead of matching Hearst-style patterns (Hearst, 1992) in a large text collection, some researchers have recently turned to the Web to match these patterns such as in (Markert et al., 2003) or (Etzioni et al., 2005).

One major bottleneck however is that currently qualia structures need to be created by hand, which is probably also the reason why there are almost no practical NLP systems using qualia structures, but a lot of systems relying on publicly available resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) or FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) as source of lexical/world knowledge.

These approaches rely on a combination of the usage of lexico-syntactic pattens conveying a certain relation of interest as described in (Hearst, 1992) with the idea of using the web as a big corpus (cf.

The evaluation 888 presented here is thus much more extensive than our previous one (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2005), in which only 7 words were used.

Poesio and Almuhareb (Poesio and Almuhareb, 2005) present a machine learning based approach to classifying attributes into the six categories: quality, part, related-object, activity, related-agent and non-attribute.

Our approach directly builds on our previous work (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2005) an adheres to the principled idea of learning ranked qualia structures.
