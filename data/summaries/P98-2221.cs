The same data were used to train Simplified Model 2 (Wang and Waibel, 1997) and IBM Model 3 for performance comparison.

Most (if not all) statistical machine translation systems employ a word-based alignment model (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel, Ney, and Tillman, 1996; Wang and Waibel, 1997), which treats words in a sentence as independent entities and ignores the structural relationship among them.

The mutual information clustering algorithm(Brown et al., 1992) were used for this.

The subset was the neighboring alignments (Brown et al., 1993) of the Viterbi alignments discovered by Model 1 and Model 2.

An experiment reveals how often this kind of "skewed" alignment happens in our English/German scheduling conversation parallel corpus (Wang and Waibel, 1997).
