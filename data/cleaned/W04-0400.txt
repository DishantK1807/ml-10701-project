2:21	MWEs are increasingly being singled out as a problem for NLP, particularly for the many applications which require some degree of semantic interpretation and require tasks such as parsing and word sense disambiguation.
3:21	In the call for papers we solicited papers that especially laid emphasis on integrating analysis, acquisition and treatment of various kinds of multiword expressions in natural language NLP.
4:21	For example, research that combines a linguistic analysis with a method of automatically acquiring the classes described, work that combines the computational treatment of a class of MWEs with a solid linguistic analysis and research that extracts MWEs and either classifies them or uses them in some task.
5:21	We received 23 submissions (3 from Asia, 11 from Europe and 9 from the Americas), and accepted 11 of them for presentation, with two reserves.
6:21	Each submission was reviewed by three members of the program committee, who not only judged each submission but also gave detailed comments to the authors.
7:21	The overall quality of submissions was high, making the final selection very difficult.
8:21	The papers in these proceedings are those which were finally selected for presentation.
9:21	Many of the papers deal with MWEs in general, rather than aiming at specific subtypes, with examples from a wide range of languages (Basque, English, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Turkish).
10:21	There were also a variety of formalisms considered (dependency grammar, finite state machines, lexical conceptual structure, HPSG,.
11:21	) as well as more decriptive papers.
12:21	The main applications targeted were machine translation and information retrieval.
13:21	We would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers.
14:21	We also thank all the members of the program committee for their time and effort in ensuring that the papers were fairly assessed.
15:21	The workshop was supported by  Research Collaboration between NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and CSLI, Stanford University  UK EPSRC project GR/N36493 Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP) Finally, we wish to thank the organizers of the main conference, in particular the conference workshop co-chairs, Srinivas Bangalore, Christopher Manning, Helen Meng and Marcello Federico.
