E indicated understanding and implicated acceptance of this assertion in 7 (Walker 1992), and E confirmed the truth of the content of 22c for H in 5.

The cache model maintains the distinction between intentional structure and attentional state first proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).

Of all theories based on hierarchical recency, only Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure provides an operationalization of hierarchical recency in terms of their stack model of attentional state (Sidner 1979; Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986).
