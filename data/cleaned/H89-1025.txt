Acoustic-Phonetics Based Speech Recognition Victor W.
Zue Spoken Language Systems Group Laboratory for Computer Science Massachusetts Institute of Technology OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to develop a robust and high-performance speech recognitiotl system using a segment-based approach to phonetic recognition.
The recognition system will eventually be integrated with natural language processing to achieve spoken lallguagc understanding.
SUMMA R Y OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Developed a phonetic recognition front-end and achieved 77% and 71% classiilcatiou accuracy under speaker-dependent and -independent conditions, respectively, using a set of 38 context-independent models.
Collaborated with researchers at SRI in the development of the MISTRI system, making explicit use of acoustic-phonetic and phonological knowledge.
Developed the SUMMIT speech recognition system that incorporates auditory modelling and explicit segmentation, and achieved a speaker-independent accuracy of 87% on the DARPA 1000-word Resource Management task using 75 phoneme models.
Developed probabilistic natural language system, TINA, and achieved a test-set coverage of 78% with perplexity of 42 for the Resource Management task.
â€¢ Transcribed all 6300 sentences for the TIMIT database.
Developed a set of research tools for the DARPA speech research community in ot'dcr to facilitate data collection, parameter computation, statistical analysis, and speech synthesis.
PLANS: Improve the speech recognition performance by incorporating context-dependency ia phoneme modelling.
Integrate TINA into SUMMIT in order to develop spoken language understanding capabilities.
Develop a back-end on the task of a Knowledgeable Navigator, and integrate it with the spoken language system.
Begin hardware development, such that the system will soon be able to execute in near real-time. 167
