The most notable features of the approach taken here are as follows: (a) the use of a sophisticated underlying ontology, to permit the representation of non-singular entities; (b) the use of two levels of semantic representation, in conjunction with a model of the discourse, to produce appropriate anaphoric referring expressions; (c) the use of a notion of discrimiaatory power, to determine what properties should be used in describing an entity; and (d) the use of a PATR-1ike unification grammar (see, for example, Karttunen (1986); Shieber (1986)) to produce surface linguistic strings from input semantic structures.

Following Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein (1983), references to other entities present in cache memory may also be pronominalized, provided the centre is pronominalized.
