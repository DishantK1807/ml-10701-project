3:1038	Box 155712 Beirut, Lebanon Temporarily: Rose Cottage, Hindon, Wiltshire, England This paper describes a program which translates Engllsh into French, It is difficult to delineate the subset which a program can deal with, so sample sentences are given.
4:1038	The analyser is multiple path, single pass, akln to Woods' A.T.N. grammar.
5:1038	The syntax is dealt wi$h by matching.
6:1038	J with $emplates; the semantics by the application of semantic re$trictions to syntactically associated pairs of word meanings.
7:1038	To lirn~t the number of paths, all available guns, syntactic and semantic, are brought to bear at every stage.
8:1038	The output is a list of disambiguated word meanings, formed into a tree structure but with semantic rather than syntactio relationships betweep them.
9:1038	The French generation first makes appropriate tense changes, then finds the French word(s) and redistributes them if necessary.
10:1038	This may generate a French structure radically different from the English, Then the words are sequenced and put into the correct form.
11:1038	The program consists of about 8,500 Fortran irlstructions and the processing averages about 15 seconds per word on a 36.0-40.
12:1038	TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction  '-t Results  6  Sample Sentences ; 15  Description of Method 19 Flowchart  2i  Reduction of the Passage to Base Form 22  Generation of the French Translation 46  Conclusion 48 My *banks are due to the Managers of IBM Near East and+IBM Lebanon and many members of the staff of IBM Lebanon, who have helped and encouraged me in every way.
13:1038	I am also indebted to Yorick Wilks, Margaret King and Walther Bischoff of the Fondazione dalle Molle, who have been very he3pful with their a advice and ideas.
14:1038	INTfRODUCTION There are, I hope three reasons why CLAM will be of interest to computational linguists.
15:1038	(1) Ir; 1s a working model.
16:1038	This is not a "paperf1 containing ltideas".
17:1038	Lt is a description of a model which works, To be more specific, it is a description of a large program, written in FORTRAN, which runs on a 960-40.
18:1038	It accepts as input English $ext, carrieg out a syntactic and semantic analysis of!
19:1038	it, stores the result, and translates it into good French.
20:1038	(2) The subset of English which it is capable of analysing is, by present standards, extremely large, The vocabulary is about 1300 words, many of which have a variety of meanings.
21:1038	More important that the size of the vocabulary is, of course, the range of syntactic structure's and, perhaps most significantly, the degree of complexity of senkences which can be dealt with, Increasing the length and complexltg of sentences does not bring likelihood of combinat orial explosion.
22:1038	The amount of working store and computing time required to analyse a sentence is of the order of the number of words in a sentence, although of course it varies according to the number of meanings of the words and the types of syntactic structure involved.
23:1038	(3) The program is continuously extensible.
24:1038	This extensi'bility applies first t~ the subset of language which can be analysed, secondly to the target languages into which translations can be generated, and thirdly bo the uses to which the analysis of the rext can be put.
25:1038	Tn other words, I believe that the program embodies 3 sound method of syntactic and semantic analysis such as must be the basis of a computer lawage model.
26:1038	Extension of the subset of language which can be malysed is a matter of addition and refinement.
27:1038	It can be stated with confidence that such extension can be achieved because nothing fundamentally different from what has already been achieved is involved.
28:1038	New syntactic structures, well formed or otherwise, can be incorporated, by addition partly to the files and partly to Ohe program.
29:1038	Continual refinements can be made to the method of finding pronoun antecedents.
30:1038	This problem, which seems to be generally accepted as the most difficult single problem in analysis, will never be solved by one simple algorithm, and the fact that a particular program at any given stage of its development gives the wrong answer in a particular case, so far from invalidating the prograp, rather points the way to further refinements (cf.
31:1038	Wilks, June 1975).
32:1038	What is important is that the program should provide the tools which enable the refinement to be made, and CLAM does this.
33:1038	Extension of the target languages involves applying to other languages the same method which is used to generate French.
34:1038	This can be done, and indeed part of the actual program used for French would be generally applic3ble.
35:1038	It will be interesting to attack a language outside the Indo-European group, and Arabic is the first one I have in mind, although how soon this can be done is a question of time and priocities, The obvious use to which the analysis can be put other than 6 translation is a questionLanswer system, and work on this is at present in hanb.
36:1038	A question-answer system must be based on an effective malyser, and it is beljeved that CLAM can provide this.
37:1038	However, I do not maintain that the analyser Sb~uld be independent of9the memory and inferencihg part of the sy$te~n. Obviously it should not be independent of the memory, since an analyser nu st create and use its own memory, and although it would be theoretically possible for the analyser to have one type of memory and the latter part of the program to have another, this would be a ludicrous arrangement.
38:1038	The same argument applies tp inferencing, which again has to be performed.
39:1038	by an analyser.
40:1038	Therefore it seems that a question-answer system should be more integrated than rnany A.1.
41:1038	reseqrcher,~ appear to allow.
42:1038	On this score, I support the view of Wilks vis-a-vis Charniak.
43:1038	To create a que~tion~answer system, and, indeed, to improve the translation program, -t;he memory and the semantics of the present program have to be developed.
44:1038	I use the word "developed" advisedly because I believe that the ekisting memory and semantics form a sound basis upon which a more comprehensive system can be built.
45:1038	RESULTS Assessment of the Subset of Language which the Model can Analyse It is normal practice when describing a language model to leave d;iscussion of the achievedents of the model until the end.
46:1038	First comes the description of how the model doeslor ~ould operate, then, if it is actually in operation, an account of what &t can do.
47:1038	En this description I am reversing 3he procedure, becauge I would not like to think of a reader ploughing through details of how something is done ii he subsequently comes to the conclusion that what was done was not worth doing anyway, Let him first sge what can be done, and then decide whether it is w~rth the trouble of reading on to discover how it is done.
48:1038	Having said this, I am immediately conYronted by the problem adrunbrated by Woods of how a reader can assess the range and scope of a particular model, and by implication, of how the programmer can honestly present it.
49:1038	There are two standard methods of prepentation.
50:1038	One is by rather sweeping general statements such as "the program can cope with noun clauses.
51:1038	adjectival clauses, conjunction, questions" etc. , according to what claims are being made, Such generalisations are inevitably suspect and rightly so, since no reader will believe that he could not find, for example, adjectival clauses which the program could not cope with.
52:1038	The alternative method of presentation is to give sample sentences which the program has coped with, and hope that the reader will make for himself the type of generalisation which the programmer has scrupulously avoided.
53:1038	If the first method is adopted, the programmer may justifiably be branded as a charlatan.
54:1038	If the second, he runs the risk of having his sent-encesdismissed as "a few examples", The problem is real, and the solution far from obvious: how to define a subset of language.
55:1038	Supposing that we were conCerned only with single sentences and not longer texts; and supposing that it were possible, which evidently it is not, $0 list all the sentences of the subset: the11 how can we find a definition which,wou&d include all the sentences which we have listed and exc1ud.e any which we have not listed?
56:1038	Two things are clear.
57:1038	The definition would be very long, ahd it would contain an agglomeration of embedded provisos, For example + the section on relative Clauses might include something like this: Relative clauses are admissible, provided that 1 . they do not contain more Zhan seven words ; 2.
58:1038	they do not contain a passive verb unless (a) it is a verb of Icookmgt ol(b) the clause is a vsubject' clause; 3.
59:1038	there is no word between the noun and the relative clause unless it is part of a supervening relative clause; 4, the noun 1s not part of a subsidiary clause unless the subsidiary clause is itself a relatlve clause provided that (a) the noun is not the object of the clause and (b) the noun is not a 'time1 noun.
60:1038	All of the above provisos are of a type which could well be applicable at any particular stage in the development of a program, although some may be more likely than others.
61:1038	The programmerls difficulty is that until he has tried an appropriate type of sentence, he probably will not realise the existence of a 9 particular limitation.
62:1038	The first indication of it is that the sentence doesn't work, and he then has to rack his brain to findrout why not, and alter the program to eliminate the limitation, thereby enlarging the subset in that particular direction (hoping that he is not at the same time being so stupid as to reduce it' in another).
63:1038	Therefore if a programmer asserts that his program can deal with e.g,, relative clauses of all types, he is probably not being dishonest but m~rely ignorant about the limitations of his om program.
64:1038	Whether such lirnitat50ns should rightly be described as bugs, which Wood,s implies, is dubious, because that is tantamount .Q;o execting a program which can deal with some relative clauses to be able to deal with all relative clauses.
65:1038	and asserting that insofar as it cannot, something has gone wrong.
66:1038	Rather might one think of a program in terms of a pool of water spreading slowly over an area and gradually covering more and mare of that area.
67:1038	The fact that the water covered a particular part of the area wottld carry no implication of covering any other part, although ther'e would be a reasonable expectation of its spreading to a contiguous area next.
68:1038	This analogy, though valuable in helping to destroy a misconception, is evidently incomplete in two respec%-s.
69:1038	It is two-dimensional, whereas.language is #multi-dimensional; and the program would advance not continuously, like a pool of water, but by fits and starts, in discrete steps.
70:1038	Each of these points is worth further examination, Lip service has long been paid to the multi-dimensional nature of language, and yet the importance of this aspect in I0 attempting to analyse language has rather slowly comb to be recognised, How many features are there whlch have to be talcen into account, and what are they?
71:1038	How many possible relationships can exist between t~hiclz of tlle~n? And, a rluostion raised with particular force by coniputer analysers, what combinations of features are relevant?
72:1038	As a simple esaztiple, consider two features, both as it happens syntactic although the argument applies to semantic as ~811 as syntac-tie features: ralative clauses, and the passive voice.
73:1038	If a program can analyse each of the features separately, does it follow that it can analyse them in combination?
74:1038	Suppose, for example, it can arlalyse both of these sentences: 1.
75:1038	The man who came to dinner stole the silver.
76:1038	2.
77:1038	The man was hit by a bus.
78:1038	Does it follow that it can analyse this?
79:1038	The man who was hit by a bus stole the silver.
80:1038	Alas, it does not.
81:1038	It may iin fact be able to, but there is no logical rule from which it can be deduced that it must be able to.
82:1038	Is the absence of' suc a rule merely a computational quirk, or does it corres~ond to some linguLstic truth?
83:1038	In this case, but not necessarily in all such cases, I would say that it does so c~rrespond.
84:1038	We may asK ourselves if it is possible to imagine a language in which relative clauses e&ist, and the passive voice exists, but in which the verb In a relative clause cannot be in the passive.
85:1038	Of course it is, and *here may for all I Know be such languages.
86:1038	It +is this absence of a logical rule of combination which makes the task of defining the bounds of a subset of language so appallingly difficult, especially when it is remembered that it is not merely combinations of two features, 9s in the above example, but combinations of many features which have to be taken into account.
87:1038	Multi-dimensiona3l.y is such a cardinal characteristic of language that analysgrs dealing with tiny subsets from which this characteristic lias been removed should probably be treated with reserve.
88:1038	They may give valuable insights, but they may also be nxisleading, I do not of course refer to the memory oP inferencing part of microworld models, which is usually their raison dletre, but: only to their interfade with natural language input, The designers of such models are inclined to regard the input analysis as little more than a tedious chore, and would be unllikely to take exception to what I am saying since they themselves normally make no great claims fox this part of their models.
89:1038	But ethers, commenting on the moaels, sometimes mae exaggerated claims on behalf of the analysers, and these claims should be guarded against.
90:1038	Perhaps Che relationship between a language and a t$ny subset of it with a stric*t;ly limited number of features should be thought of as akin to the relationship between a wall and a stone.
91:1038	They are recognisably composed of the same substance, but one has essential characteristics which the other totally.lacks.
92:1038	Before leaving the shbjsa~t of multi-dimensionality, 1 would like to touch briefly on the possibility, at some time in the future, of devising a standard method of determinine the extent of a subset of a language.
93:1038	The following idea could be considered, probably to be rejected, but at least it could provide a startingpoint for discussion, A fiumber of features, say n, could be decided upon, the number varying according to the degree of subtlety of delineation required.
94:1038	An n-dimensional array with n+l columns in each dimension (fbr the n featul~es + 1 blank) would then contain an element corresponding to ewbry combination of these features.
95:1038	Some of these qlements would be irr~levant, since they would represent impossible combinations.
96:1038	The valid elements could be filled or not, according to whether tHe subset contained the combination of features which they represented.
97:1038	For a programmer building up the subset which his program was capable of analysing, such an array could provide both a measure of achievement and a guide to what was missing.
98:1038	To return now to the analogy of the puddle, the second respect in which it was incomplete Ftas that a program, as it develops, bes not advmce continuously, like water spreading, but by fits and starts, in discrebe steps.
99:1038	Suppose, for example, that a programmer is testing a particurar feature like, say, relative clauses, as that is the feature we have previously discussed.
100:1038	Sentences containing relative clauses Uave been entered repeatedly, and each time they have been rejected or analysed inco~rectly.
101:1038	Then at last comes the moment of triumph and relief when, for the first time, the program takes in such a sentence and analyses it c'orrectly.
102:1038	At that moment, the program has not merely edged forward, but it has leapt.
103:1038	In terms of the array postulated in the last paragraph, not just one but several elements will in all probability have been covered in one step.
104:1038	It will not be known for certain which elements, until more testing has been done and more sentences tried.
105:1038	BU~ just as it would be ludicrous to suppose that because a program can analyse one relative clause it can analyse all, i.t would be equally ludicrous not to edpect a program which can analyse one rela-t;ive clause to be able to analyse at least some others.
106:1038	There is a section of program common to all relative clauses, which has to work before any can be ana~ysed correctly, and once that section is wox3cing jn combination with ~anp feaeures, the liklghood is that it will work in combination with at least some others.
107:1038	What follows from this?
108:1038	Firstly, that no reliable method at present exists for the designer of a language model 0 delineate the subset of language which his model can analyse,.
109:1038	Secondly, that desi"rab1e as it undoubtedly is, for the benefit of both the designers of models and those who seek to assess their scope, to devise such a method, it is going to be extremely difficult to do so.
110:1038	Thirdly, that in this unfortunate state of affairs a designer can but fall back on the established system of presenting a list of sentepces which his program has analysed correctly, and leave it to the reader to make hisown assessment of where the bounds of the subset analysable by the model lie.
111:1038	To discuss the sentences as simply a few examples would be unintelligent; equally unintelligent to see in them visions of universal.ity.
112:1038	Where, between these two extremes, the reader's judgement falls should depend upon the variety of the sent-ences, and upon their complexity.
113:1038	If the program can" deal with complexity in any area, it should be some indication of its power, perhaps yet unrealised, to do so in other areas, It would be a sign of its versatility, of its ability to disentangle elaborate pat* ern3 and resolite them into their elementary cornporls~lt s . After -khis rathw prolix introduction, 1 eorrle eventually to my own "Pist of ssntenc\@st1 ellat have been successftrlly annlyssd by CLAM.
114:1038	They fall into two categqries: those which have been tranglat~d into French, in which case the Frexic$l translation is given; and those which have sirtiply been analysed sylt actically, and semantically and reduced to a base form.
115:1038	Tliis 1s because durfng the last year 1 have not been working on the French generator but concentrating on certain asyects of the ana1yser;and so in order to save computer time, the French seneration has been omitted, Thus the sentenceswithout translation have been processed last.
116:1038	The question arises of what exactly is meant by "analwed syntactically and semantically" and "reduced to base form".
117:1038	Ths will be more fully explained in the subsequent test.
118:1038	At this, stage a"t is sufficient to say that a syntactic tree has been formed and serntxntic ambiguities resolved, and that semantic relations betr3een words in the tree have been determined (e.g. a syntactic subject of a passive verb is recorded as the semantic object).
119:1038	Singre word meanings are retained as basic units.
120:1038	There is no Schankian-type resolutiun lnto semantic primitives, except insofar as this is implicit in the classification system.
121:1038	This is the base form from which the French has been generated.
122:1038	It has no% so far proved necessary to go any baser.
123:1038	Development, as will be explained later, is envisaged along the lines of extending the network rather than breaking down the units.
124:1038	SAMPLE SENTENCES The follow3.ng are samples of sentences which have been correctly anaW8ed by the program.
125:1038	They are given, together with the French translations where these have been produced by the program, and with comments on points .of interest in the s8rTtences.

222:1038	DESCRIPTION OF METHOD Before going into some detail about the method used to achieve these results, I would like to say something about the danger of over-sophistication on the part of the reader, There is a natural tendency for researchers, on reading something new, to look for points of broad similarity with something, anything, %*hat they have read, before; and, having found it, to sit back with relief and feel absolved -from reading any further.

225:1038	When one passes from the realm of pure ideas to the-,hard practicalities of writing a computer program, a subtle change of emphasis occurs, The ideas, all embracing they may have seemed at their inception, recede into the background, and what becoma vital are the details, the tiny mosaic pieces which determine whether the program succeeds.
226:1038	To Judge a computer program by a crude classification ofi its metl~od is like judging a picture by saying that it is impressionistic.
227:1038	Certainly it ;is impressionistic, but is it any good?
228:1038	In case the reader is not convinced by t'his argument, let me say immediately that this is a multiple-path, singlepass, left-to-right, word-by-word analyser, akin to the multiple-path analyser of Oettinger and the augmented transitiofi~networ grammar of Woods.
229:1038	In order to tackle the semantics, and indeed also the syntactics, the meanings of words have been coded according to a hierarchical taxonomy That they are coded has been largely dictated by the demands of FORTRAN, in which the program is written, although some system more overtly !Like a networ could have been used.
230:1038	That the classification should be essentially hierarchical, with certain necesgary refinements, has always seemed obvious.
231:1038	Some details of how the program works now follow.
232:1038	I will start wikh the syntactic and semantic analysis, and come later to the generation of the French.
233:1038	find codes FLOWCHART syntactic and semantic analysis French REDUCTION OF THE PASSAGE TO BASE FORM A glance at the flowchart on the preceding page shows that there are two main parts of the program: first, the single subroutine READ, and second, a,group of subroutines comprising th~ syntactic and semantic analysis.
234:1038	READ This subroutine first transgers the base form of the ppeceding sentence to semi-permanent store.
235:1038	Then ~t reads the next sentence.
236:1038	It looks up each word in the dictionary file (VOCAB).
237:1038	If it cannot find it at first, it tests for-certain endings such as -s, -ed, and -ing, subtracts them and tries again.
238:1038	When it finds the word it stores all the possible codes which are associated with the word in VOCAB.
239:1038	It also assembles compounds such as 'in front of1, 'in order tot, or infinitives, for which there is no single code, Proverbs or cliches can be 'similarly treated.
240:1038	Coding Every possible rheaning of a word has a code number containing a maximum of twelve digits.
241:1038	These code numbergs are stored with the word in VOCAB and extracted in READ, The coding is based on a straightforward classification.
242:1038	2 1 1 1 For example the code of 'bull' is 6 2 I noun concrete creature male Such classification is essential to reduce animal farm cow the number of syntactic and semantic patterns which have to be B stored.
243:1038	It may be noted in passing that the system of coding contains the elements of both syntactic and semantic classification.
244:1038	The distinction between the two is at tlmes tenuous.
245:1038	Further explanation of the coding is given in the appendix.
246:1038	Syntactic and Semantic Analysis This is Ohe most complicated part of the model, and comprises several subroutines.
247:1038	For ease of explanation, many of them are here treated as parts of the larger routines CON, UPDT and OACR.
248:1038	As the flowchart shows, these three routines operate in turn on each word of' a sentence, and when the end of the sentence is reached, a fourth routine, ENDR, is called on to operate on the complete sentence . Before giving some account of the functions of these routines, it is necessary to explain the term EP, and to describe JEP and JSP, the two principle files referred to in this part of the program.
249:1038	EP (~n~lish pattern).
250:1038	Take the sentence, The man with a long nose always snores.
251:1038	The program breaks this down into four EPs, as follows: EP 1 EP 2 EP 3 EP 4 lead word snores man with nose subsidiary word man the nose a subsidiary word always with long An EP contains one lead word plus a number of subsidiaries, and is classified according to the nature of the lead word.
252:1038	Thus W 1 is a verb EP, EPs 2 and 4 are noun EPs, and EP 3 is a preposition EP.
253:1038	Man, the lead word of EP2, is a subsidiary of EP 1, so EP 2 is dependent on EP 1.
254:1038	Similarly, EP 3 is depenaent on EP 2, and EP 4 on EP 3.
255:1038	Splitting a sentence into EPs is simply forming it into a tree structure.
256:1038	snores /\ a long JEP This file contains the templates for all the different -t;ypes of EP.
257:1038	FOT example the template for a noun EP contains various types of adjective in appropriate sequence, These are followed by the lead novn.
258:1038	This is then followed by adjectives, appositional nouns, prepositions and relative pronouns.
259:1038	In an EP certain positions, such as the lead, are necessary, while others are optional.
260:1038	In a noun EP, the only necessary position is the lead noun.
261:1038	In a preposition EP, besides the lead preposition, the following noun is necessary.
262:1038	By far the most compliCated EP is of course the verb EP.
263:1038	In this EP, later positions can be either closed, or opened, or made necessary, by a particular class of word in a particular posi'tibn.
264:1038	For example, a pre-verb subject closes a fiost-verb subject.
265:1038	A question verb makes a post-verb subject necessary.
266:1038	One class of verbs opens a subsequent gerund position and closes a subsequent infinitive, Once an EP has bean started, the program tests to see if the next word could occupy an open posi$ion on the template as far as the next necessary position (cf.
267:1038	below).
268:1038	Note that these templates are of syntacfic patterns and bear no relation to Wilkst semantic templates.
269:1038	JSP This file contains all the semantic patterns (SPS).
270:1038	An example of an SP is 12119 21 21102.
271:1038	This means that all verbs whose codes start with the digits 12119 can have as subjects any nouns whose codes start with the digits 21102.
272:1038	More specifically, it means that human beings read1 or write.
273:1038	In this case the verb would be the lead of a verb EP, and the noun would be a subsidiary word in the subject position of the EP.
274:1038	The middle group of digits in the SP specify the relationship between subsidiary and the lead.
275:1038	In this case, 21 specifies subject of verb.
276:1038	Similarly, SPs govern the relationships between the lead verb and all other subsidiary positions in the verb EP, and between lea9 and subsidiaries of all the other EPs.
277:1038	For example, 621 2 226 means that time prepositions, whose code words start with the digits 621, can have as objects any time nouns whose codes start with digits 226.
278:1038	When deciding whether a word is acceptable in a subsidiary position of a particular EP, a,semantic match is made between that word and the lead word: JSP is searched to see if an SP exists permitting that word to be associated in that subsidiary position with that lead wofd (cf.
279:1038	below).
280:1038	Processing the Sentence The sentence is processed in a single pass word by word from left to right.
281:1038	After each word, a number of possible continuation paths are open.
282:1038	The next word is tested along each of these paths, and if no place can be found for it that path is closed.
283:1038	If no placescan be found, the path is reproduced n-1 times and the word added to each path Each path may then have one or more continuation^, Let us now return to th8 sentence, The man with a long nose always snores.
284:1038	The program goe's through the sentqnce word by word, starting from the first.
285:1038	At the beginning, a verb EP is llapentl, Thak is to say, the program loodcs for all posltiqns which could start a verb EP which the first word satisfies.
286:1038	In this case, 'the1 cannot be part of a verb El?, but only of a noun EP, so the program will skart a noun LP which is dependent on the subject position of a verb EP.
287:1038	The next word 11iust continua the noun EP.
288:1038	Therefore on going to the next word, only EP2 is ""open".
289:1038	,'Many is then read, and EP2 and also EP1 <are updated.
290:1038	At this point there are two alternative continuations.
291:1038	Either EP2 could be continued, as in fact happens, or EP2 could be closed" and EP1 continued.
292:1038	Therefore on going to the next word, EPs 1 aqd 2 are both open.
293:1038	So the process is continued through the sentence.
294:1038	As shown in the flowchart, there are three subroutines which operate on each word--CON, UPIX and OACR.
295:1038	CON takes each EP which is open, and tests each sense of the word against each possible continuation of the EP.
296:1038	If the word could satisfy a position, it then looks to see whether a form match is necessary.
297:1038	In general, in English, a form test is only necessary between subject and verb, when the number and person must agree.
298:1038	If this hurdle is overcome, CON then proceeds to a semantic match.
299:1038	In general, the lead word of an EP must be matched semantically with every subsidiary word of that EP.
300:1038	For example a sub"jct must' be matched with a verb.
301:1038	So i% check is performed, to see if that particular noun taken in that particular sense could be the subject of that particular verb taken in that particular sense.
302:1038	Having found all the possible solutions, CON then gives way to UPDT.
303:1038	UPDT updates each EP according to the solutions found in CII_ CON.
304:1038	It reproduces EPs as necessary where more than one solution has Been found, and discards EPs which have becorne defunct because no solution has been found.
305:1038	It also determines which lqter positions of' an EP either can or must be filled as a result of the current word becoming a part of the EP.
306:1038	Tt Lllen hands over to OACR.
307:1038	OACR (open and Close ~outine) determines which EPs must be kept for the next word.
308:1038	It also perforrns some juggling with EPs in certain rather tricky cases such as relative clauses.
309:1038	It then returns control to the root PTOgXaIn for the next word.
310:1038	When all the words of the sentence have been processed, ENDR is entered.
311:1038	This examines all existing solutions.
312:1038	It discards any that are incomplete, and perfornls sorne housekeeping on those which: are complete in order to separate them, In future, it will make a choice between alternative solutions, although this part of the program has not yet been written.
313:1038	After ENDR, the sentence has been reduced to one (or more) sets of connecked EPs.
314:1038	Within an EP, for each subsidiary word the relationship to the lead word ( eg.
315:1038	verb/ob ject, verb/timenoun, noun/article, etc).
316:1038	is specified, as are the code(s) remaining as a result of the semantic matches which that word has undergone during the analysis.
317:1038	After this brief description of the functions of the various subroutilies, a Inore detailed explanation of the semmtic match follows.
318:1038	We thon show l~ow tho progrnrrl deals wit11 sams af the.

321:1038	'Int is words 3 and 5 with codc nunibers 4-9, 1 1 16.
322:1038	Suppose the codes have the same meanings as shown ascribed to 1 1-16.
323:1038	Suppose further that "places11 start n with digits 2127, and that 'fieJdl is 21274, also that "time periods" start with digits 223, and that lfrnonths't start 11.
324:1038	,5215 adverb 12  621 5 place preposition object place 13  6211.
325:1038	5 place preposition object city 14  6212 5 place preposition object country 15631 5 time preposition object time period 16  6311 .'5 time preposition object month 1722355 6, It may well be asked why the distinction has been made between the three place prepositions and betweer1 the two time prepositions.
326:1038	There could be two reasons: either that the concept of the preposition changes (which is probably not true here),.or that the tranaIation is different in spme target language.
327:1038	If it is only the second case, the distinctian could have been left for the,program which generatds the target languwe to draw.
328:1038	However, it is more economical to deal with it @ring the semantic ntatching.
329:1038	Now let us see how the disambiguation procoas works.
330:1038	This example is simplified because it does not shaw the semantib matching acTOSS prepositions, between 'walked1 and 'fields1, and between 'walked1 and 'Mayt.
331:1038	Although sometimes necessary for complete disambiguation, it is not so in this example, and as i.4; complicates the explanation, I will omlt it here for the sake of simplicity, After the second word, there is only one EP open.
332:1038	Cbde range (??he meaning of "code EP 1 lead wdk 2-2 range1* will appear subject she 1-1 prgsently.
333:1038	) The thipd word, in1, has two syntactic classes, ad'verb or preposition.
334:1038	Both are acceptable at this point in the verb EP.
335:1038	So a semantic match is performed between each class of 'in' and the lea4 word 'walk'.
336:1038	Suppose that one SP gives 114 5 52, another gives 1 1 6 62, and another gives 11 6 63.
337:1038	All the codes of 'in' are accepted-code 4 by the first SP, codes 5, 6 and 7 by the second SP, and codes 8 and 9 by the third The EP has to be reproduced because there are two syntactic classes of 'in'.
338:1038	We therefore have the following: code range code ranges EP 1 lead walk 2-2 EP2 lead walk 2-2 2-2 subject she 1-1 subject she 1-1 1 1 adverb in 44 preposition in 5-7 819 in EP2 there are two code ranges, one for r;he place preposition and one for the tinis prepositiong.
339:1038	EP3, a preposition EP attackled to EP2, is now opened, and for the next word this preposition EP and EP1 are open, but EP2 is closed, The next word, 'fields', is a place noun.
340:1038	It is not accepted in EP1, which is therefore disca-rded.
341:1038	It is accewted in EP3 as the object of the preposition, so a sernantlc match IS performed between 'in1 and 'fields', Suppose there is an SP, 62 2 2127, Codes 5-7 are then accepted by this SP, and EP3 then looks like this: code range EP 3 lead in 5-7 object< field 10-10 A reconciliation is now carried out between the codes of 'inf in EP3 and EP2, As a result, the second code range in EP2 1s elirninat ed.
342:1038	The next word, 'in1 again, IS now read, and the process is repeated, EP2 now looks like this: lead walk 2-2 2-2 subject she 1-1 1-1 preposition in 57 5-7 preposition in 12-14 15-16 This time, on 'May', the relevant SP is 6311 2 2235.
343:1038	There would also be an SP like this: 63 2 223.
344:1038	But the first SP gives a narrower code range (16-16 instead of 15-16), and so it is preferred.
345:1038	This time, on recgnciliation, the first code range in EP2 is eliminated and the second is reduced.
346:1038	So at the end, the three EPs are thus: EP2 lead walk 2-2 EP3 lead in 5-7 EP~ lead in 16-16 subject she 1-1 object fields 10-10 object May 17-17 preposition in 5-7 preposition in 1616 We are now left with a code range for the first 'in1 containing three codes, In such eases, it is the first code of the range which 1s selected.
347:1038	So 'in' has been dlsambfguated to 621 in the first case, and tg 6311 in the second.
348:1038	Syntactic Complexities Of course, it is all very well for a program to be able to digest, She walked in fields in May. But can it also cope with this?
349:1038	The farmers we were talking about grew, and the greengrocers, thieves and liars, sold those apples.
350:1038	In other words, the program must be capable of being expanded to deal with the myriad complexities and exceptions of natural language.
351:1038	However sound the principles underlying a program may be, such expansion involves a deal of intricate and detaiJ.ed work.
352:1038	At every stage,, flexibility and rigidity liave to be balmced.
353:1038	The program must be flexible enough ta e'nvisage possibilities, but rigid enough to exclude impossibilities and to latch onto the right solution when it appears.
354:1038	The programmer's task resembles a tailor's.
355:1038	Let out an inch or two mare, taka in a couple thore.
356:1038	It .c~.ould be satisfactory inaeed if an algorithm could be Pound both concise and comprehensive which would encompass all the requirements, but language is such a barnacled growth that this seems on the face of it improbable, It would be surpri.sing if excrescences in the program were not necessary to deal with excrescences in the language.
357:1038	In the development of this program, when the treatment of a new structure has been added, whenever possible the original framework has been adapted to incorporate it, thereby avoid~ng the necessity of adding large sections of program.
358:1038	This is only commonsensical.
359:1038	Nevertheless, the program has grown considerably with its c~pacity to handle largerareas of language.
360:1038	Here is perhaps a suitable point to emphasise that, since this is a multiple-path analyser', at sach point all the available information, syntact'ic and semantic, has been deployed to eliminate incorrect paths.
361:1038	This has been done not only to avoid unnecessary computatian, but also because the storage limits have made i$ essential.
362:1038	There are only 25 EPs.
363:1038	Frequently during testing this store overflowed, but interestingly enough ~t has always been possible to bring the demand on it back within bounds by finding some restriction which had been overlooked and which cut out one of the paths.
364:1038	It had originally been feared that 25 EPs would not be nearly enough.
365:1038	One of the satisfying discoveries of the program is that it'i.3.
366:1038	Of course the deployment of all available information is nod &he only approach.
367:1038	Most of the earlier program concentrated on the syntax and paid little heed to the semantics.
368:1038	Wilks, on the other hand, is relying primarily on the semantics suzd is tbaking from the syntax only what is absolutely necessary.
369:1038	It will be fascinating if his research is able to deternine exackly how much of the syntax is unnecessary.
370:1038	There are obvious redundancies in the form of unnecessary safe-guards in language, No one who has struggled with German case endings is ignorant of this, In English, we have the concord between subject and verb in the third perSbn of the present, patently unnecessary since it exists only in this one instance, There are many sentences in which the semantics alone are clearly sufficient.
371:1038	In the sentence, "The man ate the steak with a fork,", the words could appear in any sequence and the meaning would be decipherable, although it might take longer to decipher.
372:1038	The interesting question is what features of the syntax can be consistently ignored, without occasional sentences cropping up which can only be deciphered with the help of these features.
373:1038	There now follows a description of the treatment of three notoriotisly awkward problems-relative clauses, pronouns, and conjunction.
374:1038	Relative Clauses Six cases are distinguished: 1.
375:1038	The man who met you.
376:1038	5.
377:1038	The man you met.
378:1038	The man who(m) you met.
379:1038	6.
380:1038	The man you gave it to.
381:1038	3.
382:1038	The rnan who (m) you gave it to.
383:1038	4, The man to whom you gave it.
384:1038	After the lead of a noun EP, a relative pronoun (94), a preposition (6), and a contact noun (2~) are all possible continuations.
385:1038	lWhol has three relative pronoun codes, starting with, 941, subject of relative clause, 942, object of relative clause, 943, object of prepositicm in relative clause,'Whom' ~bviously only has the last two.
386:1038	EP1 man EP2 man EP3 man EP~ --the the the (man) (subject) who 9-41 who 942 who 943 EP5 --EP~--A EP7 --(a) (object) --(man) (preposition object) When a relative pronoun is recognised, the noun EP, EP1, is reproduced to EPs 2 and 3, and the codes 941, 942, and 943 are to added to separate noun EPs.
387:1038	Then in OACR, new EPs 4 6 are opened dependent uppn the noun EPs.
388:1038	In the case of 941 and 942, the lead of the noun EP, *mant, is Bntered in the neQ EPs,as subject and objec-k respectively.
389:1038	They are marked so as to avoid translation, but they are necessary for semantic matching in the relative clause.
390:1038	In the case of 943, an additional new preposition EP, EP7, is opened dependent upon the relative clause EP, and the lead of the noun EP, 'man', is entered as the object of this prepositiatn EP.
391:1038	The relative clause EP is marked as waiting for a fldating preposition, although when a preposition comes this EP is reproduced, and in one EP the preposition is taken as the floating preposition, while in the other EP it is talcen as another preposition.
392:1038	This is necessary to allow for such clauses as, the man wliom you gave tile book in the end to.
393:1038	In the cases of 941, 942 and 943, the only EP which is open for the next word is the relative clause EP.
394:1038	For 941 the next necessary word in the EP is the lead verb, while for 942 and 943 the next necessary word is the subject.
395:1038	In practice, one or more of these EPs is usually eliminated on the next word.
396:1038	When a contact noun is recognised, it is marked in the noun EP as being in reality a relative pronoun.
397:1038	Then the procedure for 942 and 943 above is followed; but in addition, the contact noun is entered as the subject of the relative clause EP.
398:1038	When a prepusition is recognised, the noun EP is reproduced once, because the preposition might be in the noun EP, like dog in a manger, or it might be in a relative clause.
399:1038	For the relative clause path, a preposition EP and a relative clause EP are opened.
400:1038	Only the preposition EP is left open for the next word, which must be a relative pronoun, For indirect questions, I don't know which house he bought.
401:1038	I don't know what he lived in.
402:1038	etc the treatment is somewhat similar to that for relative clauses.
403:1038	Pronouns For either a translation or a questio~l-a~isweri~lg program, the noun which the pronoun replaces, called here the replacement noun, has to be identified.
404:1038	In a questionallawering program, the reasons are obvious enough.
405:1038	In a translation progrml, it is necsssary for sertiantic ~natchlng and also because in many target languages the gender of the prohoun varies with that of the replacement noun.
406:1038	The replacement noun might; be in the same sentence as the pronoun, or in a previous sentence.
407:1038	Therefore, in dealing with pronouns, the program must be able to refer to preceding sentences.
408:1038	So after ENDR, the essential information for the sentence just processed is extracted from the first chain of EPs and stored.
409:1038	At present, th$s is only done for one chain of EPs, i,e. one solution.
410:1038	This essential information consists of a tree, containing one code for each word and the relatlon of each word to the code to which it is attached.
411:1038	Reverting to, The mail with a long nose always snores.
412:1038	, the information is as follows, snores,le.1175 tenseZtense, mood, code.
413:1038	,.T 1 m~ ~t3e.~~~~m211021~e~~~o~~m~e1 1  the 4~40323 with .*C5e.e6~ 7ee.e*.0***.03  nqse 6em~~212ee~eem~e~~~e~~~~~~e5 a~ .mm7mee~~~~4~331~m~~me~~~m~~om~~~ 6  long 8 4176.a.~e.~e.e~*m 6 r alwgYs 933 6e-e.m.1 The fasr; co~umn polrl~s b~ tile code to which the word is attached.
414:1038	The previous column contains any relationship information not implicit in the code itself or, in the case of a pronoun, a pointer to the code of the replacement noun, 1% is important to notice that the code itself usually does provide the relationship information.
415:1038	For example 61, the first two digits of 'witht, specify with some precision the relationship of 'witht to 'man', With the preceding sentences available in this form, the processing of a pronoun works as fo1;lows.
416:1038	When the pronoun is first encountered for a semqntic match, all the possime replacement nouns are found; that is to say, all those nouns which agree in number and person with the pronoun and which are either before the pronoun in the same sentende but not in the same clause, or in a preceding.sentence.
417:1038	The program only goes back through the preceding sentences until suitable noun has been found, If for example there werB one or more suitable nouns in the second sentence before the current one, 38 it would not examine the third sentence besore the current one.
418:1038	Consider the following sentences.
419:1038	The man went into the shop where he had seen the raincoat.
420:1038	He bought a hat an4 took it away.
421:1038	For 'het, the only possible replacement noun is 'man' because it is the only noun which agrees in person.
422:1038	For it, the program firids 'hat1, 'raincoatt, and 'shopt as possible replacement nouns, If there were a preceding sentence, it would not bother to search it.
423:1038	Semantic matches are then carried out between 'take' and each of the three nouns and all three nouns are accepted, so they are all entered into the EP after it.
424:1038	But the code ranges for 'shop' are more restricted than for 'hat1 and 'raincoat1, because the physicalmovement meaning of 'taker is excluded with 'shopt because 'shopt is imrnoveable.
425:1038	When 'away' is read and matched with 'taket, all meanings of 'take' except the physical-movement meaning are eliminated.
426:1038	tShopt is now left dangling, so to speak, and is eliminated as a possible replacement noun.
427:1038	So when the end of the sentence is reached, there are two possible swviving replacement nouns, 'hat' and 'raincoat'.
428:1038	There is no semantic reason for preferring one of these to the other, becaase the number of digits matched in the semantic match with 'take' is the same in both cases.
429:1038	Therefore in ENDR a choice is made according to a formula of priorities and 'hatt is selected, as; a rmre recent verb object.
430:1038	This "formula of prioritiesv, which is only applied if there is no semantic preference for one noun, is probably at 39 the moment .a rather blunt instrumeat.
431:1038	It is concerned with two factors -which noun occurred in a 1-ater clause, and which noun has the same function as the pronoun; subject, objept, preposition object, or object of the same preposition.
432:1038	In the majority of cases it produces the correct answer, but it is possible to think up examples in which it doesn't.
433:1038	With experience of use, the formula will be refined.
434:1038	A complication is addea ~y rhe possibility that, when a subdect, 'itt may be impersonal.
435:1038	This sense is treated essentially as one possible replacement noun.
436:1038	There is still work to be done in developing the for,mula of priorities.
437:1038	CLAM extracts the information required to solve the pronoun problem.
438:1038	The question is, how to use it.
439:1038	Conjunction No mt of the program is more complex than that dealing with conjunct'fon.
440:1038	The principles are clear,Qeven simple, enough; but applying them has demanded a considerable amount of care.
441:1038	Consider the fragment, He cleaned the carpets in the bedroom and When 'and1 is read, the EPs are as follows: EPI cleaned EP2 carpets EP3 in EP~ bedroom he the bedroom the carpets in All four of these EPs are alive, which is to say that the next word might be a continuation of any of them.
442:1038	On recognising a conjunction, the program looks for nnssible continuations in all alive EPs, from the beginning of the EP up to the point which has been reached.
443:1038	It carries out the necessary semantic matches, it opens a new "conjeptt or conjunctive EP for each solution, and it enters dummy words in both the conjep and the EPs above it in the chain where necessary.
444:1038	To clarify this prooedure, we will consider two possible continuations.
445:1038	(a)  and I '1' can only be the subject of a verb EP, so the conjep.
446:1038	, EP5, must be joined to EP1.
447:1038	The program adds a 5(: entry, and opens EP5 thus: EP1 cleaned EP5----carpets EP5 is dependent on EPI at the subject position K5 (b)  and curtains.
448:1038	'Curtainsf could be joined to EP2 as the lead, or JSY~ as the object.
449:1038	The conjep IS attached to the lower EP, EP2, but a dummy word is entered in EP1 and the semantic match is carried out between the dummy word, 'curtains', and the lead of the EP, 'cleanedt, EP1 cleaned EP2 carpets EP5 curtains he the theX carpets in EP5 is dependent on EP2 at the X curtains K5 lead position, 'The1 ris entered as a dummy word in EP5 because it comes before the point at which EP5 is dependent on EP2.
450:1038	A semantic match is carried out be%w;een 'thev and 'curtainst.
451:1038	'CurtainsT might also be the subject of a verb EP, so EPI is reproduced and another conjep started, attached to the reproduced EP at -%he subject position, as forand I aboqe.
452:1038	This path is unlikely to be correct, and will probably soon b~ eliminated, An attempt is also made to attach curtainst to EP~ in the lead position, but it fails because a dummy word curtainsi is then put into EP3, and the semantic match between 'int and 'curtains1 is tried +and fails, Now let us see what the EPs 1ookd.ike at the end of a more complex conjunctive sentence: I, you and Nellie saw, watched and greeted the men, women and tired children.
453:1038	EPI saw EP2 I EP5 watched EP~ greeted EP7 men I K3 the ~4~ X youX YOU K8 ~e1li.e~ EP3 you el lie^ el lie^ 1c9 K5 ~4 ~6 men EP8 women X ~6 EP~ Nellie X X men women theX X men women childi-enx Kg X women childrenX EP9 children tired It will be seen that control passes from the conjeps 5 and 6 up to EP1 before 'men', so that 'men' is entered as a word in EPI.
454:1038	But it is also entered as a dummy word in EPs 5 and 6, and semantic matches are carried out with 'watched1 and 'greeted1.
455:1038	Also 'woment and 'children', although only dummy words in EPI, are entered as dummy words in EPs 5 and 6 as well, A c~njep remains open, and the EP ofi which it depends 42 remains closed until the last necessary word up to the branch has been filled.
456:1038	If the sentence had read, 1 you and Nellie saw, and 'he1 watched and greeted.
457:1038	,etc. EP5 would have opened with 'he'.
458:1038	I, 'you1 and 'Nellie1 would not have been entered in it as durnrny WQ~~S. El?
459:1038	would flclvo remained open, and EP1 closed until arter tho lead w~rd twa-l;chedlm A coma is treated as a possible conjunction or as FI possible braclcst.
460:1038	Bocauso of the dual role of c.i corntrln, tllc programming associated with it is rather awlc~qard.
461:1038	To sum up the treatment of conjunction, the possible continuations from a conjunction, particularly if'there have been previous conj~mctions in the sentence, can be numerous.
462:1038	But by the strict use of dumrriy entries and their associated semantic matches, false continuat~ons are usually quickly nosed out and eliminated.
463:1038	Also, for the recordirlg of the full meaning of a corij~uictive senterice fortho purpose of later interrogation, the dummy entry system is of course essential.
464:1038	And in the special case of comparative sente~~ces, it is only by such a system that it can be clearly established exactly what is being compared.
465:1038	Summary.
466:1038	I conclude this section with an assessment of what the analysis can and cannot achieve.
467:1038	The purpose of analysis might be described as follows: to select, from among all the possible meanings of each word in the passage, its correct meaning in the context, and to determine what semantic relationships exist between '~qhich words, CLAN can do thzs with considerable efficiency within the confines of 9 single sentence.
468:1038	It is just beginning to enlarge its horizens to deal with longer texts.
469:1038	To clarify this statement let us consider the aids which enable us to select one meaning of a word raeher than another, and see which of them CLAM applies.
470:1038	1.
471:1038	Syntactic class.
472:1038	Example: "The car will work when the mechhic finishes his wo'rlc.
473:1038	Here tho word 'worlc' is evidehtly a verb on the first occasion and 3 noun on the second.
474:1038	CLAM can usually deal easily enough with this type of ambiguity.
475:1038	2.
476:1038	Rules for pronoun antecedents, This has already been discussed at some length The rules are both semantic and syntactic.
477:1038	When the rules are determined, CLAM will be in a position to apply th6m.
478:1038	3.
479:1038	Semantic restrictions on syntactically associated pairs of'words which exclude one meaning.
480:1038	Example: "He took off his g~andmother.~ Here the two word verb 'take offt mugt me'mimicl.
481:1038	The personal subject and the existence of an object excludes the sense of a plane taking off, 'Grandmother1 as object excludes the sense of taking off clothes, Such restrictions are the basis of CLAM'S semantic match, and ambiguities of this sort are resolved as a matter of course.
482:1038	4.
483:1038	Semantic restrictions on syntactically associated pairs of words khich give preference to one meaning.
484:1038	Example: "I killed ths man with a gun".
485:1038	Here, there is a synta~tic as well as a semantic ambiguity.
486:1038	It is less straightforward than the previous example because the ambiguous word is 'with', whlch might be ~JI instrument preposition attached to the verb kill1, or a possessicon preposition attached to the noun Vrnanl.
487:1038	The semantic relationships which determine the choice, however, ~nly involve 'witht indl ectly.
488:1038	They are between 'kill1 and 'gun1 in one case, and between 'man1 and 'gun1 in the other, NormalLy tlXle preference would be for the instrunlent; interpretation because lg~pl' is more strongly associated with 'killt as an instrument than with 'man1 as a possession.
489:1038	CLISrcI chooses the stronger association by taking the 'deepert semadtic match, ar 2n other words the match involving the Larger number of digits.
490:1038	It does this correctly, but as we shall see in a moment, it is not always correct to do so, 5, Remoter contextual environment.
491:1038	Sometimes the factors enabling a choice to be made are more remote from the word in question than In the examples given above, In order to find these factors, a longer journey has to be made into the environment of the word, Examples: (i) "The mayor hit the alderman so hard that he fell down".
492:1038	The normal rules for selection of pronotin antecedents would prefer 'mayor' as the antecedent of 'he' because it is the subjec-tt, but in the environment of hitting, it is much more likely to be the person hit who falls down rather than tb hitter, so 'alderman' must be preferred.
493:1038	(ii) "Two men came in.
494:1038	One had a gun and tho other had a knife.
495:1038	I killed the man with a gun".
496:1038	Here 'withT is obviously not an instrument preposition attached to lkilll, but a possession preposition attached to 'menv.
497:1038	This is so because the definite article 'thet attached to vmpn' implies that 'man1 has already been defined, But in fact two men have already been defined, and more information is needed to determine which of them is referred to.
498:1038	The only possible additional information which could satisfy this requirement is 'with a gunr, whioh does suffice to distinguish one of the previously determined men.
499:1038	Therefore this phrase must be attached to 'manv, At present, CLAM could not resolve either sf these ambiguities.
500:1038	In order to do so it would need, in the fix"st case, more information about the environment of 'hitt than is contained in the semantic restrictions now at its disposal, and in the second case, both a better memory and a routine for dealing with definition of nouns.
501:1038	Work is in progress on these vital additions.
502:1038	They will involve adding to the type and range of the semantic relationships between pairs of words referred to in the definition of the purpose of analysis given at the beginning of this summary.
503:1038	At present, CLAM only holds semantic relationships be-tween words which are syntactically related.
504:1038	This is not enough.
505:1038	Adding to the types of relationships held, and extending them to pairs of words which are syntactically remote, will greatly increase the scope of the model.
506:1038	GENERATION OF TFIE FIXENCFI TRANSLATION As shown in the flowchart, the sentence is operated on sequentially by four subroutines--TWEN, ITRN, FRORM and PRIN.
507:1038	Briefly the function of each of these subroutines is as follows.
508:1038	TWEN examines all the verbs.
509:1038	It welds them (joins auxiliaries to main verbs), and determines their tense in French.
510:1038	Thls is not of course necessarily the sane as in English.
511:1038	Other features of the sentence often have to be examined.
512:1038	Thus, "When he arrives we will meet him", becomes in French, "When he will arrive we will meet him".
513:1038	And "I have been here for five years" becomes "I am here since five years.!!
514:1038	Gerunds, infinitives and participles are also dealt with by TWEN, It may well be asked why the weld part of this routine is thus left until the French generation.
515:1038	Should it not be done avring the reduction of the English sentence to base fo'rm?
516:1038	The answer is that logically it should, and it will sooner or later be transferred, probably to ENDR.
517:1038	But at present it doesn't matter.
518:1038	The part of the program described in the section on pronouns which stores the base form of the last sentences is in fact performed after the French translation has been generated, and therefore, after the verbs have been welded.
519:1038	ITRN takes each word in the sentence in turn.
520:1038	I;t finds the code number in FRILE, the French dictionary file, and extracts the French word(s).
521:1038	Sometimes of course there is more than one, Sometimes there is zero because the English word does not have to be translated.
522:1038	Any particular French word may not have the same function in the sentence as the English word.
523:1038	In such cases, the French word entry in FRILE is followed by a code which specifies the word's function in x'glation to the English word being translated.
524:1038	For example, if 2.32237 isl the code for 'potato', -t;hen'FR1LE entry will be 212237 POMME F DE 6 TERRE 6x2.
525:1038	The F after POMME shows that it is feminine.
526:1038	The 6 after DE shows that its x'unc$ion is as a plcepqsition in the EP of which POMME is the lead.
527:1038	The 6x2 after TEW shows that it is the object in the EP of which DE is the lead, Sometimes it isaecessary to go up Che tree.
528:1038	Fop example Y1x5 means an adverb (5) in the verb EP (1) of which the English word is a subsidiary (Y).
529:1038	It is thus possible to generate a French sentdnce of a radically different shape from English.
530:1038	ITRY also finds a French sequence code for each word.
531:1038	This is a code which provides the ordering of words within an EP.
532:1038	All lead words have the code 200.
533:1038	A pre-noun adjective may have a code 140, and a post-noun adjective 350.
534:1038	So these codes do not determine what is the actual sequence of words in the sentence, but they do provide the basic information from which the sequence is derived in FRORM.
535:1038	FRORM first derives the actual sequence of words in %he,sentence.
536:1038	It then takes each French word and puts it into the correct rorrn.
537:1038	Obviously the most arduous part of this tqsk is finding the forms of the verbs.
538:1038	FRORM refers to tables which contain the verb endrings for both irregular bd regular verbs, and the irregular feminine and plural endings for nouns and adjectives.
539:1038	PRIN prints the French translation, haying made any necessary elisions.
540:1038	If there is more than one solution, it prints alterna-bive translations of particular words on subsequen.1; linss or, if appropriate, it will print complete alternative sentences.
541:1038	CONCLUSION Programming Details and Future Developments Programmersmay be interested in some details.
542:1038	The program runs on a 360-40 using 146~ of core store.
543:1038	The program is mitten in FORTRAN IV, not an ideal choice but the best available in the circumstances.
544:1038	The reduction of the English to base form requires about 6,000 instructions, and the French generation about 2,500.
545:1038	At present all the files are 1cep-k in core store except for the two large dictionary files VOCAB and FRILE, which are accessed on disk.
546:1038	It will eventually be necessary to Keep JSP also on disk.
547:1038	At present the processing takes about 15 seconds per word on average, of which READ takes 4076, the semantic and syntactic analysis about 20%, and the French generation 40%.
548:1038	No serims attempt has yet been made to optimise the program and this time could certainly be peduced.
549:1038	But the reduction would be offset by the eventual need to keep JSP on disk.
550:1038	So as a practical proposition for translating texts, it would be necessary for the processing time to be reduced by a factor of about 10.
551:1038	Presumably this will come sooner or later with improvement in hardware.
552:1038	There are certain improvements which would have -bo be made to the pogram before it could be used, apart from the extension of the vocabulary.
553:1038	Most obvious: (a) there are some syntactic structures such as inversion after negatives which the program does not at present recognise; (b) a, selection routine must be incorporated in ENDR to choose between alternative solutions if more than one emerges; (c) if no solution emerges the program should try again, selectively suppressing semantic matching, allowing words to be used outside their normal sense; (d) the sizes of some of the temporary stores would have to be increased.
554:1038	No particular dirficulty is anticipated with any of these developments, in that they involve no methodology fundamentally different from what has already been applied.
555:1038	It is primarily a matter of time and priorities.
556:1038	However with a fifth development, namely the extension of the memory as outlined at the end of the section oh analysis, new ground must be covered, and work on this is at present in progress.

595:1038	I. FEDERAL PRQCUREMENT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVBLOPMENT: AN EXPLANATION OF THE RFP CONTRACT MECHANISM Each year the federal government contracts for billions of dollars of work to support efforts deemed to be in the national interest.
596:1038	A significant percentage of the contract services are in the form of Research and ~evelopment (R & D) or programmatic work which colleges and universities are particularly wcll-suited to perform.
597:1038	The government commits these funds in eithet of two WAYS: grants or contracts.
598:1038	University researchers are generally more familiar with the grant procedure than with the contract procedure.
599:1038	Under a grant program, a given federal agency is authorized to grant funds to non-profit institutions, frequently educational institutions, for the purpose of supporting research or a in a given general area.
600:1038	A body of general conditions are established by the Congress and refined by the applicable agency to set parameters for the pro$am as a whole.
601:1038	A specific grant for a program can be made so long as it fits within the gevral stpndards (the Guidelines) of the program and meets whatever qualitative standards for review that have been established.
602:1038	Since grant funds, particularly in research areas, have been inc~asingly competitive in recent years, the university community ' is turning its attention to potential support through the contract mechanismi.
603:1038	A contract, unlike a grant, is generally awarded for the purpose of meeting a specific reqwrement that a federal agency has determined to be important to the achievement of .the agency:s responsibilities.
604:1038	The contract will tend, therefore, to be specific in terms of the agency's needs, and in the case of research, wdl usually be for the purpose of "applied" rather than "basic" research.
605:1038	The contract, also unlike the grant, can be negotiated with any organization that is legally constituted to do business w~th the government, whether non-profit or profit-making.
606:1038	Government procurement m its present massive scope is a relatively new phenomenon, having emerged fin as prpscnt form in the past quarter of a century.
607:1038	Each of the many federal agencies involved in procurement and most are developed a set of standards'and procedures to administer the contracting process.
608:1038	While the procedures used by any gven agency tend to be relativel) orderly in terms of that agency's requirements, they will not necessarily conform to the practices of anoJler agency.
609:1038	Looking at the federal government as a whole, however, the set of.
610:1038	practices is varied, highly technical and often confusing.
611:1038	The general descriptions offered in 'this statement, therefore, are subject to the differing qualifications and refinements established by individd government agencies.
612:1038	In recent years there has been an attempt to bring mter-agency consistency to the procurement' process.
613:1038	A speclal government task force has recommended legislation -which would bring uniformity in procurement policy.
614:1038	Congress is considering such legislation, which will be discussed later.
615:1038	Basic contractual agreements with the federal government are developed in one of four ways: A. Sole Sotrrce I'roclrrement.
616:1038	The government negotiates with one and only one provider on the grounds that the product or service is uniqucly provided by the organization in question.
617:1038	B. Sitlqlc Solrrco Procir r(wlolt Thc governmcot ncgotlatcs with onc and onl).

620:1038	1).
621:1038	O~CVP CIotrip~tlttoil.
622:1038	CorltrI~cts .ue lct by open bid, utili~in~ the mmdatory provisions for ndvcrtts~ng publlcly the availability of the contract, and ope,, solicitation of proposals AS dcscrlbcd Intcr.
623:1038	In dddition to the four types of contractual processes, there are special types of contractual arrangements for special purposes.
624:1038	For university representatives, the Ope11 and No Cost Contracts 'Ire of particular interest.
625:1038	These contracts permit the exchange of equipment, p~~rticularly scientific equipment, and documents for specified purposes wlthout actual fiscal trmiaction.
626:1038	of the various contractual patterns, the Open Competition is becoming the most common contract mcchanhm.
627:1038	Since the government purchases goods and servlces on a dady bass and in amounts totaling blllions of dollars annually, the problem for potential investigators is how to d~scover th~t a contract of interest wdl be let and whether thew organizations have sufficiently reasonable chances of winning the contract to justify the extensive and uncompensatablc cffort required to apply.
628:1038	Each competitive contract let by the government must be announced as open to cornpetltion.
629:1038	The announcement i$ in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP).
630:1038	The announcement must be published in the journal that has begome the pnrnary source for all contract information the Conirnerce B~cslness Dally.
631:1038	The Commerce Business Daily is pbLshed In Chicago as a senrice of the Department of Commerce.
632:1038	(It may be ordered from the Government Pnntlng Office, Washingtpn, D.C. the subscription rate is currently 563.50 per year).
633:1038	The Commerce ~~rs~~zoss Dally has a small staff a~~d consequently must publish RFP announcements.
634:1038	as they arc written by the contributing.agency.
635:1038	As a result, information that is published regarmng a gven competition is often scant and late, with proposal deadlines somctlrnes only a matter of days away from the dare of *jpblication.
636:1038	~raquently a notice d indicate the need to send for more detailed information promded by the agency offering the contract.
637:1038	Writing for the necessary informat~on cuts Into the short tiine available fir preparation of a proposal to meet a deadl~ne date.
638:1038	Alternately, most agencies provldc an additional advantage to prospective bldders in the form of "Bidders Lists".
639:1038	All current prospective bidders on a "Bldders List" are notified of a pen&ng RFP, generally at the same time the Conzmerce Business Daily is notified, thus gvlng the bidder on the list the advantage of several days.
640:1038	In order to be included on a "bidders list," an investigator must contact the agency wth which he intends to do business and request an %pplicatim.
641:1038	Most agencies now use Standard Form 129*for placegent on bidders lists.
642:1038	While there is some 'inter-agency crossllstlng of bldders, for the most part appl~cants must expect to' submit Standard Form 129 separately to each agency for placement on a biddcrs list.
643:1038	There are some difficult problems in the mechanics of the contract process o$ which interested college and university representatives should be aware.
644:1038	For example, government agencles,have established the rule that each organizot~on on a "bidders list" must respond either positively 01 negatively to every RFP it rccelvcs.
645:1038	1f an organization falls to respond to an RFP with at least a notice ofintent, it is removcd from the "bidders list".
646:1038	Maintaining status on a "bidders list" therefore can become a tedious adrnln~strative task justrfiablc only to those organizations that lare geared to a heavy volilmc of government contracting.
647:1038	The "bidders list" does permlt the applicant organization to indicate the types of proposals in which it 1s interested and its capacities to perform tasks, however, so that RFP's are sent to the Grganlzation only when the RFP 1s relevant to the organizations' capabilities.
648:1038	Some of the administrative burden on prospective contractors 1s eliminated by this procedure.
649:1038	Even hi the best of cacumstances,'however, bidders frequently have as llttle as two weeks to prepare a proposal.
650:1038	Gcenerally the competltlon has the same tlme constraints,, but the process does require staff who are available and who can "drop everything" in order' to meet a proposal deadline.
651:1038	Pnvate research corporations and consulting firms can administer their wok so that they may respond to proposal preparation on short notice; respondmg quickly to an RFP 1s frequently 'more difficult for university investigators with heavy comkitrnents to teaching and other university-relyed activities.
652:1038	Except for -the time constrants under wlilch one must work, ihe preparation of contract ptoposals differs little,from the preparation of grant proposals.
653:1038	In one sense, the preparation of a contract proposal IS easier\,because specific terms and objectives are generally stated in the WP.
654:1038	The proposal is frequently a statement of the methodology and procedures for acbiewy!
655:1038	prescnbed objectives.
656:1038	On the other hand, the contract leaves little latitude for the creative investigator to detennme'the character of the rtisearcb to his own standards.
657:1038	The agency sponsoring the RFP sometimes employs qualified persollb who can state a valid set of object&ves and specifications for the contract; sometimes, however, it does not.
658:1038	It might be .necessary for he response to ~IJ RFP to contain arguments for dtenng objectives and specifications that diplo~atically demonstrate how the governments' Interests d be served.
659:1038	Contracting also can take place by mean6 of an "Unsolicited Proposal".
660:1038	The investigator sul~mits a proposal which hk has initiated to an appropnate federal agency and the agency can respond at its discretion it the proposal meets agency needs.
661:1038	Generally the unsolicited proposal rises as a result of prim informal discussions between the investigator and the government agent.
662:1038	When a contract has been awarded by a gart~culnr agency, thc investigator's fiscal agent must meet with thc agency's contract officer to negotiate the final terms of tbc contract.
663:1038	Thc type of negotiatiotl wll depend upon whether the contlact is i;trr~l-l'riccb or Cuct~ei?rrbursable.
664:1038	A Fixed-Pflce contrLct is one in wlllcll thc olganizdtion and the agency agree upon contract terms for a re-determined fixed cost.
665:1038	Once the Fixed-Price contract is signed, thc organization must rncct thc terms of the contract for the prlce regardless of circurnstdnccs.
666:1038	The fixed-price con tract is generally more appro priiltk fbr products than for services.
667:1038	The Cost-Reimb~mable contract is ncgoti~tcd on the basis of cost ertim~tcs of monthly operating levels.
668:1038	The tnontlily bperdting level will bc the sum of .dlbwn6le costs on a monthly basls during thc tirne of the contract.
669:1038	~t is understood that thc Rnal prlce of .l Cost-~cimbursablr contract can go up (Cost Ovcrrun) or down from tfic original' cstimatc as a function of cdlowablc costs actucdly incurred.
670:1038	Thc ~ixcd-price contract is easier to administer and simplifies record-keepmg.
671:1038	The reason for this is that once the pncc IS set the government is relgtlvely unconcerned about how contract expenditures break down by category or line items.
672:1038	With the Cost-Relmbursable contract, completc documcntatlon by cost category must be strictly maintained sincc the documcntaaon is the sole basis for relrnbursement for expehditures under the coktract The adrnlnistration of the Cost-Reimbursable contract is much more tedious, therefore, than is the case !or the Fixed-Price contract, but doos have the advantage, given adequate book-keeping, of entallins no risk to d~e contractor.
673:1038	Bccause the tot~l cost of a cost-~cimbursablc contr'1c.t is an estirndte rather than a firm figure, the <~w.irdln~ of n colnpctltlvc bid can be based on f'lctors othcr tllan the "botto~n line" cost.
674:1038	Clearly the level of operational cost wlll be a significa~\t factor in determination of an award, but in tlie absence of strict FixcdCost.
675:1038	the way is opened for numcrou~ judgment factors to affect the decision of c~ward.
676:1038	while the government has tried to establish safeguards agrunst4 arbitrariness and favoritism, the latitude in decision-making is still wde in open competition contracting and even wlder in the other contractural forms.
677:1038	WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING ABOUT THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS What has happened over the years is that federal procurement has become a big business.
678:1038	Contracts for goods, services (which include research and development), and facilities have reached $60 billion annually.
679:1038	Although no statistics are available to describe the amount of federal contracts awaded colleges and universities, we do know that college and university participation in federal research and development efforts represents approximately 14% of the total federal Investment in R & D, and that an increasing amount of that money is awarded by contract.
680:1038	What is dist urblng is that despite thc magnitude of federal cxpcnditures contract, the govern~lieilt has no angle office responsible for policies to govern the procurement process, and no single source to provlde guidance and inforrnatlon about federal procurement laws and regulations.
681:1038	In fact, the fcderal government has no clear-cut definition for the terms grant and contract.
682:1038	As a result, we have been faced wlth confusing and complicated rules, excessive paperwork, favoritism and abuses in procurement practices, cost overruns, and many other factors that led to a thorough study of procurement practices by the Commission on Govcrnment Procurement.
683:1038	The results of the Commission's work is now demonstrated in the Congress.
684:1038	Using the Commission's report and recommendations as a bluepnnt, Congrcss is considering 1cgisl;ltion to address procurement problems, including two major bllls of interest to State University of New York.
685:1038	One measure, certain to brlng about fundamental changcs a necessary to irnprovc the system, would establish a central procurerncnt policy office in the Erecutivc office, which would provide overall guidance and direction for federal procurcment policy Thc office would establish a government-wde system of uniform procurcment regulations, coordinating policies* and regulations of federal agencies, and exercising leadership in monitoring and revising future policies and procedures.
686:1038	The Adml~listrator would be appointed by the President and approved by the Senate.
687:1038	dl major decisions by thc office would be approved by Congress.
688:1038	At this writing, a House-Senate conference committee is considering the measure.
689:1038	Sources inkcate that the blll should be agreed to in the near future and wJ1 bc scnt to thc President for his signature.
690:1038	The other major procurement blll (S 3514, HR 9060) now under consideration by Congressional committees hopefully would eliminate the proscnt confusion among fcdcral age~~cic in deterrninillg whether the legal Instrument used to support Lhc desired goods or servlces should be a @wt or contract, or cooperative agreement, simply by defining the terms clearly.
691:1038	Undcr both House and Senate versions of the bdl, the contracts would be used whenever the principal purpose of the agreement would be to purchase goods or sewces "for the direct benefit or use of the federal government" for "ultimatc ~ublic use".
692:1038	Grants would be used as the legal instrument when the objective would be "to accomplish a public purpose authorized by federal statute" rather than for dlrect use by the federal government.
693:1038	Cooperative agreement would be used to apply whenever the acnvlty would be authorized by federal statute but "substantial involvement" of the federal agency is also necessary.
694:1038	At this writing, the bill is under consideration by House and Scnate Government Operations Committees.
695:1038	Since the legslation would directly affect agreements for research and development by State University of New York and federal agellcies, a is recommended that interested persons remain aware of the measure's status.

1011:1038	Developed by "a Cambridge, Massachusetts research firm" (name and address unknown to AJCL), the machine is described as capable of reading almost any printed type from newspapers, magazines, etc. It is said to be able to recognize hundreds of different type faces and to determine the correct pronunciation of English words.
1012:1038	However, its intonation is said to be flat, and its pronunciation of some words "bizarre" The machine is to be available for institutional use in-a year or two, and for homes in four or five years.
1013:1038	The price is predicted to start initially at $25K, falling eventually to a fifth as much.

1017:1038	A machine that can analyze thousands of words of A forejgn lenguage text and prepare summaries and anafises m English?
1018:1038	A machine that has stored vocabulanes Utat permll it to '.fansinre foreign lany~age material dsahng wth such scientific cilsclplines as chemistry, physlcs, eiectroflics, aviation, rne!allurgy, earth sciences and mathema tics?
1019:1038	It exists and has been in use by the U S Air Force since 1970.
1020:1038	It also was used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration dunnp the recent combined U.S.-Soviet space night.
1021:1038	Actually, however, ~t 1s much more than a machine.
1022:1038	It is a sjsiem developed by Dr Peter Paul Toma of L;1 JoUa, who has been working since 1936 to comblne the capabdltkes of computers wth the sclence of linguistics His system is known as "Systran," an acronym formed from the ~oros system and translation, or what he calls the world's first fully automated universal machine translauon system.
1023:1038	FROM THE SAN OIEGO SUN, 11 MARCH 1976 It is now being marketed in the United States and Eu~ope bq Latsec, lnc, Tonla's La Jolla-based finn that takes it-5 name, agaln an acroq m, from ":angmqe translat~orl sjsternq and electro:lic comrnunlcations".
1024:1038	Toma says Systran is be!ng uscd by the European Common Market, and is in various stages of use in Lusembourg, Germany and Canada, in add~tion to the United States The charms of It spreadirlg are quite good Tonla demonstrated the s) stem here Monday before a two-day senllnar sponsored by the Foreig Brosdcastlng Informatiotl Scrvice, the P;ovemrner t agency that monitors arid pr~idcs translations of all major foreign broadcasts Russian language texts itere punched, letter by letter, on tptlat IS cal!cd a Cartertone S-15 C a fonn of electlc type~k~iter, This was transn~itted by teleghone to the Teled) ne \ an computer m San D!ego, 9 &hich had been programmed to recelke 11, and then after some problems were worked out was sent back by the computer in E~glish.
1025:1038	As Tonla explairls ~t, this can be accomplished witfi any relntn ely ad\anced tomputer, after it has been programmed to operate as a translator.
1026:1038	Fed Into Memory Bank The system is recorded on mayetlc: tapes or discs whlch are fed Lnto the computer's memory bank, gning it a vocabulq to operate withln whatever language is to be uscd At this time, ~t is possibie to program a computer to translate from Russ~an to English, English to Russlan, German to English, Chinese to Engl~sh.
1027:1038	French to Engl~sh and Englsh to Freflch It also is possib!e for the computer to recelve up to three foreign language transmissions s:rnultaneously, record them and then translate them separately, normally ~lthln an hbur.
1028:1038	There is no claim that the translations are literarily perfect.
1029:1038	But they are ~h2t IS called "uszb!e translat~ons," and they can be obtained quite rap~dly.
1030:1038	Latsec says the system can be used to proude H hat IS called content analysis, or automatic zbstract~r~g and pobtical trend pre&ction.
1031:1038	In other \lords, lt can be us:d to analyze a teht and select common themes In many tests to lnd~cate trends.
