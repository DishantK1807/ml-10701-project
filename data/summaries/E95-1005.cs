In the system described in Dalrymple et al.(1993a), the ~ relation associates expressions in the meaning language with f-structures.

We provide an extension to the previous account of LFG semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1993a) according to which dependencies between f-structures are viewed as resources; as a result a one-to-one correspondence between uses of f-structures and meanings is maintained.

In the examples discussed in Dalrymple et al.(1993a) there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of path sets S and the set of f-structures S I picked out by such path sets, so the two methods yield the same predictions for those cases.

The resource-based approach to semantic composition in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) obtains the interpretation for a phrase via a logical deduction, beginning with the interpretations of its parts as premises (Dalrymple et al., 1993a).
