ESSENTIAL ARGUMENTS: AN EXTENSION The notion of an essential argument in a PROLOG literal has been first introduced in (Strzalkowski, 1989), and subsequently extended in (Strzalkowski, 1990bc; Sttzalkowski and Peng, 1990).

The general algorithm has been described in (StrTalkowski, 1990c; Strzalkowski and Peng, 1990).

In the bottom-up phase the missing parts of the goal-expansion tree will be filled in by applying i For linguistic aspects of reversible grammars, see (Kay, 1984; Landsbergen, 1987; Neuman, 1990; Steedman, 1987).

12 yj may be partially "out"; see (Strzalkowski, 1990c) for the definition of delayed "out" status.

The restricted movement inversion algorithm INVERSE has been documented in detail in (Strzalkowski, 1990ac).

The procedure can be straightforwardly augmented to compute all MSEAs (Strzalkowski, 1990c).
C90-2060 P90-1027
In addition, the procedure, as described in (Shieber et al, 1990), makes no attempt to impose a proper ordering of the "nonchain" goals, which may have an adverse effect on the generator efficiency.

The augmented grammar compilation procedure presented here is already quite general: it appears to subsume both the static compilation procedure of Strzalkowski (1990c), and the head-driven grammar evaluation technique of Shieber et al.(1990). The process of grammar inversion is logically divided into two stages: (a) computing the collections of minimal sets of essential arguments (MSEAs) in predicates, and (b) rearranging the order of goals in the grammar so that at least one active MSEA is "in" in every literal when its expansion is attempted.

7 * Some concern has also been voiced (Gardent and Plainfosse, 1990) about the termination conditions of this algorithm.

As an example, consider the following clauses: u A similar concept of guide-structure is introduced in (Dymetman et al., 1990), however the ordered series is less restrictive and covers a larger class of recursive programs.

Shieber et al.(1990) propose a mixed top-down/bottom-up interpretation, in which certain goals, namely those whose expansion is defined by the so-called "chain rules", 3 are not expanded during the top-down phase of the interpreter, but instead they are passed over until a nearest non-chain rule is reached.

Some of the recent resea~h in this area is reported in (Calder et al., 1989; Dymetman and Isabelle, 1988; Dymetman et al., 1990; Estival, 1990; Hasida and Isizaki, 1987; Ishizaki, 1990; Shieber, 1988; Shieber et al., 1990; Strzalkowski, 1990a-c; Strzalkowski and Peng, 1990; van Noord, 1990; and Wedekind, 1988).
