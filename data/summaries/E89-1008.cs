Our approach also solves the problem noted by Bear (1988) of the overgenerality of rules in an FSM system.

Finally, having the level of properties over which to state generalizations means that our lexical representations of strings are not cluttered with non-realizable diacritic characters whose function is simply to trigger morphological processes (of Bear 1988).

5). generalizations or stratification (Flickinger et al 1985, Gazdar and Evans 1988).
P85-1032
We indicate some criticisms to be made of our approach from both linguistic and computational perspectives and relate our approach to others such as Finite-State Morphology (Koskenniemi 1983), DATR (Gazdar and Evans 1989) and object-oriented morphophonemics (de Smedt 1984, Daelemans 1988).
E89-1009
We discuss relations between our proposals and the approaches of Finite-State Morphology (FSM, Koskenniemi 1983), DATR (Gazdar and Evans 1989) and object-oriented morphophonemies (de Smedt 1985, Daelemans 1988).
