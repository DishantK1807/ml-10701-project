For example, given the sentence The 1 man 2 who 3 saw 4 the 5 woman 6 who 7 saw s John 9 is 10 happy 11, the following trees are selected after the first pass (among others): 5 NP A s NP S NP f NP NP Nro$ VP A A I A D D~ N Camp \[ A D~ N N V A~ A ei V NPi~, I I I, I I I I the(l.5) man(2) whÂ°(3.7) saw(4,s) woman(6) John(9 ) is(10) happy(n ) 4 Unlike our previous suggestions (Schabes, AbeiIl6 and Joshi, 1988), we do not distinguish each structure by its head position since it increases unnecessarily the number of states of the Ear\]ey parser.

The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased both in amount and complexity: for example, lexical rules in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1983), GPSG (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum and Sag, 1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987), Comhinatory Categoriai Grammars (Steedman 1988), Karttunen's version of Categorial Grammar (Karttunen 1986, 1988), some versions of GB theory (Chomsky 1981), and LexiconGrammars (Gross 1984).

However TAGs are 'naturally' lexicalized because they use an extended domain of locality (Schabes, Abeilld and Joshi, 1988).

Examples of auxiliary trees (they are predicates taking sentential complements, 8-10, or modifiers, 11-12): S S S NPo$ VP NPo$ VP NPo$ VP S N A A (9) ~ (10) A (11) A V Sl (8) V Sl V NPi$ S2 Adv S A N I I I I I thinks saw promise maybe beautiful (12) 2In some earlier work of Joshi (1969, 1973), the use of the two operations 'adjoining' and 'replacement' (a restricted case of substitution) was investigated both mathematically and linguistically.

An Earley-type parser for TAGs has been investigated by Schabes and Joshi (1988).
