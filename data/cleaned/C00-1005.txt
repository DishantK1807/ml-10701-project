Related languages share a ntuch wider range of linguistic itff'ornuttio;t than typically assunwd in stamlard mttltilingttal gramtmtr atwhitectures.
Taking grammatical relatedness seriously, we are particularly interested in designing lhtguistically motivated grammatical resottrces Jbr Slavic languages to be used itz applied and theoretical computational linguistics, ht order to gain the pelwpective of a language-family oriented gramntar desigtl, we consider {ttt arrtly of systematic relations that can hold between syntactical units.
While the categorisation of primitive linguistic entities tends to be language-specilic or even constrttction-.~pecific, the relations holding between them allow viii'lofts degrees of absltztction.
On the basis of Slavic &tta, we show how a domain ontology conceptualising molphosyntaclic "buildiltg blocks" can serve as a basis r~" a shared grotlt;nar of Slavic.
Introduction In applied computational linguistics, the need for developing and utilising operational notions of shared grammars stems fi'om multilingual grammar engineering.
If considerable portions of existing grammars can be reused for the specification ot7 new grammars, development eftbrts can be greatly reduced.
A shared grammar also facilitates the difficult task of lnaintaining consistency within and across the individual parallel grammars.
In machine translation, the specification of a shared grammar can furthermore be exploited for simplifying the transfer process.
Without much ado, computational linguists engaged in multilingual grammar development have always tried to reduce their labour by importing existing grammar components in a simple "copy-pastemodify" fashion.
But there were also a number of systematic attempts to create and describe shared grammars that are convincingly documented in publications.
\[Kam88\] demonstrates the concept for a relatively restricted domain, the grammatical description of simple nominal expressions in five languages.
\[BOP88\] were able to exploit the grammatical overlap of two Slavic languages, for the design of a lean transfer process in Russian to Czech machine translation.
In multilingual application development within Microsoft research, grammar sharing has extensively been exploited \[Pin96\], \[GLPR97\].
However, all these approaches are rather opportunistic in the sense that existing grammatical descriptions based on existing grammar models were explored.
We went a step further and started grammar design with a notion of a shared grammar for a family of related languages.
Pursuing the goal of designing linguistically motivated grammatical resources for Slavic languages to be used in computational linguistics, one is inevitably confronted with primary problems stemming ti'om the t'act that different linguistic theories cut up grammars in quite different ways, and grammar formalisms differ in their degree of granularity.
It cannot be expected, therefore, that the minimal differences between two languages or their shared elements form easily identifiable units in the available language-specific grammars.
Therefore, an ontology conceptualising morphosyntactic "building blocks" would offer a solid basis for a shared grammar of Slavic in the sense of \[ASU99\].
Our use of the term ontology is fairly pragmatic, namely, as representing a formal shared conceptualisation of a particular domain of interest.
It describes concepts relevant for the domain, their relationships, as well as "axioms" about these concepts and relationships.
Note that such a pragmatic approach does not presuppose any general all-encompassing ontology of language but rather "mini-ontologies" conceptualising the selected domain from various perspectives in a consistent way.
The domain of interest in this project is the grammatical knowledge on Slavic morphosyntax contained in linguistic theories and linguistic descriptions.
While the categorisation of primitive linguistic entities lends to be language-specific or even construction-specific, the relations holding between them allow various degrees of abstraction.
In order to gain the perspective of language-family oriented grammar design, we will consider the array of.s3,stematic relations that can hold between syntactically significant items.
Systematic relations Systematic relations motivate shared patterns of variation cross-linguistically as well as across constructions.
In a constraint-based theory like HPSG, where the grammatical properties of linguistic entities are typically revealed in complex taxonomies, nothing in the formal apparatus would actually exclude the possibility to organise also the relations holding in syntactic constructions in a type hierarchy.
So, the type subsumption could be interpreted as modelling a continuum from general and presumably universal systematic relations to more and still more specific instances of these relations resulting fi'om admissible cross-classifications.
I In I The two types of edges connecting types in otu g,'aphical representation of hierarchies 'square' and 'direct' are significant.
The former indicate possible conjunction of types, and thus introduce various dimensions of multiple inhe,'itance.
The latter indicate disjunction of types within the respective dimension of classification.
98 our view, two orthogonal types of systematic relations have to be distinguished: syntagmatics and alignment, since they appear to be universally relevant for the well-for|nedlmss of utterances in any language (Hierarchy I).
2 Syntagmatic
relations play a constitutive role in syntax by establishing instant COlmections between linguistic entities in various constructions.

of type continuous) or as long-distance constituency (i.e.
o1' type discontinue++s).
The directionality accounts for situations where, e.g., Ihe head either li)llows the dependent or precedes it.
In turn, the i~eriphcry of a syntactically determined domain can be left or right.
Structural syntagmatics The structural syutagn|atic relations between two syntactic units is classified along two primary dimensions which we call centHcity and taxis (Hierarchy 3).
The chosen terms should be under{~ tr stood in the context of distin~.uishin~, on the one hand, endocentric imd exocentric relations, and on the other hand, h37mtaxix and parataxis.
The endocentricity of a strt,ctural syntagmatic relation (between, e.g., ~ and \[~) presuptmses that one of the syntactic items involved in this relation (e.g., c0 plays a pron|inent role.
In contrast, the exocenlricity of a structural syntag,natic relation presupl)oses no assun+|ptions in this respect, hence, it can be viewed as the unmarked member of the centricity opposition.
The hypotaxis means that there is a depend2 The intotmlional ol+ganisation of utterances by the way is anolher systematic relalion exhibiting,his trait.

l,;ndocc||tric hypotaxis, or selection.
The headdependent co|fl'igu|'ation can be identified unambiguously.
Tim prominent element is also the dominating one in the subordination.
Exoccntric hypotaxis, or modification.
There is no l)t'olnincnt clone|on+ to unambigttously lake o\,oi" the role of a dolninating item in the subordination.
Note that this is where (theory-sinusitis) linguistic conventions regarding the head-dependct+t configuration actually begin.
Endocentric parataxis.
There is a prominent elc|nent in this relation, but no head-dependent configuration.
Exocentric parataxis.
In the relation holding between lhc ilwolved linguistic entities there is neither a prominent element nor a head-dependent configuration.
This is the tmlnarked case with respect to both ccnlricity and taxis.
syntagmatics structural centricity taxis et\]docetltfic exocentfic hypctaxis parataxis selection modification endo-para exo-para " r, i licrarchy 4: Structural syntugmatics Due to the fact that there always is a principal or leading element in tile endocenlric relations, different linguistic theories typically agree on how to intel'pret these relations structurally.
But there is no consensus -often even within the same linguistic theory on the structural interpretation of the exocentric relations.
So, additional factors are usually taken into consideration as st, pporting the in+,'eduction of particular conventions.
The latter, however, arc not always linguistically motiwtted, 29 tile choice is sometimes arbitrary and often due to theory-sl~ecific technical reasons.
Combinatorial syntagmatics The combinatorial dimension in tile proposed taxonomy (Hierarchy 5) largely corresponds, in our understanding, to what \[S&L95\] regard as morphological signalling of direct syntactic relations.
syntagmatics I combinatorial . -. . juxtaposition co-variation government Hicrm'chy 5: Combinatorial synt~matics Tile combinatorial syntagmatic relation of juxtaposition presupposes no overt morphological indication.
As to governmettt, it is traditionally understood as the determination by one element of the inflectional form of the other, i.e. form government.
Its classical instance is, of course, case government.
In \[Cann93\] (p.
51) these morpllosyntactic relation is formulated for some construction involving y and (5 ill tile following way: y governs (5 if (i) varying the inflectional l'orm of (5 while keeping T constant leads to ungrammaticality, and (ii) varying the form oft and keeping 8 constant makes no difference to grammaticality.
The systematic co-variatioll o1' linguistic forms is typically rcalised as feature congruity, i.e. compatibility of values of identical grammatical categories of syntactically colnbined linguistic items.
Ill our view, two general covariation types must be distinguished (cf.
Hierarchy 6), namely, asymmetric and symmetric co-variation, with only the former actually corresponding to the traditional directional concept of agreement, e.g., \[Cor98\].
Cc-vatiatiorl asymmetric symmetric al 1~1 ('d ~I t__~ t__J llierarchy 6: Morphosyntaclic co-variation As the term suggests, the asymmetry of co-variation presupposes a controller-target conl'iguration.
This is to be contrasted with the synunetry of covariation which is not interpretable in these terms.
Symmetric co-variation, in essence, would presume redundancy as if both co-varying syntactic items were controllers and targets at the same time.
Endocentric hypotaxis (selection) The endocentric hypotaxis corresponds to the traditional notion of selection.
Even though not directly observable, it underlies specific morphosyntactic realities interpreted in Hierarchy 7 as resulting from a cross-classification with the combinatorial syntagmatic relation types.
The traditional notion of subcategorisation call thus be viewed as a selection that is realised via governmont.
Two general oplions are usually available across languages lbr externalising the governed selection (i.e.
subcategorisation) of nominal categories in actual syntactic constructions.
syntagmatics combinatorial structural co-variatien centricity taxis asymmetric symmemc juxtaposition govemmem ot,ao exo nypo L)ara i seleclion \[ agreement I \[matching marking SL~bcalogonsatlon cress-referencing relational case object eliticisation Hierarchy 7: Selection A typical definition of Ihe firsl one call be found in \[Blake94\]: "Case in its most een|ral manifestation is a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their beads".
The relational case explicating case government stands in opposition to tile so-called concordial case observed in ease-governed modification environments and presented in Hierarchy 8.
The second option to externalise subcatcgorisation of nominal categories is the cross-referencing the syntactic function of the dependent at the head.
It is actually confined to certain core grammatical relations and typically amounts to some kind of pronominal representation of these grammatical relations at tile head.
As \[Blake94\] observes, the cross-referencing pronominal elements serve as an alternative to case ill signalling grammatical relations.
In Slavic, there are two candidales for the second /ype of externalising a governed selection.
On tile ()he hand, lh0 verb inl\]cction can possibly be interpreted as crossreferencing the sub.icct fnnetion, especially in Bulgarian where no relational case is realised on the dependent.
On the other band, pronominal elitics can cross-reference the direct and the indirect object in Bulgarian verb complex, cf.
\[Avg97a\], as well as the possessor relation in Bulgarian noun phrases, cf.
\[Avg97b\]. Therefore, the systematic relation of object cliticisation can be viewed as a more specific instance of cross-referencing.
In general, a nominal category representing a grammatical relation that is cross-referenced at the head selecting this nominal category need not be overtly realised.
So, the crossreferenced noun phrase controlling the agreement can typically be omitted.
In our view, the systematic relation of marking (Hierarchy 7) is an instance of juxtaposed selection, i.e. all endocentrie hypotaxis that is realised via juxtaposition.
We promote a faMy extensive understanding of this syntactic relation as involving various functional categories, including auxiliaries, particles, determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.
The notion of morphosyntactic marking is introduced in \[Avg97a\] for syntagmatic relations 30 holding in Bulgarian analyiic verb lbrms between the main verb as a syntactic (and semantic) head and the possibly nlultiplc auxiliary verbs ;is nlai+kers specifying it.
The agreement between the verb and its subject or conlplcmcnt is interpreted in our taxonotny as a selection real\]seal via asymmetric covariation (agreement 1).
It typically occurs in con\]bination with the relation of subcatcgorisation (of.
Table 1) which in languages mnploying relational case is realiscd as case assignment, while it\] those cn\]l+~loying cross-reforencing ;is a syntactic function identification.

Its most typical instance can be found where there is compatibility in person, number or gender between (possibly multiple) auxiliaries and a main verb.
Matching usually co-occut's with a 1nat+king rchition (cf.
Table 2) which, as shown in Hierarchy 7, is interpreted its a juxlaposcd selection.
Exocentric hypotaxis (modification) The exoccntric hypotaxis corresponds to the mtditional notion of modification.
It nnderlies specific morphosyntactic realities resulling from a crossclassification with combinatorial syntagmalic relation types (cf.
Hierarchy 8).
In all of then\], we are confronted with a +'elation of subordination in which, however, there is no indisputable prominent clcmenL It+ general we assume that there is no "case agreement".
Rather, the regular compatibility of case specifications between the itwolved syntaclic items is due to a modification relation realised in a governed environment.
Ix+ other words, we cat\] regard concordial case as a typical instance of a governed modification.
The asymmetric co-variation real\]sing a modification relation can be called concord, but let us refer to it for the sake of sitnplicity as ctgreement 2.
In the majority of Slavic languages, but obviously not in Bulgarian, this relation occurs in combination with concordial case (of.
Table 3).
Note that in our approach the treat+nun+ of nominal apposition would be parallel to that of the adjectivenoun relations.

Cross-classifying cxoccntric hypotaxis with symmetric co-vat\]alien results in what cat+ be called simile and is typically observed in comparative 31 constructions, provided appropriate categories are available.
This systematic relation differs fl'om that of parallelism (distinguished in Hierarehy 10) in being hypotactic in nature, and thus, an actual instance of modification.
Similarly to the asymmetric agreement 2 (concord), tim simile relation co-occurs with concordial case, cf.
ex. 6.
The systematic relation of (case) adjunction is an instance of juxtaI)osed mod(fication.

Also the secondaly predication (referring, typically, to the relation holding between a verb and a secondary controlled predicative) is a subtype of juxtaposed modification, with the predicative case adjunction as a more specific instance.
As to the relation holding between the secondary predicative and the subject or the object, it is an instance o1' control and presupposes coreference.
The latter two concepts realise an endoccntric parataxis and are introduced in Hierarchy 9.
Endocentric parataxis In the endoccntric parataxis there is a prominent item but no subordination relation.
This allows us to model concepts like co-reference, correlation, comarking (illustrated by ex.
6) and control as naturally resulting from a cross-classification with the combinatorial syntagmatic relation types.
If an endocentric parataxis is revealed by an asymmetric co-variation, this results in co-reference.
This systematic relation is tbund in relativisation (i.e.
between a nominal category and the relative pronoun introducing a relative clause that modifies this nominal category), in resumption (i.e.
between a nominal category and the pronominal element resuming it in a different syntactic domain), and in binding (i.e.
between a pronoun and its antecedent).
When, however, an endocentric parataxis is revealed in a symmetric co-variation, we can speak of correlation.
But in both instances of co-variation, we arc confronted with paMng indices (or restricted parameters) el' referential objects.
What we propose to distinguish as co-marking corresponds to endocentrie parataxis that is realised via juxtaposition.
So, it contrasts with the systematic relation of marking (presented in Hierarchy 7) only along the taxis dimension of structural syntagmatics inasmuch as there is no subordination relation between the involved syntactic items.
As to the systematic relation of syntactic control, it is registered in our taxenemy as an cndocentrie parataxis resulting in a for,n government.
In Bulgarian, it co-occurs with co-reference cx.

It is an exoeentric parataxis that is realised via government, with a special requirement that all involved syntactic items have the same governor.
In other words, these items are typically dependcnts of the same syntactic head.
What we call agreement 3 (or accord) corresponds to an exocentric paralaxis that is rcaliscd via asymmetric co-variation.
It regularly presupposes a co32 dependence relation (of.
Table 4), and its most typical instance can be fotmd as a COlnpatibility in number or gender between the subject and the predicative in copular constructions.
