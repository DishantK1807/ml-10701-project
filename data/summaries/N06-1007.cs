In (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) different types of semantic relations between verbs are discovered using surface patterns (like “X-ed by Y-ing” for enablement1, which would match “obtained by borrowing”, for example) and assessing the strength of asymmetric relations as mutual information between the two verbs.

Entity-based theories of discourse (e.g., (Grosz et al., 1995)) claim that a coherent text segment tends to focus on a specific entity.

In Question Answering, it has been used to establish that a certain sentence found in the corpus can serve as a suitable, albeit implicit answer to a query (Curtis et al., 2005), (Girju, 2003), (Moldovan and Rus, 2001).

We start by parsing the corpus with a dependency parser (we use Connexor’s FDG (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997)), treating every verb with its dependent constituents as a clause.

Adjacency of sentences has been previously used to model local coherence (Lapata, 2003).
P03-1069
This intuition has been formalized by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005), who developed an entity-based statistical representation of local discourse and showed its usefulness for estimating coherence between sentences.

Work The task of verb entailment acquisition appears to have much in common with that of paraphrase acquisition (Lin and Pantel, 2001), (Pang et al., 2003), (Szpektor et al., 2004).

Pattern-matching often imposes restrictions on the syntactic configurations in which the verbs can appear in the corpus: the patterns employed by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) and (Torisawa, 2003) derive pairs of only those verbs that have identical argument structures, and often only those that involve a subject and a direct object.

However, this approach is likely to pick only a particular kind of verb entailment, that of troponymy (such as 1In (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) enablement is defined to be a relation where one event often, but not necessarily always, gives rise to the other event, which coincides with our definition of entailment (see Section 3).
