It also has access to inflectional information which is vital for checking agreement and determining case for subsequent phases (see (Schiehlen, 2002) for a more thorough description).

For one, the task could be simplified by focusing on unlabelled dependency structure (measured in “unlabelled” precision and recall (Eisner, 1996; Lin, 1995)), which is, however, in general not sufficient for further semantic processing.

We used the Maximum Entropy approach5 (Berger et al., 1996) as a machine learner for this task.

These figures are more informative than overall Fscore (Preiss, 2003).

In the PARSEVAL evaluation scheme (Black et al., 1991), partially correct parses are gauged by the number of nodes they produce and have in common with the gold standard (measured in precision and recall).

The respective strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are brought to light in an in-depth evaluation on a treebank of German newspaper texts (Skut et al., 1997) containing ca.

The solution proposed in the literature (Black et al., 1991; Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998; Kübler and Telljohann, 2002) is to define a normal form for dependency structure, where every adjunct or argument attaches to some distinguished part of the verb complex.

Finite-State Parser In addition to the learning approach, we used a cascaded finite-state parser (Schiehlen, 2003), to extract dependency structures from the text.
