More details about the baseline system can be found in (Zens and Ney, 2004; Zens et al., 2005).

The model scaling factors Î»M1 are trained on a development corpus according to the final recognition quality measured by the word error rate (WER)(Och, 2003).

We rescore the ASR N-best lists with the standard HMM (Vogel et al., 1996) and IBM (Brown et al., 1993) MT models.

3. This approach has been suggested by (Papineni et al., 1997; Papineni et al., 1998) for a natural language understanding task, by (Beyerlein, 1998) for an ASR task, and by (Och and Ney, 2002) for an MT task.

A statistical prediction engine provides the completions to what a human translator types (Foster et al., 1997; Och et al., 2003).

The FSA implementation of the search allows us to use standard optimized algorithms, e.g. available from an open source toolkit (Kanthak and Ney, 2004).

In the post-editing step, a prediction engine helps to decrease the amount of human interaction (Och et al., 2003).
P03-1021
In (Brown et al., 1994), the authors proposed a method to integrate the IBM translation model 2 (Brown et al., 1993) with an ASR system.

For instance, the resulting word graph can be used in the prediction engine of a CAT system (Och et al., 2003).
