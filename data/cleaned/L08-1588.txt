Starting from a few Is-A extraction patterns widely used in information extraction literature (Hearst, 1992), this paper introduces a few precision-enhancing heuristics that take advantage of textual data available on the Web, by mining a collection of Web search queries and a collection of Web documents t</context>

For simplicity and robustness when applied to large amounts of Web text, the number of extraction patterns </context>
