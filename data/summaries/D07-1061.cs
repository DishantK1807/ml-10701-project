This is a smooth approximation to the high and low frequency stop lists used effectively by other measures such as (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).

More recently, measures incorporating information from Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006) have reported stronger results on some tasks than have been achieved by existing measures based on shallower lexical resources.

It is worth noting that in their experiments, (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) report that the Vector method has rank correlation coefficients of .91 and .90 for MC and RG, respectively, which are also top performing values.

Recent work has applied random walks to NLP tasks such as PP attachment (Toutanova et al., 2004), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2005; Tarau et al., 2005), and query expansion (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).
H05-1052
A variety of other measures of semantic relatedness have been proposed, including distributional similarity measures based on co-occurrence in a body of text— see (Weeds and Weir, 2005) for a survey.

We define the Zero-KL divergence with respect to 2In Lee’s (1999) original presentation, skew divergence is defined not as sα(p,q) but rather as sα(q,p).
P99-1004
This requires part-of-speech tagging the glosses, for which we use the Stanford maximum entropy tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
N03-1033
We used the WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004) to compute baseline scores for several existing measures, noting that one word pair was not processed in WS-353 because one of the words was missing from WordNet.
N04-3012
Othermeasureshavebeenproposedthatutilizethetext in WordNet’s definitional glosses, such as Extended Lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) and later the Gloss Vectors (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) method.
W06-2501
These measures and others are surveyed in (Lee, 2001), who finds that Jensen-Shannon is outperformed by the Skew divergence measure introduced by Lee in (1999).
P99-1004
This model incorporates much of the same information as the gloss-based WordNet measures (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003; Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) but differs in that it considers many more glosses than just those in the immediate neighborhoods of the candidate words.
