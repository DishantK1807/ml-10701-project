Since the space of different combinations is too large to be searched exhaustively, we use a guided search procedure based on Genetic Algorithms (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2004), which optimizes the FLM structure with respect to the desired criterion.

For the factored language models, a feature-based word representation was obtained by tagging the text with Rathnaparkiâ€™s maximum-entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and by stemming words using the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980).

Language Models A factored language model (FLM) (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) is based on a representation of words as feature vectors and can utilize a variety of additional information sources in addition to words, such as part-of-speech (POS) information, morphological information, or semantic features, in a unified and principled framework.
