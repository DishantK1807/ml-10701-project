P. Edmundson University of California, Los Angeles i.
Introduction i.i.Background This work is a continuation of research reported in the paper Mathematical Models of S~non~, which was presented at the 1965 International Conference on Computational Linguistics.
That paper presented a historical summary of the concepts of synonymy and antonyms.
It was noted that since the first book on English synoDS, which appeared in the second half of the lath century, dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms have varied according to the particular explicit definitions of "synonym" and "antonym" that were used.
The roles of part-of-speech, context of a word, and substitutability in the same context were discussed.
Traditionally, synonymy has been regarded as a binary relation between two words.
Graphs of these binary relations were drawn for several sets of words based on Webster's Dictionary of S~non~ms and matrices for these graphs were exhibited as an equivalent representation.
These empirical results showed that the concepts of synonymy and entonymy required the use of ternary relations between two words in a specified sense rather than simply a binary relation between two words.
The synonymy relation was then defined implicitly, rather than explicitly, by three axiams stating the properties of being reflexive, symmetriC, and t/~ansitive.
The entonym¥ relation was also defined by three axioms stating the properties of being irreflexive, symmetric, and antit/~ansit~ve (the last term was coined for that study).
It was noted that thes~ six axioms could be expressed in the calculus of relations and that this relation algebra could be used to produce shorter proofs of t~eorems.
However, no proofs were given.
In addition, several gec~aet~ical and topological models of synonymy and antonymy '..J~ were posed and eexamined.,~ It was nOted that certain of these models were of more theoretical than practical interest.
Each model was seen to be simple in that it" could be expressed from mathematically elementary concepts, end each stressed certain aspects of the linguistic object being modeled at the expense of others.
However, there seemed to be little theoreti~al preference among them.
Their adequacy as models could be measured by their generality and predictive power.
In terms of these criteria the algebraic model, whether expressed in terms of relations, graphs, or matrices, seamed to have the most usefulness.
In part, this was due to the fact that one geametrical model, although highly suggestive, did not include a precise specification of the origin, axes, or coordinates for words in an n-dimensional space.
Similarly, one topological model required a closure operation for each of the intensions or senses and had no linguistically interesting interpretation.
1 1.2 Summary The present paper investigates more thoroughly the characterizations of synonymy and antonymy initiated in Edmundson (1965).
In section 2, synonymy and antonymy are defined jointly and implicitly by a set of axioms rather than separately as before.
First, it is noted that the original six axioms are insufficient• to permit the proofs of certain theorems whose truth is strongly suggested by intuitive notions about synonyms and antonyms.
In addition, it is discovered that certain fundamental assumptions about synonymy and antonymy must be made explicit as axioms.
Some of these have to do with specifying the domain and range of the synonymy and antonymy relations.
This is related to questions about whether function words, which linguistically belong to closed classes, should have synonyms and antonyms and whether content words, which linguistically belong to open classes, must have synonyms and antonyms.
Several fundamental theorems of this axiom system are stated andproved.
The informal interpretation of many of these theorems are intuitively satisfying.
For example, it is proved that any even power of the antonymy relation is the synonymy relation, while any odd power is the antonymy relation.
\ In section 3, topological characterizations are posed and examined.
A neighborhood topology is introduced by defining the neighborhood of a word.
It is proved that this definition satisfies four neighborhood axioms.
Also, a closure topology is introduced by defining the closure of a set of words.
It is proved that this definition satisfies the four closure axioms.
2. Algebraic Characterization 2.1.
Introduction Relations Before investigating antonymy and synonymy, we will estsblish some notions and notations for the calculus of binary relations.
Consider a set V of arbitrary elmnen~s, which will be called the universal set.
A binary relation on V is defined as a set R of ordered pairs <x,p, where x,y s V.
The proposition that x stands in relation R toy will be denoted by xRy.
The dcmain~Y(R), range ~(R), and field ~ (F) of relation R are, respectively, defined by the sets \[x:(~y)(xRy)\] ; (y:(~Lx)(xRy)} ; \[x:(~y)(xRy)} U (y:(~x)(xRy)\] The complement, union, intersection, and converse relstions are defined by x~y = -.x~ ; x(RUS)y x~vxSy ; x(RnS)y " x~x~; xR'ly -yRx The identity relation I and null relation ~ are defined by xIy ~ x=y ; ~y (x~x),V~(y~y) The product.and power relations are defined by xRISy = (.~z)\[xRz ^zSy\] ; R n =RIR n'l n~ 1 Inclusion and equality of relations are defined by RC S =xRy ==> xSy ; R = S m R c SA S c R Later we will use the following elementary theorems which are stated here without proof: Theorem: R g S ==> R "I c_ S "I m -Theorem: R c S ~> S c R Theorem: (R'I) "I = R Theorem: (RIS)IT : RI(SIT ) Theorem: (RIS) "I = S'IIR "I Theorem: IIR = RII = R Theorem: s -r => RIs=RIT ^ SIR=TIR 2.2 Axioms and Definitions Under the assumption that synonymy and antonymy are ternary relations on the set C of all content words, the following definitions will be used: xSiY = word x is a synonym of word y with respect to the intension i (or word x is synonymous in sense i to word y) xAiY -= word x is an antonym of word y with respect to the intension i (or word x is antonymous in sense i to word y) We will assume that the synonymy and antonymy relations are defined Jointly and implicitly bythe following set of axioms rather than separately as in Edmundson (1965).
Axiom 1 (Reflexive) : (Vx)\[xSix\] Axium 2 (Symmetric): (Vx)(Vy)\[xSiY => xS;Iy\] Axium 3 (Transitive): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xSiY A YSiZ :> Axi~n 4 (Irreflexive) : (Vx) \[x~ix\] Axiun 5 (Symmetric): (Vx)(Vy)\[xAiY => xA;ly\] Axi~n 6 (Antitransitive): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xAiY A YAiZ Aximm 7 (Right-identity): (Vx)(Vy)(Vz)\[xAiY A YSiZ Axiom 8 (Nonempty) : (Vy) (:~x) \[xAiY\] xSiz\] ~> xSiz\] ~> xAiz\] The properties named in Axiams 6 and 7 were coined for this study.
The above eight axioms may be as follows: Axicm I (Reflexive) : Axiom 2 (Symmetric): Axiom 3 (Transitive) : Axicm 4 (Irreflexive) : Axiom 5 (Symmetric) : Axiem 6 (Antitransitive) : Axiom 7 (Right-identity) : Axiom 8 (Nonempty) : expressed in the calculus of relations I~Si sl =si 1 ~i = S i Ai c_ A; 1 ' Ai I Si c_ Ai (Vy)\[A(y) ~ ~\] where A(y) = {<x,y> : x E~(A)} 3 This relation algebra will be used to produce shorter proofs, although this is not necessary.
The consistency of this set of aximms is shown by exhibiting a model for them; their independence will not be treated.
In addition to the synonymy and antonymy relations it will be useful to introduce the following classes that are the images of these relations.
The synonym class of a word y is defined by si(Y ) '= \[x : xSiY\] which may be extended to an arbitrary set E of words by si(E) ={x : (.~y)\[y ~ ~.
^ xSiY\]\] Similarly, the antonym class of a word y is defined by ai(Y) --{x : xAiy\] which may be extended to a set E of words by ai(E ) m {x : (~y)\[y e E A xAiY\]\] 2 • 3 Theorems For ressons of notational simplicity, the subscript denoting the intenslon i will be omitted in the sequel whenever possible.
However, the theorems must be understood as if the subscript were present.
As with any symmetric relation, it is possible to get stronger results than Axi~ 2 and Axiom 5.
Theorem: S "1 = S Proof: 1 S c S-1 by Axiom 2.
Hence S "1 c_ (S-1)-I = S.
Therefore S" = S_by definitiQn of equality.
Theorem~ A "I = A Proof: Same as above theorem using Axi~n 5.
Also we get a stringer result than the transitivity property of AxiQm 3: Theor .em: ~ S Proof.
~ c_ S by Axiom 3.
Hence S = SII c_ SIS = ~ by Axiom 1.
Therefore S 2 = S by definitio~ of equality.
In fact, by induction we have the generalization: Proof, 8n= .1 s (sl~ "2) ....
= sl(sl(sl"'Is)'") =s.
It can be shown that anton¥~ and sync~n~ are distinct: A ~ S.
In fact we have the stronger result: Theorem: A ~Proof: Assume A ~ 7.
Hence A n S ~ ¢ or (~x)(~M)\[x(A 0 S)y\].
Then x~7 ^ xSy implies xAy ^ ySx by Axicm 2.
So xAx, which contradicts x~x by Axi~ 4: I ~ ~.
Therefore A c_ ~.
because of Axiom 8, can we get a stronger result than the antitransitivity p~oplFty of Axiom 6.
Theorem: A = S O~I ::.,A~-.AI S bYl~imm 7.
Hence.A 2 = AIA ~-AI(AIS ) = A'II(AI s) = " IA)IS s~ce A" = A.
Now (Vy)(~x)\[xAy\] by Axiom 8.
So (_vy)(~)E~AI~ ^ ~Ay\]~ by ~i~ 5.
H~ce (Vy)E~Iy --> ~A-11~l.
z nus I c_ A" IA.
So A ~ ~__ I IS = S.
Therefore A "~ = S since A2 ~ S byAxium 6 and S G A 2.
The right-identity property of Aximm 7 can be strengthened to: Theorem: AIS -A Proof: AIS u A byAxinm 7.
NowA =AII U AIS since I u S.
Therefore A I S A by definition of equality, As a corollary we get that S and A ccexnute : Corollary.
AIS = SIA Proof: AIS --A = A "A = (AIS) "l = (A'lls'l) "l -SIA From the above two theorems it follows that: Theorem: SIA = A Proof: S~A =A IS =A.
As a special case we ~et: Theorem: A 3 =AIA =AIS =A.
In fact, we have the generalization: S if n even Theorem: An = A if n odd Proof: For n even, A n = A 2k = (A2) k = ~ = S.
For n odd, A n = A 2k+l = AI (A2) k = AtS = A.
Next, several theorems about synonym classes and antonym classes will he stated and proved.
First, the synonym class of a word is not empty: Theorem: s(y) ~ ¢ Proof: NOW I c S by Axiom 1.
So (Vy)\[ySy\].
Hence (.~x)\[xSy\].
Therefore, s(y) ~ ~.
Because S is a symmetric relation, we have: Theorem: y e s(x) <~> x e s(y) Proof: y e s(x) <-----> ySx <-----> yS'ix <----> xSy <-----> x e s(y).
Since S is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, S is by definition an equivalence relation on theset C of all content words.
Hence, we have the important result: Theorem: xSy <-----> s(x) = s(y) Proof: (------->) Assume xSy.
First let u G s(x).
Then uSx ^ xSy ------> uS2y -------> uSy -------> u • s(y).
Hence s(x)c_ s(y).
Also s(y) c_ s(x) by a similar argument.
Therefore s(x) = s(y).
(<==) Assume s(x) = s(y).
Then u e S(X) -~-> U • s(y).
SO uSx -------> uSy.
Hence xSu ^ uSy ~-> xS~y ==> xSy.
Therefore xSy.
In fact, we have the stronger result: Theorem: s(x) N s(y) = .~" s(x) if xSy L ¢ if -sy Hence for a given intension i the equivalence relation S i partitions the set C of all content words into subsets that are disjoint (i.e., the subsets have no word in common) and exhaustive (i.e., every word is in some subset): Theorem: C =~ ) si(x) x~ Second, the antonym class of a word is not empty: Theorem: a(y) ~ Proof: A~ 8: (vy)(~x)tx~1 ~p~es a(y) ~ ~.
Note that a word does not belong to its antonym class: Theorem: y ~ a(y).
Proof: Assume y e a(y) so that yAy.
But this contradicts Axiom 4: yIy ~ yXy.
Therefore y ~a(y).
Next we will establish some relations between synoc~ym classes and anton~a classes.
Theorem: xA~ ~ ~(x) = s(y) Proof: (==>) Assume x e a(y).
First let u e a(x).
~owue a(x)AxAy ~ uAx^xAy ~ uA2y ~ u~ ~-~ u ¢ sCY).
Hence aCx) g s(y).
Also sCy) c_ a(x) by a similar argmnent.
Therefore a(x) = s(y).
(~) Assume a(x) = s(y).
But y • s(y) = a(x).
Hence yAx.
Therefore xAy by Axicm 5.
In fact, we get the following necessary and sufficient condition for equality: Theorem: a(x) = a(y) <==~ s(x) = s(y) Proof: (~--~) Assume aCx) = a(y).
Now a(x) rl a(y) ~_~ z (~z)\[z~ ^ ~,v\] ~-~ (~z)\[xAz ^ zAy\] ~ xA-y ~ xSy.
Therefore s(x) = s(y) by a previous theorem.
(<~) Ass~e s(x) = s(y).
Then xSy.
First, let u • a(x).
Then uAx.
Hence uAx A XSy ~ uAISy ~ u~y ==~ U • a(y).
Therefore a(x)g a(y).
Also a(y) g a(x) by an identical argument.
Therefore a(x) = a(y).
2.4 Comments
on the Algebraic Characterization Even though s(y) # ~ since ySy by Axinm i, it may be necesssry to add the following axiom: Axiom 9: (Vy)C~x)Kx ~ y ^ x~\] to guarantee that the domain of the relation S is not trivial, i.e., s(y)-Cy\] ~¢ Axiom 9 is not necessary if s(y) is permitted to be a unit set for certain words.
Thus, we might define s(y) = (y) for any function word y, e.g., s(and) = (and).
But this will not work for antonymy since a(y) might be considered empty for certain words such as function words, e.g., a(and) = ~.
The alternative of defining a(y) = ~ is not reasonable since it produces more problems than it solves.
Axiom 8: (Vy)(~x)\[xAy\] is reasonable if the contraries _of words (e.g., nonuse, impossible, etc).
are permitted, i.e., y e ~(y).
6 The
theorems = S, A 2 = S, AIS =A, SIA =A can he summarized in the following multiplication table for products of the relations S and A S A A which is isumorphic to the table for addition modulo 2 0 1 1 Note, even without Axicms i-8, for (1) A 2 = S, (2) A S =A, (3) A\[S = A that 41) and 42) £mp~ 43), (i) and 43) ~P~v 42), but (Z) and (S) do not i~ (1).
Suppose that for every pair <x,y> Of words in the vocabulary V of a language exactly one of the following ternary relations holds : (1) x and y are synonymous, xSy 2) x and y are antonymous, xAy 3) neither (1) nor 42), xMy This can be expressed by (Vx)(Vy)\[x,~ e v----->xs~Vx~vvx~\] which is an exclusive disjunction.
Thus the vocabulary V is partitioned as follows: V = s(y) U a(y) U m(y) This also can be pictured in the lattice of for every word y.
relations U=V~V It can be shown that the multiplication table for products of the relaticms S,A, and M is S A M S S A M A A S M M M M M 2 7 3.
Topological Characterizations 3.1.
Introduction We will now examine two topological models of synonymy.
Being topological, they concern "semantic spaces" of words without any notion of "semantic distance" between two words.
Again, we will restrict our attention to content words.
Topological models for the antonymy relation will not be considered.
3-2. Neighborhood Topology The first model considers a neighborhood topology, i.e., a topology based on neighborhoods.
A set is said to have a neighborhood topology if there exist elements x called ~ and sets N x called neighborhoods of x Which satisfy the following axlcms: Axiom l: (Vx)(~Nx)\[X e N x\] ~ian 2: (v~ x) (vN x).c.~N''~x.
\[~x ~ ~x n N x\] Axiom 3: (vy)CVSx)CZs~,)\[y ~ s x ~> ~y ~ ~1 Axiom ~: (Vx)(Vy)(~x) (aNy) Ix ~ y ------> Nx n Ny -~\] These axioms can be pictured informally by the following Euler N x N~ N x Nx Ny Define a neighborhood n~(x) of a word x as any subset of the synonym class si(x) o~ x that cSntalns x, i.e., X e ni(x ) ~ si(x ) Wain, forreasons of notational simplicity, the subscript denoting the intension i will be emitted whenever possible.
First, neighborhood Axiom 1 is satisfied.
Theorem: (Vx)(an(x))\[x z n(x)\] Proof: By definition s(x) is a neighborhood n(x) of x c oalt aining x.
Second, neighborhood Axiom 2 is satisfied.
Theorem: (Vn(x))(Vn'(x))(~n"(x))\[n"(x) c n(x) n n'(x)\] Proof: For arbitary n~x) and n'(x), let n"(x) = n(x) N n'(x).
Then n"(x) ~ s(x) since n"(x) = n(x) n n' (x) c s(x) N s(x) s(x).
Also, x e n"(x) since x ¢ n(x) ^ x e n'(x) imply x e n(x) n n'(x) = n"(x).
Therefore, (Vn(x))(Vn'(x))(~n"(x))~"(x) ~ n(X) n n'(x)\].
Third, neighborhood Axiom 3 is satisfied.
Theorem: (Vy)(Vn(x))(~n(y))\[y e n(x) ==> n(y) c_ n(x)\] Proof: For arbitrary y e n(x), let n(y) = n(x).
But y e n(x) implies s(x) = s(y) since y e n(x) c_ s(x) = {z : zSx\] implies ySx and ySx implies s(y) = s(x)° Then n(y) c_ s(y) since n(y) = n(x) c_ s(x) = s(y).
Also y e n(y) since y e n(x) = n(y).
Therefore, (vy)Cvn(x))Czn(y))\[y ~ n(x) ~ n(y) ~nCx)\].
In fact, the neighborhood topology satisfies Axiom 4, which is a separation axiom: TheorT: (Vx)(Yy)(~n(x))(~n(y))\[x ~ y => n(x) n n(y) = ~\] Proof.
Assume x ~ y.
Let nCx) = (x} and n(y) = {y}.
Then x e n(x) ~ s(x) and y e n(y) ~ s(y).
Thus n(x) n n(y) = {x} n (y} = ~ since x ~ y.
Therefore, with respect to synonymy, words have a neighborhood topology since (1) (Vx)CZn(x))\[x • n(x)\] (Vy)(~n(y))\[y e n(x) ~ n(y) ~ n(x)\] .(Vx)(Vy)(~n(x))(~n(y))\[x ~ y ~ n(x) N n(y) = ~\] 3.3.
Closure Topology The second model considers a closure topology, i.e., a topology based on a closure operation.
A set is said to have a closure topology if there exists a unary operation on its subsets, denoted by~ and called the closure, which satisfies the following axiums: Axiom 2: E c_ E Axiom 3: E c E ~i~ ~: .~'O-'f =~'u ~" Define the closure of a set E of words as the synonym class of E, i.e., The closure axiums can be shown to be satisfied by using the original definition of synonym class sCE) z {x : (~y)\[yeE^xsy\]} However, shorter proofs are possible by noting that the synonym class of a set E of words can be expressed as s(E) = y e E s(y) = E (X : xSy} First, closure Axicm 1 i~ satisfied: Theorem: s(g) = Proof: s(~) = sCy) = ¢ Second, closure Axium 2 is satisfied: Theorem: E =s(E) oof.
= ..Uo ryj I = E since y • s(y) -~> Third, closure Axi~n 3 is satisfied: Theorem: s\[s(E)\] c s(E) ~oof: N~s(s(y))=sCtu:u~1)=tv:v~y\]~ {v:v~\] = s(y) since ~ c_ S.
Thus sis(E)\] = U s(x) x ~ sCE) U x U(.(x) U.(,) yeE y) y~E yeE Fourth, closure Axiom ~ is satisfied: The=am: sCE u F) = sCE) u sCF) ~oof: sCE u F) = ~J s(y) y~-E UF s(E) U S(F).
i a = l~J sCx) : x e U s(y) ~E = sCE) -U s(y) u s(y) = yeE yEF Therefore, with respect to synonyay, words have a closure topology since (1) s(¢) = C2) E ~sCE) (B) s\[sCE}l ~ s(E) (~) sCE U F) = sCE) U sCF) Note that fram Axioms 2 and 3 we get Theorem: s\[sCE)\] = sCE) 3.~.
Ca~nents on Topological Characterizations Note that for the neighborhood topology a separation sxicm has been added to the t~ree axioms proposed in Edmundson C1~5).
Also, the neighborhood topology seems more intuitively satisfying than the closure topology.
However, for the closure topology if we define the derived set of a set E of words as the set of all words that ~are synonymous to some word of E, but not identical to that Worde i.e.. then we have the followi~ result: Theorem: s(E) = E U g' which may be given a reasoQahle linguistic interpretation.
An example is {y}' = s(y) {y} which was discussed in the sectio~ on algebraic characterization.
4. Conc~sions These results support the belief that the algebraic characterization is insightful and appropriate.
For example, the assumption that synonymy is an equivalence relation also has been made, either directly or indirectly, by F.
Kiefer and S.
Abraham (1965), U.
Weinreich (1966), and others.
Since the axiom system defines the notions of synonymy and anton~ Jointly and implicitly, it avoids certain difficulties that are encountered when attempts are made to define these notions separately and explicitly.
iO These topological characterizations provide a no,metric representation of what has been called informally a "semantic space".
Previous attempts to construct a semantic space that is metric (i.e., one for which a distance function is defined) have not met with much success.
The consideration of general topological spaces avoids this difficulty.
