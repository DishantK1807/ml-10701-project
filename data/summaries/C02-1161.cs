Like Harabagiu et al.(2001), we use WordNet to propose synonyms for the words in a query.

Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Lytinen et al.(2000) used a machine readable thesaurus, specifically WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), to obtain the sense of a word, while Sch¨utze and Pedersen (1995) and Lin (1998) used automatically constructed thesauri.

These results generally concur with the observations in (Sanderson, 1994; Gonzalo et al., 1998).

However, experimental results reported in (Sanderson, 1994; Gonzalo et al., 1998) indicate that the improvement in IR performance due to WSD is restricted to short queries, and that IR performance is very sensitive to disambiguation errors.
W98-0705
Two common techniques for query expansion are blind relevance feedback (Buckley et al., 1995; Mitra et al., 1998) and word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 1999; Lytinen et al., 2000; Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1995; Lin, 1998).

a0 Tagging accuracy – manually-corrected tagging versus automatic PoS tagging (Brill, 1992), which tagged correctly 84% of the queries.
A92-1021
Syntactic information for each query was obtained from Brill’s part-of-speech (PoS) tagger (Brill, 1992).
