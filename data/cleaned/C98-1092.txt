Abstract 
This paper describes novel results on the char
actcristics of three-party dialogues by quantita
tively comparing them with those of two-party. 
In previous dialogue research, two-party dia
logues are mainly focussed because data col
lection of multi-party dialogues is difficult and 
there are very few theories handling them, al
though research on multi-party dialogues is ex
pected to be of much use in building computer 
supported collaborative work environments and 
computer assisted instruction systems, in this 
paper, firstly we describe our data collection 
method of multi-party dialogues using a meet
ing scheduling task, which enables us to com
pare three-party dialogues with those of two 
party. Then we quantitively compare these 
two kinds of dialogues su('h as the number of 
characters and turns and patterns of inforlna
tion exchanges. Lastly we show that patterns 
of information exchanges in speaker alternation 
and initiative-taking can be used to characterise 
three-party dialogues. 
1 Introduction

Previous research on dialogue has t)een mostly 
tbcussing on two-party human-human dialogue 
for developing practical human-comt)uter dia
logue systems. However, our everyday commu
nicative activities involves not only two-party 
communicative situations but also those of more 
than two-party (we call this multi-party). For 
example, it is not uImsual for us to chitchat with 
more than one ti'iend, or business meetings are 
usually held among more than two participants. 
Recently advances of computer and network
ing technologies enable us to examine the possi
bility of using computers to assist effective com
munication in business meetings. As well as 
this line of computer assisted communication 
research, autonomous programs called 'agents', 
which enable users to effectively use comput
ers for solving problems, have been extensively 
studied. In this research trend, 'agent' is sup
posed to be distributed among comt)uters, and 
how they coot)crate for problem solving is one 
of the most important research topics. Pre
vious studies on two party dialogue can be of 
some use to the above important computer re
lated communication research, but research on 
multi-party interaction can contribute more di
rectly to the advances of the above research. 
Furthermore, research on multi-party dialogue 
is expected to make us understand the nature. 
of hunmn communication in coml)ination with 
the previous and ongoing research on two-party 
dialogue. 
The purl)ose of this paper is to quantitively 
show the characteristics of multi-party dia
logues in comparison with those of two-party 
using actual dialogue data. In Cxl)loring the 
characteristics of nmlti-party dialogues to those 
of two-party, we will concentrate on the follow
ing prot)lems. 
What patterns of information ex
changes do conversational partici
pants form? When abstracting tile types 
of speech acts, in two-party dialogues, the 
pattern of information exchanges is that 
the first and second speakers alternately 
contrit)utc (A-B-A-B ...). But in multi
party dialogues, for example, in three-party 
dialogues, dialogue does not seem to pro
teed ms A-B-C-A-B-C ..., since this pat
tern seems to bc too inefficient if B tells C 
what B are told by A, which C will be told 
the same content twice, and too efficient 
and strict if A, B and C always initiate new 
topics in this order, in which they have no 
583 
occasions for checking one's understanding. 
How do conversational participants 
take initiative? In business meetings, 
most of which are of multi-party, chairper
sons usually control the flow of informa
tion for effective and efficient discussions. 
Are there any differences between in multi
and two-party dialogues? For example, are 
there any possibilities if in multi-party di
alogues the role of chairpersons emerges 
from the nature of the dialogues? 
These are not only problems in exploring 
multi-party dialogues. For example, we do 
not know how conversational participants take 
turns (when do they start to talk)? Or how 
and when do conversational participants form 
small subgroups? However, the two problems 
we will tackle here are very important issues to 
building computer systems in that they directly 
relates to topic management in dialogue pro
cessing, which is necessary to correctly process 
anaphora/ellipsis and effective dialogue control. 
In the following, firstly, previous research on 
multi-party dialogues is surveyed. Secondly, our 
task domain, data collection method, and ba
sic statistics of the collected data are explained. 
Thirdly, our dialogue coding scheme, coding re
sults and the resultant patterns of information 
exchanges for twoand multi-party dialogues 
are shown. Lastly, the patterns of initiative tak
ing behaviour are discussed. 
2 Related
Studies 
Sugito and Sawaki (1979) analysed three nat
urally occurring dialogues to characterise lan
guage behaviour of Japanese in shopping situ
ations between a shop assistant and two cus
tomers. They relate various characteristics of 
their dialogue data such as the number of ut
terances, the types of information exchanges 
and patterns of initiative taking to the stages 
or phases of shopping like opening, discussions 
between customers, clarification by a customer 
with a shop assistant and closing. 
Novick and Ward (1993) proposed a compu
tational model to track belief changes of a pilot 
and an air traffic controller in air traffic control 
(ATC) communication. ATC might be called 
multi-party dialogue in terms of the number of 
conversational participants. An air traffic con
troller exchanges messages with multiple pilots. 
But this is a rather special case for multi-party 
dialogues in that all of ATC communication 
consists of two-party dialogues between a pilot 
and an air traffic controller. 
Novick et al. (1996) extended 'contribution 
graph' and how mutual belief is constructed 
for multi-party dialogues, which was proposed 
by Clark (1992). They used their extension to 
analyse an excerpt of a conversation between 
Nixon and his brain trust involving the Water
gate scandal. Clark's contribution graph can be 
thought of as a reformulation of adjacency pairs 
and insertion sequences in conversation analy
sis from the viewpoint that how mutual belief is 
constructed, and are devoted to the analysis of 
two-party dialogues. They proposed to include 
reactions of non-intended listeners as evidence 
for constructing mutual belief and modify the 
notation of the contribution graph. 
Schegloff (1996) pointed out three research 
topics of multi-party dialogue from the view
point of conversation analysis. The first topic 
involves recipient design. A speaker builds ref
erential expressions for the intended listener to 
be easily understood, which is related to next 
speaker selection. The second concerns reason
ing by non-intended listeners. When a speaker 
praises some conversational participant, the re
maining participants can make inferences that 
the speaker criticises what they do not do or 
behave like the praised participant. The third 
is schism, which can be often seen in some par
ties or teaching classes. For example, when a 
speaker continue to talk an uninteresting story 
for hours, party attendees split to start to talk 
neighbours locally. 
Eggins and Slade (1997) analysed naturally
occurring dialogues using systemic grammar 
framework to characterise various aspects of 
communication such as how attitude is encoded 
in dialogues, how people negotiate with, and 
support for and confront against others, and 
how people establish group membership. 
By and large, on multi-party dialogues, there 
are very few studies in computational linguis
tics and there are several or more researches on 
multi-party dialogue, which analyse only their 
example dialogues in discourse analysis. But as 
far as we know, there is no research on quanti
tatively comparing the characteristics of multi
584 
party dialogues with those of two-party. Re
search topics enumerated for conversation anal
ysis are also of interest to computational lin
guistic research, but obviously we cannot han
dle all the problems of multi-party dialogues 
here. This paper will concentrate on the pat
terns of information exchanges and initiative 
taking, which are among issues directly related 
to computer modelling of multi-party dialogues. 
3 Data
Collection and Basic 
Statistics 
For the purpose of developing distritmted au
tonomous agents working for assisting users 
with problem solving, we planned and collected 
twoand three-party dialogues using the task 
of scheduling meetings. We tried to set; up the 
same problem solving situations for both types 
of dialogues such as participants' goals, knowl
edge, gender, age and background education. 
Our goal is to develop computational applica
tions where agents with equal status solve users' 
problems by exchanging messages, which is the 
reason why he did not collect dialogue data 
between between different status like expert
novice and teacher-pupils. 
The experiments were conducted in such a 
way that for one task, the subjects are given 
a list of goals (meetings to be scheduled) and 
some pieces of information about meeting rooms 
and equipments like overhead projectors, and 
are instructed to make a meeting schedule for 
satisfying as many participants' constraints as 
possible. The data were collected by assigning 
3 different problems or task settings to 12 par
ties, which consist of either two or three sub
jects, which amounts to 72 dialogues in total. 
The following conditions were carefidly set up 
to make dialogue subjects as equal as possible. 
• Both twoand three-party subjects were 
constrained to be of the same gender. The 
same number of dialogues (36 dialogues) 
were collected for female and mah; groups. 
• The average ages of female and male sub
jects are 21.0 (S.D. 1.6) and 20.8 (S.D. 2.1) 
years old. All participants are either a uni
versity student or a graduate. 
• Subjects were given the same number of 
goals and information (needless to say,

In these experiinents, dialogues among the 
subjects were recorded on DAT recorders in 
non-face-to-face condition, which excludes tile 
effects of non-linguistic behaviour. The aver
age length of all collected dialogues is 473.5 sec
onds (approximately 7.9 minutes) and the total 
amounts to 34094 seconds (approximately 9.5 
hours). 
There are dialogues in which participants 
mistakenly finished before they did not satisfy 
all possible constraints. It is very rare that one 
party (lid this sort of mistakes for all three task 
settings assigned to them, however in order to 
eliminate unknown effects, we exclude all three 
dialogues if they made mistakes in at least one 
task setting. For this reason, we limit the target 
of our analysis to 18 dialogues each for twoand 
three-party dialogues which do not have such 
kind of problem (the average length of the tar
get dialogues is 494.2 seconds (N)proximately 
8.2 minutes). 
'Fable 1 shows the number of hiragana char
acters ~ and turns for each speakers, and its 
total tbr twoand three-party dialogues. It il
lustrates that the total number of characters 
and turns of three-party dialogues are ahnost 
the same as those of two-party, which indicates

assess how much speakers talk. One hiragana character 
approximately corresponds to one mora, which has been 
used as a plmnetie unit in Japanese.

the experimental setup worked as intended be
tween twoand three-party dialogues. Table 2 
shows ANOVA of the number of hiragana char
acters and turns calculated separately for dif
ferent task settings to examine whether there 
are differences of the number of characters and 
turns between speakers. The results indicates 
that there are statistically no differences at .05 
level to the number of characters and turns for 
different speakers both in twoand three-party 
dialogues except for one task setting as to the 
number of turns in three-party dialogues. But 
this are statistically no differences at .01 level. 
For the experimental setup, we can understand 
that our setup generally worked as intended. 
4 Patterns
of Information Exchanges 
4.1 Dialogue
Coding 
To examine patterns of information exchanges 
and initiative taking, we classify utterances 
from the viewpoint of initiation-response and 
speech act types. This classification is a 
modification of the DAMSL coding scheme, 
which comes out of the standardisation work
shop on discourse coding scheme (Carletta et 
al., 1997b), and a coding scheme proposed by 
Japanese standardisation working group on dis
course coding scheme(Ichikawa et al., 1998) 
adapted to the characteristics of this meeting 
scheduling task and Japanese. We used two 
coders to classify utterances in the above 36 
dialogues and obtained 70% rough agreement 
and 55% kappa agreement value. Even in the 
above discourse coding standardisation groups, 
they are not at the stage where which agreement 
value range coding results need to be reliable. 
In content analysis, they require a kappa value 
over 0.67 for deriving a tentative conclusion, 
but in a guideline of medical science, a kappa 
value 0.41 < n < 0.60 are judged to be mod
erate (Carletta et al., 1997a; Landis and Koch, 
1977; Krippendorff, 1980). To make the anal
ysis of our dialogue data robust, we analysed 
both coded dialogues, and obtained similar re
sults. As space is limited, instead of discussing 
both results, we discuss one result in the fol
lowing. From the aspect of initiation-response, 
utterances are examined if they fall into the cat
egory of response, which is judged by checking 
if they can discern cohesive relations between 
the current and corresponding utterances if ex

ist. The corresponding utterances nmst be ones 
which are either just before the current or some 
utterances before the current in the case of em
bedding, or insertion sequences. If the current 
utterance is not judged as response, then it falls 
into the category of initiation. 
From speech act types, as in Table 3, utter
ances are classified into five types each for ini
tiating and responding, two of which are used 
for both initiating and responding. Bar ('-') in
serted categories show adaptation to our task 
domain and Japanese. For example, in this task 
domain, expressions of 'want' for using some 
meeting room are hard to be distinguished fi'om 
those of 'proposal' in Japanese, and thus these 
two categories are combined into one category 
'want-proposal'. 
4.2 Patterns
of act sequences by 
speakers 
Table 5 shows the frequency ratio as to the 
length of act sequences represented by different 
speakers in twoand three-party dialogues. The 
act sequences are defined to start from a newly 
initiating utterance to the one before next newly 
initiating utterance. Let us examine an excerpt 
in Table 4 from our dialogue data, where the 
first column shows a tentative number of utter
ances, the second is a speaker, the third is an ut
terance type, and the fourth is English transla
tion of an utterance. In this example, there are 
two types of act sequences from the first to the 
fifth utterance (E-S-E-S-E) and from the sixth 
to the seventh (S-H). Our purpose here is to ex
amine how many of the act sequences consists 
of two participants' interaction in three-party 
dialogues. Hence we abstract a speakers' name 
with the position in a sequence. The speaker in 
586 
f 2acts 3acts 4acts 5acts 6acts 
2-p 54.2 21.6 11.8 5.3 2.1 
3-p 45.1 26.0 12.2 5.4 2.4 
Table 5: Frequency ratio (%) for the number of 
act sequences in twoand three-party dialogues 
the first turn is named A, and the one in the 
second and third turn are named B and C, re
spectively. 
In both twoand three-party dialogues, the 
most frequent length of act sequences is that of 
two speakers. The frequencies decrease as the 
hmgth of act sequences increases. In two-party 
dialogues, speaker sequences concern only their 
length, since there are two speakers to be alter
nate while in three-party dialogues, more titan 
two length of sequences take various patterns, 
for example, A-B-A and A-B-C in three act se
quences. Table 6 illustrates patterns of speaker 
sequences and their frequency ratios. In three 
act sequences, the frequency ratios of A-B-A 
and A-B-C are 62.7% and 37.3%, respectively, 
which signifies the dominance of two-party in
teractions. Likewise, in four, five and six act se
quences, two-party interactions are dominant, 
53.2%, 36.7% and 31.8%, both of which are 
far more frequent than theoretical expected fi'e
quencies (25%, 12.5 and 6.3%). In three-party 
dialogues, two-party interactions amounts to 
70.6% (45.1%+26.0% x 62.7%+ 12.2% x 53.2%+ 
5.4% x 36.7% + 2.4% × 31.8% = 70.6%) against 
total percentage 91.1% from two to six act se
quences (if extrapolating this number to total 
1.00% is allowable, 77.5% of the total interac
tions are expected to be of two-party). The 
conclusion here is that two-party inter
actions are dominant in three-party dia
logues. This conclusion holds for our meeting 
scheduling dialogue data, but intuitively its ap
plicability to other domains seems to be promis
ing, which should obviously need further work. 
4.3 Patterns
of initiative taking 
The concept 'initiative' is defined by Whittaker 
and Stenton (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) us
ing a classification of utterance types assertions, 
commands, questions and prompts. The initia
tive was used to analyse behaviour of anaphoric 
expressions in (Walker and Whittaker, 1990).

Table 6: Frequency ratio (%) of 3 to 6 act se
quences in three-party dialogues 
The algorithm to track the initiative was pro
posed by Chu-Carroll and Brown (1997). The 
relationship between the initiative and efficiency 
of task-oriented dialogues was empirically and 
analytically examined in (Ishizaki, 1997). By 
their definition, a conversational participant has 
the initiative when she makes some utterance 
except for responses to partner's utterance. The 
reason for this exception is that an utterance 
following partner's utterance should be thought 
of as the one elicited by the previous speaker 
rather than directing a conversation in their 
own right. A participant does not have the 
initiative (or partner has the initiative) when 
she uses a prompt to partner, since she clearly 
abdicates her opportunity for expressing some 
propositional content. 
Table 7 and 8 show the frequency ratios of 
who takes the initiative and )12 value calculated 
from the frequencies for twoand three-party di
alogues. In two-party dialogues, based on its X 2 
values, the initiative is not equally distributed 
between speakers in 5 out of 18 dialogues at .05 
rejection level. In three-party dialogues, this 
occurs in 10 out of 18 dialogues, which signifies 
the emergence of an initiative-taker or a chair
person. To examine the roles of the participants 
in detail, tile differences of the participants' be
haviour between twoand three party informa

Table 7: Frequency ratio (%)of initiative-taking and X 2 values of the frequencies between different 
speakers in two-party dialogues 
tion exchanges in Table 9. The table shows the 
comparison between two and three speaker in
teractions in three-party dialogues as to as who 
takes the initiative in 3 to 6 act sequences. From 
this table, we can observe the tendency that E 
takes the initiative more frequently than S and 
H for all three problem settings in two-party 
interaction, and two of three settings in three
party interaction. S has a tendency to take more 
initiatives in two-party interaction than that in 
three-party. H's initiative taking behaviour is 
the other way around to S's. Comparing with 
S's and H's initiative taking patterns, E can be 
said to take the initiative constantly irrespective 
of the number of party in interaction. 
The conclusion here is that initiative
taking behaviour is more clearly observed 
in three-party dialogues than those in 
two-party dialogues. Detailed analysis of 
the participants' behaviour indicates that there 
might be differences when the participants take 
the initiative, which are characterised by the 
number of participants in interaction. 
5 Conclusion
and Further Work 
This paper empirically describes the impor
tant characteristics of three-party dialogues by 
analysing the dialogue data collected in the task 
of meeting scheduling domain. The character
istics we found here are (1) two-party inter
actions are dominant in three-party dialogues, 
and (2) the behaviour of the initiative-taking
