Smadja (1993) also detailed techniques for collocation extraction and developed a program called XTRACT, which is capable of computing flexible collocations based on elaborated statistical calculation.

Moreover, log likelihood ratios are regarded as a more effective method to identify collocations especially when the occurrence count is very low (Dunning, 1993).

Hanks and Church (1990) proposed using pointwise mutual information to identify collocations in lexicography; however, the method may result in unacceptable collocations for low-count pairs.
