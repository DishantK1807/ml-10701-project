Besides an exact match accuracy metric, we also used a more fine-grained metric based ell the well-known PARSEVAL metrics that evaluate phrase-structure trees (Black et al.1991). The PARSEVAL metrics compare a proposed parse P with the corresponding correct treebank parse 7" as follows: # correct constituents in 1' Precision = # constituents in P # correct constituents in P Recall = # constituents in 7 In order to apply these metrics to LFG analyses, we extend the PARSEVAL notion of "correct constituent" in the following way: a constituent in P is correct if there exists a constituent ill T of the same label that spans the same words and that Â¢l)-corresponds to the same fstructure unit.

This suggests that our model may be successfully used to exploit the functional annotations in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.1994), provided that these annotations can be converted into LFG-style l'unctional structures.

DOP models for a number of richer representations have been explored (van den Berg et al.1994; Tugwell 1995), but these approaches have remained context-free in their generative power.
