Previous authors (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987) have noted that TAG has many advantages for generation as a syntactic formalism, because of its localization of argument structure.

Furthermore, (Shieber et al., 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1991; Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) exploit similar benefits of lexicalization and localization.

combination in SPUD Because LTAG can associate multiple iexical items to a single tree, it is straightforward to list frozen idioms, like call number, in the lexicon (Abeille and Schabes, 1989).
E89-1001
(Shieber et al., 1990; Shieber and Schabes, 1991 ) construct a simult .~eous derivation of syntax and semantics--but they do not construct the semantics: it is an input to their system.

proper Although primarily concerned with the interpretation of Gricean maxims, the work of (Reiter and Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995) underlines the conventionality of description.

SPUD extends the general procedure for building referring expressions that is suggested by the planning paradigm (Appelt, 1985; Kronfeld, 1986).

The rhetorical connection between a sentence and surrounding discourse should also be described with adjuncts (Huang, 1994).
W94-0317
(Prevost and Steedman, 1993; Hoffman, 1994) do represent the division of sentences into theme and rheme, but because they do not model the pragmatics of particular constructions, they plan descriptions in a separate step.

Second, in keeping with ontological promiscuity (Hobbs, 1985), we represent the importance of attributes by the salience of events and states in the discourse model--these states and events now have the same status in the discourse model as any other entities.
P85-1008
For example, (Viegas and Bouillon, 1994) handle semantic collocations by implementing Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon Theory (GLT); modifiers take on specialized meanings derived from salient processes and characteristics associated with the heads they modify.
W94-0311
Various efforts at using TAG for generation (McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1985; Joshi, 1987; Yang et al., 1991; Nicolov et al., 1995; Wahlster et al., 1991) enjoy many of these advantages.
J91-4003 P85-1012
The modality of sentences may refer to a salient possibility (Roberts, 1986) or provide the content of a salient psychological state (Wiebe, 1994).

Finally, SEMANTIC COLLOCATIONS like long book derive their particular meaning from the recovery in context of parameters for events and other entities (Pustejovsky, 1991).

Second, entities differ in SALIENCE (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995).
J86-3001 J95-2003
Similarly, implementations of MTY describe the conventional use of certain modifiers with heads (Mel'~uk and Polgu~re, 1987; Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Wanner, 1994) using Lexical Functions.

We build on the existing insights of linguists (including (Pustejovsky, 1991; Mel'Euk and Polgu~re, 1987; Nunberg et al., 1994)) and implementations (including (Reiter and Dale, 1992; Viegas and Bouillon, 1994; Smadja and McKeown, 1991)).
C92-1038 J91-4003 W94-0311
First, as originally advocated by Hobbs (1985), we adopt an ONTOLOGICALLY PROMISCUOUS representation that includes a wide variety of types of entities.
P85-1008
First, as in (Reiter and Dale, 1992), we stipulate that some attributes of entities are more important than others, and that some words more naturally describe those attributes.
