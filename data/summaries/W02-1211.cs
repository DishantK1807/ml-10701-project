There are basically three kinds of approaches on sentence alignment: the length-based approach (Gale & Church 1991 and Brown et al.1991), the lexical approach (key & Roscheisen 1993), and the combination of them (Chen 1993, Wu 1994 and Langlais 1998, etc.).

Chen (1993) combines the length-based approach and lexicon-based approach together.

P94-1012
Kay & Roscheisen (1993) use a partial alignment of lexical items induce a maximum likelihood at sentence level.

P93-1002
The first sentence alignment model used to align English-Chinese bilingual texts is proposed by Wu (1994).
P94-1012
The first published algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel texts are length-based approach proposed by Gale & Church (1991) and Brow et al (1991).
P91-1023
Gale & Church (1991) suggest that the same length-based algorithm can be used to align paragraph also.
