The source expression of the transfer knowledge is expressed by a constituent boundary pattern, which is defined as a sequence that consists of variables and symbols representing constituent boundaries (Furuse, 1994).

The left-to-right parsing determines the best structure and best transferred result locally by performing structural disambiguation using semantic distance calculations, in parallel with the derivation of possible structures (Furuse, 1996).

2.2 Left-to-right parsing In TDMT, possible source language structures are derived by applying the constituent boundary patterns of transfer knowledge source parts to an input string in a left-to-right fashion (Furuse, 1996), based on a chart parsing method.
C96-1070
The proposed method can be incorporated into frameworks that utilize left-to-right parsing and a score for a substructure, In fact, it has been added to Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT), which was proposed for efficient and robust spoken-language translation (Furuse, 1994; Furuse, 1996).
C94-1015 C96-1070
Wakita (1997) proposed a robust translation method which locally extracts only reliable parts, i.e., those within the semantic distance threshold and over some word length.
