While these models may suggest the existence of strong syntactic preferences in effect during sentence understanding, other studies provide clear evidence that purely syntactic heuristics for prepositional phrase attachment will not work (see (Whittemore, Ferrara, & Brunner, 1990), (Taraban, & McClelland, 1988)).

In $7, the antecedent is the subject, "the woman;" in $9, it is the prepositional phrase 1For a solution to the gap-finding problem that is consistent with the simplified parsing strategy presented below, see (Cardie & Lehnert, 1991).

In comparison, most corpus-based algorithms employ substantially larger corpora (e.g., 1 million words (de Marcken, 1990), 2.5 million words (Brent, 1991), 6 million words (Hindle, 1990), 13 million words (Hindle, & Rooth, 1991)).

However, recent research in these areas indicates that automated approaches for these tasks may be feasible (see, for example, (Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, & Mercer, 1991) and (l-Iindle, 1983)).

8Interestingly, in work on the automated classification of nouns, (Hindle, 1990) also noted problems with "empty" words that depend on their complements for meaning.

In addition, clause boundaries are detected using a method described in (Cardie, & Lehnert, 1991).

Moreover, the success of the approach for structurally complex antecedents suggests that the technique may provide a general approach for the 9 In recent work on the disambiguation of structurally, but not semantically, restricted phrases, however, a set of 16 predefined semantic categories sufficed (Ravin, 1990).

Alternatively, a syntactic filter is applied to the parse tree and any noun phrases for which coreference with the relative pronoun is syntactically legal (or, in some cases, illegal) are passed to a semantic component which determines the antecedent using inference or preference rules (see (Correa, 1988), (Hobbs, 1986), (Ingria, & Stallard, 1989), (Lappin, & McCord, 1990)).
