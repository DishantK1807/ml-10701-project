Raw parallel data need to be preprocessed in the modern phrase-based SMT before they are aligned by alignment algorithms, one of which is the wellknown tool, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), for training IBM models (1-4).

84 5.2 Machine translation on Europarl corpus We further tested our WDHMM on a phrase-based machine translation system to see whether our improvement on word alignment can also improve MT accuracy measured by BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002).
P02-1040
Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) and Owczarzak et al.(2006) use paraphrases during BLEU and NIST evaluation to increase the number of matches between the translation and the reference; the paraphrases are either taken from WordNet4 in Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) or derived from the test set itself through automatic word and phrase alignment in Owczarzak et al.(2006). Another metric making use of synonyms is the linear regression model developed by Russo-Lassner et al.(2005), which makes use of stemming, WordNet synonymy, verb class synonymy, matching noun phrase heads, and proper name matching.
N06-1058 W06-3112
This finding has been previously reported, among others, in Liu and Gildea (2005).

The BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) and the closely related NIST metric (Doddington, 2002) along with WER and PER 48 have been widely used by many machine translation researchers.

In this paper, we use the parser developed by Cahill et al.(2004), which automatically annotates input text with c-structure trees and f-structure dependencies, obtaining high precision and recall rates.

P02-1040
Since the creation of BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002), the subject of automatic evaluation metrics for MT has been given quite a lot of attention.
P02-1040
Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference, like CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering; or METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy.
E06-1031 W05-0909
Still, a confidence range for BLEU can be estimated by bootstrapping (Och, 2003; Zhang and Vogel, 2004).

Model weights were trained separately for all 3 systems using minimum error rate training to maximize BLEU (Och, 2003) on the development set (dev).

3 3 Related work 3.1 String-based metrics The insensitivity of BLEU and NIST to perfectly legitimate syntactic and lexical variation has been raised, among others, in Callison-Burch et al.(2006), but the criticism is widespread.
E06-1032
We employ the phrase-based SMT framework (Koehn et al., 2003), and use the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), and the SRILM language modelling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), and evaluate our decoded translations using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002), using a single reference translation.
P02-1040
Although widely popular thanks to their speed and efficiency, both BLEU and NIST have been criticized for inadequate accuracy of evaluation at the segment level (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).
E06-1032
By contrast, Liu and Gildea (2005) present three metrics that use syntactic and unlabelled dependency information.

Even the 3 A demo of the parser can be found at http://lfgdemo.computing.dcu.ie/lfgparser.html creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level (Papineni et al., 2002).

J03-1002
In addition, to allow for the possibility of valid lexical differences between the translation and the references, we follow Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) in adding a number of synonyms in the process of evaluation to raise the number of matches between the translation and the reference, leading to a higher score.
N06-1058
It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.

As suggested by Callison-Burch et al.(2006) we perform a focussed manual analysis of the output to see what changes have occurred.

Our method, extending this line of research with the use of labelled LFG dependencies, partial matching, and n-best parses, allows us to considerably outperform Liu and Gildea?s (2005) highest correlations with human judgement (they report 0.144 for the correlation with human fluency judgement, 0.202 for the correlation with human overall judgement), although it has to be kept in mind that such comparison is only tentative, as their correlation is calculated on a different test set.

In an experiment on 16,800 sentences of Chinese-English newswire text with segment-level human evaluation from the Linguistic Data Consortium?s (LDC) Multiple Translation project, we compare the LFG-based evaluation method with other popular metrics like BLEU, NIST, General Text Matcher (GTM) (Turian et al., 2003), Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006)1, and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), and we show that combining dependency representations with synonyms leads to a more accurate evaluation that correlates better with human judgment.
W05-0909
While Liu and Gildea (2005) calculate n-gram matches on non-labelled head-modifier sequences derived by head-extraction rules from syntactic trees, we automatically evaluate the quality of translation by calculating an f-score on labelled dependency structures produced by a LexicalFunctional Grammar (LFG) parser.
W05-0904
Weights on the loglinear features are set using Och's algorithm (Och, 2003) to maximize the system's BLEU score on a development corpus.
J03-1002
In recent years, statistical machine translation have experienced a quantum leap in quality thanks to automatic evaluation (Papineni et al., 2002) and errorbased optimization (Och, 2003).
J03-1002 P02-1040
These dependencies differ from those used by Liu and Gildea (2005), in that they are extracted according to the rules of the LFG grammar and they are labelled with a type of grammatical relation that connects the head and the modifier, such as subject, determiner, etc.
W05-0904
Note that using stems and their synonyms as used in METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) could also be considered for word similarity.

The factored translation model combines features in a log-linear fashion (Och, 2003).
J03-1002
The most widely used are Word Error Rate (WER), Position independent word Error Rate (PER), the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) and the NIST score (Doddington, 2002).
P02-1040
Our method follows and substantially extends the earlier work of Liu and Gildea (2005), who use syntactic features and unlabelled dependencies to evaluate MT quality, outperforming BLEU on segment-level correlation with human judgement.
W05-0904
In the experiment, only the first 500 sentences were used to train the log-linear model weight vector, where minimum error rate (MER) training was used (Och, 2003).
J03-1002
To improve the correlation with accuracy judgements, we would like to experiment using a paraphrase set derived from a large parallel corpus, as described in Owczarzak et al.(2006). While retaining the advantage of having a similar size to a corresponding set of WordNet synonyms, this set will also capture low-level syntactic variations, which can increase the number of matches.
