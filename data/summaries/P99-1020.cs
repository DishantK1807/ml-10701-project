with other methods As indicated in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997), it is difficult to compare the WSD methods, as long as distinctions reside in the approach considered (MRD based methods, supervised or unsupervised statistical methods), and in the words that are disambiguated.
W97-0209 W97-0213
WSD that make use of the information provided by machine readable dictionaries (Cowie et al., 1992), (Miller et al., 1994), (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), (Li et al., 1995), (McRoy, 1992); 2.
C92-1056 H94-1046 J92-1001
WSD that use information gathered from raw corpora (unsupervised training methods) (Yarowsky, 1995) (Resnik, 1997).
P95-1026 W97-0209 W97-0213
A method that disambiguates unrestricted nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives in texts is presented in (Stetina et al., 1998); it attempts to exploit sentential and discourse contexts and is based on the idea of semantic distance between words, and lexical relations.
W98-0701
As it can be seen from this table, (Stetina et al., 1998) reported an average accuracy of 85.7% for nouns, 63.9% for verbs, 83.6% for adjectives and 86.5% for adverbs, slightly less than our results.
W98-0701
WSD that use information gathered from training on a corpus that has already been semantically disambiguated (supervised training methods) (Gale et al., 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996); 3.
H92-1045 P96-1006
There are also hybrid methods that combine several sources of knowledge such as lexicon information, heuristics, collocations and others (McRoy, 1992) (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) (Ng and Lee, 1996) (Rigau et al., 1997).
J92-1001 P94-1020 P96-1006 P97-1007
To our knowledge, there is only one other method, recently reported, that disambiguates unrestricted words in texts (Stetina et al., 1998).
W98-0701
Some of the best results were reported in (Yarowsky, 1995) who uses a large training corpus.
