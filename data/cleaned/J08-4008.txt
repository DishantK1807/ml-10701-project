You are reading the last issue of Computational Linguistics that will appear in printed
hardcopy form. The beginning of 2009 heralds a new era for the journal in at least
two major respects: As of the ﬁrst issue of volume 35, Computational Linguistics will be
published only electronically, and it will be open access. As editor, I’d like to take this
opportunity to use these last words that will tumble from the presses to provide some
explanation of the changes afoot at the journal, and to offer some thoughts on where
this might take us in the future.
1. Why Open Access?
Thereareanumber ofdeﬁnitions oftheterm‘openaccess’ incirculation, butalmostall
sharethekeyprinciplethatscientiﬁcliteratureshouldbefreelyavailableforalltoread,
download, copy, distribute, and use (with appropriate attribution) without restriction.
At the time of writing, the vast bulk of scholarly literature is not open access: Either
you pay for access directly as an individual subscriber (for example, in the case of
Computational Linguistics, via your annual membership subscription to the Association
for Computational Linguistics), or you gain access via an institutional subscription
(typically, your library’s annual subscription to MITPress).
There is an increasingly widely held view that this is just not right. Given that
almost all the research published in scholarly journals is paid for by the taxpayer, it’s
reasonable to ask what justiﬁcation there can be for restricting public access to this
researchbyrequiringthatafurtherpaymentbemadetoreadaboutit.And‘tollaccess’,
as it is sometimes called, is not only bad for the reading public; it has been frequently
argued that it is bad for authors too, because any barriers to access may decrease the
likelihood of citation and the general impact of the reported work.
So, as announced earlier this year at the annual meeting of the Association for
Computational Linguistics in Columbus, Ohio, Computational Linguistics will become
an open access journal as of the ﬁrst issue of 2009. In fact, for some time the journal
has had a rather unusual access status, whereby its content becomes freely available as
part of the online ACL Anthology one year after publication.

As of the ﬁrst issue of
Volume 35, even this delay will be removed, with the journal’s contents being freely
available as soon as they are published.

2. Why Electronic-only?
That the journal is going electronic-only and open access at the same time are not
unrelated events. Print publication is a major part of the cost of producing the journal,
and this is a cost that is very considerably subsidized by the revenues generated by
institutional subscriptions. Going open access means that institutions no longer pay
thesesubscriptions,andsoweneedasustainableﬁnancialmodelthatdoesnotdepend
on this income. Ceasing the production of the printed version of the journal is an
important step in that direction. In an environmentally conscious age, it also has the
additional beneﬁt of removing the need to ﬂy, four times a year, small plastic-wrapped
wads of paper to two thousand ACL members around the world.
At the same time, there is no necessary connection between going open access
and going electronic-only. In principle a journal could be open access and yet still be
distributedinprintedform,althoughthenanalternativefundingsourcehastobefound
forprintproduction.Oneapproachisthatadoptedbythosepublishers(suchasElsevier
and Cambridge University Press) who offer authors the option of their work being
published open access in exchange for a fee, which can be anywhere between $500 and
$2,000perarticle.This‘disseminationfee’modelhasbecomeacceptedpracticeinsome
disciplines,butnot—sofar,atleast—inours.Thereareotherbusinessmodelsonecould
adopt to sustain print production. For example, free local newspapers and many trade
magazines are also effectively open access, with their production costs being paid for
by advertisers; but it seems unlikely that advertising revenue could sustain a scholarly
journal like CL. Another alternative would be to seek sponsorship from corporations
like Google and Microsoft. But in the Internet age, it just seems perverse to bend over
backwards to ﬁnd ways to kill more trees.
This is not to say that going electronic-only makes the journal free of production
costs. Although the journal’s editor, editorial board, and external reviewers provide
their labor free of charge, it still costs real money to produce the journal: In partic-
ular, CL will continue to use the professional services of the MIT Press in managing
the high standards of copyediting and typesetting to which our readers have become
accustomed. For the foreseeable future at least, these costs will continue to be met by
the ACL, as owner ofthe journal.
3. What Else isChanging?
The shift to electronic publication means that publishing an article in Computational
Linguisticsshouldbeconsiderablyfasterthanbefore,foranumberofreasons.Underthe
oldmodel,itcantakeuptosixmonthsfromthetimethattheeditorialofﬁcedispatches
the author’s ﬁnal copy of an article to the publisher, to the time the article appears in
print. Around half of this time is taken up by the print production process. The delay
is further exacerbated by the fact that the ﬁrst article that is ready for an issue has to
wait until the remainder of the issue is ready before it can be published. By moving to
electronic-only publication, articles will now appear online as soon as they have gone
through the copy-editing process, on an article-by-article basis. You’ll be able to access
articles even before they have completed the copy-editing cycle. This, in fact, is not a
new thing: for the last year or so, we have been publishing what are referred to as the
‘ﬁrstrevises’ofarticles—thesebeingtheproofsthataresenttotheauthorsforchecking
before ﬁnal edits are made—via the MIT Press Web site under the label ‘Early Access’.
But the unavailability of an easy way to let individual subscribers see this toll-access

content meant that very few people were aware of its existence. With the move to open
access, the Early Access articles will also be freely available to all.
Anotherconsequenceofbeingelectronic-onlyisthattherewillbenoartiﬁcialback-
log resulting from the page limits imposed by physical print production. Previously,
the journal’s cost model meant that we could publish 160 or so pages each quarter; the
removal of print production provides us with more ﬂexibility, and the likelihood that
the journal will publish a greater number of articles (although, as indicated previously,
there will still be costs associated with this: Copyeditors and typesetters charge per
page). Being freed from paper bindings does not mean that processing backlogs will
completely disappear, because there are other places in the publication process where
delays can occur. For example, an unpredictable copyediting workload may lead to
delays when our demand for copyediting services outstrips the available resources.
We hope that readers who keenly look forward to receiving an issue of the journal
in their pigeonhole every three months will not suffer too much from a sense of loss.

or provide the content in the form of email attachments. The full details of our elec-
tronic delivery mechanisms are still being worked out at the time of writing, but ACL
members will already have been notiﬁed of themby the time this issue is published.
We are taking advantage of the shift to electronic-only publication to institute a
numberofotherchanges.Mostvisibleforauthorswillbeourmovetoanonlinejournal
manuscript management system, which should introduce efﬁciencies that will shave
a few more days off the time our reviewing process takes. For readers, each article
published in the journal will be available in both PDF format and in XML format, the
latter allowing easy reading on screen.
4. What Does theLonger-term Future Look Like?
Over the next year or two we intend to introduce a number of further changes that be-
comemorestraightforwardasaconsequenceofourprimaryexistencebeingelectronic.
Possibilities we are exploring include making available for download supplementary
materials such as the code and data associated with articles, and providing each article
with an online discussion forum where its content can be discussed. The editor wel-
comes suggestions and ideas for how we can improve the value of the journal to its
readership along these lines.
There is a longer-term question, though, about the nature of journals and whether
they are a sustainable means of scholarly dissemination in the Internet age. The pub-
lication landscape has changed signiﬁcantly in the last 10 years. One challenge to the
positionofjournalsandexistingformsofscholarlypublicationmoregenerallycomesin
the shape of blogs and other online discussion fora. Obviously these are not rigorously
reviewed in the way that journals are, but they are open to other means of quality
assessment, via machinery like page rank and reader voting. For some purposes, the
low cost and democratic openness these offer may outweigh the deﬁciencies that arise
from the lack of a conventional peer-review process. Ultimately, how these alternative
forawillfareasameansofscholarlypublicationmaybedeterminedbywhetherwecan
develop a credit assignment mechanism that gives due recognition for great ideas that
ﬁrst surface in these more informal spaces. This would have to be more ﬁne-grained
than our current model of journal impact factors and bald citation counts; but more
traditional forms of publication would surely beneﬁt fromimprovements here too.

Another challenge comes from online shared knowledge repositories such as

credit for work of this kind. It’s entirely possible that, within a few years, Knols will
frequently be cited in the pages of journals like this one.
These are future challenges for journals in any discipline. In our ﬁeld, journals face
a challenge from another direction, closer to home. It has often been noted that, in
computer science generally, conference publication counts as much as journal publi-
cation. In fact, a paper in a good conference can be worth much more than an article in
a mid-ranking journal. Given the substantial additional effort that is usually required
to produce a journal article, and the longer reviewing process that is subsequently
involved, it’s perhaps a surprise that journals receive any submissions at all. So why
don’t we just let journals die, and allow conferences to become the primary means of
scientiﬁc communication in the ﬁeld?
Conferences play an important role in many disciplines, but they do not fulﬁl all

Here at Computational Linguistics, we aim to take on board ideas that arise from newer
forms of media and ﬁnd ways of adopting and adapting them; but we also aim to
continue to be seen as a source of the highest quality research in the ﬁeld. I hope you’ll
continue reading, and that you’ll consider Computational Linguistics the publication
forum of choice in our discipline.
