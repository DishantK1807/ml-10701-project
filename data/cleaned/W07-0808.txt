c©2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Can You Tag the Modal?
You Should.
Yael Netzer and Meni Adler and David Gabay and Michael Elhadad Ben Gurion University of the Negev Department of Computer Science POB 653 Be’er Sheva, 84105, Israel {yaeln,adlerm,gabayd,elhadad}@cs.bgu.ac.il Abstract Computational linguistics methods are typically first developed and tested in English.
When applied to other languages, assumptions from English data are often applied to the target language.
One of the most common such assumptions is that a “standard” part-of-speech (POS) tagset can be used across languages with only slight variations.
We discuss in this paper a specific issue related to the definition of a POS tagset for Modern Hebrew, as an example to clarify the method through which such variations can be defined.
It is widely assumed that Hebrew has no syntactic category of modals.
There is, however, an identified class of words which are modal-like in their semantics, and can be characterized through distinct syntactic and morphologic criteria.
We have found wide disagreement among traditional dictionaries on the POS tag attributed to such words.
We describe three main approaches when deciding how to tag such words in Hebrew.
We illustrate the impact of selecting each of these approaches on agreement among human taggers, and on the accuracy of automatic POS taggers induced for each method.
We finally recommend the use of a “modal” tag in Hebrew and provide detailed guidelines for this tag.
Our overall conclusion is that tagset definition is a complex task which deserves appropriate methodology.
1 Introduction
In this paper we address one linguistic issue that was raised while tagging a Hebrew corpus for part of speech (POS) and morphological information.
Our corpus is comprised of short news stories.
It includes roughly 1,000,000 tokens, in articles of typical length between 200 to 1000 tokens.
The articles are written in a relatively simple style, with a high token/word ratio.
Of the full corpus, a sample of articles comprising altogether 100,000 tokens was assembled at random and manually tagged for part of speech.
We employed four students as taggers.
An initial set of guidelines was first composed, relying on the categories found in several dictionaries and on the Penn treebank POS guidelines (Santorini, 1995).
Tagging was done using an automatic tool1.
We relied on existing computational lexicons (Segal, 2000; Yona, 2004) to generate candidate tags for each word.
As many words from the corpus were either missing or tagged in a non uniform manner in the lexicons, we recommended looking up missing words in traditional dictionaries.
Disagreement was also found among copyrighted dictionaries, both for open and closed set categories.
Given the lack of a reliable lexicon, the taggers were not given a list of options to choose from, but were free to tag with whatever tag they found suitable.
The process, although slower and bound to produce unintentional mistakes, was used for building a lexicon, and to refine the guidelines and on occasion modify the POS tagset.
When constructing and then amending the guidelines we sought the best trade-off between 1http://wordfreak.sourceforge.net 57 accuracy and meaningfulness of the categorization, and simplicity of the guidelines, which is important for consistent tagging.
Initially, each text was tagged by four different people, and the guidelines were revised according to questions or disagreements that were raised.
As the guidelines became more stable, the disagreement rate decreased, each text was tagged by three people only and eventually two taggers and a referee that reviewed disagreements between the two.
The disagreement rate between any two taggers was initially as high as 20%, and dropped to 3% after a few rounds of tagging and revising the guidelines.
Major sources of disagreements that were identified, include: Prepositional phrases vs.
prepositions In Hebrew, formative letters – a0a2a1a3a4a1a5a6a1a7 b,c,l,m2 – can be attached to a noun to create a short prepositional phrase.
In some cases, such phrases function as a preposition and the original meaning of the noun is not clearly felt.
Some taggers would tag the word as a prepositional prefix + noun, while others tagged it as a preposition, e.g., a8a10a9 a7a12a11a10a13a4a7 b’iqbot (following), that can be tagged as a8a14a9 a7a12a11a10a13a16a15a17a7 b-iqbot (in the footsteps of).
Adverbial phrases vs.
Adverbs the problem is similar to the one above, e.g., a11 a9a19a18a19a20 a7 bdiyuq (exactly), can be tagged as b-diyuq (with accuracy).
Participles vs.
Adjectives as both categories can modify nouns, it is hard to distinguish between them, e.g, a21a22a18a19a18a24a23 a0a26a25a27a7a28a0 mabat.
m’ayem (a threatening stare) the category of a21a22a18a19a18a24a23 a0 m’ayem is unclear.
Another problem, on which the remainder of the article focuses, was a set of words that express modality, and commonly appear before verbs in the infinitive.
Such words were tagged as adjectives or adverbs, and the taggers were systematically uncertain about them.
Beside the disagreement among taggers, there was also significant disagreement among Modern Hebrew dictionaries we examined, as well as computational analyzers and annotated corpora.
Table 1 lists the various selected POS tags for these words, as determined by: (1) Rav Milim (Choueka et al., 1997), (2) Sapir (Avneyon et al., 2002), (3) Even-Shoshan (Even-Shoshan, 2003), (4) Knaani 2Transcription according to (Ornan, 2002) (Knaani, 1960), (5) HMA (Carmel and Maarek, 1999), (6) Segal (Segal, 2000), (7) Yona (Yona, 2004), (8) Hebrew Treebank (Sima’an et al., 2001).
As can be seen, eight different POS tags were suggested by these dictionaries: adJective (29.6%), adveRb (25.9%), Verb (22.2%), Auxilary verb (8.2%), Noun (4.4%), parTicle (3.7%), Preposition (1.5%), and Unknown (4.5%).
The average number of options per word is about 3.3, which is about 60% agreement.
For none of the words there was a comprehensive agreement, and the PoS of only seven words (43.75%) can be determinded by voting (i.e., there is one major option).
In the remainder of the paper, we investigate the existence of a modal category in Modern Hebrew, by analyzing the characteristic of these words, from a morphological, syntactic, semantic and practical point of view.
The decision whether to introduce a modal tag in a Hebrew tagset has practical consequences: we counted that over 3% of the tokens in our 1M token corpus can potentially be tagged as modals.
Beyond this practical impact, the decision process illustrates the relevant method through which a tagset can be derived and fine tuned.
2 Modality
in Hebrew Semantically, Modus is considered to be the attitude on the part of the speaking subject with regard to its content (Ducrot and Todorov, 1972), as opposed to the Dictum which is the linguistic realization of a predicate.
While a predicate is most commonly represented with a verb, modality can be uttered in various manners: adjectives and adverbs (definitely, probable), using thought/belief verbs, mood, intonation, or with modal verbs.
The latter are recognized as a grammatical category in many languages (modals), e.g., can, should and must in English.
From the semantic perspective, modality is coarsely divided into epistemic modality (the amount of confidence the speaker holds with reference to the truth of the proposition) and deontic modality (the degree of force exerted on the subject of the sentence to perform the action) views (de Haan, 2005).
Modal expressions do not constitute a syntactic class in Modern Hebrew (Kopelovich, 1982).
In her work, Kopelovich reviews classic descriptive 58 Word Example 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a0 a18 yeˇs should a1 a9a3a2 a18a5a4 a3 a7a28a3 a21a22a18 a0 a3 a0 a18 yeˇs la´sim leb lanisuh.

In this section we review three major approaches to modality in Hebrew the first is semantic (Kopelovich), the second is semantic-syntactic (Zadka) and the third is purely morphologicosyntactic (Rosen).
Kopelovich provides three binary dimensions that describe the modal system in Hebrew: Personal Impersonal, Modality Modulation and Objective Subjective plane.
The Personal-Impersonal system is connected to the absence or presence of a surface subject in the clause.
A personal modal has a grammatical subject: (1) a9 a0 a23 a8a27a23 a13 a18a3a2 a8 a3a17a23 a18 a11 a13 a20a16a9a19a20 dawid carik lhasi‘ ’et ’imo David should to-drive ACC mother-POSS David should drive his mother An impersonal modal has no grammatical subject, and modality predicates the entire clause.
(2) a8 a20a16a9 a7a28a13a4a3 a9 a0 a23 a8a27a23 a13 a18a3a2 a8 a3a17a23 a18 a11 a13 carik lhasi‘ ’et ’imo la‘abodah should to-drive ACC mother-POSS to-the-work His mother should be driven to work Kopelovich makes no distinction between the various syntactic categories that the words may belong to, and interchangeably uses examples of words like a11 a0a19a18 a23 a1a0 a18 a1a11 a8a14a9 a0 mutar, yeˇs, ’epˇsar [adverb, existential, participle respectively].
The Modality-Modulation plane, according to the functional school of Halliday (Halliday, 1985), refers to the interpersonal and ideational functions of language: Modality expresses the speaker’s own mind (epistemic modality possibility, probability and certainty) a11 a1a6a0 a21 a0 a30 a8a22a20 a11 a3 a3 a9 a3 a13 ‘alul laredet geˇsem mah.
ar (it may rain tomorrow).
Modulation participates in the content clause expressing external conditions in the world (deontic modality permission, obligation, ability and inclination): a3 a9 a5 a18 a8 a8a27a23 a9a19a18 a0 a5a28a13 a3 a18 a1 a8 a8 a3 ’ata yakol lhath.
il ‘akˇsaw (you can start now).
Modality does not carry tense and cannot be negated, while modulation can be modified by tense and can be negative.
3For reference see (Kopelovich, 1982), see below for Rosen’s analysis The Objective-Subjective plane is what Kopelovich calls the perception of the world.
Objectivity is achieved using different tenses of to-be in conjunction with the modal (including tense of modal if it is a verb), and their order subjective vs.
objective: (3) a7 a18 a7 a23 a3 a8 a3 a13 a9a3a2 a4 a3a15a23 a18 a11 a13 a8 a18 a8 a20a16a9a19a20 dawid haya carik lisw‘ ltel ’abib David was have to-drive to-Tel Aviv David had to drive to Tel Aviv (4) a21a22a18a19a20 a7 a9 a13a9a8 a3 a5 a8a27a23 a2 a4 a5a28a3a15a8 a18 a8a34a23 a18 a11 a13 a1a8 a25 a3a32a1 a8 a8 a8a27a23 a11 a18 a7a28a13a9a8 a3 a18a19a20 a5 kdei lha‘abir ’et hahah.

Zadka (1995) defines the class of single-argument bridge verbs4, i.e., any verb or pro-verb that can have an infinitive as a subject or object, and that does not accept a subordinate clause as subject or object: (5) a6 a0 a13a4a3a15a11 a9a3a2 a23 [subject] ’sur l‘aˇsen Forbidden to-smoke It is forbidden to smoke (6) a11 a1 a0 a3 a3 a18 a1 a8 a8 a1 a8 a13 a11 a23 a9 a8 [object] hua racah/hth.

il/’amad/msugal ˇsiqra’ ’et hado”h.
bimlo’o. *Yosef started/was-about/is-capable that-he-read ACC the report entirely.
Zadka classifies these verbs into seven semantic categories: (1) Will (2) Manner (3) Aspect (4) Ability (5) Possibility/Certainty (6) Necessity/Obligation 4“Ride Verb” in Zadka’s terminology, a18 a23 a0 a9 a0a2a15 a20 a1 a7a28a5 a9 a11 a3 a13 a9 a18 60 and (7) Negation.
Categories 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are considered by Zadka to include pure modal verbs, e.g., alethic and deontic verbs.
In his paper, Zadka defines classification criteria that refer to syntactic-semantic properties such as: can the infinitive verb be realized as a relative clause, are the subject of the verb and its complement the same, can the infinitive be converted to a gerund, animacy of subject; deep semantic properties – argument structure and selectional restrictions, the ability to drop a common subject of the verb and its complement, factuality level (factual, non-factual, counter-factual); and morphological properties.
Will, Manner and Aspectual verbs as Zadka defines are not considered modals by Kopelovich since they can be inflected by tense (with the exceptions of a11 a9 a0 a23 ’amur (supposed),a20a28a18 a8 a13 ‘atid (should).
Ability verbs are a3 a9 a5 a18 yakol (can), a3a31a30 a9a3a2 a0 msugal (can,capable) [participle].
They have both an animate actor as a subject and an infinitive as a complement, with the same deep subject.
These verbs are counter-factual.
Certainty verbs include a1 a11a4a5 a9 a0 mukrak (must), a23 a18 a11 a13 carik (should), a0 a3 a23a14a4 ne’elac (be forced to), a3 a9 a5 a18 yakol (can), a18 a1 a11a4a5a10a8 hekreh.
i (necessary), a18 a9 a0 a13 ‘a´suy (may), a3 a9 a3 a13 ‘alul (might), a18 a9 a18 a13 capuy (expected).
They represent the alethic and epistemic necessity or possibility of the process realized in the clause.
All of them cannot be inflected morphologically.
The modal predicates the whole situation in the proposition, and may be subjective (epistemic) or objective (alethic).
The subject of these verbs coreferences with the subject of the modal: (9) a8a22a18a5a4a17a9 a5a28a0 a8a14a9a5a4 a11a10a3a7a1 a11a4a5 a9 a0 a18a3a4 a23 ’ani mukrak liqnot mkonit I must to-buy car I must buy a car Necessity/Obligation includes adjectives – e.g., a7 a18a19a18 a1 h.
ayab (must), a18a24a23 a0 a11 raˇsa’y (allowed), gerunds – a1 a11a4a5 a9 a0 mukrah.
(must), a11 a9a5a2 a23 ’asur (forbidden), a11 a8a10a9 a0 mutar (allowed) and the verb a3 a9 a5 a18 yakwl (can) 5.
Necessity verbs/proverbs present deontic modality, and all clauses share, in Zadka’s view a causing participant that is not always realized in the surface.
5as well as nouns and prepositions among them a0 a18 and a6 a18a24a23 yeˇs and ’ein according to Zadka From the morphological point of view, one may characterize impersonals by a non-inflectional behavior, e.g., a0 a18 yeˇs, a6 a18a24a23 ’ein, a11 a8a14a9 a0 mutar, a11 a9a5a2 a23 ’asur, a11 a0a19a18 a23 ’epˇsar,a8 a18 a5 a23 ’ikpat.
All of these words do not inflect in number and gender with their argument.
But this criterion leaves out all of the genderquantity inflected words, e.g., a18 a9 a23 a11 ra’uy, a3a33a30 a9a5a2 a0 msugal, a3 a9 a3 a13 ‘alul, a11 a9 a0 a23 ’amur, a23 a18 a11 a13 carik, a3 a9 a5 a18 yakol, which are all classified as modals by Zadka.
On the other hand, including all the gender-quantity inflected words with infinite or relative clause complements as modals, will include certain adjectives, e.g., a23 a0 a2 a9 a0 musmak (certified), nouns, e.g., a8a14a9 a5 a20 zkut (credit), and participles, e.g., a13 a4 a0 a4 nimna‘ (avoid), as well.
It appears that Zadka’s classification relies primarily on semantic criteria.
Rosen (1977, pp.
113-115) defines a syntactic category he calls impersonals.
Words in this category occur only as the predicative constituent of a sentence with an infinitive or a subordinate clause argument.
Past and future tense is marked with the auxilary verb a8 a18 a8 hayah (to-be).
In addition, impersonals cannot function as predicative adjectives: a18 a23a14a20 a5 kda’i (worthwhile), a7a16a25 a9 a0 mutab (better), a8 a18 a5 a23 ’ikpat (care/mind).
Personal reference can be added to the clause (governed by the infinitive) with the a3 l dative preposition: (10)a8a14a9 a8 a0 a3 a18 a3 a18 a23a14a20 a5 kda’y li liˇstot worthwhile to-me to-drink It is worthwhile for me to drink 2.1 Criteria to Identify Modal-like Words in Hebrew We have reviewed three major approaches to categorizing modals in Hebrew: Semantic represented mostly in Kopelovich’s work, modality is categorized by three dimensions of semantic attributes.
Since her claim is that there is no syntactic category of modality at all, this approach ‘over-generates’ modals and includes words that from any other syntactic or morphologic view fall into other parts of speech.
Syntactic-semantic Zadka classifies seven sets of verbs and pro-verbs following syntactic and semantic criteria.
His claim is that modality actually is marked by syntactic characteristics, which can be 61 identified by structural criteria.
However, his evaluation mixes semantics with syntactic attributes.
Morphological-syntactic Rosen’s definition of Impersonals is strictly syntactic/morpholgical and does not try to characterize words with modality.
Consequently, words that are usually considered modals, are not included in his definition a11 a9a3a2 a23 ’asur (forbidden), a11 a8a14a9 a0 mutar (allowed), a3 a9 a5 a18 yakol (can).
3 Proposed
Modal Guidelines to Identify The variety of criteria proposed by linguists reflects the disagreements we identified in lexicographic work about modal-like words in Hebrew.
For a computational application, all words in a corpus must be tagged.
Given the complex nature of modality in Hebrew, should we introduce a modal tag in our tagset, or instead, rely on other existing tags?
We have decided to introduce a modal tag in our Hebrew tagset.
Although there is no distinct syntactic category for modals in Hebrew, we propose the following criteria: (i) They have an infinitive complement or a clausal complement introduced by the binder a0 ˇs.
(ii) They are NOT adjectives.
(iii) They have irregular inflections in the past tense, i.e., a18a24a8a22a18a5a13 a11 a8 a13 a20 a3 raciti lada‘at (I wanted to know) is not a modal usage.
The tests to distinguish modal from non-modal usages are: a0 a18 and a6 a18a24a23 which can be also existential, are used as modals if they can be replaced with a23 a18 a11 a13. Adjectives are gradable and can be modified by a20a28a9 a23 a0 m’od (very) or a11 a8a10a9 a18 yoter (more).
Adjectives can become describers of the nominalized verb: a2 a9 a11 a8 a3 a3 a11 ) a20a28a9 a23 a0 a8 a3 a11 a8 a2 a18 a11 a8 a8 qal laharos ) haharisah qala m’od (easy to destroy ) the destruction is easy).
In all other cases where a verb is serving in to convey modality, it is still tagged as a verb, e.g., a1 a13 a4 a0a21a8 a23 a9 a8 a18a5a2 a9a19a18 a0 a6 a7 a9 a0 muban ˇsyosi hu’ hamnaceh.
(it is clear that Yossi is the winner).
We first review how these guidelines help us address some of the most difficult tagging decisions we had to face while building the corpus, we then indicate quantitatively the impact of the modal tag on the practical problem of tagging.
3.1 ”What do I care” a0 a1a3a2a5a4a7a6a9a8a11a10a13a12 One of the words tagged as a modal in our corpus the word a8 a18 a5 a23 ’ikpat – is not considered thus far to be a modal.
However, at least in some of its instances it fits our definition of modal, and it can also be interpreted as modality according to its sense.
The only definition that is consistent with our observation is Rosen’s impersonals.
Looking back at its origins, we checked the Historical Lexicon of the Hebrew Language6, the word a8 a18 a5 a23 was used in the medieval period in the Talmud and the Mishna, where it only appears in the following construction: (11)a23 a3 a8 a18 a5 a23 a8 a0 mah ’ikpat lk what care to-you what do you care Similarly, in the Ben Yehuda Project – an Israeli version of the Guttenberg project7 which includes texts from the Middle Ages up to the beginning of the 20th century – we have found 28 instances of the word, with the very same usage as in older times.
While trying to figure its part of speech, we do not identify a8 a18 a5 a23 as a NOUN as it cannot have a definite marker a8 8, and is not an adjective9.
Traditional Hebrew Dictionaries consider a8 a18 a5 a23 to be an intransitive verb (Kohut, 1926; Even-Shoshan, 2003; Avneyon et al., 2002) or an adverb.
Some dictionaries from the middle of the 20th century (Gur, 1946; Knaani, 1960), as well as recent ones (Choueka et al., 1997) did not give it a part of speech at all.
In our corpus we found 130 occurences of the word a8 a18 a5 a23 of which 55 have an infinitive/relative clause complement, 35 have null complement, and 40 have a0 m PP complement a8 a4a17a18a19a20 a0a25a8 a0 a9 a3 a8 a18 a5 a23 ’ikpat lo mehamdina (he cares for the country).
The latter has no modal interpretation.
We claim that in this case it should be tagged as a participle (a18a3a4 a9a5a4 a18 a7 ).
The test to tell apart modal and participle is: 6http://hebrew-treasures.huji.ac.il/ an enterprise conducted by the Israeli Academy of the Hebrew Language.

To conclude this section, our proposed definition of modals allows us to tag this word in a systematic and complete manner and to avoid the confusion that characterizes this word.
3.2 ”It’s really hard” a0 a1a3a10a1a0a3a2 Some of the words tagged as modals are commonly referred to as adjectives, such as a11 a8a14a9 a0 a1a11 a9a3a2a22a23 ’asur, mutar (allowed, forbidden), though everyone agrees and tags these words as adverbs or participals (see table 1).
However, questions are raised of how to tell apart modals as such from adjectives that show very similar properties: a8 a5a12a3 a3 a18 a3 a8 a0 a11 qaˇse li laleket (it is hard for me to walk).
Ambar (1995) analyzes the usage of adjectives in modal contexts, especially of ability and possibility.
In sentences such as a8 a0 a11 a0 a13a9a11 a3 a3a33a30 a8 a2 a8 a3 a9a5a4 a3 qaˇse lanu lhistagel lara‘aˇs (it is hard for us to get used to the noise) the adjective is used in a modal and not an adverbial meaning, in the sense that meaning of the adverbial a18 a0 a9 a11a22a7 bqwˇsi (with difficulty) and the modal a3 a9 a5 a18 yakwl (can) are unified into a single word a8 a0 a11 . Similarly, the possibility sense of a8 a0 a11 is unified with the modal a11 a0a19a18 a23 ’epˇsar.
In any usage of the adjective as the modal, it is not possible to rephrase a clause in a way that the adjective modifies the noun, i.e., the range is the action itself and not its subject.
(14)a21 a5 a2 a8 a8 a8a27a23 a13 a13 a7a28a3a15a8 a0 a11 qaˇse lbace‘ ’et haheskem hard to-perform PREP the-agreement It is hard to perform the agreement (15)*a8 a0 a11 a21 a5 a2 a8 a8 haheskem kaˇse the-agreement hard The agreement is hard However, following Ambar, there are cases where the usage of a3 a8 a0 a11 qaˇse le is not modal, but an emotional adjective: (16)a9 a8a10a18a24a23 a1 a1 a9 a0 a3 a21a22a18 a13 a4 a1 a8 a0 a11 qaˇse/na‘im lˇsoh.
eh. ’ito hard/pleasant to-chat with-him It is hard/pleasant to chat with him Berman (1980) classifies subjectless constructions in Modern Hebrew, and distinguishes what she calls dative-marked experientials where (mostly) adjective serves as a predicate followed by a dativemarked nominal (17)a21 a18 a18 a1 a7 a8 a4a17a18 a11 a3a7a8 a0 a11 qaˇse le-rinah bah.
ayim hard for-Rina in-the-life It is hard for Rina in life Adjectives that allow this construction are circumstantial and do not describe an inner state: a8 a4a17a18 a11 a8 a7 a9a5a13 a13 rina ‘acuba (Rina is sad) vs.
a8 a4a17a18 a11 a3 a7 a9a3a13 a13 ‘acub lrina (it is sad for Rina).
Another recognized construction is the modal expressions that include sentences with dative marking on the individuals to whom the modality is imputed a8 a5a28a5 a11 a7 a20 a3 a9a3a4 a3 a11 a9a3a2 a23 ’asur lanu ldaber kakah (we are not allowed to talk like this); Berman suggests that the similarity is due to the perception of the experiencer as recipient in both cases; This suggestion implies that Berman does not categorize the modals (’asur, mutar) as adjectives.
Another possible criterion to allow these words to be tagged as modals (following Zadka) is the fact that for Necessary/Obligation modals there exists an ’outside force’ which is the agent of the modal situation.
Therefore, if a8 a5a16a5a7a11 a7 a20 a3 a9a5a4 a3 a11 a9a5a2 a23 ’asur lanu ldaber kakah (we are not allowed to talk like this), this is because someone forbids us from talking, while if a21a22a18a19a18 a1a6a7 a8 a4a17a18 a11 a3a26a8 a0 a11 qaˇse lrinah bah.
ayim (It is hard for Rina in life) then no ”outside force” is obliged to be the agent which makes her life hard.
To 63 conclude we suggest tagging both ’asur and mutar as modals, and we recommend allowing modal tagging for other possible adjectives in this syntactic structure.
4 Conclusion
We recommend the introduction of a modal POS tag in Hebrew, despite the fact that the set of criteria to identify modal usage is a complex combination of syntactic and morphological constraints.
This class covers as many as 3% of the tokens observed in our corpus.
Our main motivation in introducing this tag in our tagset is that the alternative (no modal tag) creates confusion and disagreement: we have shown that both traditional dictionaries and previous computational resources had a high level of disagreement over the class of words we tag as modals.
We have confirmed that our guidelines can be applied consistently by human taggers, with agreement level similar to the rest of the tokens (over 99% pairwise).
We have checked that our guidelines stand the test of the most difficult disagreement types identified by taggers, such as “care to” and “difficult for”.
Finally, the immediate context of modals includes a high proportion of infinitive words.
Infinitive words in Hebrew are particularly ambiguous morphologically, because they begin with the letter a3 l which is a formative letter, and often include the analysis le+ participle, e.g. a11 a9 a0 a0 a3 can be interpreted, depending on context, as liˇsmwr (to guard), leˇsamur (to a guarded), or la-ˇsamur (to the guarded).
Other ambiguities might occur too, e.g., a11 a18 a0 a3 can be interpreted as laˇsir (to sing), le-ˇsir (to a song), or as la-ˇsir (to the song).
We have measured that on average, infinitive verbs in our expanded corpus can be analyzed in 4.9 distinct manners, whereas the overall average for all word tokens is 2.65.
The identification of modals can serve as an anchor which helps disambiguate neighboring infinitive words.
