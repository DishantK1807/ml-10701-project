This assumption has been shown to be wrong in certain applications (Franz, 1997).

The two-Poisson model is suggested as a variation of the Poisson distribution (Bookstein and Swanson, 1974; Church and Gale, 1995b).

5.5.3 kennedy vrs except Both these terms have nearly equal inverse document frequency for the AP corpus (Church, 2000; Umemura and Church, 2000) and will be assigned equal weight.

Hence their findings (Church, 2000) are well explained by our model.

A measure of homogeneity or self-similarity of a corpus can be calculated, by dividing the corpus into two frequency lists based on the term frequency and then calculating the χ 2 statistic between them (Kilgarriff, 1997).

5.5.4 noriega and said These terms were studied in the context of an adaptive language model to demonstrate the fact that the probability of a repeat occurrence of a term in a document defies the “bag of words” independence assumption (Church, 2000).
