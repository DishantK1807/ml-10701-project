2:185 The great response to the call for papers may have been caused by this location or it may just have been a consequence of the rapid growth of our discipline.
3:185 Anyway, the 600 submissions of high average quality we received made it relatively easy for the programme committee to put together an excellent programme.
4:185 After a thorough reviewing process including a period of interactive deliberation, the programme committee selected 145 full papers and 35 poster presentations.
5:185 The central criterion for the selection was scientific quality rather than geographic balance or the desirable spread across subareas.
6:185 We tried to apply a multidimensional concept of quality that does not exclusively favour technically sound engineering papers but also yields some space for challenging scientific insights and first reports on novel approaches.
7:185 Looking at the distribution of the papers among subfields of CL, we made a few observations.
8:185 One concerns the central theme of machine learning.
9:185 Although the term machine learning only appears in the name of one single session, machine learning actually transcends nearly all represented subfields of our discipline.
10:185 After decades of hibernation, the area of machine translation has again become a central field of research.
11:185 Almost all of the MT related submissions are on statistical translation but a growing number of papers describe clever combinations of methods from different paradigms.
12:185 Compared with MT, the area of natural language generation is much less represented, which may partially be due to this years International Language Generation Conference in Ohio.
13:185 The area of information extraction still keeps growing.
14:185 With subareas such as opinion mining, sentiment detection and event extraction it has become rather diversified.
15:185 A special observation concerns specialized types of phrase disambiguation or classification that cannot easily be subsumed under IR or IE since the described methods could also be utilized for summarization, paraphrasing or other application types.
16:185 In general it has become harder to assign method papers to just one traditional technology area.
17:185 This is nicely reflected in the authors choice of multiple keywords from different areas.
18:185 We received only few submissions on speech technologies, in our opinion even less than in earlier COLING conferences.
19:185 Although this development might simply be attributed to the inevitable and ever progressing differentiation of the human language technologies, it may also be the case that the meeting market in this area is well covered by the well known speech conferences.
20:185 This years ACL conference also had just a single speech processing session.
21:185 We hope that our colleagues will forgive us for having been rather strict with double submissions.
22:185 In several cases accepted submissions were finally turned down because a paper with largely overlapping contents has appeared or is scheduled to appear elsewhere.
23:185 We believe that our field has to find a proper way of dealing with the increasing number of professional conferences without sacrificing the basic principles of scientific publishing.
24:185 iii After deciding to enrich COLING 2008 with a Best Paper Award, we received an offer to support the award from the renowned scientific publishing house Springer.
25:185 This prize will first be conferred at this Conference.
26:185 We are grateful to Springer for this generous donation and thank especially Olga Chiarcos for her efforts in this case.
27:185 Together with Olga Chiarcos we also thought about other ways to make COLING even more attractive and visible.
28:185 Olga proposed a special book publication of extended versions of selected ground-breaking COLING papers.
29:185 This is an excellent idea which we are going to implement already for this COLING conference.
30:185 Finally, we want to thank the people who were essential to this academic programme.
31:185 There are the area chairs who have with great commitment and dedication steered the reviewing process to a successful end: Paul Buitelaar, Robert Dale, Mary Dalrymple, Bill Dolan, Robert Gaizauskas, Eva Hajicova, Julia Hirschberg, Chu-Ren Huang, Pierre Isabelle, Mark Johnson, Miles Osborne, Stephen Pulman, Dan Roth, Junichi Tsujii.
32:185 We also wish to gratefully acknowledge the successful work of our numerous reviewers who are listed on pages v-viii.
33:185 Our special gratitude goes to Roger Evans and Christian Spurk.
34:185 Roger has worked hard and uncompromisingly on these proceedings; he has been a very thoughtful and creative publication chair.
35:185 Christian has played a central role in organizing the technical basis for the online reviewing and in the communication with authors, area chairs, reviewers and organizers.
36:185 We would also like to thank the local organizer Harold Somers for his valuable collaboration.
37:185 Less connected with this volume but essential for the overall success of the conference programme were the tutorial chair, Philipp Koehn; the workshops chair, Mark Stevenson, and all the workshop organisers; the demo chairs, Allan Ramsay and Kalina Bontcheva; the people who solicited the urgently needed sponsorships, John Tait and Anne de Roeck; as well as the colleague who recruited the student helpers, Paul Bennett.
38:185 But our greatest thanks, of course, go to the authors for their excellent contributions.
