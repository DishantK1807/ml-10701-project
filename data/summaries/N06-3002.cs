Prosody has been shown to improve performance on several NLP problems, such as topic and sentence segmentation (e.g., (Shriberg et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2004)).

(Quek et al., 2002) describe examples in which gesture correlates with topic shifts in the discourse structure, raising the possibility that topic segmentation and summarization could be aided by gesture features; Cassell et al.(2001) make a similar argument using body posture.

Another important area of research is the generation of multimodal communication in animated agents (e.g., (Cassell et al., 2001; Kopp et al., 2006; Nakano et al., 2003)).
P01-1016 P03-1070
(Nakano et al., 2003) describes how head gestures and eye gaze relate to turn taking and dialogue grounding.

Work The bulk of research on multimodality in the NLP community relates to multimodal dialogue systems (e.g., (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000)).

In (Eisenstein and Davis, 2006b), these features are combined with traditional textual features for coreference resolution, with encouraging results.
N06-2010
An empirical study on this part of the corpus has identified several gesture features that are relevant to coreference resolution (Eisenstein and Davis, 2006a).
