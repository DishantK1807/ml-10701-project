Background The origins of Duluth38 can be found in an ensemble approach based on multiple Naive Bayesian classifiers that perform disambiguation via a majority vote (Pedersen, 2000).

Likewise, (Ng and Lee, 1996) report overall accuracy for the noun interest of 87%, and find that that when their feature set only consists of coâ€“occurrence features the accuracy only drops to 80%.

Our interest in bigrams was indirectly motivated by (Leacock et al., 1998), who describe an ensemble approach made up of local context and topical context.

The frustration with models that lack an intuitive interpretation led to the development of decision trees based on bigram features (Pedersen, 2001a).

This follows the line of reasoning developed by (Leacock et al., 1998) in formulating their ensemble of Naive Bayesian classifiers for word sense disambiguation.

Such descriptions can be found in (Pedersen, 2001b) or (Pedersen, 2002).
