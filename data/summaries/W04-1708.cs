2.1 DP-based Method The DP score between a translation output and references can be calculated by DP matching (Su et al., 1992; Takezawa et al., 1999).
C92-2067
The core technology of the proposed method, i.e., the automatic evaluation of translations, was developed in research aiming at the efficient development of Machine Translation (MT) technology (Su et al., 1992; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002).
C92-2067 P02-1040
2.2 N-gram-based Method Papineni et al.(2002) proposed BLEU, which is an automatic method for evaluating MT quality using N-gram matching.
P02-1040
The unit of utterance corresponds to the unit of “segment” in the original BLEU and NIST studies (Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002).
