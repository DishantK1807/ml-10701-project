Thus, AUTOSEM operates efficiently, free of any hand coded repair rules or any knowledge specifically dedicated to repair unlike other approaches to recovery from parser failure (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Van Noord, 1997; Kasper et al., 1999).
P99-1052
Some partial parsing approaches have been coupled with a post-parsing repair stage (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Ros6 and Waibel, 1994; Ros6, 1997; Van Noord, 1997; Kasper et al., 1999) The goal behind these two stage approaches is to increase the coverage over partial parsing alone at a reasonable computational cost.

Note that the syntactic features that appear in this example are taken from the COMLEX lexicon (Grishman et al., 1994).

Work Recent approaches to robust parsing focus on shallow or partial parsing techniques (Van Noord, 1997; Worm, 1998; Ait-Mokhtar and Chanod, 1997; Abney, 1996).

as it is processed by AUTOSEM using the CARMEL grammar and lexicon, which is built on top of the COMLEX lexicon (Grishman et al., 1994).
