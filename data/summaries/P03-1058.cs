That domain dependence is an important issue affecting the performance of WSD programs has been pointed out by (Escudero et al., 2000).
W00-1322
The research of (Chugur et al., 2002) dealt with sense distinctions across multiple languages.
W02-0805
Li and Li (2002) investigated a bilingual bootstrapping technique, which differs from the method we implemented here.

Training of WSD Classifier Much research has been done on the best supervised learning approach for WSD (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002; Lee and Ng, 2002; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001).
W02-1004 W02-1006
The resulting parallel texts are then input to the GIZA++ software (Och and Ney 2000) for word alignment.
P00-1056
In this paper, we used the WSD program reported in (Lee and Ng, 2002).
W02-1006
The research most similar to ours is the work of Diab and Resnik (2002).
P02-1033
One source to look for potential training data for WSD is parallel texts, as proposed by Resnik and Yarowsky (1997).
W97-0213
Ide et al.(2002) investigated word sense distinctions using parallel corpora.
W02-0808
The lack of large-scale parallel corpora no doubt has impeded progress in this direction, although attempts have been made to mine parallel corpora from the Web (Resnik, 1999).
P99-1068
Related Work Brown et al.(1991) is the first to have explored statistical methods in word sense disambiguation in the context of machine translation.
P91-1034
Various alignment algorithms (Melamed 2001; Och and Ney 2000) have been developed in the past.
