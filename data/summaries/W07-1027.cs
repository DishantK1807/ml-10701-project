The conditional log-linear feature combination framework (Berger, Della Pietra and Della Pietra, 1996) is remarkably simple and effective in practice.

This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.(2006), but we use a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to determine parser actions, which makes parsing extremely fast.

Maximum Entropy Modeling (MaxEnt) (Berger et al., 1996) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) were used to build the classifiers in our solution.
