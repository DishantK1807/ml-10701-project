effectiveness of divergence for detecting phrase structures in a sentence is also shown in (Brill, 1992).

Toward these problems, there were several attempts developed for automatically learning grammars based on rule-based approach(Ootani and Nakagawa, 1995), corpus-based approach(Srill, 1992)(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or hybrid approach(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994b)(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).

More detail can be found in (Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996).

This hypothesis generation is similar to one applied in (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).

Unlike stochastic parsing such as (Magerman, 1995)(Collins, 1996), our approach can parse sentences which fall out the current grammar and suggest the plausible hypothesis rules and the best parses.

In this evaluation, the PARSEVAL measures as defined in (Black and et al., 1991) are used: Precision : number of correct brackets in proposed parses Recall = number of brackets in proposed parses number of correct brackets in proposed parses number of brackets in corpus parses From this result, we found out that the parser can succeed 57.3 % recall and 65.2 % precision for the short sentences (3-9 words).

In this framework, a whole grammar is not acquired from scratch(Mori and Nagao, 1995) or an initial grammar does not need to be assumed(Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994a).
A94-1012 C94-2134
For the partial grammar acquisition, in our previous works, we have proposed a mechanism to acquire a partial grammar automatically from a bracketed corpus based on local contextual information(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1996) and have shown the effectiveness of the derived grammar(Theeramunkong and Okumura, 1997).

Moreover, we make use of the geometric mean of the probability instead of the original probability in order to eliminate the effect of the number of rule applications as done in (Magerman and Marcus, 1991).
