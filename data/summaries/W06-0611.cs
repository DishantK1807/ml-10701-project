Section 4 concludes the paper with a critical assessment of the proposed approach and a discussion of the prospects for application in the construction of corpora comparable in size and quality to existing treebanks (such as, for example, the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993) or the TIGER Treebank for German (Brants et al., 2002)).
