If keywords to be confirmed are defined, the system can confirm them using confidence measures (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000; Hazen et al., 2000) to manage the errors.

Most spoken dialogue systems that have been developed, such as airline information systems (Levin et al., 2000; Potamianos et al., 2000; San-Segundo et al., 2000) and train information systems (Allen et al., 1996; Sturm et al., 1999; Lamel et al., 1999), are categorized here.

We compared our method with a conventional one, which used a confidence measure (CM) based on N-best candidates of the ASR (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000) 5 . In this method, the system generated confirmation only for content words with a confidence measure lower than θ 1 . The thresholds to generate confirmation (θ 1 ) were set to 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8.

We use a syntactic parser KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994) to divide the ASR results into the phrases 2 . 1 Bunsetsu is a commonly used linguistic unit in Japanese, which consists of one or more content words and zero or more functional words that follow.

However, it is not feasible to define such keywords in retrieval for operation manuals (Komatani et al., 2002) or WWW pages, where the target of retrieval is not organized and is written as natural language text.
