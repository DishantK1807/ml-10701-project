There exists only very little other work that considers integration of shallow and deep NLP using an XMLâ€“based architecture, most notably (Grover and Lascarides, 2001).

In (Becker and Frank, 2002) we present a corpusdriven stochastic topological parser for German, based on a topological restructuring of the NEGRA corpus (Brants et al., 1999).

GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg, 1997) is a large lexical database, where words are associated with POS information and semantic sorts, which are organized in a fine-grained hierarchy.

Due to abstraction from constituency decisions at the sub-sentential level, and the essentially POS-driven nature of topological structure, this rather simple probabilistic model yields surprisingly high figures of accuracy and coverage (see Fig.2 and (Becker and Frank, 2002) for more detail), while context-free parsing guarantees efficient processing.

Following the trichotomy of NLP data representation models in (Cunningham et al., 1997), the XML markup contains additive information, while the multi-level chart contains positional and abstraction-based information, e.g., feature structures representing NLP entities in a uniform, linguistically motivated form.

Given the fine-grained syntactic and semantic analysis of the HPSG grammar and its robustness (through SNLP integration), we decided to use the semantic representation (MRS, see (Copestake et al., 2001)) as additional input for IE.
