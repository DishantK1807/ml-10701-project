(Collins and Duffy, 2002) defined a kernel on parse tree and used it to improve parsing.

(Suzuki et al.2002) explored the answer extraction using SVM.

Many previous QA systems (Echihabi et al., 2003; Ravichandran, et al., 2003; Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2002; Ittycheriah, 2001; Xu et al., 2002) have well studied the features in the surface texts.

(Ravichandran et al., 2003) compared two maximum entropy-based QA systems, which view the AE as a classification problem and a re-ranking problem respectively, based on the word frequency features, expected answer class features, question word absent features and word match features.

ISI’s (Echihabi et al.2003; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) statistical-based AE module implemented a noisy-channel model to explain how a given sentence tagged with an answer can be rewritten into a question through a sequence of stochastic operations.
