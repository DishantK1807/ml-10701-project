Note as well that this is not 'bottom-up' parsing in the usual sense either, since where more than one possibility is logically available, the parser makes no attempt to represent them all and cull out tlte false positives later on; there is a strict principle of 'altruism avoidance' (that is, never undertaking computational effort without a guaranteed payoff) which compels the parser to give no answer at all during lThe approach described in Sampson 1986, while quite different in its actual character, is nonetheless similar in spirit to what we are proposing.
