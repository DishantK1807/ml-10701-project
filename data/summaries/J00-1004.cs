Our preferred choice of statistical measure for assigning the costs is the ~ correlation measure (Gale and Church 1991).

Brown et al.1993). In addition to the correlation measure, the cost for a pairing includes a distance measure component that penalizes pairings proportionately to the difference between the (normalized) positions of the source and target words in their respective sentences.

6. Concluding Remarks Formalisms for finite-state and context-free transduction have a long history (e.g., Lewis and Stearns 1968; Aho and Ullman 1972), and such formalisms have been applied to the machine translation problem, both in the finite-state case (e.g., Vilar et al.1996) and the context-free case (e.g., Wu 1997).

At the same time, we believe our method has advantages over the approach developed initially at IBM (Brown et al.1990; Brown et al.1993) for training translation systems automatically.

In the transducers produced by the training method described in this paper, the source and target positions are in the set {-1,0,1}, though we have also used handcoded transducers (Alshawi and Xia 1997) and automatically trained transducers (A1shawl and Douglas 2000) with a larger range of positions.

This contrasts with one of the traditional approaches (e.g., Dorr 1994; Watanabe 1995) to posing the translation problem, i.e., the approach in which translation problems are seen in terms of bridging the gap between the most natural monolingual representations underlying the sentences of each language.
