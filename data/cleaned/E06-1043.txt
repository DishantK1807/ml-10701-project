Automatically Constructing a Lexicon of Verb Phrase Idiomatic Combinations Afsaneh Fazly Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, ON M5S 3H5 Canada afsaneh@cs.toronto.edu Suzanne Stevenson Department of Computer Science University of Toronto Toronto, ON M5S 3H5 Canada suzanne@cs.toronto.edu Abstract We investigate the lexical and syntactic flexibility of a class of idiomatic expressions.
We develop measures that draw on such linguistic properties, and demonstrate that these statistical, corpus-based measures can be successfully used for distinguishing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.
We also propose a means for automatically determining which syntactic forms a particular idiom can appear in, and hence should be included in its lexical representation.
1 Introduction
The term idiom has been applied to a fuzzy category with prototypical examples such as by and large, kick the bucket, and let the cat out of the bag.
Providing adefinitive answerforwhatidioms are, and determining how they are learned and understood, are still subject to debate (Glucksberg, 1993; Nunberg et al., 1994).
Nonetheless, they are often defined as phrases or sentences that involve some degree of lexical, syntactic, and/or semantic idiosyncrasy.
Idiomatic expressions, as a part of the vast family of figurative language, are widely used both in colloquial speech and in written language.
Moreover, a phrase develops its idiomaticity over time (Cacciari, 1993); consequently, new idioms come into existence on a daily basis (Cowie et al., 1983; Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).
Idioms thus pose a serious challenge, both for the creation of widecoverage computational lexicons, and for the development of large-scale, linguistically plausible natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al., 2002).
One problem is due to the range of syntactic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic expressions.
Some idioms, such as by and large, contain syntactic violations; these are often completely fixed and hence can be listed in a lexicon as “words with spaces” (Sag et al., 2002).
However, among those idioms that are syntactically well-formed, some exhibit limited morphosyntactic flexibility, while others may be more syntactically flexible.
For example, theidiom shoot the breezeundergoes verbalinflection(shot the breeze), but not internal modification orpassivization (?shoot the fun breeze, ?the breeze was shot).
In contrast, the idiom spill the beans undergoes verbal inflection, internal modification, and even passivization.
Clearly, a words-withspaces approach does not capture the full range of behaviour of such idiomatic expressions.
Another barrier to the appropriate handling of idioms in a computational system is their semantic idiosyncrasy.
This is aparticular issue for those idioms that conform to the grammar rules of the language.
Such idiomatic expressions are indistinguishable on the surface from compositional (nonidiomatic) phrases, but a computational system must be capable of distinguishing the two.
For example, a machine translation system should translate the idiom shoot the breeze as a single unit of meaning (“to chat”), whereas this is not the case for the literal phrase shoot the bird.
In this study, we focus on a particular class of English phrasal idioms, i.e., those that involve the combination of a verb plus a noun in its direct object position.
Examples include shoot the breeze, pull strings, and push one’s luck.
We refer to these as verb+noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs).
The class of VNICs accommodates a large number of idiomatic expressions (Cowie et al., 1983; Nunberg etal., 1994).
Moreover, their peculiar be337 haviour signifies the need for a distinct treatment in a computational lexicon (Fellbaum, 2005).
Despite this, VNICs have been granted relatively little attention within the computational linguistics community.
We look into two closely related problems confronting the appropriate treatment of VNICs: (i) the problem of determining their degree of flexibility; and (ii) the problem of determining their level of idiomaticity.
Section 2 elaborates on the lexicosyntactic flexibility of VNICs, and how this relates to their idiomaticity.
In Section 3, we propose two linguistically-motivated statistical measures for quantifying the degree of lexical and syntactic inflexibility (or fixedness) of verb+noun combinations.
Section 4 presents an evaluation of the proposed measures.
In Section 5, we put forward a technique for determining the syntactic variations that a VNIC can undergo, and that should be included in its lexical representation.
Section 6 summarizes our contributions.
2 Flexibility
and Idiomaticity of VNICs Although syntactically well-formed, VNICs involve a certain degree of semantic idiosyncrasy.
Unlike compositional verb+noun combinations, the meaning of VNICs cannot be solely predicted from the meaning of their parts.
There is much evidence in the linguistic literature that the semantic idiosyncrasy of idiomatic combinations is reflected in their lexical and/or syntactic behaviour.
2.1 Lexical
and Syntactic Flexibility A limited number of idioms have one (or more) lexical variants, e.g., blow one’s own trumpet and toot one’s own horn (examples from Cowie et al.1983). However, most are lexically fixed (nonproductive) to a large extent.
Neither shoot the wind nor fling the breeze are typically recognized as variations of the idiom shoot the breeze.
Similarly, spill the beans has an idiomatic meaning (“to reveal a secret”), while spill the peas and spread the beans have only literal interpretations.
Idiomatic combinations are also syntactically peculiar: most VNICs cannot undergo syntactic variations and at the same time retain their idiomatic interpretations.
It is important, however, tonotethatVNICsdifferwithrespecttothedegree of syntactic flexibility they exhibit.
Some are syntactically inflexible for the most part, while others are more versatile; as illustrated in 1 and 2: 1.
(a) Tim and Joy shot the breeze.
(b) ??
Tim and Joy shot a breeze.
(c) ??
Tim and Joy shot the breezes.
(d) ??
Tim and Joy shot the fun breeze.
(e) ??
The breeze was shot by Tim and Joy.
(f) ??
The breeze that Tim and Joy kicked was fun.
2. (a) Tim spilled the beans.
(b) ? Tim spilled some beans.
(c) ??
Tim spilled the bean.
(d) Tim spilled the official beans.
(e) The beans were spilled by Tim.
(f) The beans that Tim spilled troubled Joe.
Linguists have explained the lexical and syntactic flexibility of idiomatic combinations in terms of their semantic analyzability (e.g., Glucksberg 1993; Fellbaum 1993; Nunberg et al.1994). Semantic analyzability is inversely related to idiomaticity.
For example, the meaning of shoot the breeze, a highly idiomatic expression, has nothing todowith either shoot or breeze.
Incontrast, aless idiomatic expression, such as spill the beans, can be analyzed as spill corresponding to “reveal” and beans referring to “secret(s)”.
Generally, the constituents ofasemantically analyzable idiom can be mapped onto their corresponding referents in the idiomatic interpretation.
Hence analyzable (less idiomatic) expressions are often more open to lexical substitution and syntactic variation.
2.2 Our
Proposal We use the observed connection between idiomaticity and (in)flexibility to devise statistical measures for automatically distinguishing idiomatic from literal verb+noun combinations.
While VNICs vary in their degree of flexibility (cf.
1 and 2 above; see also Moon 1998), on the whole they contrast with compositional phrases, which are more lexically productive and appear in a wider range of syntactic forms.
We thus propose to use the degree of lexical and syntactic flexibilityofagivenverb+noun combination todetermine the level of idiomaticity of the expression.
It is important to note that semantic analyzability is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for an idiomatic combination to be lexically or syntactically flexible.
Other factors, such as the communicative intentions and pragmatic constraints, can motivate a speaker to use a variant in place of a canonical form (Glucksberg, 1993).
Nevertheless, lexical and syntactic flexibility may well be used as partial indicators of semantic analyzability, and hence idiomaticity.
338 3 Automatic Recognition of VNICs Here we describe our measures for idiomaticity, whichquantify thedegreeoflexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of a given verb+noun combination, represented as a verb–noun pair.
(Note that our measures quantify fixedness, not flexibility.) 3.1 Measuring Lexical Fixedness AVNICislexically fixedifthereplacement ofany of its constituents by a semantically (and syntactically) similar word generally does not result in another VNIC, but in an invalid or a literal expression.
One way of measuring lexical fixedness of a given verb+noun combination is thus to examine theidiomaticity ofitsvariants, i.e., expressions generated by replacing one of the constituents by a similar word.
This approach has two main challenges: (i) it requires prior knowledge about the idiomaticity of expressions (which is what we are developing our measure to determine); (ii) it needs information on “similarity” among words.
Inspired by Lin(1999), weexamine the strength of association between the verb and noun constituents of the target combination and its variants, as an indirect cue to their idiomaticity.
We use the automatically-built thesaurus of Lin (1998) to find similar words to the noun of the target expression, in order to automatically generate variants.
Only the noun constituent is varied, since replacing the verb constituent of a VNIC with a semantically related verb is more likely to yield another VNIC, as in keep/lose one’s cool (Nunberg et al., 1994).
Let a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a14a13a16a15a17a9a18a5a20a19a22a21a24a23a26a25a27a23a29a28a31a30 be the set of the a28 most similar nouns to the noun a9 of the target pair a32a34a33a36a35 a9a38a37. We calculate the association strength for the target pair, and for each of its variants, a32a39a33a36a35 a9 a5 a37, using pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Church et al., 1991): a40a42a41a44a43 a7 a33a36a35 a9a46a45a47a11a48a13 a49a51a50a53a52a55a54 a7 a33a36a35 a9 a45 a11 a54 a7 a33 a11 a54 a7a10a9 a45 a11 a13 a49a51a50a53a52 a19a56a26a57a34a58a59a19a61a60a62a7 a33a36a35 a9a46a45a47a11 a60a62a7 a33a36a35a64a63 a11a62a60a65a7 a63a66a35 a9 a45 a11 (1) where a67 a23a69a68a70a23a31a28 and a9a36a71 is the target noun; a56 is the set of all transitive verbs in the corpus; a58 is the set of all nouns appearing as the direct object of some verb; a60a2a7 a33a72a35 a9 a45 a11 is the frequency of a33 and a9 a45 occurring as a verb–object pair; a60a62a7 a33a36a35a64a63 a11 is the total frequency of the target verb with any noun in a58 ; a60a2a7 a63a66a35 a9 a45 a11 is the total frequency of the noun a9 a45 in the direct object position of any verb in a56 . Lin (1999) assumes that a target expression is non-compositional if and only if its a40a73a41a74a43 value is significantly different from that of any of the variants.
Instead, we propose a novel technique thatbringstogether theassociation strengths (a40a42a41a44a43 values) of the target and the variant expressions into a single measure reflecting the degree of lexical fixedness for the target pair.
We assume that the target pair is lexically fixed to the extent that its a40a42a41a44a43 deviates from the average a40a42a41a44a43 of its variants.
Our measure calculates this deviation, normalized using the sample’s standard deviation: a75a62a76a51a77a79a78a81a80a18a82a18a78a81a83a84a83a86a85a88a87a90a89 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11a48a13 a40a42a41a44a43 a7 a33a36a35 a9a12a11a62a92 a40a42a41a44a43 a93 (2) a40a73a41a74a43 is the mean and a93 the standard deviation of the sample; a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a84a85a88a87a97a89 a7 a33a72a35 a9a12a11a38a98a100a99a94a92a102a101 a35a104a103 a101a106a105 . 3.2 Measuring Syntactic Fixedness Compared to compositional verb+noun combinations, VNICs are expected to appear in more restricted syntactic forms.
To quantify the syntactic fixedness of a target verb–noun pair, we thus need to: (i) identify relevant syntactic patterns, i.e., those that help distinguish VNICs from literalverb+noun combinations; (ii) translate thefrequency distribution of the target pair in the identified patterns into a measure of syntactic fixedness.
3.2.1 Identifying
Relevant Patterns Determining a unique set of syntactic patterns appropriate for the recognition of all idiomatic combinations is difficult indeed: exactly which formsanidiomatic combination can occur inisnot entirely predictable (Sag et al., 2002).
Nonetheless, there are hypotheses about the difference in behaviour of VNICs and literal verb+noun combinations with respect to particular syntactic variations (Nunberg et al., 1994).
Linguists note that semantic analyzability is related to the referential status of the noun constituent, which is in turn related to participation in certain morphosyntactic forms.
In what follows, we describe three types of variation that are tolerated by literal combinations, but are prohibited by many VNICs.
Passivization There is much evidence in the linguistic literature that VNICs often do not undergo passivization.1 Linguists mainly attribute this to the fact that only a referential noun can appear as the surface subject of a passive construction.
1There are idiomatic combinations that are used only in a passivized form; we do not consider such cases in our study.
339 Determiner Type A strong correlation exists between the flexibility of the determiner preceding the noun in a verb+noun combination and the overall flexibility of the phrase (Fellbaum, 1993).
It is however important to note that the nature of the determiner is also affected by other factors, such as the semantic properties of the noun.
Pluralization While the verb constituent of a VNIC is morphologically flexible, the morphological flexibility of the noun relates to its referential status.
A non-referential noun constituent is expected to mainly appear in just one of the singular or plural forms.
The pluralization of the noun is of course also affected by its semantic properties.
Merging the three variation types results in a pattern set, a0 a0, of a1a2a1 distinct syntactic patterns, given in Table 1.2 3.2.2 Devising a Statistical Measure Thesecond stepistodeviseastatistical measure that quantifies the degree of syntactic fixedness of a verb–noun pair, with respect to the selected set of patterns, a0 a0 . We propose a measure that compares the “syntactic behaviour” of the target pair with that of a “typical” verb–noun pair.
Syntactic behaviour of a typical pair is defined as the prior probability distribution over the patterns in a0 a0 . The prior probability of an individual pattern a3a5a4 a98 a0 a0 is estimated as: a54 a7a7a6a9a8a86a11a48a13 a10 a11a13a12a15a14a17a16 a10 a18a20a19a21a14a23a22 a60a2a7 a33 a3 a35 a9a46a45 a35 a3a5a4 a11 a10 a11a24a12a25a14a17a16 a10 a18a20a19a21a14a26a22 a10 a27a29a28a31a30a26a14a33a32a35a34 a60a2a7 a33 a3 a35 a9 a45 a35 a3a5a4a37a36 a11 The syntactic behaviour of the target verb–noun pair a32a34a33a72a35 a9 a37 is defined as the posterior probability distribution over the patterns, given the particular pair.
The posterior probability of an individual pattern a3a5a4 is estimated as: a54 a7a7a6a9a8 a19a20a38 a35a40a39 a11a48a13 a54 a7 a33a36a35 a9 a35 a3a5a4 a11 a54 a7 a33a72a35 a9a12a11 a13 a60a62a7 a33a36a35 a9 a35 a3a5a4 a11 a10 a27a29a28a31a30a41a14a17a32a35a34 a60a62a7 a33a72a35 a9 a35 a3a5a4a37a36 a11 The degree of syntactic fixedness of the target verb–noun pair is estimated as the divergence of its syntactic behaviour (the posterior distribution 2We collapse some patterns since with a larger pattern set the measure may require larger corpora to perform reliably.

The divergence of the two probability distributions is calculated using a standard information-theoretic measure, the Kullback Leibler (KL-)divergence: a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83 a83a53a52a37a54a26a55 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11 a13 a56a44a7 a54 a7 a3a5a4 a19 a33a72a35 a9a12a11a91a19a51a19 a54 a7 a3a5a4 a11a86a11 a13 a10 a27a29a28a31a30a23a14a33a32a35a34 a54 a7 a3a5a4a37a36 a19 a33a36a35 a9a12a11a79a49a51a50a53a52 a54 a7 a3a57a4a37a36 a19 a33a72a35 a9a12a11 a54 a7 a3a5a4a37a36 a11 (3) KL-divergence is always non-negative and is zero if and only if the two distributions are exactly the same.
Thus, a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a58a52a37a54a26a55 a7 a33a72a35 a9a91a11a73a98a100a99a67a95a35a104a103 a101a106a105 . KL-divergence is argued to be problematic because it is not a symmetric measure.
Nonetheless, it has proven useful in many NLP applications (Resnik, 1999; Dagan et al., 1994).
Moreover, the asymmetry is not an issue here since we are concerned with the relative distance of several posterior distributions from the same prior.
3.3 A
Hybrid Measure of Fixedness VNICs are hypothesized to be, in most cases, both lexically and syntactically more fixed than literal verb+noun combinations (see Section 2).
We thus propose a new measure of idiomaticity to be a measure of the overall fixedness of a given pair.
We define a75a62a76a51a77a79a78a81a80a18a82a18a78a81a83a84a83a60a59a13a61a84a87a13a62a15a63 a85a88a85 a7 a33a72a35 a9a12a11 as: a75a62a76a51a77a79a78a81a80a18a82a18a78a81a83a84a83a53a59a20a61a84a87a24a62a15a63 a85a88a85 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11 a13 a64 a75a2a76a94a77a79a78a81a80a72a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a53a52a65a54a21a55 a7 a33a72a35 a9a12a11 a103 a7 a1 a92a66a64a62a11 a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83 a83a86a85a88a87a90a89 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11 (4) where a64 weights the relative contribution of the measures in predicting idiomaticity.
4 Evaluation
of the Fixedness Measures To evaluate our proposed fixedness measures, we determine their appropriateness asindicators ofidiomaticity.
We pose a classification task in which idiomatic verb–noun pairs are distinguished from literal ones.
We use each measure to assign scores 340 to the experimental pairs (see Section 4.2 below).
We then classify the pairs by setting a threshold, here the median score, where all expressions with scores higher than the threshold are labeled as idiomatic and the rest as literal.
We assess the overall goodness of a measure by looking at its accuracy (Acc) and the relative reduction in error rate (RER) on the classification task described above.
The RER of a measure reflects the improvement in its accuracy relative to another measure (often a baseline).
We consider two baselines: (i) a random baseline, a0a2a1 a82a18a80, that randomly assigns a label (literal or idiomatic) to each verb–noun pair; (ii) a more informed baseline, a40a42a41a44a43, an information-theoretic measure widely used for extracting statistically significant collocations.3 4.1 Corpus and Data Extraction We use the British National Corpus (BNC; “http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/”) to extract verb– noun pairs, along with information on the syntactic patterns they appear in.
We automatically parse the corpus using the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and further process it using TGrep2 (Rohde, 2004).
For each instance of a transitive verb, we use heuristics to extract the noun phrase (NP) in either the direct object position (if the sentence is active), or the subject position (if the sentence is passive).
We then use NP-head extraction software4 to get the head noun of the extracted NP, its number (singular or plural), and the determiner introducing it.
4.2 Experimental
Expressions We select our development and test expressions from verb–noun pairs that involve a member of a predefined list of (transitive) “basic” verbs.
Basic verbs, in their literal use, refer to states or acts that are central to human experience.
They are thus frequent, highly polysemous, and tend to combine with other words to form idiomatic combinations (Nunberg et al., 1994).
An initial list of suchverbswasselected fromseveral linguistic and psycholinguistic studies on basic vocabulary (e.g., Pauwels 2000; Newman and Rice 2004).
We further augmented this initial list with verbs that are semantically related to another verb already in the 3As in Eqn.
(1), our calculation of PMI here restricts the verb–noun pair to the direct object relation.
4We use a modified version of the software provided by Eric Joanis based on heuristics from (Collins, 1999).
list; e.g., lose is added in analogy with find.
The final list of 28 verbs is: blow, bring, catch, cut, find, get, give, have, hear, hit, hold, keep, kick, lay, lose, make, move, place, pull, push, put, see, set, shoot, smell, take, throw, touch From the corpus, we extract all verb–noun pairs withminimum frequency of a1 a67 that contain abasic verb.
From these, we semi-randomly select an idiomatic and a literal subset.5 A pair is considered idiomatic if it appears in a credible idiom dictionary, such as the Oxford Dictionary of Current Idiomatic English (ODCIE) (Cowie et al., 1983), or the Collins COBUILD Idioms Dictionary (CCID) (Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).
Otherwise, the pair is considered literal.
We then randomly pull out a1a4a3 a67 development and a5 a67a53a67 test pairs (half idiomatic and half literal), ensuring both low and high frequency items are included.
Sample idioms corresponding to the extracted pairs are: kick the habit, move mountains, lose face, and keep one’s word.
4.3 Experimental
Setup Development expressions are used in devising the fixedness measures, as well as in determining the values of the parameters a28 in Eqn.
(2) and a64 in Eqn.
(4). a28 determines the maximum number of nouns similar to the target noun, to be considered in measuring the lexical fixedness of a given pair.
The value of this parameter is determined by performing experiments over the development data, in which a28 ranges from a1 a67 to a1 a67a53a67 by steps of a1 a67 ; a28 is set to a6 a67 based on the results.
We also experimented with different values of a64 ranging from a67 to a1 by steps of a7 a1 . Based on the development results, thebest value for a64 is a7a9a8 (giving moreweight to the syntactic fixedness measure).
Testexpressions aresaved asunseen data forthe final evaluation.
We further divide the set of all testexpressions, TESTa63 a85a88a85,intotwosetscorresponding to two frequency bands: TESTa10a12a11a13a15a14 contains a6 a67 idiomatic and a6 a67 literal pairs, each with total frequency between a1 a67 and a16a66a67 (a1 a67 a23a20a60a18a17a20a19a20a21a96a7 a33a36a35 a9 a35a12a63 a11a23a22 a16a66a67 ); TESTa10a12a24a26a25a27a28a24 consists of a6 a67 idiomatic and a6 a67 literal pairs, each with total frequency of a16a66a67 or greater (a60a18a17a20a19a20a21a96a7 a33a36a35 a9 a35a91a63 a11a30a29 a16a66a67 ).
All frequency counts are over the entire BNC.
4.4 Results
We first examine the performance of the individual fixedness measures, a75a2a76a94a77a79a78a81a80a72a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a104a85a88a87a90a89 and 5In selecting literal pairs, we choose those that involve a physical act corresponding to the basic semantics of the verb.

(Results for the overall measure are presented later in this section).
As can be seen, the informed baseline, a40a42a41a44a43, shows a large improvement over the random baseline (a5 a8 a33 error reduction).
This shows that one can get relatively good performance by treating verb+noun idiomatic combinations as collocations.

This result shows that, as hypothesized, lexical fixedness is areasonably good predictor of idiomaticity.
Nonetheless, the performance signifies a need for improvement.
Possibly the most beneficial enhancement would be a change in the way we acquire the similar nouns for a target noun.
The best performance (shown in boldface) belongs to a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a60a52a65a54a21a55, with a16a66a67 a33 error reduction over the random baseline, and a5 a67 a33 error reduction over the informed baseline.
These results demonstrate that syntactic fixedness is a good indicator of idiomaticity, better than a simple measure of collocation (a40a73a41a74a43 ), or a measure of lexical fixedness.
These results further suggest that looking into deep linguistic properties of VNICs is both necessary and beneficial for the appropriate treatment of these expressions.
a40a73a41a74a43 is known to perform poorly on low frequency data.
To examine the effect of frequency on the measures, we analyze their performance on the two divisions of the test data, corresponding to the two frequency bands, TESTa10a12a11 a13a15a14 and TESTa10a12a24a26a25 a27a28a24 . Results are given in Table 3, with the best performance shown in boldface.
As expected, the performance of a40a73a41a74a43 drops substantially for low frequency items.
Interestingly, although it is a PMI-based measure, a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a86a85a88a87a97a89 performs slightly better when the data is separated based on frequency.

These results reflect that our fixedness measures are not as sensitive tofrequency as a40a42a41a44a43 . Hence they can be used with a higher degree of confidence, especially when applied to data that is heterogeneous with regard to frequency.
This is important because while some VNICs are very common, others have very low frequency.
Table 4 presents the performance of the hybrid measure, a75a2a76a94a77a79a78a81a80a72a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a58a59a13a61a84a87a24a62a25a63 a85a88a85, repeating that of a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a84a85a88a87a90a89 and a75a2a76a94a77a79a78a81a80a72a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a60a52a37a54a26a55 for comparison.
a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a60a59a13a61a84a87a24a62a25a63 a85a88a85 outperforms both lexical and syntactic fixedness measures, with a substantial improvement over a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83 a85a88a87a90a89, and a small, but notable, improvement over a75a2a76a94a77a95a78a81a80a18a82a96a78a81a83a84a83a21a52a37a54a26a55 . Each of the lexical and syntactic fixedness measures is a good indicator of idiomaticity on its own, with syntactic fixedness being a better predictor.
Here we demonstrate that combining them into a single measure of fixedness, while giving more weight to the better measure, results in a more effective predictor of idiomaticity.
5 Determining
the Canonical Forms Our evaluation of the fixedness measures demonstrates their usefulness for the automatic recognition of idiomatic verb–noun pairs.
To represent such pairs in a lexicon, however, we must determine their canonical form(s)—Cforms henceforth.
For example, the lexical representation of a32 shoot, breeze a37 should include shoot the breeze as a Cform.
Since VNICs are syntactically fixed, they are mostly expected to have a single Cform.
Nonetheless, there are idioms with two or more accept342 able forms.
For example, hold fire and hold one’s fire are both listed in CCID as variations of the same idiom.
Our approach should thus be capable of predicting all allowable forms for a given idiomatic verb–noun pair.
Weexpect aVNICtooccurinitsCform(s)more frequently than it occurs in anyother syntactic patterns.
To discover the Cform(s) for a given idiomatic verb–noun pair, we thus examine its frequency of occurrence in each syntactic pattern in a0 a0 . Since it is possible for an idiom to have more than one Cform, we cannot simply take the most dominant pattern as the canonical one.
Instead, we calculate a a0 -score for the target pair a32a102a33a72a35 a9a12a37 and each pattern a3a5a4a65a36 a98 a0 a0 : a0 a36 a7 a33a72a35 a9a12a11 a13 a60a62a7 a33a72a35 a9 a35 a3a5a4a37a36 a11a62a92 a60 a93 inwhicha60 isthemeanand a93 thestandard deviation over the sample a15a84a60a62a7 a33a36a35 a9 a35 a3a57a4a65a36 a11a91a19 a3a5a4a37a36 a98 a0 a0 a30 . The statistic a0 a36 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11 indicates how far and in which direction the frequency of occurrence of the pair a32 a33a36a35 a9 a37 in pattern a6 a8a2a1 deviates from the sample’smean, expressed inunits ofthesample’s standard deviation.
To decide whether a3a5a4a25a36 is a canonical pattern for the target pair, we check whether a0 a36 a7 a33a36a35 a9a91a11a4a3a6a5a8a7, where a5a9a7 is a threshold.
For evaluation, we set a5a9a7 to a1, based on the distribution of a10 and through examining the development data.
We evaluate the appropriateness of this approach in determining the Cform(s) of idiomatic pairs by verifying its predicted forms against ODCIE and CCID.
Specifically, for each of the a1 a67a53a67 idiomatic pairs in TESTa63 a85a88a85, we calculate the precision and recall of its predicted Cforms (those whose a0 -scores are above a5a11a7 ), compared to the Cforms listed in the two dictionaries.
The average precision across the 100 test pairs is 81.7%, and the average recall is 88.0% (with 69 of the pairs having 100% precision and 100% recall).
Moreover, we find that for the overwhelming majority of the pairs, a8 a3 a33, the predicted Cform with the highest a0 -score appears in the dictionary entry of the pair.
Thus, our method of detecting Cforms performs quite well.
6 Discussion
and Conclusions The significance of the role idioms play in language has long been recognized.
However, due to their peculiar behaviour, idioms have been mostly overlooked by the NLP community.
Recently, there has been growing awareness of the importance of identifying non-compositional multiword expressions (MWEs).
Nonetheless, most research on the topic has focused on compound nouns and verb particle constructions.
Earlier work on idiomshaveonlytouched thesurface oftheproblem, failing to propose explicit mechanisms for appropriately handling them.
Here, we provide effective mechanisms for the treatment of a broadly documented and crosslinguistically frequent class of idioms, i.e., VNICs.
Earlier research on the lexical encoding of idioms mainly relied on the existence of human annotations, especially for detecting which syntactic variations (e.g., passivization) an idiom can undergo (Villavicencio et al., 2004).
We propose techniques for the automatic acquisition and encoding of knowledge about the lexicosyntactic behaviour of idiomatic combinations.
We put forwardameans for automatically discovering the set ofsyntactic variations that aretolerated byaVNIC and that should be included in its lexical representation.
Moreover, weincorporate suchinformation into statistical measures that effectively predict the idiomaticity level of a given expression.
In this regard, our work relates to previous studies on determining the compositionality (inverse of idiomaticity) of MWEs other than idioms.
Most previous work on compositionality of MWEs either treat them as collocations (Smadja, 1993), or examine the distributional similarity between the expression and its constituents (McCarthy et al., 2003; Baldwin et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003).
Lin (1999) and Wermter and Hahn (2005) go one step further and look into a linguistic property of non-compositional compounds—their lexical fixedness—to identify them.
Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) combine aspects of the above-mentioned work, by incorporatinglexical fixedness, collocation-based, anddistributional similarity measures into a set of features which are used to rank verb+noun combinations according to their compositionality.
Our work differs from such studies in that it carefully examines several linguistic properties of VNICs that distinguish them from literal (compositional) combinations.
Moreover, we suggest novel techniques for translating such characteristics into measures that predict the idiomaticity level of verb+noun combinations.
More specifically, we propose statistical measures that quantify the degree of lexical, syntactic, and overall fixedness of such combinations.
We demonstrate 343 that these measures can be successfully applied to the task of automatically distinguishing idiomatic combinations from non-idiomatic ones.
We also show that our syntactic and overall fixedness measures substantially outperform a widely used measure of collocation, a40a42a41a44a43, even when the latter takes syntactic relations into account.
Others have also drawn on the notion of syntactic fixedness for idiom detection, though specific to a highly constrained type of idiom (Widdows and Dorow, 2005).
Our syntactic fixedness measure looks into a broader set of patterns associated with a large class of idiomatic expressions.
Moreover, our approach is general and can be easily extended to other idiomatic combinations.
Each measure we use to identify VNICs captures a different aspect of idiomaticity: a40a73a41a74a43 reflects the statistical idiosyncrasy of VNICs, while the fixedness measures draw on their lexicosyntactic peculiarities.
Our ongoing work focuses on combining these measures to distinguish VNICs from other idiosyncratic verb+noun combinations that are neither purely idiomatic nor completely literal, so that we can identify linguistically plausible classes of verb+noun combinations on this continuum (Fazly and Stevenson, 2005).
