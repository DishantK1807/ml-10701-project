Our experiment also shows that, compare to using only LM like it in Chen & Lee (2000), TM shows significantly better result in character accuracy (from 81.0% to 91.4% in our experiment: “DU0” a18 “DU1”, table 4).

In statistical based English-Korean transliteration, to convert English word E to Korean word K, a model could use Korean LM Pr(K) and TM Pr(E|K) (Lee, 1999; Kim et.al, 1999) to maximize Pr(K|E), or use English LM Pr(E) and TM Pr(K|E) to maximize Pr(E,K) (Jung et, al., 2000).

So we assume the user input is perfect, and employ a transfer model instead of the typing model in Chen and Lee (2000).

And like the model in Pinyin IME (Chen and Lee, 2000), we also try to use a Hanja LM Pr(T), to measure the probabilities of hypothesized Hanja and/or Hangeul sequences.

The character accuracy is lower than the typing and language model based Chinese Pinyin IME, which was 95% in Chen & Lee (2000).

To convert Pinyin P to Chinese characters H, Chen and Lee (2000) used Bayes law to maximize Pr(H|P), in which a LM Pr(H) and a typing model Pr(P|H) are included.

The word co-occurrence pattern (Yamashita, 1988) and case-frame based approach (Abe, 1986) were reported with a quite high precision.
