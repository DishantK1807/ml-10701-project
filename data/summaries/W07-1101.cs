In computational linguistics, a great deal of work has been done on the extraction of collocations in the last decade and a half (see Pecina (2005) for a survey).
P05-2003
Fazly and Stevenson (2006) propose a measure for detecting the syntactic fixedness of English verb phrases of the same variety as us.
E06-1043
There have also been a number of papers focusing on the detection of semantic non-compositional items in recent years beginning with the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2001).

In an evalutaion of RASP, Preiss(2003)reportsanprecisionof85.83andrecall of 78.48 for the direct object relation, 69.45/57.72 for the ?ncmod??relation, and 91.15/98.77 for the ?detmod??relation.

This is consistent with results reported by Evert and Krenn (2001).
P01-1025
work Wermter and Hahn (2004) explore one kind of syntactic fixedness: the (non-)modifiability of preposition-noun-verb combinations in German.

The evaluation procedure used here (first suggested by Evert and Krenn (2001) for evaluating measures of lexical association) involves producing andevaluatingjustsucharanking.
P01-1025
The small amount of previous work on the identification of syntactic fixedness (Wermter and Hahn (2004), Fazly and Stevenson (2006)) has either focused on a single variation variety, or has only been evaluated for combinations of a small preselected list of words, presumably due to noise.
