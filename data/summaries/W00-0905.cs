Roland & Jurafsky (1998, 2000 in press) showed that there were subcategorization frequency differences between various written and spoken corpora, and furthermore showed that that these subcategorization frequency differences are caused by variation in word sense as well as genre and discourse type differences among the corpora.

Data for 64 verbs (shown in Table 1) was collected from three corpora; The British National Corpus (BNC) (http'J/info.ox.ac.uk/bnc/index.html), the Penn Treehank parsed version of the Brown Corpus (Brown), and the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpas (WSJ) (Marcus et al.1993). The 64 verbs were chosen on the basis of the requirements of separate psychological experiments including having a single dominant sense, being easily imagable" and participating in one of several subcategorization alternations.

Biber (1993) and Biber et al.(1998) have shown that that word frequency, word sense (as defined by collocates), the distribution of synonymous words and the use of syntactic structures varies with corpus genre.
