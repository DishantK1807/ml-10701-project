Bar-Haim et al.(2005) use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to implement a segmenter and a tagger for Hebrew.

Our best result, 91.44% accuracy, reflects a reduction of 25% in error rate compared to the previous state of the art (Adler and Elhadad, 2006), and almost 40% compared to the baseline.

We reconfirm the results of Daya et al.(2004) and Habash and Rambow (2005), which show that decoupling complex morphological tasks into several simple tasks improves the accuracy of classification.

A supervised approach to morphological disambiguation of Arabic is given by Habash and Rambow (2005), who use two corpora of 120K words each to train several classifiers.

SNoW has already been used successfully as the learning vehicle in a large collection of natural language related tasks and compared favorably with other classifiers (Punyakanok and Roth, 2001; Florian, 2002).

Recently, Adler and Elhadad (2006) presented an unsupervised, HMM-based model for Hebrew morphological disambiguation, using a morphological analyzer as the only resource.

First, we define a na¨ıve combination along the lines of Habash and Rambow (2005).

This is the exact setup of the experiments reported by Adler and Elhadad (2006).

Levinger et al.(1995) were the first to apply it to Hebrew, but their work was hampered by the lack of annotated corpora for training and evaluation.
