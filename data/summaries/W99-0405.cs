Many of these can be lexically or syntactically identified, as the ETS GMAT research shows (Burstein et al., 1998).
P98-1032
For instance Pereira and Schabes (1992) demonstrate that a grammar learning algorithm with a simple constraint on binary branching (CNF) achieves less than 40% accuracy after training on an unbracketed corpus.
P92-1017
Although the features deal with suprasentential structure, the reported variables (Burstein et al., 1998) 27 are identified via lexical information and shallow constituent parsing, arguably not modeling the human process.
P98-1032
Fairly robust results (n '~ 0.8) have been achieved in the commercial domain modeling the human rater results, with both the Electronic Essay Rater (erater) system for written essay scoring (Burstein et al., 1998), and the PhonePass pronunciation assessment (Ordinate, 1998).
