STATISTICAL TRANSLATION Following Brown et al.\[Brown et al., 1990\], we choose as the translation of a French sentence F that sentence E for which Pr (E\[F) is greatest.
J90-2002
The translation model used by Brown et al.\[Brown et al., 1990\] incorporates the concept of an alignment in which each word in E acts independently to produce some of the words in F.
J90-2002
\[Brown et al., 1988\] Brown, P.

From the Viterbi alignments for 1,002,165 pairs of short French and English sentences from the Canadian Hansard data \[Brown et al., 1990\], we have extracted a set of 12,028,485 connections.

Brown et al.\[Brown et al., 1990\], show an example of such an automatically derived alignment in their Figure 3.

This system is an enhanced version of the one described by Brown et al.\[Brown et al., 1990\] in that it uses a trigram language model, and has a French vocabulary of 57,802 words, and an English vocabulary of 40,809 words.
