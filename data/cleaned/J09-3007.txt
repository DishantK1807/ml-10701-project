March 2009 marked an important milestone: the First International Conference on
Language Documentation and Conservation, held at the University of Hawai‘i.

The
scale of the event was striking, with ﬁve parallel tracks running over three days. The

Over the past 15 years, the ﬁeld of computational linguistics has been revolution-
ized by the ready availability of large corpora. Landmark dates are the founding of
the Linguistic Data Consortium (1992) and the ﬁrst Workshop on Very Large Corpora
(1993). WhiletheCLcommunity has beenpre-occupied withthenew-found technical
capabilitiesforcollectingandprocessinglargeamountsofdata,theﬁeldoflinguistics
has been undergoing a revolution of its own. It is also dominated with the use of
new-found technical capabilities for collecting and processing large amounts of data.
However,inthiscase,thedatacomesfromlanguagesthatarefacingextinction.
Back in 1992, Michael Krauss, of the Alaska Native Language Center, issued the
world’s linguists with a wake-up call, calculating that “at the rate things are going—
the coming century will see either the death or the doom of 90 per cent of mankind’s
languages” (Krauss 1992, page 7). He exhorted linguists to document these languages
“lest linguistics go down in history as the only science that presided obliviously over
the disappearance of 90 per cent of the very ﬁeld to which it is dedicated” (page 10).

What does computational linguistics offer to a community that is exploiting advances
ininformationtechnologyforprojectsinvolvinglinguisticﬁeldworkwithendangered
languages?
Thegenesisoftheﬁeldofcomputationallinguisticsoutoftheﬁeldofmachinetrans-
lation is well-known; this journal had a previous existence under the title Mechanical
TranslationandComputationalLinguistics.TherelationshipbetweenCLandMToverthe
pasthalf-centuryhasjustcomefullcircle:InMarch2009theACLExecutiveCommittee
acceptedaproposalforanewACLSpecialInterestGroupinMachineTranslation.There
can be no doubt that the multilingual information society is driving many important
challenges in our discipline. However, relatively few languages have the necessary
resourcestoparticipate.
Over the same half-century another strand of research has sought to use compu-
tationaltechniquestosupportlinguisticﬁeldwork.Forexample,JosephGrimes—ACL
Vice President (1975)—has devoted much of his long career to studies at the interface
betweencomputationallinguisticsandlinguisticﬁeldwork.

HisNSFprojectwithGary
Simons,calledLanguageVariationandLimitstoCommunication(CornellUniversity,1976–
1978), involved building a suitcase-sized “portable” computer and lugging it around
the Paciﬁc to capture and analyze wordlists. Two decades later, my own ﬁeldwork on

As if this were not challenging enough, the subsequent curation of the data is
fraught with technical difﬁculties. It’s easy to generate “endangered data” when for-
mats, encodings, and media are so quickly obsolete (Bird and Simons 2003). Existing
ﬁeldwork tools use incompatible formats, and it is often necessary to convert data
between the native formats of various tools. The experience of writing 10k lines of

Clearly, with enough effort we can use
computational techniques to represent and manipulate linguistic ﬁeld data. Is there
morewecanoffer?
For example, consider the tone language data in Figure 1. It represents a slice
throughpartofan8-dimensionaltoneparadigmcontaining1,350cells(Bird2003).The
address of each cell in this data cube is just a vector specifying properties like tense,
mood,nounclass,andlexicaltones.Thecontentofeachcellisjustavectorspecifyinga

When the data is not systematized, when there is no established body of knowledge
about the language, when many analytical options are available, and when every
conclusion is open to question, the task becomes one of managing uncertainty—and

To help someone ﬁx their program requires that you brieﬂy enter their world, and

Documenting and describing endangered languages presents computational lin-
guistics with some difﬁcult challenges. The most immediate challenge concerns lin-

supporting collaborative annotation, handling uncertain data, validating structure,

timeframe (upscaling). What methods do we have that can detect structure in small,
noisy data sets, while being directly applicable to a wide variety of languages? This

will augment these recordings with voice annotations, phrase by phrase, providing
a careful speech version along with translation into Tok Pisin, the language of wider
communication.Ahandfulofspeakerswhoareliterateinthelanguagewilltranscribe
a small portion of the collection. The resulting corpus, it is hoped, will be adequate
to support future analysis and revitalization work. If it is possible to collect a useful
corpus in the space of a week (downscaling) then it will also be possible to apply
such methods to many other languages (upscaling). In this way, limited resources are

Apart from technical challenges, there is also an important sociological challenge
to create maximally interoperable language analysis software. To imagine this can be
done simply by adopting common ﬁle formats, or by operating an in-house software
