For instance, Divay and Vitale (1997) recently wrote: "To our knowledge, learning algorithms, although promising, have not (yet) reached the level of rule sets developed by humans" (p.

The impact of implementational choices on performance has been studied by Sullivan and Damper (1993), Damper and Eastmond (1996, 1997), and Yvon (1996, 1997).

4. Previous Work and Extensions In this section, we briefly review our previous work on a single-strategy approach to PbA (Damper and Eastmond 1996, 1997).

Also, D&N's claimed results on this pseudoword test set have proved impossible to replicate (Damper and Eastmond 1996, 1997; Yvon 1996; Bagshaw 1998).

See also the work of Byrd and Chodorow (1985), which considers computer-based pronunciation by analogy but does not mention the possible application to text-to-speech synthesis.

As detailed by Damper (1995) and Damper and Eastmond (1997), PbA shares many similarities with the artificial intelligence paradigms variously called case-based, memory-based, or instance-based reasoning as applied to letter-to-phoneme conversion (Stanfill and Waltz 1986; Lehnert 1987; Stanfill 1987, 1988; Golding 1991; Golding and Rosenbloom 1991; van den Bosch and Daelemans 1993).

Consequently, fusion has been applied to a wide variety of pattern recognition and decision theoretic problems-using a plethora of theories, techniques, and tools--including some applications in computational linguistics (e.g., Brill and Wu 1998; van Halteren, Zavrel, and Daelemans 1998) and speech technology (e.g., Bowles and Damper 1989; Romary and Pierrel 1989).

Typical letter-to-sound rule sets are those described by Ainsworth (1973), McIlroy (1973), Elovitz et al.(1976), Hunnicutt (1976), and Divay and Vitale (1997).

In spite of opinions to the contrary expressed in the literature (see above), there is accumulating evidence that PbA easily outperforms linguistic rewrite rules (Damper and Eastmond 1996, 1997; Yvon 1996; Bagshaw 1998).
