This latter tasks which can be seen as a very restricted form of parsing, has been treated in a body of interesting work, including (Sun, Shen and Tsou, 1998), (Lee, 1999) . This work has generally used vee/y simple heuristic control policies, such as repeatedly splitting at the point of lowest mutual information.

approaches for general parsing received some early exploration (Brill, Magerman, Marcus and Santofini, 1990), (Magerman and Marcus, 1990), but this approach seems to have lost popularity.
