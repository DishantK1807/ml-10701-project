The simplest (Wu, 1997) uses constit(np,3,5,np,4,8) to denote a NP spanning positions 3–5 in the English string that is aligned with an NP spanning positions 4–8 in the Chinese string.

Training M1◦M2 back-propagates to train the original weights in M1 and M2, as in (Eisner, 2002).
P02-1001
We are generally interested in log-linear models for parsing (Riezler et al., 2000) and other tasks.
P00-1061
These types are compiled into C++ classes that support constructors and accessors, garbage-collection, subterm sharing (which may lead to asymptotic speedups, as in CCG parsing (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1990)), and interning.10 Dyna can import new primitive term types and value types from C++, as well as C++ functions to combine values and to user-define the weights of certain terms.
P90-1001
Dyna will soon allow user-defined priority functions (themselves dynamic programs), which can greatly speed up parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003).
J98-2004 N03-1016
The role of supervision is to permit some constituents to be built but not others (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).
