In particular, our new algorithm can be thought of as a probabilistic version of the Ramshaw and Marcus (1994) algorithm, for speeding up TBLs.

Decision lists (Rivest, 1987) have been used for a variety of natural language tasks, including accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 2000), finding the past tense of English verbs (Mooney and Califf, 1995), and several other problems.

For instance, in part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995), when the tag of one word is changed, it changes the answers to questions for nearby words.

Florian et al.(2000) showed one way to make probabilistic versions of TBLs, but the technique is somewhat complicated.

Similarly, the spaceefficient algorithm using compound questions at the end of Section 2.2.1 can be thought of as a static probabilistic version of the efficient TBL of Ngai and Florian (2001).

In particular, we chose to use exactly the same training, test, problems, and feature sets used by Banko and Brill (2001a; 2001b).

Accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994), word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 2000), and other problems all fall into this framework, and typically use similar feature types.
P94-1013
Both Yarowsky (2000) and Florian et al.(2000) were able to get improvements on the simple decision list structure by adding additional splits â€“ Yarowsky by adding them at the root, and Florian et al.by adding them at the leaves.
W00-1304
First, since probabilistic decision lists are probabilistic analogs of TBLs, we compared to TBL (Brill, 1995).
J95-4004
The standard algorithm for learning decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994) is very simple.
P94-1013
Work There has been a modest amount of previous work on improving probabilistic decision lists, as well as a fair amount of work in related fields, especially in transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995).
J95-4004
Yarowsky (1994) suggests two improvements to the standard algorithm.
