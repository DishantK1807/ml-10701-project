In HPSG, the most extensive grammars are those of English (Flickinger, 2000), German (M¨uller & Kasper, 2000), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel & Bender, 2002).
W02-1210
For example, the ChaSen package for segmenting Japanese input into words and morphemes (Asahara & Matsumoto, 2000) has been linked to at least the LKB and PET systems.
C00-1004
#0F Types associated with Minimal Recursion Semantics (see, e.g., Copestake, Lascarides, & Flickinger, 2001), a meaning representation language which has been shown to be wellsuited for semantic composition in typed feature structure grammars.
P01-1019
The matrix is built to give Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake et al., 2001; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 1999; Copestake, Flickinger, Malouf, Riehemann, & Sag, 1995) representations.

Several other platforms exist which can efficiently parse text using the existing grammars, including the PET system developed in C ++ at Saarland University (Germany) and the DFKI (Callmeier, 2000); the PAGE system developed in Lisp at the DFKI (Uszkoreit et al., 1994); the LiLFeS system developed at Tokyo University (Makino, Yoshida, Torisawa, & Tsujii, 1998), and a parallel processing system developed in Objective C at Delft University (The Netherlands; van Lohuizen, 2002).
C94-1072
These tools could use the type hierarchy to predict where conflicts are likely to arise and bring these to the engineer’s attention, possibly inspired by the approach under development at CSLI for the dynamic maintenance of the LinGO Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2002).
