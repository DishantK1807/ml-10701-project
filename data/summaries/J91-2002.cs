One of the largest hand-encoded semantic lexicons (Dahlgren 1989 and Dahlgren, communication to AAAI90 Stanford seminars) was built by asking subjects to freelist features common to objects.

4. Generalize the result by replacing the concepts in the CRC with their closest supertypes, using the structural overcommitment principle (Webster 1989).

In our previous work on semantic knowledge representation (Pazienza 1988, Velardi 1988, Antonacci 1989) we showed that a semantic dictionary in the style of collocative meaning is a powerful basis for semantic interpretation.

4. A Method for the Acquisition and Interpretation of a Semantic Lexicon Our research on lexical acquisition from corpora started in 1988, when a first version of the system was built as utility for the DANTE natural language processor (Velardi 1989), a system that analyzes press agency releases on finance and economics.

We believe that, just to take one example, a poor knowledge of the results and methods of lexicography, linguistics, and cognitive science in part motivates the nonstriking success of NLP in developing large-scale systems (Velardi 1990).

The hypothesis of hand-entering a type hierarchy would not require an unreasonable amount of time, because the task is comparable to entering a morphologic lexicon (Russo 1987).
E87-1006
The most difficult task, both in the domain described in this paper and in the press agency releases domain described in Velardi (1989), is to define at the appropriate level of generality the selectional restrictions on conceptual relations.

extracted through morphologic (Russo 1987) and syntactic analysis of the selected corpus.

(b) a set of domain-dependent conceptual relations, and a many-to-many mapping (synt-sem) between syntactic relations and the corresponding conceptual relations (see Velardi 1988 and Antonacci 1989 for extensive examples of syntax-to-semantics mapping); (c) a set of coarse-grained selectional restrictions on the use of conceptual relations, represented by concept-relation-concept (CRC) triples.
P89-1023
The NLP system is described in Fasolo (1990) and is similar to the one described in Velardi (1988) and Antonacci (1989) and in the other papers on the DANTE system, except for the use of shallow methods in syntax and the ability to produce partial interpretations if parts of a text are not understood.

At the other extreme is full syntactic parsing, as performed in Velardi (1989).

For example, much work on lexical acquisition from dictionaries produces lexical entries in a format that is clearly useful for lexicographers (see the many examples in Byrd (1987) and Boguraev (1989)), but their utility for the purpose of automatic language processing is less evident.
