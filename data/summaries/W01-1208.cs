Motivated partially by the TREC-8 QA collection (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), question answering has of late become one of the major topics within the natural language processing and information retrieval communities, and a number of QA systems targeting the TREC collection have been proposed (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Moldovan and Harabagiu, 2000; Prager et al., 2000).

For this purpose, we use a modified version of our method to extract term descriptions from Web pages (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000).

Although Harabagiu et al.(2000) proposed a knowledge-based QA system, most existing systems rely on conventional IR and shallow NLP methods.

Since word senses are often associated with domains (Yarowsky, 1995), word senses can be consequently distinguished by way of determining the domain of each description.

However, Moldovan and Harabagiu (2000) found that each of the TREC questions can be recast as either a single axis or a combination of axes.

To resolve this problem, we previously used a language model to filter out descriptions with low perplexity (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000).

Among a number of existing categorization methods, we experimentally used one proposed by Iwayama and Tokunaga (1994), which formulates P(c|d) as in Equation (2).

P(d) ≈ P L (d) (4) Statistical approaches to language modeling have been used in much NLP research, such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) and speech recognition (Bahl et al., 1983).

In principle, the remaining two modules (“retrieval” and “extraction”) are the same as proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000).

2 http://www.google.com/ The first rule is based on Japanese linguistic patterns typically used for term descriptions, such as “X toha Y dearu (X is Y).” Following the method proposed by Fujii and Ishikawa (2000), we semi-automatically produced 20 patterns based on the Japanese CDROM World Encyclopedia (Heibonsha, 1998), which includes approximately 80,000 entries related to various fields.
