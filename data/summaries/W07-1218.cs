In particular, we consider the LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002; Bender and Flickinger, 2005).

This basic approach, is also the basis for the approach taken in (Broker, 2000); the specific forms of knowledge leveraged, and the test-suite development strategies used, however, are quite different.

The grammar is an HPSG implementation (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002), which provides a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations.

The SRG is implemented within the Linguistic Knowledge Building (LKB) system (Copestake, 2002), based on the basic components of the grammar Matrix, an open?source starter-kit for the development of HPSG grammars developed as part of the LinGO consortium?s multilingual grammar engineering (Bender et al., 2002).

To allow reuse of grammar code across languages and to increase the size of the jump-start provided by the Matrix, in more recent work (Bender and Flickinger, 2005; Drellishak and Bender, 2005), we have been developing ?libraries??implementing realizations of various linguistic phenomena.

Initial work on the Matrix (Bender et al., 2002; Flickinger and Bender, 2003) focused on the development of a cross-linguistic core grammar.
