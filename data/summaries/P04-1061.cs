As we will see, this combined model finds correct dependencies more successfully than the model above, and finds constituents more successfully than the model of Klein and Manning (2002).

is worth noting that these totally unsupervised numbers are better than the performance of the CCM model of Klein and Manning (2002) running off of Penn treebank word classes.
P02-1017
In Klein and Manning (2002), we proposed a constituent-context model (CCM) which solves this problem by building constituency decisions directly into the distributional model, by earmarking a single cluster d for non-constituents.

P95-1031
Klein and Manning (2002) gives comparative numbers showing that the basic CCM outperforms other recent systems on the ATIS corpus (which many other constituency induction systems have reported on).

An important distinction should be drawn between work primarily interested in the weak generative capacity of models, where modeling hierarchical structure is only useful insofar as it leads to improved models over observed structures (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and work interested in the strong generative capacity of models, where the unobserved structure itself is evaluated (van Zaanen, 2000; Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002).

8In Klein and Manning (2002), we reported results using unlabeled bracketing statistics which gave no credit for brackets which spanned the entire sentence (raising the scores) but macro-averaged over sentences (lowering the scores).

Previous work has shown that even this quite simple representation allows the induction of quite high quality word classes, largely corresponding to traditional parts of speech (Finch, 1993; SchÂ¨utze, 1995; Clark, 2000).

The task of statistically inducing hierarchical syntactic structure over unannotated sentences of natural language has received a great deal of attention (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Brill, 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).
P92-1017 P93-1035
Clark (2001) and Klein and Manning (2002) show that this approach can be successfully used for discovering syntactic constituents as well.

Dependency Parsing Most recent progress in unsupervised parsing has come from tree or phrase-structure grammar based models (Clark, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2002), but there are compelling reasons to reconsider unsupervised dependency parsing.

First, in supervised models, a head outward process is modeled (Eisner, 1996; Collins, 1999).
C96-1058
While absolute numbers are hard to compare across corpora, all the systems compared to in Klein and Manning (2002) parsed below a right-branching baseline, while the CCM is substantially above it.

Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995), and to examine cognitive issues in language learning (Solan et al., 2003).

To this end, after briefly recapping the model of Klein and Manning (2002), we present a combined model that exploits dependencies and constituencies.
