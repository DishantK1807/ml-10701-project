The fact that GPSG (Gazdar et al., 1985) makes heavy use of defaults, has led to some research concerning the compatibility of GPSG with a formalism such PATR-II (Shieber 1986a) and concerning the logical nature of the mechanisms used in GPSG (Evans 1987).

A uniflclatlon-based grammar that includes a morphological component (see, for instance, Calder, 1989 and Evans & Gazdar, 1989), would probably list only (regular) root forms as lexlcal items.
E89-1008 E89-1009
The latter suggests that the use of defaults Is of particular relevance for those brands of Unification Grammar (UG) that are lexicalist, that is, in which the lexicon is the main source of grammatical information (such as Categorial Unification Grammar (Uskorelt 1986, Calder et al.1988) and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard & Sag 1987)).

It can be defined as an operation which Is like ordinary unification, with the exception that In case of a unification failure, the value of the non-default feature structure takes precedence (Kaplan 1987, Shieber 1986a).

Shieber (1986a) proposes an operation.rid conservatively, which adds information of a feature structure A to a feature structure B, in as far as this information is not in conflict with information In B.
