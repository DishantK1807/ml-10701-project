Extensive research concerning the integration of semantic knowledge into NLP for the English language has been arguably fostered by the emergence of WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004).1 In its turn, the development of the WordNet based semantic similarity software has been facilitated by the availability of tools to easily retrieve 1http://www.d.umn.edu/a0 tpederse/similarity.html data from WordNet, e.g.

296–304. McCarthy, Diana, Rob Koeling, Julie Weeds & John Carroll (2004).
P04-1036
This can be used e.g. to perform word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003), to find predominant word senses in untagged text (McCarthy et al., 2004), to automatically generate spoken dialogue summaries (Gurevych & Strube, 2004), and to perform spelling correction (Hirst & Budanitsky, 2005).
