Wordnets and ontologies are very common resources and are employed in a wide variety of direct and indirect QA tasks, such as reasoning based on axioms extracted from WordNet (Moldovan et al., 2003), probabilistic inference using lexical relations for passage scoring (Paranjpe et al., 2003), and answer filtering via WordNet constraints (Leidner et al., 2003).

The web has been employed for pattern acquisition (Ravichandran et al., 2003), document retrieval (Dumais et al., 2002), query expansion (Yang et al., 2003), structured information extraction, and answer validation (Magnini et al., 2002). Some of these approaches enhance existing QA systems, while others simplify the question answering task, allowing a less complex approach to find correct answers.
