The algorithms are set up in such a way that recursive rules can be derived for the interpretation of adjunct sets within a codescripiion approach (see \[Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993\] for details).

On the other hand particular readings can be excluded by global binding and/or scoping principles, similar to the ones formulated in \[Dalrymple et al., 1990\].

(1) arrived: V, (T PrtED)= "arrive(SUDJ)' (a T REL) ---arrive (a T AaQ1) = a(T sunJ) Within the domain of translation, Wedekind \[1988\], and Sadler and Thompson \[1991\] recognized some problems of the correspondence approach which concern data of head.switching.
E91-1051
Also, modifiers are involved in the head-switching translation problems discussed by Kaplan and Wedekind \[1993\], and the algorithms proposed here underlie the descriptionby-analysis approach that we developed in that paper.

This provides some support for the adequacy of our extended description language and reinforces the results reported by Kaplan and Wedekind \[1993\].
E93-1024
In this paper and in \[Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993\] we introduced a new formal device, the "restriction operator", into the language of functional descriptions.
