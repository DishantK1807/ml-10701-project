Abstract
NegEx, a rule-based algorithm that detects
negations in English clinical text, was trans-
lated into Swedish and evaluated on clini-
cal text written in Swedish. The NegEx al-
gorithmdetects negations throughthe use of
triggerphrases,whichindicatethat a preced-
ing or following concept is negated. A list
of Englishtriggerphraseswas translatedinto
Swedish, taking grammaticaldifferences be-
tween the two languagesinto account. This
translationwasevaluatedona setof436man-
uallyclassifiedsentencesfromSwedishhealth
records. The results showed a precision of
70% and a recall of 81% for sentencescon-
tainingthe triggerphrasesanda negative pre-
dictive value of 96% for sentences not con-
taining any trigger phrases. The precision
was significantlylowerfor the Swedishadap-
tation than published results on the English
version, but since many negated propositions
wereidentifiedthrougha limitedsetoftrigger
phrases, it could nevertheless be concluded
thatthesametriggerphraseapproachispossi-
bleina Swedishcontext,eventhoughit needs
to befurtherdeveloped.
1 Introduction
Medicaldocumentation,such as patientrecords,is
today often stored in a digital, searchableformat.
Thisopensthepossibilityof extractinginformation,
whichforexamplecouldbeusedfordiseasesurveil-
lanceor to findnew, unknownconnectionsbetween
patientbackground,symptomsand diseases. When
extractinginformationfroma text, it is not onlythe
words that occur in the text that are important,but
also whetherthese words are negated or not. This
is especiallytrue when it comesto patientrecords,
since when describing the status of a patient, the
physician often reasons by excluding various pos-
siblediagnosesandsymptoms.
Mostworkondetectingnegationsin medicallan-
guagehasbeencarriedoutforEnglish,andverylit-
tle has been carriedout for other languages,as for
exampleSwedish. This articlewill thereforefocus
onthetaskoffindingwhethera conceptina clinical
text writtenin Swedishis negatedor not.

There are many different methods for detecting
whethera conceptis negated. Rokachet al. (2008)
give a good overview of some approachesfor de-
tectingnegations. The methodscan be dividedinto
two main groups; knowledgeengineeringmethods
and machine learning methods. Knowledge engi-
neeringmethodshave theadvantagethata large an-
notatedcorpus is not needed, but the disadvantage
thatruleshavetobewrittenmanually,whichisoften
time-consuming. Negation detectionbased on ma-
chinelearningmethods,on the otherhand,is faster
to implementand oftenworks betterwhena text is
notcompletelygrammatical,whichis oftenthecase
withclinicaltexts. (Rokachet al.,2008)

for Swedish negation detection is to adapt a sim-
ple knowledgeengineeringmethodthat is used for
detectingnegations in English,an algorithmcalled
NegEx. (Chapmanet al.,2001b)
2.1 TheNegExalgorithm
NegExdetectspertinentnegativesinEnglishpatient
records,that is ”findingsand diseasesexplicitlyor
implicitlydescribedas absentin a patient”.Given a
sentenceand a chosenpropositionin this sentence,
NegEx determinesif that propositionis negated or
not. An example would be ”Extremities showed
nocyanoses.”, in whichthepropositionis cyanoses.
(Chapmanet al.,2001b)
The NegEx algorithm uses regular expressions
and three lists of phrases. The first list, the pre-
negationlist,consistsof triggerphraseswhichindi-
cate that a propositionthat follows themis negated
inthesentence,forexamplenosignsof. Thesecond
list,thepost-negationlist,consistsoftriggerphrases
that indicate that a propositionpreceding them is
negated, as the phrase unlikely. Finally, the third
listconsistsofpseudo-negationphrases,phrasesthat
are similarto negationtriggers,but thatdo not trig-
ger negation, for examplenot certainif. The algo-
rithmjudgesthe propositionto be negatedif it is in
the range of one to six words from a postor pre-
negationtrigger. (Chapmanet al.,2001b)
NegEx has later been further developed into
NegExversion2
2, for examplethroughthe addition
of more triggers and by limiting the scope of the
negationthrougha listof conjunctions.
In theevaluationof NegEx,thepropositionscon-
sisted of UMLS
3
phrases that belonged to any of
the UMLScategories finding, diseaseor syndrome
or mentalor behavioral dysfunctionand that could
also be found in the describingtext of an ICD-10
code
4
. Sentencescontainingthese UMLS phrases
were extracted from discharge summaries. There-
after, 500 of the extractedsentencesthat contained
at least one negationtriggerand 500 sentencesthat
didnotcontainanegationtriggerwererandomlyse-
lected. A few sentencesthat containedphrasesthat
weresuspectedtosometimesindicateanegation,but
thatwerenot in the threelists,wereincludedin the

firstgroup. Thesentenceswerethencategorisedby
physiciansinto containingan affirmed proposition,
a negatedpropositionor an ambiguousproposition.
Theinter-rateragreementwasalmost100%.Forthe
NegEx evaluation,the categories affirmed and am-
biguousweregroupedintothecategorynotnegated.
The resultsshowed a precisionof 84% and a recall
of82%forsentencesinthegroupwithnegationtrig-
gersanda negative predictive valueof 97%forsen-
tencesinthegroupwithouttriggers.Ofthecorrectly
foundnegations,82% were triggeredby only three
negation triggers; no, without and no evidence of.
Moreover, only 15 of the 35 negationtriggerswere
found in the test set. The trigger not had a preci-
sionof 58%,whichwas muchlowerthanthe preci-
sionfortheothercommontriggers.(Chapmanetal.,
2001b)
An evaluation of the NegEx algorithm on ten
otherkindsofreportshasalsobeencarriedout. The
average precisionof NegEx was 97%, and 90% of
thedetectednegationsweretriggeredby onlyseven
negationphrases,withthe fourmostfrequentbeing
no, denies, withoutand no evidence. (Chapmanet
al.,2001a)
Ina laterstudybyGoldinandChapman(2003),a
Naive Bayesclassifieranda decisiontreewereused
to classifywhichoccurrencesof the triggernot that

roundingwordsandtheirpartof speech.Boththese
methodsresultedin anincreasedprecision.
3 ResearchQuestion
An evaluation was carried out on how the NegEx
algorithm performs on health records written in
Swedish, compared to health records written in
English. The hypothesis was that the results for
Swedish would be similar to the results for En-
glish, since the two languages are grammatically
close. This comparisoncouldgive an indicationof
whetherit is possibleto adaptmoreadvancedmeth-
odsfor negationdetectionintoSwedish,andthe re-
sultscouldalsobe usedas a baselineforcomparing
theresultsof othermethods.

4.1 Translatingtriggerphrases
Thetriggersfor Swedishwereobtainedby translat-
ingthephrasesforNegExversion2. Thetranslations
were made with the help of a web-basedEnglish-
Swedish dictionary
5
and with the help of Google
translate
6
. Inthecaseswheretherewasagoodtrans-
lation neither in the dictionary nor in the Google
translation,the negation was translatedby the au-
thorof thisarticle. Whenit was notpossibleto find
a goodSwedishtranslation,thephrasewas omitted.
A total of 148 phraseswere translated. Almostall
negationphrasesweregeneralEnglishterms. How-
ever, in a few casesthey consistedof specificmed-
ical terms, and in these cases the translation was
madeby a physician. In many instancesthe dictio-
nary offered many translations,and in other cases
the same translationwas offered for different En-
glishphrases.Inthecaseswhereseveraltranslations
were offered, all of them were added to the list of
Swedishnegations.
4.2 Expandingthetranslatedtriggerphrases
Englishand Swedishare both Germaniclanguages
(Crystal, 1997) and they have a similar grammar.
Nevertheless, there are some grammatical differ-
encesthat have to be taken into accountthroughan
expansionof thelistof translatedtriggerphrases.
Swedishhas two grammaticalgenders(common
genderandneutergender),whereastheEnglishlan-
guage lacks grammaticalgender. Adjectives and
somequantifiersin Swedishhave a genderconcord,
as wellas a numberconcord(Dahl,1982). To com-
pensatefor this, the Englishnegative quantifierno
wastranslatedintothreedifferentformsofthecorre-
spondingSwedishnegative quantifier, namelyinga,
ingen and inget. Inflectionsof all adjectives in the
trigger phrases were also generated. This was ac-
complishedbyinvokingtheGranskainflector
7
.
TheEnglishcombinationsof aspectand tensedo
not always corresponddirectly to a Swedish verb
form (Dahl, 1982). Therefore,a direct translation
of thedifferentformsof a verbin thetriggerphrase
listwasnotperformed.Thelemmaformoftheverb
was insteadaddedto the list of negationtriggersin
5
http://www.norstedtsord.se
6
http://translate.google.com
7
http://www.csc.kth.se/tcs/humanlang/tools.html
Swedish, and from this all inflectionsof the verb
weregenerated,againusingtheGranskainflector.
The difference connected with the do-
constructiondid not need to be taken into account.
Whennegatinga non-auxiliaryverb in English,the
do-constructionis used. This type of construction
does not exist in Swedish. The phrasehan vet (he
knows) would for example be negated as han vet
inte (he knows not) (Svartvik and Sager, 1996).
However, the NegEx algorithm only checks if
the propositionis less than six words to the right
of the word inte (not), and when it is, it will
consider the propositionto be negated. The lack
of a do-constructionshouldthereforenot affect the
results.
8
Swedish has a word order inversion in subordi-
nate clauses. The position of the negating adverb
is changed, and it is instead positioned immedi-
atelybeforetheverb(HolmesandHinchliffe,2008).
Whenstressingthenegation,thereis alsothepossi-
bility of using this word order in the main clause
(Sells, 2000). A version with reversed word order
was thereforegeneratedfor triggerphrasescontain-
ing some of the most commonadverbs. From the
translationof the trigger phrase has not, a version
withthewordordernothaswas forexamplegener-
ated.
ThefrequencyoftheSwedishtriggerphraseswas
counted on a text other than the test set, and the
most frequent trigger phrases were selected. The
numberof selectedphraseswas two morethanused
in the EnglishNegExevaluation,to compensatefor
Swedishgenderandnumberconcord

5 Evaluationmethod
5.1 Constructionoftestdata
Propositionsto use for evaluatingthe performance
of the Swedishversion of NegEx were taken from
the Swedishtranslationof the ICD-10codes. How-
ever, the descriptionin the ICD-10 code list often
containsboththenameofa symptomordiseaseand
a clarificationor specificationof it, which has the

effect that simple string matching would not find
someof the mostcommonsymptomsand diseases.
Anautomaticpre-processingoftheICD-10codelist
was thereforefirst accomplished,where for exam-
ple text within parenthesisand clarificationssuch
as not specified or other specified forms were re-
moved. To find more namesof symptomsand dis-
eases,additionallistswerealsoadded,includingthe
KSH97-P
10, an adaption of the ICD-10 codes for
primary care, and the MeSH terms under the sec-
tionsdiseasesandmentaldisorders.
The test data was extracted from a set of sen-
tences randomly chosen from the assessmentpart
of SwedishhealthrecordsfromtheStockholmEPR
Corpus(Dalianiset al., 2009). From this set, sen-
tencesthat containedany of the propositionsin the
propositionlistwereextracted,alsowhenthepropo-
sitionwaspartofacompoundword. Neitherthepre-
processingof theICD-10codelistnorthedetection
of a propositionin a compoundword was perfect
and thereforesome words that were not compara-
ble with findings, diseasesor syndromes or mental
orbehavioral dysfunctions, wereaddedtothelistof
propositions.Sentencescontainingthesewereman-
uallyfilteredoutfromthetestdata.
The chosen sentences were ordered in a list of
pairs,consistingofthesentenceandtheproposition.
If a sentencecontainedmore than one proposition,
the sentencewas addedto the list onetimefor each
proposition.
In order to be able to compare the English and
Swedish versions of NegEx, the same evaluation
methodwas used, and two groupsof test sentences
were constucted. The first group, Trig, contained
202sentenceswithatleastoneofthetriggerphrases.
The second group, Non-Trig, contained 234 sen-
tenceswithoutany of thetriggerphrases.
5.2 Classificationoftestdata
The propositionswere manuallyclassifiedinto the
categories affirmed, negated and ambiguous by a
raterwithoutmedicaleducation. The categoriesaf-
firmedandambiguouswerethereaftercollapsedinto
the category not negated. The resultsare presented
in Table1.
Of the202sentencesin group Trig, 70 werealso

classifiedby a physician. The inter-rateragreement
betweenthe physician and the other rater with re-
specttothetwogroupsnegatedandnotnegatedwas
80%.
The majority of the sentences where there was
disagreementwere judgedas negated by the physi-
cian rater and ambiguousby the otherrater, or am-
biguous by the physician rater and negated by the
other rater. There was no evident systematicten-
dency to judgethe propositionsas moreor lessam-
biguousbyeitherof thetwo raters.
Whentherewas a differencein opinionof how to
classifythe proposition,the classificationmade by
the physicianwas chosen. Alsosentencesthatwere
subjectively judged by the rater as not possible to
ratewithoutdeepmedicalknowledge,wereratedby
thephysician.

The Swedishversion of NegEx was executed with
the sentences in group Trig and the sentences in
group Non-Trig as input sentences.

As shown in
Table 2, group Trig had a precisionof 70% and a
recallof 81%. GroupNon-Trig had a negative pre-

7 Discussion
The comparisonbetweenthe Englishand Swedish
evaluations is complicated by the fact that the
Swedishtest data had lower inter-rater agreement,
whichaddsuncertaintyto the Swedishresults. This
differencecouldperhapsbe partlyexplainedby the
differenttypesofhealthrecords;theEnglishversion
was evaluatedon discharge summaries,whereasthe
Swedish version was evaluated on the assessment
partofahealthrecord,whichpossiblycontainsmore
reasoningandtherebyperhapsmoreambiguousex-
pressions.
Also, the fact that group Trig in the evaluation
of theEnglishversionalsoincludedsomesentences
notcontainingtriggerphrasescomplicatesthecom-
parison.
It could, however, be concludedthat the preci-
sionislowerforSwedish.Thefollowingerrortypes
couldat leastaccountforsomeof thisdifference:
It is difficult to draw a line betweenwhat is an
ambiguousexpressionand what is a negation, both
for the raters and for the NegEx program. The
Phrase Precision Occur.
inga tecken (nosignsof) 89% 9
ingen (no) 89% 27
ej (not) 75% 8
inga (no,plural) 67% 15
utan (without) 63% 8
intehar (nothave) 60% 5
inte (not) 57% 21
icke (non-,not) 0 % 4
Table 4: The most frequenttriggers,their precisionand
thenumberof timesthey occurin thesentences.
above-mentioned difference in type of evaluation
data could have resultedin lower precisionand re-
callfortheSwedishversion.
It is a commonconstructionfor a nameof a dis-
ease, or a versionof a disease,to have a namethat
starts with the word icke (non-, not), for example
icke allergisk astma. The diseaseis presentin the
patient,even thoughthe word icke is interpretedas
a negationtriggerby NegEx. In thetestdata,all the
occurrencesof the word icke are constructionslike
this,thushavinga negative impactonprecision.
TheSwedishwordforwithout(utan)hasadouble
meaning.It is alsoa conjunctionmeaningbut. This
gives rise to a few instanceswherethe programin-
correctlyclassifiesa propositionas negated, result-
ingin lowerprecision.
Other error types were also identified. These
were, however, not specificfor Swedishor for the
typeoftestdata,andcouldthereforenotaccountfor
the differencein precisionbetweenthe Englishand
SwedishversionsofNegEx. Examplesarewhenthe
negation of the propositionoccurs in a conditional
clause or when the scope of the trigger should be
lessthantheNegExscopeofsixwords,forexample
whenthescopeis limitedbya conjunction.
7.1 Identifiednegationtriggers
In the test set, only 16 of the 39 negation triggers
were found, and among them, only 12 correctly
negated a proposition. This is close to the English
versionwhere15of37triggerswerefound.Noneof
thepost-negationtriggerswerefoundintheSwedish
testdata.
In the Englishversionof NegEx,82%of the cor-
19
rectly found negations were triggeredby the three
negationphrasesno, withoutandno evidenceof. In
the Swedishversion, the three most commontrig-
gerswerethecommongenderversionofno(ingen),
not(inte) andthepluralformofno(inga). Together,
they constitute63%of thetotalnumberof correctly
identifiednegations.Ifthetriggerinfourthplace,no
signs of, is also counted,they make up 75% of the
correctlynegatedpropositions.In bothEnglishand
Swedishthere are thus a small numberof negation
triggersthatareverycommon.
It canalsobe notedthatbothin SwedishandEn-
glish,theprecisionof thetriggernot(inte) is low.
Noothercommonnegationtriggerswerefoundin
the testdata. Theonlyre-occurringtriggerthatwas
not includedin any of the three lists were different
formsof thephraseruleout.
8 Conclusion
The Swedishversionof the NegEx algorithmhad a
significantlylower precisionthan the English ver-
sion, and for the recall no significantconclusions
could be drawn. Not taking the uncertaintyof the
low inter-rateragreementintoaccount,the Swedish
versionhas a precisionof 70%and a recallof 81%
for sentencescontainingthe trigger phrases and a
negative predictive value of 96% for sentencesnot
containingany trigger phrases. As for the English
version,asmallnumberoftriggerphrasesaccounted
forthemajorityof detectednegations.
Sincea limitedsetoftriggerscanbeusedtoiden-
tifymany negationsalsoin Swedish,thissimpleap-
proachoftheNegExalgorithmcanbeusedasabase
methodfor identifyingnegationsin Swedish.How-
ever, evenforuseina systemwithouthighdemands
onrobustness,themethodneedstobefurtherdevel-
oped.
Fromthe relatively low inter-rateragreement,es-
peciallywithrespectto conceptsthatmightbe clas-
sifiedas eitherambiguousor negated,it canbe con-
cludedthatitisadifficulttaskalsoforahumanrater
to determinewhat is an ambiguityexpressed as a
negationor anactualnegation.
9 Limitations
Themostimportantlimitationofthisstudyistherel-
atively low inter-rater agreement,and the fact that
most of the sentenceswere rated by a person who
didnothave a medicaleducation.Thelackofmedi-
calknowledgemayhaveleadtomistakeswhenclas-
sifyingthe test data and could probablyalso partly
explainthelow inter-rateragreement.
Anotherlimitationis thaterrorsin themodulefor
selectingsentencesleadto that a few test sentences
did not contain a symptom, disease or equivalent.
Consequently, thesesentenceshadto be filteredout
manually.
As in the study by Chapmanet al. (2001a), no
analysishas beenmadeof the occurrencesof nega-
tionsthatstretchover sentenceboundaries.
10 Future
work
To automaticallydistinguishan ambiguity from a
negation is not always trivial. However, the er-
rorsoriginatingfromtheothererrortypesmentioned
couldbe limitedthroughthe use of moreadvanced
natural language processing methods. The cases
where the phrase icke does not trigger a negation,
couldprobablybe detectedby a simpleregular ex-
pression rule. Which meaning of the phrase utan
thatisintendedcouldperhapsbedetectedbythema-
chine learningmethodsused by Goldin and Chap-
man (2003). A list of conjunctionsthat limit the
scopeof thenegations,as in NegExversion2, could
alsobe usedto increasethe precision,and a similar
methodcouldbeusedtodetectwhentheproposition
is negatedin a conditionalphrase.
It would also be interestingto use the complete
list of negation triggers that was constructed for
this study, instead of limiting the size to that of
the NegEx trigger list, and to evaluate this list on
a larger test set. This evaluationcould also deter-
minewhetherthereareany commonSwedishnega-
tiontriggersthatwerenotobtainedbytranslatingthe
Englishtriggerlist.
