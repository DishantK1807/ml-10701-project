In most previous work, NER has been applied to news articles (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1999; McCallum and Li, 2003)), scientific articles (e.g., (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004)), or web pages (e.g., (Freitag, 1998)).

443 (e.g., (Humphreys et al., 1998)), scientific abstracts (e.g., (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004)) and seminar announcements (Sutton and Mccallum, 2004); however, these techniques rely on either NP analysis or capitalization information to pre-identify candidate coreferent name mentions, features which are not reliable in email.
