A TAXONOMY FOR ENGLISH NOUNS AND VERBS Robert A.
Amsler Computer Sciences Department University of Texas, Austin.
TX 78712 ABSTRACT: The definition texts of a machine-readable pocket dictionary were analyzed to determine the disambiguated word sense of the kernel terms of each word sense being defined.
The resultant sets of word pairs of defined and defining words were then computaCionally connected into t~o taxonomic semilattices ("tangled hierarchies") representing some 24,000 noun nodes and 11,000 verb nodes.
The study of the nature of the "topmost" nodes in these hierarchies.
and the structure of the trees reveal information about the nature of the dictionary's organization of the language, the concept of semantic primitives and other aspects of lexical semantics.
The data proves that the dictionary offers a fundamentally consistent description of word meaning and may provide the basis for future research and applications in computational linguistic systems.
1. INTRODUCTION In the late 1960"s, John 01ney et al.at System Development Corporation produced machine-readable copies of the Merriam-Webster New Pocke~ Dictionary and the Sevent~ Collegiate Dictionary.
These massive data files have been widely distributed within the computational linguistic community, yet research upon the basic structure of the dictionary has been exceedingly slow and difficult due to the Significant computer resources required to process tens of thousands of definitions.
The dictionary is a fascinating computational resource.
It contains spelling, pronunciation, hyphenation, capitalization, usage notes for semantic domains, geographic regions, and propriety; etymological, syntactic and semantic information about the most basic units of the language.
Accompanying definitions are example sentences which often use words in prototypical contexts.
Thus the dictionary should be able to serve as a resource for a variety of computational linguistic needs.
My primary concern within the dictionary has been the development of dictionary data for use in understanding systems.
Thus I am concerned with what dictionary definitions tell us about the semantic and pragmatic structure of meaning.
The hypothesis I am proposing is that definitions in the lexicon can be studied in the same manner as other large collections of objects such as plants, animals, and minerals are studied.
Thus I am concerned with enunerating the classifications1 organization of the lexicon as it has been implicitly used by the dictionary's lexicographers.
Each textual definition in the dictionary is syntactically a noun or verb phrase with one or more kernel terms.
If one identifies these kernel terms of definitions, and then proceeds to disambiguate them relative to the senses offered in the same dictionary under their respective definitions, then one can arrive at a large collection of pairs of disambiguated words which can be assembled into a taxonomic semi-lattice.
This task has been accomplished for all the definition texts of nouns and verbs in a comu~n pocket dictionary.
This paper is an effort to reveal the results of a preliminary examination of the structure of these databases.
The applications of this data are still in the future.
What might these applications be?
First, the data shoul'd provide information on the contents of semantic domains.
One should be able to determine from a lexical taxonomy what domains one might be in given one has encountered the word "periscope", or "petiole", or "petroleum".
Second, dictionary data should be of use in resolving semantic ambiguity in text.
Words in definitions appear in the company of their prototypical associates.
Third, dictionary data can provide the basis for creating case gr-,-~-r descriptions of verbs, and noun argument descriptions of nouns.
Semantic templates of meaning are far richer when one considers the taxonomic inheritance of elements of the lexicon.
Fourth. the dictionary should offer a classification which anthropological linguists and psycholinguists can use as an objective reference in comparison with other cultures or human memory observations.
This isn't to say that the dictionary's classification is the same as the culture's or the human mind's, only that it is an objective datum from which comparisons can be made.
Fifth. knowledge of how the dictionary is structured can be used by lexicographers to build better dictionaries.
And finally, the dictionary if converted into a computer tool can become more readily accessible to all the disciplines seeking Co use the current paper-based versions.
Education. historical linguistics, sociology.
English composition, etc.
can all make steps foxward given that they can assume access to a dictionary is immediately available via computer.
I do not know what all these applications will be and the task at hand is simply an elucidation of the dictionary's structure as it currently exists.
2. "TANGLED" HIERARCHIES OF NOVN S AND VERBS The grant.
MCS77-01315, '~)evelopment of a Computational Methodology for Deriving Natural Language Semantic Structures via Analysis of Machine-Readable Dictionaries".
created a taxonomy for the nouns and verbs of the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary (MPD), based upon the hand-disambiguated kernel words in their definitions.
This taxonomy confirmed the anticipated structure of the lexicon to be that of a "tangled hierarchy" \[8,9\] of unprecedented size (24,000 noun senses.
11.000 verb senses).
This data base is believed to be the first Co be assembled which is representative of the structure of the entire English lexicon.
(A somewhat similar study of the Italian lexicon has been done \[2.11\] ).
The content categories agree substantially with the semantic structure of the lexicon proposed by Nida \[I5\], and the verb taxonomy confirms the primitives proposed by the San Diego LNR group \[16\].
This "tangled hierarchy" may be described as a formal data structure whose bottom is a set of terminal disambiguated words that are not used as kernel defining terms; these are the most specific elexents in the structure.
The tops of the structure are senses of words such as "cause", "thing", '*class", "being", etc.
These are the most general elements in the tangled hierarchy.
If all the top terms are considered to be 133 members of the metaclass "<word-sense>", the tangled forest becomes a tangled tree.
The terminal nodes of such trees are in general each connected to the Cop in a lattice.
An individual lattice can be resolved into a seC of "traces", each of which describes an alternate paCh from terminal to cop.
In a crate, each element implies the terms above iC, and further specifies the sense of the elements below it.
The collection of lattices forms a transitive acyclic digraph (or perhaps more clearly, a "semi-lattice", that is, a lattice with a greatest upper bound, <word-sense>, but no least lower bound).
If we specify all the traces composing such a structure, spanning all paths from top to bottom, we have topologically specified the semi-lattice.
Thus the list on the left in Figure I topologically specifies the tangled hierarchy on its right.
(a b c e f) a (a b c gk) I (a b d g k) I (a b c g I) b (a bd gl) / \ (abc gin) / \ (a b d g m) c d (a b d i) II I \ / J / • I / \[ f / I I/ f g /I\ /I\ / I \ k 1 m \ i Figure I.
The Trace of a Tangled Hierarchy 2.1 TOPMOST SEMANTIC NODES OF THE TANGLED HIERARCHIES Turning from the abstract description of the forest of tangled hierarchies Co the actual data, the first question which was answered was, 'What are the largest tangled hierarchies in the dictionary?".
The size of a tangled hierarchy is based upon two numbers, the maximum depth below the "root" and the total number of nodes transitively reachable from the root.
Thus the tangled hierarchy of Figure 1 has a depth of 5 and conCains a total of 11 nodes (including the "root" node, "a").
However, since each non-terminal in Che tangled hierarchy was also enumerated, it is also possible Co describe the "sizes" of che other nodes reachable from "a".
Their number of elemenCs and depChs given in Table 1.
Table 1.
Enumeration of Tree Sizes and Depths of Tangled Hierarchy Nodes of Figure 2 Tree Maximum Rooc Size Depth Node ii 5 a 10 4 b 6 3 c 6 2 d 4 l g 2 I e These examples are being given co demonstrate the inherenC consequences of dealing wich tree sizes based upon these measurements.
For example, "g" has the most single-level descendants, 3, yet it is neither at the Cop of the Cangled hierarchy, nor does iC have the highest total number of descendants° The root node "a" is at the top of the hierarchy, yet it only has I single-level descendant.
For nodes ¢o he considered of major importance in a tangled hierarchy it is chus necessary to consider not only Cheir total number of descendants, buc whether Chese descendants are all accually immediately under some ocher node Co which this higher node is attached.
As we shall see, che nodes which have the most single-level descendants are actually more pivoral concepts in some cases.
Turning to the actual forest of Cangled hierarchies, Table 2 gives the frequencies of the size and depth of the largest noun hierarchies and Table 3 gives the sizes alone for verb hierarchies (depths were noc oompuced for these, unfortunately).

Relations between Topmost Tangled Verb Hierarchy Nodes The list appears in terms of descending frequency.
The topmost nodes don't have many descendants at one level below, but they each have one BIG descendant, the next node in the chain.
CAUSE-2.0A has approximately 240 direct descendants, and MAKE-I.IA has 480 direct descendants making these t~o the topmost nodes in terms of number of direct descendants, though they are ranked 9th and 13th in terms of total descendants (under words such as EDL%IN-.4A, CONTINUE-.1A, etc.).
This points out in practice what the abstract tree of Figure I showed as possible in theory, and explains the seeming contradiction in having a basic verb such as "CAUSE-2.0A" defined in terms of a lesser verb such as '~EMAIN-.4a".
The difficulty is explainable given two facts.
First. the lexicographers HAD to define CAUSE-2.0A using some other verb, etc.
This is inherent in the lexicon being used to define itself.
Second, once one reaches the Cop of a tengled hierarchy one cannot go any higher -and consequently forcing further definitions for basic verbs such as "be" and "cause" invariably leads CO using more specific verbs, rather than more general ones.
The situation is neither erroneous, nor inconsistent in the context of a self-defined closed system and will be discussed further in the section on noun primitives.
2.2 NOUN
PRIMITIVES One phenomenon which was anticipated in computationally grown trees was the existence of loops.
Loops are caused by having sequences of interrelated definitions whose kernels form a ring-like array \[5.20\].
However. what was not anticipated was how important such clusters of nodes would be both co the underlying basis for the Caxonomies and as primitives of the language.
Such circularity is sometimes evidence of a truly primitive concept, such as the set containing the words CLASS, GROUP, TYPE, KIND, SET.
DIVISION, CATEGORY.
SPECIES, INDIVIDUAL, GROUPING, PART and SECTION.
To understand this, consider the subset of interrelated senses these words share (Figure 3) and then the graphic representation of these in Figure 4.
GROUP 1.0A a number of individuals related by a common factor (as physical association, community of interests, or blood) CLASS 1,1A a KrouD of the same general status or nature TYPE 1.4A a c~ass, k~nd, or 2rouo set apart by com~on characteristics KIND Io2A a 2rouv united by common traits or interests KIND 1.2B CATEGORY,CATEGORY .0A a division used in classification ; CATEGORY .0B CLASS, GROUP, KIND DIVISION .2A one of the Darts, sections, or =rouDinas into which a whole is divided *GROUPING <-" W7 a set of objects combined in a group SET 3.5A a zrouv of persons or things of the same kind or having a common characteristic usu.

"GROUP" Concept Primitive from Dictionary Definitions * Note: SECTIONS, PARTS, and GROUPINGS have additional connections not shown which lead to a related primitive cluster dealing with the PART/WHOLE concept.
This complex interrelated set of definitions comprise a primitive concept, essentially equivalent to the notion of SET in mathematics.
The primitiveness of the set is evident when one attempts to define any one of the above words without using another of them in that definition.
135 This essential property, the inability to write a definition explaining a word's meaning without using another member of some small set of near synonymous words, is the basis for describing such a set as a PRIMITIVE.
It is based upon the notion of definition given by Wilder \[21\], which in turn was based upon a presentation of the ideas of Padoa, a turn-of-the-century logician.
The definitions are given, the disambiguation of their kernel's senses leads to a cyclic structure which cannot be resolved by attributing erroneous judgements to either the lexicographer or the disambiguator; therefore the structure is taken as representative of an undefinable pyimitive concept, and the words whose definitions participate in this complex structure are found Co be undefinable without reference to the other members of the set of undefined terms.
The question of what to do with such primitives is not really a problem, as Winograd notes \[22\], once one realizes that they must exist at some level, just as mathematical primitives must exist.
In tree construction the solution is to form a single node whose English surface representation may be selected from any of the words in the primitive set.
There probably are connotative differences between the members of the set.
but the ordinary pocket dictionary does not treat these in its definitions with any detail.
The Merriam-Webster CollemfaCe Dictionary does include so-called "synonym paragraphs" which seem to discuss the connotative differences between words sharing a "ring".
While numerous studies of lexical domains such as the verbs of motion \[1,12,13\] and possession \[10\] have been carried out by ocher researchers, it is worth noting that recourse to using ordinary dictionary definitions as a source of material has received little attention.
Yet the "primitives" selected by Donald A.
Norman, David E.
Romelhart, and the LNR Research Group for knowledge representation in their system bear a remarkable similarity to those verbs used must often as kernels in The Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary and Donald Sherman has shown (Table 4) these topmost verbs to be among the most common verbs in the Collegiate Dictionary as well \[19\].
The most frequent verbs of the MPD are, in descending order.
MAKE, BE, BECOME, CAUSE, GIVE, MOVE, TAKE, PUT, FORM, BEING, HAVE.
and GO.
The similarity of these verbs to those selected by the LNH group for their semantic representations, i.e., BECOME, CAUSE, CHANGE, DO, MOVE.
POSS ("have"), T~SF ("give","take"), etc., \[10.14.18\] is striking.
This similarity is indicative of an underlying "rightness" of dictionary definitions and supports the proposition that the lexical information extractable frca study of the dictionary will prove to be the same knowledge needed for computational linguistics.
The enumeration of the primitives for nouns and verbs by analysis of the tangled hierarchies of the noun and verb forests grown from the MPD definitions is a considerable undertaking and one which goes beyond the scope of this paper.
To see an example of how this technique works in practice, consider the discovery of the primitive group starting from PLACE-1.3A.
place-l.3a a building or locality used for a special purpose The kernels of this definition are "building" and "locality".
Lookiog these up in turn we have: building-.la a usu.

Looking these up we find the circularity forming the primitive group.

LOCALITY, SPOT, SITE, SITUATION, and LOCATION 2.3 NOUNS TERMINATING IN RELATIONS TO oTHER NOUNS OR VERBS In addition to terminating in "dictionary circles" or "loops", nouns also terminate in definitions which are actually text descriptions of case arguments of verbs or relationships to other nouns.
"Vehicle" is a fine example of the former, being as it were the canonical instrumental case argument of one sense of the verb "carry" or "transport".
vehicle a means of carrying or transporting something '~eaf" is an example of the letter, being defined as a part of a plant, leaf a usu.
flat and green outgrowth of a plant stem that is a unit of foliage and functions esp.
in photosynthesis.
interaction of the PART-OF and ISA hierarchies.
Historically even Raphael \[17\] used a PART-OF relationship together with the ISA hierarchy of gig's deduction system.
What however is new is that I am not stating "leaf" is a part of a plant because of some need use this fact within a particular system's operation.
but "discovering" this in a published reference source and noting that such information results naturally from an effort to assemble the complete lexical structure of the dictionary.
2.4 PARTITIVES
AND COLLECTIVES Thus "leaf" isn't a type of anything.
Even though under a strictly genus/differentia interpretation one would analyze "leaf" as being in an ISA relationship with "outgrowth", "outgrowth" hasn't a suitable homogeneous set of members and a better interpretation for modeling this definition would be to consider the "outgrowth of" phrase to signify a part/whole relationship between "leaf" and "plant".
Hence we may consider the dictionary to have at least two taxonomic relationships (i.e.
ISA and ISPART) as well as additional relations explaining noun terminals as verb arguments.
One can also readily see that there will be taxonomic interactions among nodes connected across these relationship "bridges".
While the parts of a plant will include the "leaves", "stem", "roots", etc., the corresponding parts of any TYPE of plant may have further specifications added to their descriptions.
Thus "plant" specifies a functional form which can be further elaborated by descent down its ISA chain.
For example, a "frond" is a type of "leaf", frond a usu.
large divided leaf (as of a fern) We knew from "leaf" that it was a normal outgrowth of a "plant", but now we see that "leaf" can be specialized, provided we get confirmation from the dictionary that a "fern" is a "plant".
(Such confirmation is only needed if we grant "leaf" more than one sense meaning, but words in the Pocket Dictionary do typically average 2-3 sense meanings).
The definition of "fern" gives us the needed linkage, offering, fern any of a group of flowerless seedless vascular green plants Thus we have a specialized name for the "leaf" appendage of a "plant" if that plant is a "fern".
This can be represented as in Figure 6.
ISPART leaf ------=='''''> plant /\ /\ II II II II II II ISA II II ISA II il II II II II II ISPART \[\[ frond =====~=~==="==''> fern Figure 6.
LEAF:PLANT::FHOND:FERN This conclusion that there are two major transitive taxonomies and that they are related is not of course new.
Evens etal.
\[6,7\] have dealt with the PART-OF relationship as second only to the ISA relationship in importance, and Fahlmen \[8,9\] has also discussed the As mentioned in Section 2.3, the use of "outgrowth" in the definition of "leaf" causes problems in the taxonomy if we treat "outgrowth" as the true genus term of that definition.
This word is but one ~*-mple of a broad range of noun terminals which may be described as "partitives".
A "partitive" may be defined as a noun which serves as a general term for a PART of another large and often very non-homogeneous set of concepts.
Additionally. at the opposite end of the partitive scale, there is the class of "collectives".
Collectives are words which serve as a general term for a COLLECTION of other concepts.
The disambiguators often faced decisions as to whether some words were indeed the true semantic kernels of definitions, and often found additional words in the definitions which were more semantically appropriate to serve as the kernel -albeit they did not appear syntactically in the correct position.
Many of these terms were partitives and collectives.
Figure 7 shows a set of partitives and collectives which were extracted and classified by Gretchen Hazard and John White during the dictionary project.
The terms under "group names", "whole units", and "system units" are collectives.
Those under "individuators".
"piece units".
"space shapes", "existential units", "locus units", and "event units" are partitives.
These terms usually appeared in the syntactic frame "An of" and this additionally served to indicate their functional role.
