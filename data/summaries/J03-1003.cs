For example, Malouf (2000) has shown that large corpora can be used to determine the order of realization of sequences of prenominal adjectives.

One advantage of this logical perspective is that logical properties that are not covered by most generation algorithms (such as not having a certain property; see van Deemter [2002]) fit in very well with this perspective.

Cost Functions One of the important open questions in natural language generation is how the common rule-based approaches to generation can be combined with recent insights from statistical natural language processing (see, e.g., Langkilde and Knight [1998] and Malouf [2000] for partial answers).

According to Dale and Reiter (1995) and Reiter (1990), human speakers have a general preference for basic level values and move to more specific (subsumed) values only if these are more informative.
P90-1013
Some algorithms are fully formalized and come with explicit characterizations of their complexity (e.g., Dale and Reiter 1995; van Deemter 2000); others are more conceptual and concentrate on exploring new directions (e.g., Stone and Webber 1998).

By defining cost functions in different ways, we can mimic and extend various well-known algorithms from the literature (see also Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg [2001]).

2. Generating Referring Expressions There are many different algorithms for the generation of referring expressions, each with its own objectives: Some aim at producing the shortest possible description (e.g., Dale’s [1992] full brevity algorithm), others focus on psychological realism (e.g., Dale and Reiter’s [1995] incremental algorithm) or realistic output (e.g., Horacek 1997).

In this respect it is comparable to the Dale and Haddock (1991) algorithm, granted that here the problems with infinite recursions do not arise, since a particular edge is either present in a graph or not.

1. Introduction The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades, including Appelt (1985), Reiter (1990), Dale and Haddock (1991), Dale (1992), Dale and Reiter (1995), Horacek (1997), Stone and Webber (1998), Krahmer and Theune (1998, 2002), Bateman (1999), and van Deemter (2000, 2002).

For this purpose they use a version of centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) augmented with a recency effect essentially due to Haji˘cov´a (1993).

There may, however, be certain dependencies between content selection and realization (see, e.g., Horacek [1997] and Krahmer and Theune [2002]).

Defining an upper bound K, however, does have a disadvantage: We lose completeness (see van Deemter [2002]).

(4) The combined use of graphs and cost functions paves the way for a natural integration of traditional rule-based approaches to generating referring expressions and more recent statistical approaches, such as Langkilde and Knight (1998) and Malouf (2000), in a single algorithm.
