Firstly, as Collins demonstrates (Collins, 1996), accurate parse selection, which is important for ambiguity resolution, requires lexical statistics.

Examples of the first approach can be seen most clearly with the usage of CNF grammars by the Inside-Outside algorithm (Pereira and Schabes, 1992, Lari and Young, 1990).

Given the embryonic status of grammatical statistical models and the difficulties of accurately estimating the parameters of such a model, it seems more prudent to prefer whenever possible simpler statistical models with fewer parameters, and treat lexicalisation as part of the grammatical formalism, and not as part of the statistical framework (for example (Schabes, 1992)).
