Previous works dealing with translating telegraphic text, such as (Grishman and Sterling, 1989), (Lee et al., 1997) requires to identify dependency relations among the tokens of the telegraphic input.

The system belongs to the family of WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) (Power and Scott, 1998) text generation systems: logical forms are entered interactively and the corresponding linguistic realization of the expressions is generated in several languages.

Similar methods were used for AAC applications, COMPANSION (McCoy, 1997) for example – where the telegraphic text is expanded to full sentences, using a word order parser, and a semantic parser to build the case frame structure of the verb in the utterance, filling the slots with the rest of the content words given.

This provides a reliable approximation of the learning curve and usability of the system in general (Biller et al., 2005).

In the last decade, several systems that integrate NLG techniques for AAC systems have been developed ((McCoy, 1997), (Vaillant, 1997) for example).

Messages via Semantic Authoring Our approach differs from previous NLG-AAC systems in that, with the model of semantic authoring (Biller et al., 2005), we intervene during the process of composing the input sequence, and thus can provide early feedback (in the form of display composition and partial text feedback), while preventing the need for parsing a telegraphic sequence.

Figure 1: A snapshot of the Bliss Lexicon Web Application The core of the processing machinery of the AAC message generation system is based on SAUT (Biller et al., 2005) – an authoring system for logical forms encoded as conceptual graphs (CG).
