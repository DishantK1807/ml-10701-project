tVIodeling syntactic constraints on anaphoric binding Mary Dalrymple SRI International and Stanford University John Maxwell Xerox-PARC Annie Zaenen Xerox-PARC and CSLI, Stanford University Abstract Syntactic constraints on antecedent-anaphor relations can be stated within the theory of Lexical Functional Grammar (henceforth LFG) through the use of functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988; Halvorsen and Kaplan 1988; Ksplan and Zaenen 1989).
C88-1060
Kaplan and Maxwell (1988) and Kaplan and Zaenen (1989) develop a formal specification of relations involving disjunction over paths by allowing the argument position of functionM equations to denote a set of strings.

Elaboration of this representation would require us to introduce the LFG mechanism of projections (HMvorsen and Kaplan 1988), which is beyond the scope of this paper.
