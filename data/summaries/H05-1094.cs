Also, Carreras and Marquez (Carreras & M`arquez, 2004) have obtained increased performance in clause finding by training a cascade of perceptrons to minimize a single global error function.

Finally, Miller et al.(Miller et al., 2000) have combined entity recognition, parsing, and relation extraction into a jointly-trained single statistical parsing model that achieves improved performance on all the subtasks.

Current state-of-the-art systems for the ACE task (Florianetal.,2004)usethepredictionsofothernamed-entity recognizers as features, that is, they use cascaded transfer.

For example, recent CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang & De Meulder, 2003; Carreras & Marquez, 2004), which are standarddatasetsforsuchcommonNLPtasksasclauseidentification and named-entity recognition, include predictions from a part-of-phrase tagger and a shallow parser as features.
