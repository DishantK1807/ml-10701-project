<context> Manual of Style6. Wikipedia has received a great deal of attention within the research community over the last years and has been successfully utilised in such diverse fields as machine translation (Alegria et al., 2006), NE transliteration (Sproat et al., 2006), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2007), parallel corpus construction (Adafre and de Rijke, 2006) and ontology construction (Ponzetto and Strube, 2007).</context>

<context>rg Named Entity Resource. HeiNER contains 1,547,586 disambiguated English Named Entities together with translations and transliterations to 15 languages.

Translating Named Entities into the various target languages is carried out by exploiting crosslingual information contained in the online encyclopedia W</context>

The method we apply in order to recognise and disambiguate NEs in the source language follow the approach of (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006). For multilingual NE acquisition we exploit and enrich crosslingual information contained in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. With this account we demonstrate a viable solution for the efficient a</context>
<context>tricting our acquisition method to article titles, we avoid any efforts for morphological normalisation. The heuristics we apply in order to acquire NEs in the source language are those suggested by (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006): Let e2E be a given Wikipedia entity for which we have to decide whether it is an NE or not, and let e.title be the title attributed to this entity in Wikipedia: 1.

The methods for the creation follow in substance the settings from (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006). These are described below. 3.2.1. Creating the Disambiguation Dictionary For each language, the Disambiguation Dictionary (DisDict) is constructed by executing the following steps: 1. for each NE p</context>

An example of the constructed dataset for Chinese and English can bee seen in Figure 5. &lt;dataset neID=’2134’ lang=’zh’ neStr=’T ’&gt; &lt;context id=’1’</context>
