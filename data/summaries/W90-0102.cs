In previous work, one of us noted that generation according to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be semantically monotonic (Shieber, 1988); the derived semantics for an expression must include, in an appropriate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.

1This issue of canonicality of logical forms is discussed by Shieber (1988).

Furthermore, it is reasonable to require that the semantic component of a synchronous TAG be iexicalized (in the sense of Schabes et al.(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing according to the semantic grammar and, consequently, more efficient generation.

For instance, Wedekind (1988) requires a property of a grammar that he refers to as connectedness, which specifies that complements be semantically connected to their head.
C88-2150
Semantichead-driven generation (Shieber et al., forthcoming; Calder et al., 1989) uses semantic heads and their complements as a locus of semantic locality.

Shieber (1988) defines a notion of semantic monoLonicity, a kind of compositionality property that guarantees that it can be locally determined whether phrases can contribute to forming an expression with a given meaning.

The same observation runs as an undercurrent in the work of McDonald and Pustejovsky (1985), who apply TAGs to the task of generation.

Finally, the base TAGs may be lexicalized (Schabes et al., 1988) or not.
