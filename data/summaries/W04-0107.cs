In later work, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) extend their technique to identify not only suffixes but also prefixes and circumfixes by building both forward and backward tries over a corpus.

Additional details concerning the candidate inflection class framework can be found in Monson (2004).
P04-2012
Goldsmith (2001), by searching over a space of morphology models limited to substitution of suffixes, ties morphology yet closer to orthography.
J01-2001
We currently have plans to employ statistical independence and correlation tests to adjacent CIC’s as a guide to search (Monson, 2004).
P04-2012
At one end of the spectrum is the work of Yarowsky et al.(2001), who derive a morphological analyzer for a language, L, by projecting the morphological analysis of a resource-rich language onto L through a clever application of statistical machine translation style word alignment probabilities.
H01-1035
Monson (2004) describes how morpheme boundary links in a CIC lattice can be thought of as branchings in a vocabulary trie where identical subtries are conflated.
P04-2012
Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarBarcelona, July 2004 Association for Computations Linguistics ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology (SIGPHON) Proceedings of the Workshop of the ity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000), who first acquire a list of pairs of potential morphological variants (PPMV’s) using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999), in which pairs of words from a corpus vocabulary with the same initial string are identified.
