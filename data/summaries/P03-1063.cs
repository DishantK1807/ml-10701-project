Text chunking has been one of the most interesting problems in natural language learning community since the first work of (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) using a machine learning method.

To solve this problem, we have proposed a combining method of the rules and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm (Park and Zhang, 2001).

The main purpose of the machine learning methods applied to this task is to capture the hypothesis that best determine the chunk type of a word, and such methods have shown relatively high performance in English (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Zhang et.
