To achieve that, we use inter-lingual triggers to build translation tables required by the decoder Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) in order to translate an English source corpus into French. Bleu score allows us to evaluate the quality of the obtained French translation. In section (3.3.), we start with a Word-Based Machine Tra</context>

Word-based Translation with Inter-Lingual Triggers In (Lavecchia et al., 2007b), we built a word-based Machine Translation (WBMT) system based on 1-To-1 triggers.

Corpora We present results on a subtitle parallel corpus built using Dynamic Time Wrapping algorithm (Lavecchia et al., 2007a). Subtitle corpora are very attractive due to the used spontaneous language which contains formal and informal words. We think that such corpus constitute a good challenge to go towards spontaneous </context>
