A similar scheme was proposed by Babych and Hartley (Babych and Hartley, 2004) for BLEU.
P04-1079
Many methods for calculating the similarity have been proposed (Niessen et al., 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gime´nez et al., 2005).

In our research, 23 scores, namely BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) with maximum n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4, NIST (NIST, 2002) with maximum n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, GTM (Turian et al., 2003) with exponents of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0, METEOR (exact) (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), WER (Niessen et al., 2000), PER (Leusch et al., 2003), and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) with n-gram lengths of 1, 2, 3, and 4 and 4 variants (LCS, S∗,SU∗, W-1.2), were used to calculate each similarity S i . Therefore, the value of m in Eq.

Usually, about 300 or more sentences are used to automatically rank MT systems (Koehn, 2004).
W04-3250
In recent years, many researchers have tried to automatically evaluate the quality of MT and improve the performance of automatic MT evaluations (Niessen et al., 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gime´nez et al., 2005) because improving the performance of automatic MT evaluation is expected to enable us to use and improve MT systems efficiently.
C04-1072 P02-1040 P04-1079 W04-1013 W05-0909
For example, Och reported that the quality of MT results was improved by using automatic MT evaluation measures for the parameter tuning of an MT system (Och, 2003).
