Since the model estimation has been reduced to simple update calculations, the proposed model is similar to conventional spreading activation approaches, which have been applied, for example, to word sense disambiguation (Veronis and Ide, 1990).

Riloff et al.(2003) focused on the collection of subjective nouns.

Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) focused on conjunctive expressions such as “simple and 133 well-received” and “simplistic but well-received”, where the former pair of words tend to have the same semantic orientation, and the latter tend to have the opposite orientation.

Another interesting point is the relation to maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996), which is popular in the natural language processing community.

As mentioned in Section 2, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) used conjunctive expressions in corpus.

We should note that the finite-temperature decoding is quite different from annealing type algorithms or ‘zero-temperature decoding’, which correspond to maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and also often used in natural language processing (Cowie et al., 1992).
