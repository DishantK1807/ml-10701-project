in DEKADE TMRs represent propositions connected by discourse relations (since space permits only the briefest of descriptions, interested readers are directed to Nirenburg and Raskin 2004, Chapter 6 for details).

Lack of interannotator agreement presents a significant problem in annotation efforts (see, e.g., Marcus et al.1993). With the OntoSem semiautomated approach, there is far less possibility of 73 interannotator disagreement since people only correct the output of the analyzer, which is responsible for consistent and correct deployment of the large and complex static resources: if the knowledge bases are held constant, the analyzer will produce the same output every time, ensuring reproducibility of the annotation.

In brief, the OntoSem text analyzer takes as input open text and outputs a text-meaning representation (TMR) that represents its meaning using an ontologically grounded, language-independent metalanguage (see Nirenburg and Raskin 2004).

This conception of cross-linguistic lexicon development derives in large part from the Principle of Practical Effability (Nirenburg and Raskin 2004), which states that what can be expressed in one language can somehow be expressed in all other languages, be it by a word, a phrase, etc.

In fact, we recently carried out an experiment on porting the English lexicon to Polish and found that a) much of it could be done semi-automatically and b) the manual work for a second language is considerably less than for the first language (for further discussion, see McShane et al.2004). To sum up, the OntoSem ontology and the DEKADE environment are equally suited to any language, and the OntoSem English lexicon and analyzer can be configured to new languages with much less work required than for their initial development.

Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) created a stochastic system that labels case roles of predicates with either abstract (e.g., AGENT, THEME) or domainspecific (e.g., MESSAGE, TOPIC) roles.

Snapshot of OntoSem OntoSem is a text-processing environment that takes as input unrestricted raw text and carries out preprocessing, morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, and semantic analysis, with the results of semantic analysis represented as formal textmeaning representations (TMRs) that can then be used as the basis for many applications (for details, see, e.g., Nirenburg and Raskin 2004, Beale et al.2003). Text analysis relies on: • The OntoSem language-independent ontology, which is written using a metalanguage of description and currently contains around 6,000 concepts, each of which is described by an average of 16 properties.

In the face of the usual pressures of time and manpower, we have made the programmatic decision not to focus on all types of evaluation but, rather, to concentrate our evaluation metrics on the correctness of the automated output of the system, the extent to which manual correction is needed, and the depth and robustness of our knowledge resources (see Nirenburg et al.2004 for our first evaluation effort).

Of significant interest is the porting of annotations across languages: for example, Yarowsky et al.2001 present a method for automatic tagging of English and the projection of the tags to other languages; however, these tags do not include semantics.

Post-editing of automatic annotation has been pursued in various projects (e.g., Brants 2000, and Marcus et al.1993). The latter group did an experiment early on in which they found that “manual tagging took about twice as long as correcting [automated tagging], with about twice the interannotator disagreement rate and an error rate that was about 50% higher” (Marcus et al.1993). This conclusion supports the pursuit of automated tagging methods.
