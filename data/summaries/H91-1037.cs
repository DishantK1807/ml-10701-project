We are particularly exploring probabilistic models for this processing, and have described experiments with various probabilistie models elsewhere (Aynso, et al, 1990; Meteer, et al., 1991).

An alternative to traditional parsers is represented in FIDDITCH (Hindle, 1983), MITFP (deMarcken 1990), and CASS (Abney, 1990).

Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso et al., 1987; Bates, 1989; Grishman et al., 1986; Weischedel, et al., 1989).

In a related test, we explored the bracketings produced by Church's PARTS program (Church, 1988).

In Proteus (Grishman, 1989), complete syntactic analysis is applied.

Related Work In addition to the work discussed earlier on tools to increase the portability of natural language systems, another recent paper (Hindle and Rooth, 1990) is directly related to our goal of inferring case frame information from examples.
