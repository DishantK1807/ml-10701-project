it marks a sentence boundary is at issue (Palmer and Hearst, 1994; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997)).

In the sequel, we use Collins’s statistical parser (Collins, 1997) as our canonical automated approximation of the Treebank.

Work and Conclusion The experiments reported here — like much of the previous work in comma restoration (Beeferman et al., 1998) and sentence boundary disambiguation and restoration (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996; Shriberg et al., 2001; Gotoh and Renals, 2000; Stevenson and Gaizauskas, 2000) (though not all (Christensen et al., 2001; Stolcke et al., 1998; Kim and Woodland, 2001)) — assume an ideal reference transcription of the text.

Many alternatives suggest themselves to expand the options, including maximum entropy models, which have been previously successfully applied to, inter alia, sentence boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and transformation-based learning, as used in part-of-speech tagging and statistical parsing applications (Brill, 1995).
A97-1004 J95-4004
Stevenson and Gaizauskas (Stevenson and Gaizauskas, 2000) and Goto and Renals (Gotoh and Renals, 2000) address the sentence boundary detection problem directly, again using lexical and, in the latter, prosodic cues.
