Other existing cost-based or distance-based metrics, such as Learning Accuracy (LA) (Hahn and Schnattinger, 1998), have some flaws such as not taking into account the density of the hierarchy, and in the case of LA, being asymmetrical. By this we mean that comparing two concepts in the ontology gives different </context>

Of course, how to evaluate an evaluation metric is not obvious, but there are some general guidelines proposed by (King, 2003) for evaluation metrics that we try to follow.
