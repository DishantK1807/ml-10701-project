Both Brcnt (1993) and Manning (1993), who attempt to induce a lexicon of subcategorization features do so by completely discarding all preexisting knowledge; both systems are stand-ahmc, without a parsing engine to test or use the "learned" information.

Manning has built into his finite state device a panic mode to skip over ambiguous elements, but the trick is to recognize when things get hairy; that is where a lot of programming el'tort takes place, and this finetuning is never over (and must be repeated for every port to a new domain) as Manning himself admits (1993, 238).
