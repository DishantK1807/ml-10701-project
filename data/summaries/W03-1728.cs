Therefore, in our experiments described here, we use the Transformation-Based Learning (Brill, 1995) to combine the results of two MEMM taggers.

In that paper, pairwise voting (van Halteren et al., 1998) has been used to combine the results of two supertaggers that scan the input in the opposite directions.

The Maximum Entropy Markov Model used in POS-tagging is described in detail in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and the LMR tagger here uses the same probability model.

We use the LMR tagging output to train a TransformationBased learner, using fast TBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001).

This may sound simple enough but in reality identifying words in Chinese is a non-trivial problem that has drawn a large body of research in the Chinese language processing community (Fan and Tsai, 1988; Gan et al., 1996; Sproat et al., 1996; Wu, 2003; Xue, 2003).

The feature set used in the TBL algorithm is similar to those used in the NP Chunking task in (Ngai and Florian, 2001).

This strategy has been successfully used in (Shen and Joshi, 2003).
