Manual collections of semantic classes include the hierarchies of WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), Levin verb classes (Levin 1993), and FrameNet (Baker et al.1998). Automatic derivation of semantic classes can take a variety of approaches, but often uses corpus methods and the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris 1964) to automatically cluster similar entities into classes, e.g.

TEASE 1 (Szpektor et al.2004) and DIRT (Lin and Pantel 2001).

This, along with the difficulty and labor-intensiveness of generating exhaustive lists of rules, has led researchers to focus on automatic methods for building inference resources such as inference rule collections (Lin and Pantel 2001; Szpektor et al.2004) and paraphrase collections (Barzilay and McKeown 2001).

We used the Minipar parser (Lin 1993) to match DIRT patterns in the text.

Several important applications are already relying heavily on inference, including question answering (Moldovan et al.2003; Harabagiu and Hickl 2006), information extraction (Romano et al.2006), and textual entailment (Szpektor et al.2004). In response, several researchers have created resources for enabling semantic inference.

Another thread related to our work includes extracting from text corpora paraphrases (Barzilay and McKeown 2001) and inference rules, e.g.

Zanzotto et al.(2006) recently explored a different interplay between SPs and inferences.
