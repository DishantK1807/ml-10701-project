Pang et al (2002) considered the same problem and presented a set of supervised machine learning approaches to it.

Work 2.1 Evaluating Helpfulness of Reviews The problem of evaluating helpfulness of reviews (Kim et al, 2006), also known as learning utility of reviews (Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006), is quite similar to our problem of assessing the quality of reviews.

Kim et al (2006) used the percentage of “helpful” votes as the measure of evaluating the “quality of reviews” in their experiments.

Another area of research on opinion mining is to extract and summarize users’ opinions from product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

Existing studies (Kim et al, 2006; Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006) used these users’ votes for training ranking models to assess the quality of reviews, which therefore are subject to these biases.

In the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in mining opinions from product reviews (Pang, et al, 2002; Liu, et al, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

Unlike previous work (Kim et al, 2006; Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006) using shallow syntactic information directly, we use a sentiment analysis tool (Hu and Liu, 2004) which aggregates a set of shallow syntactic information.
