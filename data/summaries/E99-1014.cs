Effectiveness was automatically calculated by comparing the system results against a user-defined tagged corpus via the MUC scorer (Douthat, 1998).

Scenario Template recognition needs the correct treatment of syntactic relations at both sentence and text level (Aone et al., 1998).

Secondly we represent syntactic relations in the sentence (i.e., grammatical functions and thematic roles); such relations allow a better treatment of linguistic phenomena than possible in shallow approaches (Aone et ah, 1998; 105 Proceedings of EACL '99 Kameyama, 1997).

If we consider the most complex MUC-7 task (i.e., the Scenario Template task (MUC7, 1998)), the current technology is not able to provide results near an operational level (expected F(1)=75%; the best system scored about 50% (Aone et al., 1998)).

They generally adopt heuristics such as linear ordering and recency of basic chunks: such heuristics have been shown not as effective as those based on full syntactic relations, even if for some languages they represent an acceptable approximation (Kameyama, 1997).

Most successful approaches in IE (Appelt et al., 1993; Grishman, 1995; Aone et al., 1998) make a very poor use of syntactic information.

The use of big grammars partially solves the problem of gaps but worsens the problem of huge search spaces and makes grammar modifications difficult (Grishman, 1995).
