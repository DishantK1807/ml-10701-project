P.Larousse 9#241 Malakoff France ABSIPACT This paper describes an implemented tutoring system (2), designed to help students to generate clitic-constmctions in French.
While showing various ways of converting a given meaning structure into its corresponding surface expression, tbe system helps not only to discover what data to process but also h~_~ this information processing should take_place.
In other words, we are concerned with efficiency in verbal planning (performance).
Recognizing that the same result can be obtained by various methods, the student should find out ~dch one is best suited to the circumstances (what is kr~n, task demands etc.
). Infon~atiohal states, hence the preeesser's needs, may vary to a great extent, as may his strategies or cognitive styles.
In consequence, in order to become an efficient processor, flu student }\]as to acquire not only S\]RUCilRa_ or RULE-KNOWLEDGE but also PROCEDLI~-~_EIX~ (skill).
With this in mind we have designed three modules in order to foster a reflective, experimental attitude in the learner, helping him to discover insightfully the,Dst efficient strategy.
i. ~TION It is well known that the same output can be achieved by several methods.
For example, a given set of sentences or texts can be generated by a variety of equivalent but different grammars.
Any of U~se grammars can be used in numerous ways.
Grammars are generally noutra\] with respect to processing (3).
They pertain only to competence and performance factors such as memory load, focus of attention, etc.
lie out of their scope.
lh3oc~\] different granmars may be equivalent in terms of their product -they all produce the same result, i.e. the same set of senfencesthey certainly differ in te,~ns of the processing, that is to say in terms of their relative efficiency (speed, memory load, etc.
). Whereas most scholars werking in the domain of generation de not deal with strategies (4) -they consider but one way to reach the solution~e will be concerned by the procedural inlolications of using a given gra, mar in a variety of ways.
Instead of having co,loeting grammars, we will take one of them (5) and l~elate its efficiency to the way it is used.
\]\]\]is perfotmanoe-orionted approadl seems justified on theoretical as well as on practical grounds (economy and flexibility of processing).
Let us take, for example, a student who ~uld like to becone fluent in French.
Obviously, he would have to learn not only what to process, but also how to process in order to efficiently convert a given meaning (conceptual graph) into its corresponding expression (seetenee).
In oN~er werds, our student has to learn not only a set of gcammatical rules but also a set of strateqies or operating principles (6) powerful and flexible enough to get from a given input (meaning) to the output (sentence) in the most economic way, i.e. with the fewest operations, with the least storage, and wiN\] the minimum amount of transformations.
2. PROCE55, FUNCTION OF STRUCTL~: It is a well known fact that students learning French have diffienlties in producing fluently sentences with 2 pronoun ccmploments such as: Dis-le moi V-OO-lO Tell me (tell me it) Ne le lui dis pas! neg-DO-lO-V-neg Don't tell him (that)!
Ii te le donnora S-IO-DO-V He'll (.live it to you Ii le lui deonera S-DO-IO-V He'll give it to him Je te pr6sente ~ elle S-DO-V-prep-lO I'Ii pres~\]te you to her It is interesting to find out why these constructions are so difficult to learn and to process.
We believe that there are three basic reasons for this: i) the structural idiesyneraeies oF the French system: mor~\]ology and syntax are interdep~ant; 2) the procedural implications of this structure: many morphemes have an embedded structure (see below); 3) the resource limitations of the l~mn processor: being a serial processor, the learnor can focus his attention on but one thing at a time.
2.1 STRUCIIP#~ PARTICIIARITIES: French pronoun constructions are complicated because syntax and morphology are interrelated, form as well as position depending upon each other.
Their generation implies that one is capable of dete~nLning at least three things: the fom\] of a given referent: for example, the concepts SPEAKER or 3d PERSON can be realized in any of the following forms: SPEAKER: je, me, moi 3d PERSON: il, e\].le, ils, dies, on, se, sol, le, la, ies, lui, lent, cux; its position: In the affinnative mode there are three positions or sentenceframes: a) 5-10-DO-V il me le pr4sente (he presents him to me) b) S-DO--IO-V il l-e lui pr4sente (he presents him to her) c) S-DO-V---prep-I_O0 il me ~sonte ~ elle(he presents me to her) ~letber the preposition, inherent in the base, should be made explicit or not.
As the examples (b) and (c) clearly show, the same verbeonstmction may or may not require elision of the preposition.
Either one affects form as ~ell as position (7).
It should be noted that while most verbs allow only for two patterns in the.
declarative mode ('a' and 'b'), those with an animate object such as 'pr6scnter' (to present) allow also for 'c'.
566 2.2 I-I~OCE1)LI~L \]M~tICATION~: ~tm lir~dsttc constraints operate on all levels: phono\].~jicaI, mrphol(~jical and syntact.i.cal. a) H~onoloqi~il constraints: lhe detemdnation of ~)rpbology generally requires three operations (porsen, case, nLraber and so~Keimes gender), yet: pronouns are n~nosyl.labie.
\]in c~isequencc, one cannot plan tl~ i~xt pronoun while uttering tl~ eut'rc~lt one as the pronoun uttered is ton short and the time needed for planning the next ~e being too long.
b) Morphological.
om~straints: There are number of cases where the indirect object has an embedded structure, i.e.
U~. morl~ology of' the indirect object d ep~Js upon information cx~dng from the direct ~_~t (8).
This implies intercupLion of a routine.
Suppose that the sentence: 3d~ presents Paul to Mary is to be.
prononinalized. Tile problem is ttk~ detemdnati~ of form and position of Lt~ prc~)nos, referring respectively to "Paul" ar~J to "Mary".
The indirect ob~ (Mary) lexicalizes either as LUI or as EIÂ£E, dopending upon ~,ther the direct ~.
(Paul) rcl)resents the sgeaker/lister~r or a 3d person, in this latter ense (e) the verb follows the indirect object, va~ereas in the forrmr (d) i.t precedes it.
(d) il me prgsenbe ~ EI_LE (he presents ~m to her) (e) il le LUI pr4sento (he presents him to her) e) 5Vntactical constraints: lhe lir~r order of tile corlstitoents carl generally not be established, u~til both objects are known.
In cons~ce, at least one of the.
t~o elements bas to be stored in werkLng nmmory.
(f) i.1 le \]ui donne he give~s it to him (S-DO-IO-V) (g) il me ie donne he gives it to me (S-IO-DO-V) Suppose that the.
direct object has been processed right after U~ subject.
In that ease one I<nows its form but not tlcce~sarily its position ('f' or 'g').
This latter de~x~nds upon the vah~ of the indirect object.
If U~ indirect object is in tlm first or second person it precedes the dit'ect objeet (g), otherwise it Pol-.lows it (f).
Should ~e start by processing the indirect object before the direct one, we might have to keep tl~e fommr in working memory, lhis is precisely the case of "f" ~ere the indirect object is in U~e third person and not tmflexive.
As one can see, in beth sih~tions one is faced with unwanted storage problems.
Obviously these structural particularities of tlm Frend~ pron(xm system have implication~ not only for U~e process of learning but also for the process of generation, namely: they exclude any ~ord-to-word processing, and they *~@Jire a certain amount of prepl~dng or look-algld.
~lat is needed tl~n, in order tO avoid false starts or correetions (bad<tracking), i.s global planninc~ on Um clause level rat)mr than local pl.annlnc~ on the word level.
In the light of tl~-~se facts one has to ad~t that gm treeration of pro~m constructions in Frend~ is i~ot all that simple.
Althe~jh the relevant features (rules) are simple in nature, their interaction is highly conlolex.
It is U~s not surprising that students take a \].ong ti.~ to understand all U~ intricacies of the system, ~ieh would allow U~-ml eventually to integrate the rules into an efficient prccess-modei.
3. (IZI:CTIVE: The syst~n descrit~:~ here ts an atbmi)t to help the student to acquire the necessary struchJral and procedural tmowle&je.
\]~s goal mn be cl~aracteriz~t as follows: }~hi\]e lenrning experi~}ta\]ly about structore (gra,m~rrulfxs) be sheu\]d Learn as w~\].l abouL the process of incrc~ilental senter~e generation.
In other tmrds, by playlng wiU~ the system, the studmt should gain necessary insights into tJ~e gra,m~r, :its procedural implications etc.
Fie should also reflect upon his {*~l strat~lies.
All these insights shotl\]d help hlm to develop a more effiec~lt set of prxx~.edures.
Since the discovery of moll opti,nl processing strategies implies thai one \].earns t~' to access tim (~/~mtltJc~\] database under di Pferent eirc~mtance~s, -the data and theh" use being separatedwe have varied tie processing situation as well as the coding of the data.
Variable task den~nds and n~ltiple representation should enhance the flexibility, speed and econmly of processi ng.
#. l}l-SCR\[PllChi OF IFE SYSILM: \[l*e heart of the systx~n is a I(nowlc~e base v~qich contains, in fol~l of production roles, the sLrt~Wra\] infom~ltien ~vessary to ir~.'remontaiiy determine fern1 as well as pesitJon.

accessed in various ways, thus allowing for for varying usage of the knowledge acxeordi~J to the objective.
We will.
use it here in three ways, varying one of the following parmetors: input:, output, or processing, v&il.e keeping the other wing ways: ~at is Imown at the input ? wf~3t is expected at the output ? ~hid~ trothed or strategy is used to get frem one to the other ? lhe thr(~ mothods have a coIrl/lOn goaL, ncqllle\].y, the building of larger bhx~ks (sd/emotas).
Ole of the main objectives is to induce strat*;gies ~here items belonging c(xqoeptoally together aide also preeess~ together (grouping).
This cl~nklng meU~ed avoids not only t~necessary disruptions and memory \]cad, but it hepefully Favors the evolutico fro~ serial to simaltanecus prooessing.
5. )~PLZCAT\]ONS: %1 "IFÂ£ SOC~IIC IvE~OD: The system guides the student in the form of a dialogue, by ~lowing him ~hat and }low to process in order to get from an input to the outpuC.
file use\[' starts by pt~vidin 9 the input (verb pattern composed of a verb, its conlolements and prepositions ) : donner (qn,qc,~ qn) to give (so, sth, to so) lhe system takes over, asking for more infom~tion about these basic el~llents.
By asking specific questions (persc~l, gender, nm~er etc.), the systems shows ~dch informoti~ Js relevant ~hm determining form as well as position.
~hile answering these questions the student incrementally determines the final form of t|~ sentenc*~, lhe following example may illustrate Ute proeess: 567 IN~UI given by the user: PROCESSING donner(quelqu'un, quelque chose, ~ quelqu'un) to give (somebody, something, to somebody) prompts f~m the system answers given by success, questions (attributes) the user (value) OUIPUTS SPEECH-ACT order SUBJECT person 2 number plural donnez DIRECT OBJECT quantity definite person 3 number singular gender male le IN)TRECT OBJECT person i nmi~er singular moi linearized output: donnez-le moi!
(give it to me!
) \]he qualities of this socratic dialogue \].ie in the visualization of the whole process.
The system demonstrates which information should be processed and in what order.
It also shows under ~hat conditions movement of constituents are necessary.
These per'mutations are g~own on the screen, so that the user can learn ~deh features control those movements.
Furthermore, the results of the processed date are shown on-line, i.e. the form and position of the ~ord determined are shown instantaneously.
Finally the system tells ~hether the newly determined item can be articulated right away or not.
The system is thus explicit with respect to rule knowledge and optimal in temm of processing.
The result is obtained in the most economic way.
The disadvantage of this sys~-drivm processing reside in the fact that the solution, or more precisely, the method used to arrive at the solution, is shown but not discovered.
Moreover, only one method is considered, hence the procedural knowledge remains implicit.
Tim student will not even envisage other methods.
He may thus know how to convert meaning into sentences, bat this knowledge being implicit, he will not know how to transfer it to other situations.
5,2 GUIDED DISCOVERY The system still controls the nature of the operations but no longer controls their order.
The latter is controlled, via strategies, by the user.
He decides in what order to process tlm data, Having determined the subject, whose positions is invariable, one can choose from three strategies: a syntactical one (syntactic-driven processing), and two morphological ones (le~ical-ddven processing).
If priority is given to syntax, no reordering of constituents is meant to take place, i.e. all information pertaining to ~rd order is processed.
The result is an ordered eategoriai structure or syntactical frame (h) @rich will be filled in by the merphologicai values determined later (i), for ex~lole: he gives it to her (h) sentence frame: Stl3~CT DI~CT OBfCT IN), 0B~CT VERB (i) morpholo9~: il le lui donne 568 If priority is given to morphelogy (lexically-driven generation), the form is determined before U~e relative order of the constituent elemeats.
In this ease two strategies are possible: either one proeesses the direct or the iodi.rect object.
The efficiency of these three strategies is of course not the same.
It is precisely the user's task to find out whidl of these strategies is tlm most efficient.
The system invites him to compare these methods by applying certain performance criteria: oumher of steps necessary to generate the sentence, what is kno~ when ? (form/position), congruence of inpet/output order (are permutations necessary?
LIFO/FIFO) are there any conceptual disruptions ? (9) This experimental method should make the student aware of the fact that several strategies can be used to arrive at the solution.
Ha should compare them with respect to certain criteria and reach his conclusions.
5.3 USER
DRI~_N EtPERIMENTATION: This method, like the previous one, is empirical.
By playing with the system the student may gain certain insights about processing order, A matrix appears on the screen, ~ose blank spaces have to be filled in by the student.
The herizontal line ~lows the syntactic information given with tim input (verb, subject, object, preposition), -more inforfmltion is needed about those elementstlm vertical line shows the nature of the information necessary to arrive at the output.
Thus the processing once again consists of tlm specification of the values of a llst of attributes.
However there is a fundamental differences between this approach and tlm former, namely, the system has an inference mechanism.
Each item of information given to the system is considered for its meaning potential, i.e. the system tries to fi.nd out whether some new facts can be inferred from the old fact.
It should be noted that the inference power varies with the nature of the data as ~ll as with their order, lhere are eases ~mre a single fact enables 3 other faet~ to he deduced (reflexives).
A given inference,my allow further deductions (inference-chain, knowledge propagation).
This has of course an effect on Um process, tamely, tim greater the inference power, the greater tlm ecmow of precessing.
This speaks for the following operating principle: the greater the inference power of a given piece of information, tim earlier it should be processed.
\]his method is interesting in that, by testing different items and different order~ it makes possible to watch on the screen which items allow what inferences.
Sinee those inferences depend upon the nature of the input as ~ell as on tim moment at ~hieh that information is given, we believe that this module is particularly useful in helping discover the best possible order of processing.
Furthermore we think that this method has another virtue, namely that it can simulate literally any knowledge state, thus meking it possible, by experimental means to disoover the shortest path bet~en a given information state (input) and the solution (output).
6. O\]4CLLSIONS: We have str(msed the need for teac~dn 9 procedural kr@le6tje (strategies) as well as structural knowledge (linguistic roles).
~tmt~t~ore, ~ ar(~Jed that tt~ proeeO~-es to be \].earned had to be flexible, \[x~JSe the input conditions (informational states) as well as the cognitive styles may vary beth ar~ ledividuals and within the :mine incH.vidual.
In integrating U~ student into the learning-process We hopefully make him: actively curl(~JS (testing of hypothesis -learning by discovery); conscious abc~t the need for planning (how far should one plan e~md ? ~qat are the planning units ?); = selective a\[x~it the means he should use (whid~ strategy is best under what e.troumstances ?).
lhe ~ole zdca of having different strategies cmDete has been largely i~)red by current work on language generation.
~ile this as~ct may be only of secondary interest for automatLe g~mration in genoral, it certainly is not an animportant issue in cognitive model\[ ling, ~ther it be second langJage-learning or usage.
7. NOTES: 1 Â° Oar grammar deals only with a sn~ll\] subset oF French, r~ely pronoun constructions (ctitics).
Starting with input propositions of the type: to give (sc~t~,se#~thing,to sm~N~dy) the system helps live student to determine the output.
\]\]~ input above could \[cad to any of tl~ fell.owing output: QUESTION: Est-ce que tu le lui as dc~\]ne Â° ASSERTION: Je le lui donne.
BRDER: Donne le lui ! 2 Â° \]he modules described are written in S~m\]a and Prolng.
They Were implemented by G.Sahah and C.Alviset. 3 Â° There are a few exceptions like Robinson's (1975), Carrol's (1980) or I<ml0en & Fbenk~'s (1982) approad~.
#o See for example: Davey (1978), Mc Donald (1983), Mc i<eo~) (1982), Mann (1983), Sewa (\]983), Danlos (1985).
5 Â° Oar gr~m~r is basically a lexical-functional grammar (see Kay, 1979) 6 Â° ~Dng those operating principles are the following: avoid disruptions by grouping together ~at belongs c~eptually toge~r; start with the most informative items (feature hierarchy: PERS~, CASE_, NLM~R, GE~I~_R); avoid unnecessary storage start wi.th the lefi~st item.
7 Â° lhe fact that prepositions have marphological reflexes has been readily recognized by linguists.
~at has not been sho~ ate the conditions under which a preposition has to be explicited or not, but that is the kind of knowledge a speaker must have.
8 Â° This is generally r~t made explicit in lingeistlc descriptions.
9 Â° Given the fact that the ~le process is visualized in form of Pasca\]-like structures, the stt~ent can easily realize at what moment conceptual disnJptions take place.
Hierarc~y is signalled through indentations.
All features pertaining to the same refet~nt arerepresented on the same level.
It can happen that one cannot process all infonmltton for a given referent.
For exarole if prtority is given to syntax it often happens that one cannot oo~olete a procedure because of an onbedded structure.
Having started with the dlrect object, one needs information from the indirect object before getting ~lck to the original object.
\]his jm~in 9 forth and bade results in conceptual disruption, ~hich is precisely ~}at sheuld be avoided.
