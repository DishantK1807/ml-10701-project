We contend that information about how functional relations are actually instantiated in a text is important for the following reasons: • it is linguistically valuable, both as an end in itself and as an intermediate linguistic resource; in fact, it is sufficiently close to semantic representations to be used as an intermediate stage of analysis in systems requiring full text understanding capabilities; 39 • it is likely to become a more and more heavily used information asset in its own right for NLP applications: a shift of emphasis from purely pattern matching methods operating on n-word windows to functional information about word pairs has recently been witnessed both in the context of information retrieval/filtering systems (Grefenstette, 1994) and for the purposes of word sense disambiguation (see the last SENSEVAL and ROMANSEVAL evaluation campaigns); • it is comparatively easy and "fair" to evaluate since it overcomes some of the shortcomings of constituency-based evaluation (Carroll and Briscoe, 1996; Carroll et al., 1998; Sampson, 1998; Lin, 1998); • it represents a very informative "lowest common ground" of a variety of different syntactic annotation schemes (Lin, 1998); • it is naturally multi-lingual, as functional relations probably represent the most significant level of syntactic analysis at which crosslanguage comparability makes sense; • it permits joint evaluation of systems dealing with both spoken and written language.

The hierarchy of figure 2.3.1 is a revision of the SPARKLE functional hierarchy (Carroll et al., 1996), in the light of the methodological points raised in section 2.2.

Most available tag taxonomies for functional annotation (such as those provided by, e.g., Karls40 son's Constraint Grammar (Karlsson et al., 1995), or the SPARKLE annotation scheme (Carroll et al., 1996), to mention but two of them) typically collapse the levels above into one level only, for reasons ranging from a theoretical bias towards a maximally economic description of the phenomena in question or a particular view of the way syntactic phenomena are mutually implied from a logical standpoint, to choices chiefly motivated by the intended application.
