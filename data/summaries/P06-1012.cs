In another work, Agirre and Martinez (2004) trained a WSD system on data which was automatically gathered from the Internet.

Escudero et al.(2000) exploited the difference in coverage between these two corpora to separate the DSO corpus into its BC and WSJ parts for investigating the domain dependence of several WSD algorithms.
W00-1322
The widely used SEMCOR (SC) corpus (Miller et al., 1994) is one of the few currently available manually sense-annotated corpora for WSD.
H94-1046
Corpus The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains 192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70 verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ.

In addition, we implemented the unsupervised method of (McCarthy et al., 2004), which calculates a prevalence score for each sense of a word to predict the predominant sense.

To investigate this, Escudero et al.(2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which contains sentences drawn from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ).
W00-1322
Results Similar to our previous work (Chan and Ng, 2005b), we used the supervised WSD approach described in (Lee and Ng, 2002) for our experiments, using the naive Bayes algorithm as our classifier.
W02-1006
To gather training examples from these parallel texts, we used the approach we described in (Ng et al., 2003) and (Chan and Ng, 2005b).
P03-1058
To tackle this problem, in one of our recent work (Ng et al., 2003), we had gathered training data from parallel texts and obtained encouraging results in our 92 evaluation on the nouns of SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task (Kilgarriff, 2001).
P03-1058
We found that the WSD accuracies obtained with the method of (McCarthy et al., 2004) are on average 1.9% lower than our NBcal-EMa0 a2a4a3 a5 method, and the difference is statistically significant.
P04-1036
of Words Research by (McCarthy et al., 2004) highlighted that the sense priors of a word in a corpus depend on the domain from which the corpus is drawn.
P04-1036
Since the test data for the nouns of SENSEVAL-3 English lexical sample task (Mihalcea et al., 2004) were also drawn from BNC and represented a difference in domain from the parallel texts we used, we also expanded our evaluation to these SENSEVAL-3 nouns.
W04-0807
McCarthy et al.(2004) provided a partial solution by describing a method to predict the predominant sense, or the most frequent sense, of a word in a corpus.
