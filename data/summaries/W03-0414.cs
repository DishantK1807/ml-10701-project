In this section, we restrict our attention (again, following (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001)) to five ‘core’ pos, N (noun), V (verb), J (adjective), R (adverb), and I (preposition or subordinating conjunction).

In preparation, we use the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) to annotate the English part of the corpus with pos tags.

As for (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) estimating lexical priors is merely an intermediate step, they do not report evaluation results for this step.
H01-1035 N01-1026
Having said this, we follow in principle the algorithm proposed by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) to estimate lexical priors.

We annotate the English side of the corpus with pos tags, using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995).

(Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993)) are best known and studied.
J90-2002 J93-2003
(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) propose the same algorithm as the one proposed here for their estimation of lexical priors, with the exception that they use automatic word alignments rather than our extraction algorithm for finding corresponding words.

One notable example in this context is (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Yamada and Knight, 2002), who introduce syntactic knowledge into their statistical translation model.
P01-1067 P02-1039
However, as was noted by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), most words tend to have at most two pos.

(Goldsmith, 1995)), with the notable exception of (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001).

Our work falls in line with the bilingual analysis described in (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001).
H01-1035 N01-1026
(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) aim at pos tagging a target language corpus using English pos tags as well as estimation of lexical priors (i.e.
