Examples are pure bottom-up methods, such as left-corner parsing without topdown filtering (Wiren, 1987).
E87-1037
For instance, the algorithms presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999) allow recognition in time O(IVDI 3 IwI4).
P99-1059
Several algorithms commonly used in natural language parsing satisfy this property, as for instance Earley's algor!thm (Earley, 1970), tabular left-corner and PLR parsing (Nederhof, 1994) and tabular LR parsing (Tomita, 1986).
P94-1017
This formalism, originally presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999), is an abstraction of the language models adopted by several state-of-the-art real-world parsers (see Section 1).
P99-1059
Bilexical context-free grammars have been presented in (Eisner and Satta, 1999) as an abstraction of language models that have been adopted in several recent real-world parsers, improving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy (A1shawl, 1996; Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1997).
P97-1003 P99-1059
With respect to grammar formalisms based upon context-free grammars, and when the rules of these formalisms strongly depend on lexical information, (van Noord, 1997) shows that bidirectional strategies are more efficient than leftto-right strategies.

Our presentation relies on definitions from (Nederhof and Satta, 1996).
P96-1032
In contrast, several algorithms have been proposed in the literature that process the input in a bidirectional fashion; see (van Noord, 1997; Satta and Stock, 1994) and references therein.
J97-3004
We perceive that these results can be extended to other language models that properly embed bilexical context-free grammars, as for instance the more general history-based models used in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998).
P98-1035 W97-0301
These desiderata are met by existing bidirectional algorithms (Alshawi, 1996; Eisner, 1997; Eisner and Satta, 1999).
