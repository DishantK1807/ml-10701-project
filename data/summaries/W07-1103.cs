Work In previous work addressing nested entities, Shen et al.(2003), Zhang et al.(2004), Zhou et al.(2004), Zhou (2006), and Gu (2006) considered the GENIA 2Both corpora are represented in XML with standoff annotation, potentionally allowing overlapping NEs.

Finally, Zhang et al (2006) cluster the parallel training corpus using an algorithm that heuristically minimizes the average entropy of source-side and target-side language models over a fixed number of clusters.

Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006).

Villavicencio et al.(2004) defined a specific metatype for each particular class of MWEs.

However, at the short term, the incorporation of these type of features will force us to either build a new decoder or extend an existing one, or to move to a new MT architecture, for instance, in the fashion of the architectures suggested by Tillmann and Zhang (2006) or Liang et al.(2006).

For instance, some max-margin methods restrict their computations to a set of examples from a ?feasible set,?? where they are expected to be maximally discriminative (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006).

This makes it suitable for discriminative SMT training, which is still a challenge for large parameter sets (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006; Liang et al., 2006).

Kuiper et al.(2003) worked on a representation of English idioms, and Villavicencio et al.(2004) proposed a lexical encoding of MWEs in general, by analysing English idioms and verb-partical constructions.

This might prove beneficial for various discriminative training methods (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006).

The ISL SMT decoder is capable of loading several language models (LMs) at the same time, namely n-gram SRI language models with n up to 4 and suffix array language models (Zhang and Vogel, 2006) of arbitrary length.
