The techniques for dealing with indirect speech acts (Perrault & Allen, 1980 ) can be used directly to analyse these cases.

All the examples given in this paper can be run, as well as a few others discussed in Hinkelman (1989).

This is a promising approach, and was the starting point for the computational model of indirect speech act recognition developed by Allen and Perrault (Perrault & Allen, 1980, Allen, 1983).

More details on the system and its capabilities can be found in Hinkelman & Allen (1989) as well.
