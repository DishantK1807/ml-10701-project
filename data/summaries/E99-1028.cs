A more recent unsupervised approach is described in (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).

The approach proposed in this paper explicitly introduces new entities, i.e. hypothetical verbs when an entity is judged polysemous and associates them with contexts which are sub-contexts of the context of the original entity• Our algorithm has two basic operations, splitting and lumping• Splitting means to divide a polysemous verb into two hypothetical verbs and lumping means to combine two hypothetical verbs to make one verb out of them (Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994).

We say that wv and nq are semantically related if w~i and nq are semantically related and (wp, nq) and (w~i, nq) are semantically similar (Dagan et al., 1993).

One of the major approaches to disambiguate word senses is supervised learning (Gale et al., 1992), (Yarowsky, 1992), (Bruce and Janyce, 1994), (Miller et al., 1994), (Niwa and Nitta, 1994), (Luk, 1995), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998).

The data we have used is 1989 Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in ACL/DCI CD-ROM which consists of 2,878,688 occurrences of part-of-speech tagged words (Brill, 1992).
