Tree-Adjoining Grammar Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al., 1988; Schabes, 1990) consists of ELEMENTARY TREES, with each elementary tree having a lexical item (anchor) on its frontier.

of our approach to using EBL We are pursuing the EBL approach in the context of a wide-coverage grammar development system called XTAG (Doran et al., 1994).
C94-2149
The XTAG system consists of a morphological analyzer, a part-ofspeech tagger, a wide-coverage LTAG English grammar, a predictive left-to-right Early-style parser for LTAG (Schabes, 1990) and an X-windows interface for grammar development (Paroubek et al., 1992).

Samuelsson (1994) used the information-theoretic measure of entropy to derive the appropriate sized tree chunks automatically.

In other EBL approaches (Rayner, 1988; Neumann, 1994; Samuelsson, 1994) it is necessary to walk up and down the parse tree to determine the appropriate subtrees to generalize on and to suppress the feature values.
