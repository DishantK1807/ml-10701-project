Authorability is stressed in IDAS because we believe this is the best way to achieve IDAS'S goal of fairly broad, but not necessarily deep, domain coverage; short responses are stressed because IDAS's hypertext interface should allow users to dynamically choose the paragraphs they wish to read, i.e., perform their own highlevel text-planning \[Reiter et al., 1992\].

If a unification system is based on a typed feature logic, then its grammar can include classificationlike subsumption tests \[Elhadad, 1990\], and thus be as expressive in specifying patterns as a classification system.

More sophisticated text-structuring techniques have been discussed by, among others, Mann and Moore \[1981\], who used a hill-climbing algorithm based on an explicit preference function.

The logic underlying FUG is relatively simple, but much more expressive logics are now being implemented \[Emele and Zajac, 1990; D6rre and Seiffert, 1991; D/Srre and Eisele, 1991\].

Systemic systems vary substantially in the input language they accept; we will here focus on the NIGEL system \[Mann, 1983\], since it uses the same input language (SPL) as IDAS'S surface realisation system, s Other systemic systems (e.g., \[Patten, 1988\]) tend to use systemic features as their input language (i.e., they don't have an equivalent of NIGEL'S chooser mechanism), which makes comparisons more difficult.

Classification and inheritance are used in this manner by the IDAS natural language generation system \[Reiter et al., 1992\], and their use has allowed IDAS to use a single knowledge representation system for both linguistic and domain knowledge.

DATR \[Evans and Gazdar, 1989\] is a system that declaratively represents morphological rules, using a representation that in some ways is similar to I1.

Referring expressions in IDAS are generated by the algorithm described in \[Reiter and Dale, 1992\].
