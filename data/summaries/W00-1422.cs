Another approach that has been proposed is to fill in the missing information on the basis of word cooccurrence data collected from a large corpus of text (see Nitrogen (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995)).

Most generation systems (such as FUF/SURGE (Elhadad, 1992), Penman (Mann, 1983), RealPro (Lavoie and Rainbow, 1997), TG/2 (Busemann, 1996), and YAG (Channarukul, 1999; McRoy et al., 1999)) alleviate this problem by using defaulting, in which a grammar writer specifies a default for each syntactic constraint.
