novice discourse strategies (Kamm 1995), different repair strategies (Hirschman and Pao 1993), or different degrees of initiative (Potjer et al.1996; Smith and Gordon, this volume).

In some cases, the resulting corpus provides training data for spoken language systems (Hirschman et al.1993), is used as a target for improved systems (Moore, Lemaire, and Rosenblum 1996), or forms a test set for evaluating the performance of an existing natural language system (Whittaker and Stenton 1989; Hirschman et al.1993). Dialogue simulation testbeds evaluate specific models of agent communicative action.

Discourse units range from referring expressions and syntactic constructions (Fox 1987; Kroch and Hindle 1982; Prince 1985), to words or phrases (Heeman and Allen 1994; Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Novick and Sutton 1994), to utterances and relationships among them (Dahlback 1991; Reithinger and Maier 1995; Moser and Moore 1995; Nagata 1992; Rose et al.1995), to multiutterance units identified by a range of criteria such as speaker intention or initiative (Flammia and Zue 1995a; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996; Whittaker and Stenton 1988).

The same method has been applied to empirically testing an algorithm for resolving verb phrase ellipsis (Hardt 1992).

For example, the wizard may follow a proto4 Walker and Moore Empirical Studies in Discourse col that includes particular system limitations or error-handling strategies, to explore potential problems before implementation, e.g. determining how the program's level of interactivity affects the complexity of the instructions it is given (Oviatt and Cohen 1989).

For example, researchers have devised algorithms for generating the surface form of explanations and instructions from underlying intention-based representations by tagging naturally occurring discourses for surface form features, informational relations, and intentional relations (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio 1996; Moser and Moore 1995; Moore and Pollack 1992; Paris and Scott 1994).
C96-1059 J92-4007 P95-1018
A common application is testing coreference resolution algorithms; the tags indicate the preferred interpretation of a potentially ambiguous utterance containing anaphoric noun phrases (Walker 1989; Suri and McCoy 1994; Chinchor and Sundheim 1995).
J94-2006 P89-1031
Another promising area is speech act (dialogue move) tagging, where, for example, researchers have tested whether an automatic tagger trained on the tagged corpus can improve the performance of a speech recognizer with tag-specific language models (Taylor et al.1996), and whether an induced discourse model based on the tagging can predict the next dialogue act in the dialogue, and thus affect how the system translates the next utterance (Reithinger and Maier 1995; Nagata 1992).

They also show that claims about the effect of initiative on dialogue structure in human-human dialogues in other domains (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990) generalize to human-computer dialogues in the circuit repair domain.
P88-1015 P90-1010
To our knowledge, the only publicly available human-computer dialogue corpora is that for the ATIS task (Hirschman 1993), and there are no publicly available corpora of human-human dialogues representing a broad range of spoken-dialogue applications.

She tests the hypothesis that term repetition is a primary feature of textual cohesion (Morris and Hirst 1991) by using it as the basis for two different algorithms for identifying multiparagraph subtopical units.
J91-1002
Future work could test further generalizations; term repetition may also indicate subtopics in other discourse or dialogue environments, and may interact with other features that correlate with topic boundaries, such as pauses, intonation, or cue words (Cahn 1992; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996).
P96-1038
For example, this method has been used to identify features for predicting accent assignment in text-tospeech (Hirschberg 1993), for repairing disfluencies (Nakatani and Hirschberg 1993), cue vs.

In the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) approach, a human wizard simulates the behavior of a program interacting with a human to carry out a particular task in a particular domain (Dahlb~ick and Jonsson 1989; Hirschman et al.1993; Oviatt and Cohen 1989; Whittaker and Stenton 1989).

Recent work includes discussion of appropriate statistical methods and metrics for spoken dialogue systems (Bates and Ayuso 1993; Danieli et al.1992; Hirschman et al.1990; Hirschman and Pao 1993; Simpson and Fraser 1993), information extraction systems (Lewis 1991; Chinchor, Hirschman, and Lewis 1993; Chinchor and Sundheim 1995), and tagging reliability (Carletta 1996).

For example, Lappin and Leass (1994) report an ablation study of an anaphora resolution algorithm, operating on computer manuals, in which various factors that were hypothesized to determine the most likely antecedent were selectively turned off.

Generalizations of this work arise from other research on different speech genres In different environments that also found that coreferential relationships, pausing, and intonation are correlated with discourse structure (Cahn 1992; Fox 1987; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996).
P96-1038
For example, the claim that a model is general can be supported by test corpora representing different genres (Fox 1987; Kroch and Hindle 1982), or different language families (Strube and Hahn 1996; Iida 1997; Di Eugenio 1997; Hoffman 1997).

noncue uses of discourse cue words (Litman 1996; Siegel and McKeown 1994), discourse segment boundaries (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Passonneau and Litman, this volume), intonational phrase boundaries (Wang and Hirschberg 1992), and the Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 most likely antecedents for anaphors (Aone and Bennet 1995; Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994).
P95-1017
Empirical research in testbeds for human-computer dialogue interfaces is very recent (Hirschman et al.1990; Allen et al.1996). This method supports studies of the interaction of various components; for example Danieli and Gerbino (1995) propose an implicit recovery metric for evaluating how the dialogue manager overcomes limitations in the speech recognizer.
