For example, in a part-of-speech tagging task, the initial annotation may assign each token its most likely tag without any regard to context (Brill, 1995).

Learning Transformation Rules for Semantic Role Labeling Ken Williams Christopher Dozier Research & Development Thomson Legal and Regulatory Eagan, MN 55123 USA {ken.williams|chris.dozier|andrew.mcculloh}@thomson.com Andrew McCulloh Abstract This paper presents our work on Semantic Role Labeling using a Transformation-Based ErrorDriven approach in the style of Eric Brill (Brill, 1995).

According to (Brill, 1995), a Transformation-Based Error-Driven learning application is defined by: 1.

to Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning For the 2004 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), our team has applied the methodology popularized by Eric Brill for part-of-speech tagging and linguistic parsing (Brill, 1995; Brill, 1993).

The addition of a look-ahead searcher has been suggested (Brill, 1995), but we have not seen it implemented in a research context, likely due to the fact that a straightforward implementation of the concept would at minimum square the amount of time required for training.
