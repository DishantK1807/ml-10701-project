also (Ciaramita, 2002) on this problem).

Systems for thesaurus extension (Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998), information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999) or named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) each partially address this problem in different ways.

Collins and Singer (1999) for example report that 88% of the named entities occurring in their data set belong to these three categories (Collins and Singer, 1999).

The averaged version of the perceptron (Collins, 2002), like the voted perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999), reduces the effect of over-training.

In named-entity classification a large set of named entities (proper nouns) are classified using a comprehensive set of semantic labels such as “organization”, “person”, “location” or “other” (Collins and Singer, 1999).
W99-0613
Several studies have addressed the problem of expanding one semantic category at a time, such as “vehicle” or “organization”, that are relevant to a particular task (Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999).

We parsed the WordNet definitions and example sentences with the same syntactic parser used for Bllip (Charniak, 2000).
