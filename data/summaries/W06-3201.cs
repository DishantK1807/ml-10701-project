In these methods, phonemes are represented by a distinctive feature vector and a phonetic distance or similarity algorithm is used to align phoneme strings between related words (Connolly 1997; Kessler 1995, 2005; Kondrak 2002; Nerbonne and Heeringa 1997; Somers 1998).

Because features are known to differ in relative importance (Ladefoged 1969), some researchers apply weights or saliencies to the individual features for distance calculation.
C69-5701
Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997), for example, weighted each feature by information gain, or entropy reduction.
