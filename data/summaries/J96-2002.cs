As a number of researchers have shown, the highly defaulty character of lexical phonology and morphophonology makes DATR a very suitable medium of representation (Bleiching 1992, 1994; Cahill 1993b; Gibbon 1990, 1992; Gibbon and Bleiching 1991; Reinhard 1990; Reinhard and Gibbon 1991).

Depending on the nature and purpose of one's lexicon, it would be much more natural to deal with the choice orthographically with a DATR-coded FST of the kind discussed in Section 4.3, above, or morphophonologically using the kind of phonological representation adopted by Reinhard and Gibbon (1991), for example.
E91-1023
At the time of writing, we know of a dozen different implementations of the language, some of which have been used with large DATR lexicons in the context of big NLP systems (e.g., Andry et al.1992; Cahill 1993a, 1994; Cahill and Evans 1990).

Thus, Evans, Gazdar, and Weir (1995) formulate various lexical rules for LTAG (see note 33).

Many of the points made in Nerbonne (1992) are repeated from the more accessible Krieger and Nerbonne (1993) 57 and we have considered them in our discussion of the latter.

Like Daelemans and van der Linden (1992), he makes some pessimistic comments 56 Krieger and Nerbonne are not forced to use distributed disjunction to describe inflectional paradigms.

If there had been no definition for < >, then none of these example paths would have 18 For formal discussion of the semantics of the DATR default mechanism, see Keller (1995).

Finally, Bouma and Nerbonne (1994, 47) comment that "in spite of Kilgarriff's (1993) interesting work on modelling some derivational relations in the pure inheritance machinery of DATR, we know of no work attempting to model potentially recursive derivational relations, and we remain sceptical about relying on inheritance alone for this".

As Keller (1995) points out, the meaning of a node depends on the global context, and a node thus really denotes a function from global contexts to partial functions from paths to values.
P95-1008
We agree that their evaluation is unfair, but ascribe the cause to the ways in which they attempted to apply DATR to their chosen tasks, sl Daelemans and van der Linden (1992) review a number of approaches to lexical knowledge representation, including DATR, with respect to their notational adequacy and expressivity.

Keller (1995) effectively replaces our 1989 presentation of a semantics for DATR and his treatment is general enough to cover descriptor sequences.

31 Much of the computational phonology and morphology of the last decade and a half has depended on FSTs (Kaplan and Kay 1994).

56 At the root of Krieger and Nerbonne's (1993) critique of DATR is a complaint that it fails to provide all the resources of a modern, fully equipped unification grammar formalism (p.

An especially simple approach is possible when the DAGs one is interested in are all built out of a set of paths whose identity is known in advance (Kilbury, Naerger, and Renz 1991).

It is also a task that is likely to figure in the on-line use of the lexicon in a language-processing system, once the relevant lexical entry (i.e., the relevant DATR node) has been determined, to recover information associated with the entry, and it is the task that does the compilation in systems that use a partially or fully compiled-out off-line lexicon (as in Andry et al.1992). The reverse query task again presupposes that we have a description available to us, but instead of starting with a known query, we start instead with a known value love ed, say, and the task is to infer what queries would lead to that value (Love: <mor past participle>, Love: <mor past tense sing one>, etc.).
J92-3001
These techniques can also be readily adapted for use in the semantic domain and used, for example, to implement the distinction between fixed and projective inheritance of lexical semantic information proposed by Pustejovsky (1991, 433-437).

Langer (1994) gives an inference algorithm, based on the familiar chart data structure, for reverse querying DATR lexicons; and Gibbon (1993) describes Â£DQ\[ (Extended DATR Query Language) which permits quantification into components of multisentence DATR queries.

Our first publications on DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b) provided a formal theory of inference (i) and a formal semantics (ii) for DATR and we will not recapitulate that material here.

The automatic induction of (symbolic) lexicons from data is a very new research area in computational linguistics: Kilbury (1993), Kilbury, Naerger, and Renz (1994), Light (1994), and Light, Reinhard, and Boyle-Hinrichs (1993) have proposed a variety of incremental algorithms that take a partial lexical hierarchy and 47 An alternative formulation is to start with a known value and path, and the task is to infer the appropriate nodes.

Daelemans, De Smedt, and Gazdar (1992) provide a rationale for, and an introduction to, this body of research and we will not rehearse the content of that paper here, nor review the work cited there.
