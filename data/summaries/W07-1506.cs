While it is not unusual for a Tiger tree to have multiple dis1This approach was inspired by Joakim Nivre’s paper Pseudo-Projective Dependency Parsing (Nivre, 2005), in which non-projectivedependencystructuresareconvertedtoeasier-toparse projective dependency structures in a way that limits the number of new labels introduced, but is mostly reconstructible.

Previous work on PCFG parsing using Negra or Tiger has either used the provided Penn Treebankstyle versions of the corpora included with Negra and Tiger Version 1 (Dubey and Keller, 2003; Dubey, 2004) or used a program provided with the Negra/Tiger Annotate software (Plaehn and Brants, 2000)whichperformstheraisingalgorithm(K¨ubler, 2005; K¨ubler et al., 2006).
