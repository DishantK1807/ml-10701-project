assessing whether a document has been correctly judged to be relevant or not, on the basis of its summary alone) (Mani et al., 1999).

(Mitra et al., 1997)--the same problems of coherence degradation and topical underrepresentation, remain).

In particulab while remaining sensitive to tile distribution of "terms" across tile docunlent, and calculating similarity between adjacent text blocks by a cosine measure, our procedure differs from that in (Hearst, 1994) in several ways.

segmentation and summarization Unlike Barzilay and Elhadad, we start with a sentencebased summarizeb and are specifically seeking to improve upon what is already (by some measure; see Section 4.1 below) a good performance, judged in a discipline-wide evaluation initiative (Mani et al., 1999).

Likewise, segmentation results are naturally incorporated in an annotation superstructure which records the various levels of document analysis: discourse segments are just another type of a 'span' (annotation) over: a number of sentences, logically akin to a paragraph (Bird and Liberman, 1999).

It presupposes finegrained methods for the identification of cohesive ties 76 between (sentence) units in a text; describing the computational basis for developing such methods is outside of the scope of this paper (howeveb see (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996), (Fellbaum, 1999), (Kelleb 1994)), as is the complete framework for lexical cohesion analysis we have developed.

2.2 Salience-driven summarization With its set of linguistic filters, our frequency-based summarizer can exploit linguistic dimensions beyond single word analysis; this is not unlike the approach of (Aone et al., 1997).

1 tmvever, unlike (Kan et al., 11998) (whose work also seeks to leverage linear segmentation for the explicit purposes of document summarization), we further take tile view that with an appropriate interface metaphor where the user has an overview of the relationships between a sunnnary sentence, the key salient phrases within it, and its enclosing discourse segment--a sequence of visually demarkated segments can impart a lot of information directly leading to in-depth perception of the summary, as it relates to the full docun~ent (Boguraev and Neff, 2000).

Such discontinuities are indicative of topic shifts, t%llowing the original idea of lexical chains (Morris and l lirst, 1991), subsequently developed specifically for the purposes of segmentation of expository text (Hearst, 1994), we have adapted an algorithm for discourse segmentation to our document processing environment.
