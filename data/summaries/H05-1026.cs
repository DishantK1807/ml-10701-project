decades like n-gram back-off word models (Katz, 1987), class models (Brown et al., 1992), structured language models (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000) or maximum entropy language models (Rosenfeld, 1996).

The field of natural language processing has recently seen some changes by the introduction of new statistical techniques that are motivated by successful approaches from the machine learning community, in particular continuous space LMs using neural networks (Bengio and Ducharme, 2001; Bengio et al., 2003; Schwenk and Gauvain, 2002; Schwenk and Gauvain, 2004; Emami and Jelinek, 2004), Random Forest LMs (Xu and Jelinek, 2004) and Random cluster LMs (Emami and Jelinek, 2005).
