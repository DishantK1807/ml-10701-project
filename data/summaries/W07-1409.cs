There is no direct connection between these different verbs in the ERG lexicon, even though they are intuitively related and are listed as belonging to the same or related word classes in semantic lexicons/ontologies such as VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

Our syntax relies on a frame-based design in the LF ontology, a common representation in semantic lexicons (Baker et al., 1998, Kipper et al., 2000).

Our generic senses have been inspired by FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources ??FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) ??that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.

FrameNet (Baker et al, 1998) attempts to encode this knowledge.

The SALSA RTE system is based on three main components: (i) a linguistic analysis of text and hypothesis based primarily on LFG and Frame Semantics (Baker et al., 1998), (ii) the computation of a match graph that encodes the semantic overlap between text and hypothesis, and (iii) a statistical entailment decision.

Setup Experiments aimed at extracting protein-protein interactions for Bakers yeast (Sacharomyces Cerevesiae) to assess BioNoculars (Cherry et al., 1998).
