Specifically, the model employs a bracketing transduction grammar or BTG (Wu, 1995a), which is a special case of inversion transduction grammars or ITGs (Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995b; Wu, 1995d).

Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere (Brown et al., 1993).

In this case, Equation (2) is kept as the objective function and the translation channel can be parameterized similarly to Dagan et al.(Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).

The corpus was sentence-aligned statistically (Wu, 1994); Chinese words and collocations were extracted (Fung and Wu, 1994; Wu and Fung, 1994); then translation pairs were learned via an EM procedure (Wu and Xia, 1995).

For the remainder of the paper, we take advantage of a convenient normal-form theorem (Wu, 1995a) that allows us to assume without loss of generality that the BTG only contains the binary-branching form for the non-lexicM productions.

Moreover, extremely distorted alignments can be handled by BTGs (Wu, 1995c), without resorting to the unrestricted-alignment model.

The only prohibited arrangements are "inside-out" transformations (Wu, 1995b), which we have been unable to find any examples of in our corpus.

The statistical translation model introduced by IBM (Brown et al., 1990) views translation as a noisy channel process.

We summarize here; details are given elsewhere (Wu, 1995b).

A slightly different model is employed for a word alignment application by Dagan et al.(Dagan, Church, and Gale, 1993).

For instance, we previously reported a method for improving search times in channel translation models that exploits bracketing information (Wu and Ng, 1995).
