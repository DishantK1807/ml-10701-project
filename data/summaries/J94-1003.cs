Multidimensional phonological structures were taken to be descriptions of classes of phonetic objects, following Wheeler (1981), Bird and Klein (1990), Pierrehumbert (1990), Bird (1990), and Coleman (1992).

Such a move gives rise to a novel view of the relationship between phonology and the other modules of grammar, as some initial investigation has already demonstrated (Bird 1992; Bird and Klein in press).

Finally, Section 5 compares our proposals with those of Kay (1987), Kornai (1991), and Wiebe (1992).

The model is then compared with the transducer models for autosegmental phonology of Kay (1987), Kornai (1991), and Wiebe (1992).

In order for any computational 22 Wiebe borrows the terms SFA and SFT from an earlier version of this paper (Bird and Ellison 1992).

5. Other Finite-State Approaches to Nonlinear Phonology 5.1 Kay (1987) The earliest treatment of autosegmental phonology in a finite-state setting is attributable to Kay (1987).

SPE rules must be restricted so as not to apply to their own output (Johnson 1972) and there is no guarantee that the transducer encoding an SPE rule can be expressed using the two-level rule notation (Ritchie 1992).
