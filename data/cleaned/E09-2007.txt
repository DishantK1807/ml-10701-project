Abstract 
We compare the phenomena of clausal cor-
dinate elipsis in Estonian, a Fino-Ugric lan-
guage, and German, an Indo-European lan-
guage. The rules underlying these phenomena 
apear to be remarkably similar. Thus, the 
software module ELEIPO, which was origi-
naly developed to generate clausal cordi-
nate elipsis in German and Dutch, works for 
Estonian as wel. In order to extend 
ELEIPO’s coverage to Estonian, we only had 
to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules 
unrelated to cordination. We describe the 
language-independent rules for cordinate el-
lipsis that ELEIPO aplies to non-eliptical 
syntactic structures in both target languages. 
1 Introduction

In writen German newspaper text, clausal coor-
dination occurs in about 14% of the sentences, 
and coordinate ellipsis (e.g. (1) in about 7% (see 
a corpus study by Harbusch and Kempen, 207). 
Studies of ellipsis in Estonian are hardly avail-
able (cf. Erelt, 203). 
(1) Monopole  solen geknackt werden und 
    onopolies should shatered   be   and 
    Märkte  solen  getrent werden 
    markets should   split    be 
   'Monopolies should be shatered and markets split’ 
In order to deal with these relatively frequent 
phenomena, we develop an Estonian coordinate-
ellipsis generator based on ELEIPO, the software 
module writen in JAVA that generates clausal 
coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch (Har-
busch and Kempen, 206; 209). Given the fact 
that the two target languages belong to two rather 
different language families (German is an Indo-
European, Estonian a Fino-Ugric language) we 
expected the two target languages to differ con-
siderably with respect to the rules for generating 
coordinate elisions; however, this expectation 
was falsified. As we wil detail below, a pairwise 
comparison of a heterogeneous set of elliptical 
constructions in the target languages reveals that 
the German rules we had implemented in 
ELEIPO also generate the Estonian structures. 
We only needed to adapt the lexicon and some 
syntax rules unrelated to coordination. The core 
algorithm worked language-independently for 
both languages. 
The paper is organized as folows. In section 
2, we first define the four main groups of clausal 
coordinate ellipsis phenomena, and show that the 
elisions in the two target languages obey basi-
cally the same rules. This implies that the Esto-
nian version of the software system ELEIPO can 
use the same core algorithm as the German and 
Dutch version. In section 3, we discus other lin-
guistic theories for clausal coordinate ellipsis, 
especially focusing on implementations for gen-
eration. In final section 4, we draw some conclu-
sions and address options for future work. 
2 Clause-level coordinate elipsis in Es-
tonian and German 
In the literature, one often distinguishes four ma-
jor types of clause-level coordinate ellipsis 
(which can become combined; cf. example (1)).
1
 
• GAPING, with three special variants called 
LONG DISTANCE GAPING (LDG), SUB-
GAPING, and STRIPING, 
• FORWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (FCR), 
• BACKWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (BCR; 
                                                
1
 We wil not deal with the eliptical constructions known as 
VP Elipsis, VP Anaphora and Pseudogaping because they 
involve the generation of pro-forms instead of, or in adi-
tion to, the elipsis proper. For example, John laughed, and 
Mary did, to—a case of VP Elipsis—includes the pro-
form did. Nor do we deal with recasts of clausal cordina-
tions as cordinate NPs (e.g., John likes skating and Peter 
likes sking becoming John and Peter like skating and ski-
ing, respectively). Presumably, such conversions involve a 
logical rather than syntactic mechanism. 
25
also called Right Node Raising), and 
• SUBJECT GAP IN CLAUSES WITH FINITE/ 
FRONTED VERBS (SGF). 
They are ilustrated in the English sentences (2) 
through (8). The subscripts denote the elliptical 
mechanism at work: g stands for Gapping, Sub-
gapping, and Striping, respectively; g(g)
+
is re-
cursively added for LDG; f = FCR; s = SGF; b = 
BCR. 
(2) GAPING: Jüri lives in Talin and his children 
live
g
 in Tartu 
(3) LDG: My wife wants to buy a car and my son 
wants
g 
[to buy]
g
 a motorcycle 
(4) SUBGAPING: The driver was kiled and the pas-
sengers were
g
 severely wounded 
(5) STRIPPING: My sister lives in Narva and my 
brother [lives in Narva]
g
 to 
(6) FCR: Pärnu is the city [S where Ainar lives and 
where
f
 Peter works] 
(7) BCR: Rina arived before thre [o’clock]
b
 and 
Terje left after six o’clock 
(8) SGF: Into the wod went the hunter and [the 
hunter]
s
 hot a hare 
In the theoretical framework by Kempen 
(209) and its implementation for German and 
Dutch in ELEIPO, the elision process is guided 
by constraints on lemaand wordform-identity 
constraints and, to some extent, linear order.
2
 
ELEIPO’s functioning is based on the as-
sumption that coordinate ellipsis does not result 
from the application of declarative grammar 
rules for clause formation but from a procedural 
component that interacts with the sentence gen-
erator and may block the overt expression of cer-
tain constituents. Thus, the rules apply to assem-
bled non-elliptical (unreduced) tree structures in 
the final stage of generation. Due to this feature, 
ELEIPO can be combined, at least in principle, 
with various lexicalized-grammar formalisms. 
However, this advantage does not come entirely 
for free: The module needs a formalism-
dependent interface that converts generator out-
put to a canonical form consisting of “flat” syn-
tactic trees where all major clause constituents 
                                                
2
 Cordinate structures consist of two or more conjuncts 
conected by a cordinating conjunction (in our exam-
ples: and). Rules of cordinate elipsis license elision of 
some consituent in one conjunct under “identity” with a 
constituent in another conjunct. We distinguish betwen 
lema identity, where only the word-stems of the constitu-
ents have to be identical, and wordform identity, which re-
quires not only identity of the stems but also of their mor-
phological features.
 
Gaping only requires lema identity 
(cf. examples (2) and (4). In FCR, word-form identity is 
checked, i.e. the identical word string refering to the same 
referent (cf. *The boy loves dogs and [the boys]
f
 hate cats). 
are represented at the same hierarchical level 
(see Harbusch and Kempen 206; 207). 
In the folowing, we introduce ELEIPO’s eli-
sion rules only in an informal manner (for the 
pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and 
Kempen, 206; 209). The rules described in the 
folowing can be applied in any order to unre-
duced syntactic structures in canonical form. In 
case of a successful rule application, the elidable 
constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the 
other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indi-
cating the ellipsis type (as ilustrated in (2) 
through (8)). ELEIPO’s final step executes all 
posible elliptical combinations (e.g., for exam-
ple (1), it also realizes a version with Subgapping 
and LDG, respectively, i.e.: Monopole solen 
geknackt werden und Märkte solen
g
 getrennt 
werden
g
). 
In Gapping (see examples (9) and (10), 
lemma-identical verbs can be elided from the 
second conjunct, if and only if a contrast is ex-
pressed, i.e. each remaining constituent in this 
conjunct has a counterpart with the same gram-
matical function in the first conjunct (cf. (11)).

In Long-Distance Gaping (LDG), the rem-
nants, i.e. the non-elided constituents in the pos-
terior conjunct, include constituents whose ante-
rior counterparts belong to different clauses. My 
wife in (12) (translation of (3) belongs to the 
main clause whereas a car is part of  the infini-
tival complement clause. Notice that LDG does 
not require adjacency of the elided verbs (cf. the 
German example in (12).

In Subgaping, the posterior conjunct includes 
a remnant in the form of a non-finite complement

 For lack of space, here we canot go into aspects of word-
order variation (both Estonian and German are languages 
with relatively fre word order). For the same reason, we 
only discus examples with two conjuncts (although, 
ELEIPO analyses n-ary cordinations as wel), and canot 
pay atention to cordinate structures that include negation.

Striping is Gapping with the posterior con-
junct consisting of one constituent only. This 
remnant is not a verb, and it is often suple-
mented by a modifier (such to in (14), the trans-
lation of (5).

In Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR), a 
left-peripheral string of major constituents in the 
right conjunct is elided under wordform-identity 
with its counterpart in the right conjunct. In FCR 
example (15), the left-peripheral string compris-
ing complementizer, subject and direct object are 
elided from the right-hand conjunct. If modifiers 
that are neither lemmanor wordform-identical, 
are placed in between subject and object—as in 
(16)—, then elision of the object is blocked. (Ac-
tually, example (16) is not il-formed but its 
right-hand conjunct cannot be interpreted as 
cleaning the bike.) In main-clause variant (17), 
elision of the direct object is blocked for similar 
reasons. 
(15)  .. et Jan oma jalgrata asjatundlikult parandas

Backward-Conjunction Reduction (BCR) li-
censes elision of a right-peripheral string in the 
left-hand conjunct under lemma-identity
4
 with its 
counterpart in the right conjunct. However, un-
like FCR’s mirror image, BCR may cut into ma-
jor constituents of the clause. In BCR example 
(18), the direct object can be elided in the first 
conjunct whereas in word-order variant (19), the 
verb blocks this elision. Example (20) ilustrates 
that BCR, unlike the three other ellipsis types, 
may cut into major clausal constituents and only

 ELEIPO also checks case-identity to rule out ?Hilf _

AC 
‘Help and reanimate the man’ 
checks lemma-identity. Varying the objects to 
‘new bike’/‘old bikes’, and the second subject 
‘Peter’ to ‘his brothers’ does not rule out ellipsis 
as long as peripheral access is guaranteed.

Examples (21)-(23) embody word-order vari-
ants within two simple coordinated clauses. The 
(il)licit elision patterns verify that in BCR the 
ellipsis should be right-peripheral in the left-hand 
conjunct, whereas in FCR the ellipsis is located 
left-peripherally in the right-hand conjunct.

SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Fi-
nite/Fronted verb) licenses elision of the subject 
of the right conjunct if in the left conjunct the 
subject folows the verb; however, the first con-
stituent of the unreduced right-hand clausal con-
junct must meet certain special requirements. In 
particular, it should be the subject of this clause 
(as in (24), translation of  (8) or a modifier (25), 
but not an argument other than the subject, e.g. 
neither complement nor (in)direct object (26). 
Aditionally, if FCR is also posible, it should 
actually be realized in order to license SGF (for 
additional discusion of these restrictions, see 
Harbusch and Kempen, 209).

Given the similarities between the rules that 
appear to control clausal coordinate ellipsis in 
German and Estonian, it is not surprising that 
the German/Dutch version of ELEIPO could be 
tailored to Estonian easily. ELEIPO’s language-
independent core algorithm generates Estonian 
ellipsis as well, as shown by the demonstrator. 
For the sake of completeness, we should add 
here that we have not been able to find types of 
clausal coordinate ellipsis in Estonian that go 
beyond the above four types; hence, as far as we 
can tell, Estonian does not require additional 
rules over and above those we needed for Ger-
man and Dutch. 
3 State
of the art in elipsis generation 
Al major grammar formalisms provide rules for 
clausal coordinate ellipsis—rules that tend to be 
intertwined with rules for nonelliptical coordina-
tion (e.g. Sarkar and Joshi (196) for Tree Ad-
joining Grammar; Steedman (200) for Combi-
natory Categorial Grammar; Frank (202) for 
Functional Grammar; Crysman (203) and Bea-
vers and Sag (204) for HPSG; and te Velde 
(206) for the Minimalist Program). This also 
applies to many NLG systems (cf. Reiter and 
Dale, 200). Generators that do include an 
autonomous component for coordinate ellipsis— 
that is, a component that takes unreduced coordi-
nations expressed in the system’s grammar for-
malism as input and return elliptical versions as 
output (Shaw, 198; Dalianis, 199; Hielkema, 
205)—use incomplete rule sets, thus risking 
overor undergeneration, and incorrect or un-
natural output. 
4 Conclusion

Finally, we do not expect that the four types of 
clausal coordinate ellipsis presented here are 
“universal” in the sense that all natural languages 
exhibit all four of them and no language has ad-
ditional types (see Harbusch and Kempen 209 
for some discusion based on language-
typological work by Haspelmath, 207). How-
ever, the experience described in this paper 
makes us confident that the ”modular” approach 
taken in the ELEIPO project wil prove efficient 
when it comes to writing coordinate ellipsis rules 
for other languages—especially for languages 
belonging other language families.
