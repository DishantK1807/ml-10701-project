Phrase pairs are extracted by following the method described in (Och and Ney, 2004) where all contiguous phrase pairs having consistent alignments are extraction candidates.

The introduction of automated evaluation procedures, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) for machine translation (MT) and ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) for summarization, have prompted much progress and development in both of these areas of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

We ran the alignment algorithm from (Och and Ney, 2003) on a Chinese-English parallel corpus of 218 million English words, available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

In (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), a language model is used to make sure that the paraphrases extracted are direct substitutes, from the same syntactic categories, etc.

Callison-Burch et al.(2006) point out three prominent factors: • ``Synonyms and paraphrases are only handled if they are in the set of multiple reference translations [available].

Our method (Anonymous, 2006), also illustrated in (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), to automatically construct a large domainindependent paraphrase collection is based on the assumption that two different phrases of the same meaning may have the same translation in a Figure 2.

Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (Och and Ney, 2004).

This substitution technique has shown some improvement in translation quality (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).

Although our paraphrase extraction method is similar to that of (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), the paraphrases we extracted are for completely different applications, and have a broader definition for what constitutes a paraphrase.

In addition to distinguishing the quality of MT systems, a reliable evaluation procedure must be able to distinguish system translations from humans’ (Lin and Och, 2004).
J04-4002 P04-1077
Although both methods have gained mainstream acceptance and have shown good correlations with human judgments, their deficiencies have become more evident and serious as research in MT and summarization progresses (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).
