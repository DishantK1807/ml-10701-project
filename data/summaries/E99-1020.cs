The set of items in a parsing system PAIg corresponding to the parsing schema Alg describing a given parsing algorithm Alg is denoted 2:Alg, the set of hypotheses 7/Alg, the set of final items ~'Alg and the set of deduction steps is denoted ~)Alg" 2 A CYK-like Algorithm We have chosen the CYK-like algorithm for TAG described in (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) as our starting point.

The introduction of the element adj taking its value from the set {true, false} corrects the items previously proposed for this kind of algorithms in (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) in order to avoid several adjunctions on a node.
P85-1011
As an additional advantage, the algorithm does not need to require the restriction that every auxiliary tree must have at least one terminal symbol in its frontier (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985).

As a consequence, only one adjunction can take place on an elementary node, as is prescribed by the tree adjoining grammar formalism (Schabes and Shieber, 1994).
J94-1004
Several parsing algorithms have been proposed for this formalism, most of them based on tabular techniques, ranging from simple bottom-up algorithms (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) to sophisticated extensions of the Earley's algorithm (Schabes and Joshi, 1988; Schabes, 1994; Nederhof, 1997).
