Very briefly, we see discourse marker choice as one aspect of the sentence planning task (e.g., \[Wanner, novy 1996\]).

Obviously, marker selection also includes the decision whether to use any marker at all or leave the relation implicit (e.g., \[Di Eugenio et al.1997\]). When these decisions can be systematically controlled, the text can be tailored much better to the specific goals of the generation process.

For example, within the VERBMOBIL project, Stede and Schmitz \[1997\] have analysed the various pragmatic functions that German discourse particles fulfill in dialogue; many of these particles are discourse markers, and DiMLex can provide valuable information for their disambiguation, which in turn facilitates the recognition of underlying speech acts.

This generation approach is described in more detail in a separate paper \[Grote, Stede 1998\].
W98-1414
There are several detailed studies of individual groups of markers, such as \[Vander Linden, Martin 1995\] for PURPOSE markers.

In the approach proposed by Marcu \[1997\], for example, the presence of discourse markers is used to hypothesize individual textual units and relations holding between them.
