In order to speed up the learning process, we use a four-stage learning architecture: Stage 1: To save time, we use a pruning stage (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out the constituents that are clearly not semantic arguments to the predicate.

In this paper, we decompose the Moschitti (2004)â€™s predicate-argument feature (PAF) kernel into a Path kernel and a Constituent Structure ker1http://www.cs.unt.edu/âˆ¼rada/senseval/senseval3/ 73 nel, and then compose them into a hybrid convolution tree kernel.

The data consist of sections of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993), with information on predicate-argument structures extracted from the PropBank corpus (Palmer et al., 2005).

Many researchers (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005a) use feature-based methods Figure 1: Semantic role labeling in a phrase structure syntactic tree representation for argument identification and classification in building SRL systems and participating in evaluations, such as Senseval-3 1, CoNLL-2004 and 2005 shared tasks: SRL (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), where a flat feature vector is usually used to represent a predicate-argument structure.

In addition, Moschitti (2004)â€™s Tree Kernel Tool is used to compute the tree kernel function.

In the context of convolution kernels, more and more kernels for restricted syntaxes or specific domains, such as string kernel for text categorization (Lodhi et al., 2002), tree kernel for syntactic parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2001), kernel for relation extraction (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) are proposed and explored in NLP domain.

They used a linear interpolation method and extract features from a parse tree to identify and classify the constituents in the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) with syntactic parsing results.

Most of the following works focused on feature engineering (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Jiang et al., 2005) and machine learning models (Nielsen and Pradhan, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2005a).

Convolution Tree Kernels for SRL In this section, we introduce the previous kernel method for SRL in Subsection 4.1, discuss our method in Subsection 4.2 and compare our method with previous work in Subsection 4.3. 4.1 Convolution Tree Kernels for SRL Moschitti (2004) proposed to apply convolution tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001) to SRL.

The same as Moschitti (2004), we also set the Âµ = 0.4 in the computation of convolution tree kernels.

In addition Moschitti (2004) only study the task of argument classification while in our experiment, we report the experimental results on both identification and classification.

Stage 4: A rule-based post-processing stage (Liu et al., 2005) is used to handle some unmatched arguments with constituents, such as AM-MOD, AM-NEG.

Their features are usually extended from Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)â€™s work, which uses flat information derived from a parse tree.
