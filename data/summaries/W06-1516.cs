(Carroll and Oepen, 2005); and on experimenting with different semantic construction strategies (Gardent and Parmentier, 2005).

This module assumes a TAG of the type described in (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003; Gardent, 2006) 5ThecorrespondingsystemiscalledSemConst(cf section 6).

Both of these algorithms integrate a number of optimisations such as delayed adjunction and polarity filtering (Kow, 2005; Gardent and Kow, 2005).
W05-1605
XMG was used to develop a core grammar for French (FRAG) which was evaluated to have 75% coverage4 on the Test Suite for Natural Language Processing (TSNLP, (Lehmann et al., 1996)).
C96-2120
This second measure is based on optimisation known as polarity filtering (Gardent and Kow, 2005).
W05-1605
As detailed in(GardentandParmentier, 2005), suchgrammars support two strategies for semantic construction.

This toolbox combines existing software and aims at facilitating grammar development, More precisely, this toolbox includes1: • XMG: a grammar compiler which supports the generation of a TAG from a factorised TAG (Crabb´e and Duchier, 2004), • LLP2 and DyALog: two chart parsers, one with a friendly user interface (Lopez, 2000) and the other optimised for efficient parsing (Villemonte de la Clergerie, 2005)2 • GenI: a chart generator which has been tested on a middle size grammar for French (Gardent and Kow, 2005) 1All these tools are freely available, more information and links at http://trac.loria.fr/˜semtag.
