NY 11794 All~tract: RECONSIDER is an interactive diagnostic prompting program which uses simple information retrieval techniques to prompt a physician regarding possible diagnoses, given a list of positive patient findings.
Its knowledge base consists of "strucLured text" definitions of 3262 diseases and a synonym dictionary Patient findings, and their synonyms, are matched against inverted files of terms from the disease descriptions, the number and selectivity of the patient findings matching terms in a given disease description determine that disease's "score", and the matched diseases are sorted on this score to form a preliminary differential diagnosis.
Defimtions of diseases can be referenced for viewing by name, or by their position in a differential While its first formal evaluation is not yet complete, the performance of RECONSIDER continues to exceed the expectations of user and designer alike.
1. \]ioU~tl~ ~ B~cl~ro~d A review of the various means by which medical knowledge is represented in symbolic form \[6,7\] led us to formulate the \[o\[Iowing speetrun~: Human.
Machine Processible Processible Spectrum of Medical Knowledge Representation Schemes The two endpoints of the spectrum represent the limiting cases wherein knowtedge is difficult, or impossible, to process algorithmically, but transparent to medical personnel, e.g. free text; or easily processibte algorithmicatty, and dil~cuit to process by humans untrained in applied mathematics or computer science.
e.g. a matrix of Bayesian probabilities, or a semantic network.
Those attending this conference will be familiar with work at both ends of the spectrum, if not in medicine, then in other knowledge domains.
Most will concede that the greatest "successes" in the field of expert systems has been achieved by those working at or near the right-hand end of the spectrum; and that progress has been most difficult to achieve at the Left-hand end of the spectrum.
We concluded that.
for the short run at least, those successes at the right-hand end would prove to be self-limiting knowledge that was not readily accessible to and modifiable by the medical community at large could not remain in the mainstream of medical practice.
Similarly, we saw no immediate prospects for a breakthrough in the algorithmic understanding of free text.
though ~npressecL with accomplishments in the area of natural language access to databases \[9, I0\].
The dilemma these observations implied led us to formulate the following question: Co~r~ knowledge ubo=t diseases 6e 1"e:presen.f.ed in.

Conceding the important role of zvo~-ds (rather than text) as conveyers of meaning in medicine, we focused on a hierarchica/ nominal-attribute model, wherein nominals (electrons, cells, lungs, eta) were "defined" in terms of attributes (spin, neoplastic, congested, etc.).
Obviously, nominals could be attributes of other higher level nominals, and attributes could be nominals at a lower level.
The principle result of this model was the observation that some words had meaning only at certain levels electrons could not be congested or neoplastic, nor could Lungs or cells have spin.
While the idea of "levels of description" is not new, such levels were observed to be both well separated and powerful determiners of context in medicineJ In turn.

surprisingly, well determined meanings for words, diminishing the need for syntax to clarify or disambiguate meanin 8.
Our search for an body of knowledge on which to explore certain hypotheses regarding such a nominal-attribute model in medicine led us to regard a familiar but little used resource ill medicine in a new light.
A corpus of computer readable disease deflmtions was seen to be a crude instantiation of the model.
In this corpus each disease was given a name (a nominal).
and defined by its (usually clinical) attributes the original motivation for the corpus being the standardization of disease nomenclalure.
The attributes were written in a talegraphic, but otherwise easily readable style, and organized, for each disease, in a relatively stable format a form we have chosen to call st~ct~d ttzt.
Superficially. the corpus had but one level of description, attributes of diseases.
But each disease definition was divided, explicitly, into "contexts" (etiology.
symptoms ..... lab.
x-ray. ...).
and each disease was place in one (or.
at most two) "body systems" (whole body.
skin ..... urogenital ....
). These contexts and systems were obviously strong, if imprecise, determiners of context.
Early experiments \[3.4\] with this corpus.
the computer readable version of Cto-rtn2 Msd/c,., I, tfo,',nu.~n ~ T~n~o~ (C~IT), 4¢h Edition \[II\].
explored the selective and associative power of the words it employed, and confirmed our hypothesis that word use in it was both relatively consistent and systematic.
We soon realized that the sharpest test of the ability of words to convey meaning in this context was to evaluate the corpus as a knowledge base for a "diagnoses program" which would accept a description of the patient in the form of a list of words, such as 'pain.
fever, jaundice ....
'. The specific diagnostic problem we addressed was that of formulating a "differential diagnosis ''z \[12.
15\]. which included, as alluded to by Scadding \[21, 5\].
diseases that a physician might not othaT~ise think of.
but. perhaps, should think of.
Important to our attempt to formulate a diagnostic prompting program was not only that the knowledge base should be readily comprehensible, but, if the disease "prompts" were to be credible, the "reasoning" by which diseases were retrieved and ranked had to be equally accessible a consultative criterion noted by Shortlfffe and co-workers \[P~.
23\]. In addition, the availability of a knowledge base contmning in excess of 3000 disease descriptions has allowed us to study phenomena that would be hard to reproduce in the context of most "expert systems".

None of the patient findings are particularly specific, but RECONSIDER places the correct diagnosis in Oth place, and determines that most of the diseases near the top of the differential are "whole body" diseases, a group containing most toxicity diseases.
If this differential were selected from among a few hundred diseases, or even from a knowledge base of toxicity diseases, the result would he more open to a variety of less favorable interpretations.
Put differently, when one is retrieving from such a large knowledile base.
one is more tolerant about the appearance of "false positives" (diseases that shouldn't be there) in the interests of minimizing the number of "false negatives" (diseases that should be there, but are not).
Finally. RECONSIDER provides a test bed for the evaluation of some hypotheses regarding the kind of problems encountered representing and utilizing knowledge about the 'natural', as opposed to 'artificial'.
world. Briefly.
RECONSIDER benefits from the high degree of structure observable in diagnostic medicine, in spite of our ignorance in many areas, and the otherwise generally unappreciated stability and specificity of medical language regarding this structure.
2. Zxtmtetattons?
Non-medical audiences should be reminded of differing expectations regarding such meaning representation experiments.
As computer scientists, two of us (MST & DDS) "knew" that meaning could not be represented satisfactorily by words alone: words were ambiguous, in general.
and, besides, syntax was a partner with semantics, and to separate the two was to grossly distort the meaning of either.
4 We
regarded early efforts as potentially interesting from the point of view of statistical linquistics how did words and contexts associate?
However. the medically trained member of the initial team (MSB) predicted the successful performance of RECONSIDER once he saw the results of some early word-counting experiments.
Later. SN, an internist with a background in mathematics, anticipated the performance limiting aspect of RECONSIDER without ever using the program!
(He predicted that inadequacies in the knowledge base would be more important than any shortcomings in the algorithms by which descriptions of patients were "matched" w~th the descriptions of the diseases).

An Example of 'Structured Text' CMIT was designed first for human users, as a reference of standard disease names (in book form it is about the size of the World Almanac), and second for computer applications.
(The RECONSIDER-formatted CKIT definition of .tet/~yl 0~co/wL, to~c~t~J appears in the appendix of this paper).
The "structure" imposed on CMIT definitions is Largely external to the language of those definitions.
First. the entire text of C~T iS organized in the aforementioned noTm~t~-c~tr~b~e form.
the disease names being the nominals and the descriptions consisting of the attributes of the disease, s Second.

within each :DaFt, the descending hierarchy of se~.ences, ct~zuaes, and phrases (all inferrable from punctuation) are used relatively consistently to denote appropriate "chunks" of meaning.
Thus, in this instance, structured tezt is tightly edited prose written in nominal-attribute form, employing external markers, and relatively consistent punctuation, style, and vocabuLary.
Put differently.
CMIT can be "structurally" parsed without the need to /ztfer any of the semantics from the text.
(Again. a portion of this "parse" is what produces the "display" of the deflnLtaon of methyl -lcotwl, toz~c-iZy shown in the appendix).

The Current I~CONSIDKR Implementation 4-.
L The Inverted File Using abstract syntax to represent the structure in the text.
C?41T was scanned and "parsed ''~ to produce a sequence of ts~w.~, each with the following attributes: ordinal position of teem in phrase ordinal position of phrase in clause ordinal position of clause in sentence ordinal position of sentence in part name of part disease body system(s) of disease Thus.
a dictionary (containing in excess of 20.000 such terms) was formed and CM.IT "inverted", so that each dictionary entry was folLowed by pointers to every occurrence of that entry in CMIT.
Included with every pointer were the seven attributes associated with each occurrence of that term.
There are 333.211 terra occurrences in CMIT.
for an average of about 102 terms per disease, or 79 unique terms per disease, the difference being terms that are used more than once in a given deflnitior~ In principle, this "dictionary" could be used to reconstruct CMIT, as it r~preswrtts, in aZter,tat~ve for.7.at, e=actty tlw saw~ ~nformat~rn!
This Large inverted file allows et~cient searching for terms in the text.
The searches can be (I) constrained to a context (diseases of the skin).
(2) constrained to textual proximity (adjacency.
or membership within a clause), or (3) constrained to a definition part (symptoms only).
4.2~ Synonym Dictionary A 15.388 term "synonym" dictionary a.
includes words not in CMIT which are synonyms of words used in the CMIT definitions and words already in CMIT that are synonyms of each other (e.g.
prur~tu,s and itcA g) These are partitioned a_mongst 4.165 "synonym classes" (the two or more words within each class are synonyms of each other).
Search options allow searches with or without equiv~dencmg the synonyms, and with or without invoking hierarchical synonyms.
The term "synonym" is used generously, as the dictionary is actually functioning as a kind of semantic net connecting words with strong conceptual Links.
It should also be noted that RECONSIDER does not employ "stemming".
All variants of a term (and some phrases, e.g. abdominal penn ).
including. in some cases, mis-speLlings, appear wittun a single • 'synonym class".
Though we have not proven this, it is our opinion that this synonym dictionary is what converts an interesting tool for research into medical term-use, into something vOnce age.u~ this par~e L~ .nOt identifylr~ "pa."~ of speech" Ln L~e conventional serme.

4.3. Searches Searches for a set of terms can require a match on every term.
or a match on one or more of the terms in the set.
In the latter case.
matches are scored in a manner reminiscent of techniques used for literature and infm-mation retrieve/ by Salton.
~parck-Jones and others.
and in particular Doszkocs \[8\].
The scoring a/gorithm is illustrated in the next section.
4. 4.
The User-Interface RECONSIDER is an interactive user interface running on top of the inverted file and the search algorithms.
It accepts terms, search modifiers, and requests for one of the two matching algorithms, formulates the appropriate query, searches the inverted files, computes the score of the diseases retrieved (if requested), constructs a body-system histogram (if requested), ranks the diseases if appropriate, and displays any disease definitions selected for viewing or browsing by the user.
5. Performance S.L & Compartsen with two lY~ncet/e Expert When applied Lo the published cases diagnosed by INTERNIST and PIP \[R0.17,16\], RECONSIDER produced the correct diagnosis (or diagnoses) at.
or near, the top of the disease List produced by enterin~ the positive findings given Lo these programs \[5\].
(Again. CADUCEUS considers 300 diseases from internal medicine, and PIP considers 20 diseases featuring edema).
While these cases were often complex, a large amount of clinical information was available for each patient.
5.2. Diagnostic Pr~nptin~: An Example We believe that RECONSIDER performs better, and much more usefully, at an earlier point in the diagnostic process, at a time prior to any extensive patient work-up, when the physician's "cognitive span" is widest \[2\].
For example, a patient presents with findings as noted at the beginning of the appendix.
RECONSIDER begins by prompting for terms.
The prefix ~s/is used by the physicianuser to indicate that the succeeding terms are to be searched ~or in either the s'y~npton~s, or s~\]rts portions of Lhe disease descriptions.
This grouping, a union of the two vocabularies, was necessitated by the non-consistent usage of terms in these contexts.
~ The phrase oObdo~r~,,/ pmL't will match (given the RECONSIDER options setected to run this case) any co-occurrence of these two words (or its synonyms) within a si~gie ctause.
RECONSIDER responds with the synonyms it knows for the terms entered, and sThe ~ of terms withe CMIT did not follow t~e ~dioal do~rrm as to what was • ~m;~om, and what w,,, a ssgn.
the number of diseases containing one of mor'e occurrences of each of the terms within the ss/ context.
The response =bdo.tinaL pain\[ 191+80\] indicates that the pah" abdom~n~ pen occurs in 191 diseases and that 80 additional diseases have been retrieved by the synonyms for ~bdompaL-t, namely ccL/c\[3~\], csL~ck~/~16\], end pWut /n abdom4~48\].
The fact that 3.5÷15+48 exceeds 80.
and 191+35+18+48 exceeds 191+180, indicates that some diseue definitions contain more than one term from this synonym class.
The score (a measure of selectivity) for abdom~n~ p~n is 0.917 = 1 (271/3262) where 271 is the number of "disease occurrences" of abdomma~ p~, and 3252 is the total nurnbar of diseases in CMIT.
A disease's score is the sum of the scores of the terms its description matched.
Most physicians would probably conclude that the observation that the patienL smoked was not relevant to the patient's illness, but the term smo~ was entered here to show its obvious effect on the disease List (it brings n~.ott~ur, to=/¢/~ and ~g ~pende.ce, ma=-/h~m~ nearer to the top, partly because it is so "seLective").
It is not clear which 'part' of the disease descriptions the term ~wlo~g will be found in.
so its search context is all/.
and the same decision is made with respect to =e/dos.iv.
An/on gap ~/dos/8 is not used in C~\]T, so we enter the more genera/ form.
I° Entering swto~lk~g in the a~/context has the disadvantage that it brings in a reference to smoky, which is used as an adjective.
The histogram displays the body system frequencies for the diseases near the top of the disease list (the top 4~, was selected by the user to include about the first "screen's worth" of the disease List 8?9 diseases containing one or more of the terms entered, or their synonyms).
A physician-user viewing the first screenfull of this ~st (the portion shown in the appendix) would next formulate a strategy for resolving it, assuming the diagnosis was still noL immediately apparent.
A methodical approach would note first that no disease matched all five entries (as no disease has a score of 4.738).
Similarly, diseases #I, #2.
and #3 would be ruled out by asking the patient appropriate questions.
(If the patient were from Matin County, here in the Bay Area.

Disease #4, ecto~p~, raises a more interesting issue.
RECONSIDER does not have a model of gender (or of anything else), so a disease that occurs during pregnancy is not automatically ruled out when the patient is male.
WhAle understandably distracting at first.
users are soon comfortable ignoring such inclusions, especially since it's easy to understand RECONSIDER put the disease there.
Viewing the C~\]T definition of disease #5.
nej#u-Lbi~, s"It £o~ reveals that it is usually accompanied by a rich complex of symptoms, so while it can not be ruled out at this point, it becomes extremely unlikely.
Since the patient is not an alcoholic, the definition of disease #6, rn.ethTjt ~l.cohoL, Lozic%tll.
suggests the possibility of occupational exposure (perhaps percutaneous or respkatory).
Once considered, an appropriate test would confirm the existence of the toxic substance in the body.
8. /k~l-Umr Experience We have not permitted RECONSIDER to be used '~iva" in a clinical context.
In addition to the fact that evaluation of the program is not complete, the knowledge base is known to be out of date.
Nonetheless since we have been able to move RECONSIDER to the MIS-UCSF VAX 11/750 running UNIX~ (Berkeley 4.1) students, postdoctoral fellows and some faculty have been able to use the program.
The initial reaction usually consists of the following three observations: (I) "Why is that disease there"?
(sometimes it's there Legitimately, and sometimes not), (2) "How does such a dumb program do so well"?
(referring to RECONSIDER's lack of evident reasoning power), and (3) "What I need to be able to do now is "...
(1111 in your favorite interactiveknowledge-base user-feature).
We tolerate the probiem alluded to by question (I) because it is more important, at this stage of development, not to miss important diseases, and because it is easier for a physician-user to reject totally inappropriate diseases than it is for the program to do so.
Question (2) alludes to the point raised by the title of this paper.
RECONSIDER can only be considered an "expert" (if at all) because its knowledge base is so Large (relative to what a physician can keep readily available in his or her head), and because of its performance.
It is obviously not like a human "expert" un the way it a~'~ves at the disease list.
And question (3) we take to be a comphment that reveals, among other things, that occasionally the utility of RECONSIDER is iu~uted not by the knowledge it eonteuns, but by the means we currently have of accessing it through the narrow window of a 23line CRT terminal.
Question (1) deserves further comment.
The author (MST) has observed considerable user-discomfort caused by CMIT hexing diseases from several body systems near the top of a eUN1X is a produc~ of Ben Telephone Laboratories, ~nc.
sorted disease list.
Apparently, the cognitive dissonance is usually avoided by thinking about diseases by system, an the discomfort can be relieved by restricting the search (and thus the sorted list) to a single body system.
The problem with the latter practice is that the preliminary results of our evaluation reveals that contextless (0~/searches) are the most e~Lcacious.
on average.
AS this is also the opposite of the behavior predicted by our model of context in a norruna/-attribute knowled4\[e base.
further study is suggested.
In any case, it may prove necessary to re-design the user-intorface to accomodate some users' need to view deseases by system, within a contextless search.
7. Evaluation A formal evaluation of RECONSIDER on i00 serial admissions to a tertmry care medical ward.
is in progress (and will be reported elsewhere), but the prelim/nary results are both encouraging and interesting.
They are encouraging because the correct diagnoses is included so often in the first frame or two (and usually higher), and interesting because the difference between diagnostic programs, and diagnostic p~rn4~g programs is made quite clear, The former have a very specific goal.
and it is easy to tell whether it is reached or not.
A prompting program is evaluated against a different standard; not whether it is correct but whether it is halpfui And judging whether something is helpful or not may be a subtle matter.
If the correct diagnosis is included h~h on the List, the performance can be given a hiKh score.
But if, instead, a listed disease closely related to the correct one has the result of directing the physician's attention to the correct body system, and finally the correct diagnosis, how is this to be scored? 8.
Suspected \[~mitat/ons: 8.1.
The \]Qaowtedge As has been the experience with similar projects, computer processing subjects "knowledge" to a harsh and unyielding l~ht.
We anticipate that a half a man-year of "tuning" would significantly improve RECONSIDEEs performance, but that the next and much more serious Limitation will be the quality, uniformity, completeness, and timeliness of CMIT and the synonym dictionary.
Given the opportunity to rewrite CMIT (and continue to do so on an ongoing basis), or introducing A\] techniques to RECONSIDER (we have received many suggestions), we would choose the former.
8.2, Other lJrnit~Uol~ Our experience to date has taught us that, in this context, negatives are ~nportant.
Terms such as fe~r u~b.se~tt are teated as if/e-vet were a positive finding: while not fatal, such retrievals increase the number of false positives.
Also users often wish to search using "rule-out", e.g. elirmnate all diseases from consideration 128 containing a certain term.
or terms.
Especially tricky would be interactions between these two uses of negation.
On a more global level.
CMITs homogenization of diseases contributes to confusion and loss of information.
Congestive heart failure is listed as a disease under ~r(.
fa~,ui'e, cov~sstt~e.
as a symptom under ~art.
AMoe~tm,~mye.
~e--e. as a sign under Hart, AV/m,-tT~pA V, /mm-t.
f~tv 0kge~rt and ~ ssta~a'~.,fu.bv,dvuZar, and as a complication in, for exampie.
tr~pznaso~a~s, ~awm~c~m.
And to illustrate the stress on the process of attempting to form a closed set of synonyms, the symptoms and signs of c0n~es~e ~m'~ ~s are described at various points as in cm-dio~.,~opa£A!@, but the phrase conges~bue heart f~ does not occur in that description.
9. Futuure ImpementaU~um Given an opportunity to re-brnplement CMIT.
we would retreat h-ore our original notion that it should not be modified (so as to prove that structured text could be used, intact, as a knowledge base).
Rather we would maintaIn the inverted files dynamically, in a relational database.
so as to facilitate modifications, and experiments with alternative knowledge representations and retrieval techniques.
Specifically. we would investigate the difficulty of re-writIng CM1T to improve the quality and timeliness of the information it contained, to use a more standard model of disease nomenclature \[ 1\].
to evaluate alternative ways of handling negation (such as 2m~ug~e -bsent).
and the allow users to specify necess/~ (a term m.usf occur, or not occur, In a disease description for it to be retrieved).
RECONSIDER currently requires some 20 MB o disk space.
A dynamically revisable version would require at least twice that.
making RECONSIDER a little Like an orphan elephant in already pressed medical computing environments.
A "production" version of RECONSIDER might fit in 15 MB, leaving two alternatives for the future: running RECONSIDER on the large address-space micro-based systems now avail.able with large hard disks, or making it available on a network.
We are toot~n~ into both possibilities.
10. Conclumons In the context of medical diagnoses, and perhaps in other apptication areas.
"structured text", as defined here, has been neglected as a means of representin 8 information in a form accessible to both humans and algorithms.
If as Minsky has put it.
"For a program, being smart is knowing a tot.", then carefulty edited and constructed natural language text, available in computer-readable form, may facilitate the process by which programs come to "know a lot" and continue to "know a tot" as the knowledge evolves over time.
We conclude by noting that ultimately tile usefulness of diagnostic aids such as RECONSIDER.
must await the verdict of users.
If the cost and bother of their use is less than the benefit they are found to provide, we can expect them to make their way Into clinical practice.
Up until the present thne.
no diagnostic support program seems to have accomplished t~s.
