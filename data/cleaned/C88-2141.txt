S}3C Maximal flexibility in controlling CFG parsing can be obtained in !,tie active (:hart parser \[Kay80\]\[WinogrM8a\].
h~ this algorith,,/ qchemata, ~, parsing p,'ocGqs i,':; taken as a sequence of attaching an active or inactive arc to Chmq, one at each time.
Though each attachment of an arc creates a set of arc.': to be ~ttached, the churl parser in a/~eneral foJm does not atttmh 6}~3 them'inmediately, but registers them in Agenda, A scheduler decides which arc in Agenda is to be attchcd next.
Because no a priori ordering of arc attachment is assumed, one can realize abitrary, flexible control mechanisms in this schemata.
llowever, such a maximal flexibility is obtained at the cost of efficiency.
The scheduler has to be invoked at each cycle to decide which arc to be attached, l:'urthermore, when arcs are created, we have to take away tile arcs which exist in Agenda or in Chart, before re.gistering them in Agenda.
The same ares may exist to the arcs only whose leftmost constituents are filled by inactive arcs.
Because of lhe reachabilily eondilion, we also have to check applicability of rules to all the inactive arcs in the right neighbor, whenever an active arc is attached.
Such repeated cheekings can be avoided in more restricted algorithms.
ht KGW-t-p, we use an Agenda°like list (S-listsuspending list) but unlike the Agenda in the active chart parser, it only keeps tile arcs which will be tried after the prelerred ones fail.
The other created arcs are attached immediately, instead of tlle scheduler, the SBC has its own control scheme for building PPTs mechanically from left to right.
The scheduler of KGW-I-p is more like a demon watching the SBC.
When it finds less preferred PPTs (arcs) generated, it jumps out to store them in the S-list.
Or when it finds the SBC goes to deadend, it decides which suspended PPTs in the S-list should be resumed.
The SBC in KGW+p uses two data structures, one for inac. tive arcs and the other for active arcs in Chart.
As in Fig.
2, the inactive arcs from vertex i to j are stored ill P(i, j)and the active arcs with ending vertices i are stored in G(i).
We call the arcs in P(i, j) inactive PPTs and the arcs iu G(i) active PPTs.
Both P(i, j) and G(i) are realized as flavor instances of each type (P-Flavor and G-Flavor).

Fig. 2 T'~o Data Str.etures ill I(GW+p We also realize active and inactive PPTs as instances of the PPT-flavor, each of Which keeps the following items (e°PPT in the following means the PPT which is expressed by the flavor instance) (1)starting and ending vertices of c-PPT (2)syntactic category and features of the top node of e-PPT (3)completed constituents: a list of inactive PPT..
instances filling the child nodes of e-PPT (4)remainders: a list of constituents to be filled.
If c~.PI'T is inactive, the remainders is an empty list.
We call the leftmost constituent of the remainders the waili'ng constiluenL Note that the waiting constituents of PPTs in G(i) are to be filled by inactive t'PTs with starting vertex i.
(5)pairs of a larger PPT which incorporates c-PPT as the leftmost constituent and the rule which ww~J used to create the larger PPT.
'Because PPT-instances keep (1)., (4) as the arcs in Char~, they can be suspended ill the S-list (not immediately sLored in P(i, j) or G(i )) and resumed afterwards freely.
(5) is used to avoid redundant processings in the retrial phases (see Seclion 4).
The basic cycle of parsing is implemented as a set of method,~ el P--Flavor When P(i, j)-instanee is triggered,, the methods in P-Flavor perform the following operations for each PPT stored in p(i,j).
o (Extension of Aclive PPTs)look for active PPTs in G(i) which can incorporate the PPT as the leftmost constituent of the remainders, and create new PPTs © (New Rule Applicalion)look for rules wimse leftmost constituents in rhs can be unified with the PPT and whose nonterminals in lhs can reach to the nonterminals of the waiting constituents of active PPTs in G(i), and applies them to create new PPTs By storing newly created PPTs in the corresponding P(i', j') or G(j ~ ) immediately, a naive bottom-up, breadth-first and left-to-right parsing with top-down filtering can be easily realized as follows.
(1)After completion of the basic cycle, P(i, j)-instance triggers the execution of the basic cycle in P(i-1, j)instance (2)A trigger to P(0, j)-instance is taken as a trigger to the SBC-manager.
The manager creates new PPTs by using the rules A ~ aj+i (aj+l is the j+l th words), stores them in P(j+I, j+l) and triggers P(j+ I, j+ l)oinstance (3)Parsing is started by triggering P(0,/0)-intance (This leads to the triggering of P(1, 1) in (2)).
The basic control scheme of the SBC is the same as the above one.
However, in KGWTp, after each basic cycle of creating new PPTs, newly created PPTs are rated by the PRC and the scheduler suspends less preferred (active or inactive) PPTs by storing them in the S-list.
Only preferred ones are stored in C0rrgsponding P(i', j") or G(j" ) m parallel.
Thus, though the scheduler loosely controls the whole process, the SBC analyzes sentences basically from left to right in a breadth-first manner by its own efficient control scheme.
Note that the basic control scheme is an extended one of the algorithm proposed by V.

These new PP't's represent different hypotheses b~se(l on the same l)ottom.-up evidence, the incorporated PP'j'.
The PR,(II computes the PVs (plausibility vMues) of these dif fereat hypotheses by invoking a package of preferet,ce rules.
A rule package is defined for computing the l'Vs of larger PI'Ts incorpratiug the same inactive PPT.
That is, ~ rule package is delined for each syntactic category (noutermit~u.l) of a PPT to be iitcorporated.
A set of rules tot PP-attachment, tbr examt.{!e, are defined in a package which is iuvoked when the incorporated PPT is a prepositional phrase.

The PRO gets a set of values from the independent evidences, each of which is a primitive PV based o,t a certain aspect of the PPT such as semantic intimacy of words, welbtbrmedness of syntactic trees, etc.
By combining the values with a certain function (currently~ we use simple addition as this 685 function), the PRC determines the PV for the incorporation of tree into TREE.

And we do not use (4) (the PV from top-down) in this addition.
In the present experilnent~ after the PRC computes the PVs of larger PPTs incorporating the same PPT, the scheduler suspends PPTs which have low PVs cornpared with the most preferable PPT.
That is, if the difference between the highest PV and the PV of a PPT exceeds a certain (predetermined) threshold, the PPuC suspends the PPT.
6 Experiments
We conducted various experiments by using KGW+p.
In this section, we will show the experiment of disambiguating sentences containing the word that.
That can be taken as a pronoun, a detenninner, a relative pronoun, a complementizer, a noun as an antecedent of a relative clause, a conjunction for an appositional clause or adverbial clause, an adverb, etc.
The followings are examples we realize as preference rules in the experiment.
(Note that, in the present experiment, the PVs 6iven by independent evidences are classified into 5 ranks, most preferred (+2), more preferred (+1), neutral (0), less preferred (-1) aud least preferred (-2)).

are often collocated with appositional clauses.
When the head of a noun phrase preceding that is one of su& nouns, the apposilional clause interpolation is more preferred.
(2) Wheat the verb in the sentence is one of the verbs subcategorized by that-clause, the complemeMizer ino terpretation is most preferrred.
(3) When the word so or such appears iu the preceding part of the sentence, tile adverbial phrase interprelation is most preferred.
(4) PP.-attachments over clauses are less preferred.
(5) Omission of relative pronouns is less preferred.
(6) The pronoun and determiner interprelaliou of that are less preferred in written texts.
(7) Different usages of a verb have different preferences.
The verb to fell, for example, has five usages, 'to tell sth to *b', 'to tell slh', 'to tell sb sth', 'to tell sb lhaf-cl' and 'to tell'.
The last usage (the intransitive usage) has the least preference.
etc. An example of actuM preference rules is given in Fig.
6. The sentences in the following are used in the experinmr, t.
1. I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal.
2. I told the man that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal.
3. I was so tired that I could not move.
4. I was so surprised at the fact that John told us.
5. I told the fact that sulfuric acid dissolves the metal to John.
For 1 and 2, the SBC generates seven descriptions as follows, (a) \[s '" \[vp tell \[npthe \[n 1 fact lapp-el that sulfuric ..\]\]\]\]\] (l))\[o ...
\[vptell \[npthe fact~ \[that ca that sulfuric '..\]l\] (c)C..\[vpteU \[npthe fact \[rel_cl\[npthat sulfmic\] ..\]\] \[npthe metallll (d)\[s ""\[vp teu \[np the \[npl fact \[app-cl \[np that sulfuric\] ..\]\]\]\]t (e)\[ \[ tell\[ the fact\] \[ \[ that sulfurm\] \]\]\] s'" vp np ' that-el np ' " "" (0\[.~...\[vptell \[npthe fact \[rel_clthat sulfuric ..\]\]\]\[npthe metal\]\]\] ' (g)\[s'"\[vp tell \[np tile fact \[app_clthat sulfuric ..\]\]\[npthe metal\]\]\] (c)(g) are rated low because they contain less preferred co,,-structions.
\]~klr example, (c) contains tile ommision of a l'elative pronoun, the determiner interpretation of that, a PP-attachment over a clause (the phrase lhe metal), etc.
As tl,e result, (c) be-.
comes tile least preferred one among the interpretations.
(a) and (b) are most prelL>rable for 1 and 2, respectively.
The PVs of (~;) t~a~d (b) in these sentences differ by the semantic con..
dillon that the usage ~to tell *b UtaVcl' prefers human as sb and hy the collocation condition that the noun \[ec~ is often eolloc~ted with in! appositional that-clause but the noun man is not.
For the sentences 1 and 2, gGW4'p succeeds in integrating such different soils of preferential cues to give the highest PVs to the interpretations most preti~rable for till.sna,ii readers, t,'urthermore, because the p~.ths which lead to these interpretations htwe the highest PV.,; during the whole parsing process, ~my thrrmhold vt~.l ues can be used for suspending less pret.~rred interpretations.
KCW-.I p t~iso predates the valid interpretation for the sentence ~1 in i~ straightforward way, lint it erieounters certain diflirallies in 4 and 5.
At the i;ime when tl, e word ~hat is analyzed iti the sentence 4, the tale.tire pronoun interpretation, which leads to the va.lid atia.lysis, h.
a lower PV than the other two interpretaions.
'1;'I~,,.> ~dverbiM clause interpretation supported by the word no, and the ~ppositionM clause interpretation supported |)3' the word \]'acl have high;~.,: P'V~.
Therefore, if the t!@shold value is low, the valid lnteri.~retatum is suspended, l, urthermore> both interprets-lions sucee?d, though they contain siieh a semlmtieally less preferred struetm'e as \[s lap a°hnl\[vp \[v telll\[n i, Its\]l} arid tile woiile interpretations are rated low.
In the sentence 5, because the interpretation most preferable to human readers contains a PP-attaehment over a clause, it is rated less preferable than the one which contMns lap the \[npl.
metal \[pp to Johnlll.
The:se ex~i,nrples, especially the sentence 4, show |.haA, we need a mechanism to notice that the selected parsing pv~ths become less feasible (even though they do riot fail) thlm the snspendc<t paths.
This mechanism reqnires a ~lobal method lot comparing colnpletely remote PPTs.

KGW+p allows one to prepare knowledge for ~latural language parsing in two separate forms.
One is for the conMrai'al type of knowledge and the other is for the preference type of .knowledge.
By nsing the conslraiut type of knowledge, tile Sl-iC (Struc-tme Bnikling Component) in I(GW+p produces partial parse trees mechanically from left to right in a breadth-llrst real> her.
'Phe scheduler, which is a kind of demo's watching the SBC, loosely controls the whole parsing process by utilizing PVs (Plausibility Values) given by the PRC (Preference Rating Con> ponent).
The PRC uses the preference type of knowledge to compute the PVs.
KGW+p prepares a ti'amework in which we can obtain the flezibiliiy of control, ilte modurarily i~ knowledge preparation, a.nd lhe efficiency aild completencs.~ of parsing at the same ~ime.
I~ is a w.~ry delicate and difficnlt problem to decide the actual PVs of interpretations and the threshohl value for suspending PPTs.
Because w~rious different sorts of factors may contribute to the PVs with different strengths, we certainly have to coinbrae conventional NLP techniques with appropriate statistical and stoeha.stie models.
We hope that KGW-I p giw:s us a good starting imint for such future researches.
