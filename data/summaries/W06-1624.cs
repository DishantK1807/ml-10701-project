Traditionally, there are mainly two mainstreams in the SLU researches: knowledge-based approaches, which are based on robust parsing or template matching techniques (Sneff, 1992; Dowding et al., 1993; Ward and Issar, 1994); and data-driven approaches, which are generally based on stochastic models (Pieraccini and Levin, 1993; Miller et al., 1995).

This mechanism is well-suited for SLU since the spoken utterance usually consists of several phrases and noises (restart, repeats and filled pauses, etc) are most often between them (Ward and Issar, 1994).

While labelers/ sentences are available (a) Get n unlabeled sentences from u S (b) Apply the current classifier to n unlabeled sentences (c) Select m examples which are most informative to the current classifier and manually label the selected m examples (d) Add the m human-labeled examples and the remaining nmâˆ’ machinelabeled examples to the training set t S (e) Train a new classifier on all labeled examples 3.2 Bootstrapping the Topic-dependent Semantic Classifiers Bootstrapping refers to a problem of inducing a classifier given a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data (Abney, 2002).

One way to reduce the number of labeling examples is active learning, which have been applied in many domains (McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Tang et al., 2002; Tur et al., 2005).

The key to the bootstrapping methods is to exploit the redundancy in the unlabeled data (Collins and Singer, 1999).

We use the metric described in (Yarowsky, 1994; Golding, 1995).

It has been applied to problems such as word-sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), web-page classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), namedentity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) and automatic construction of semantic lexicon (Thelen and Riloff, 2003).
