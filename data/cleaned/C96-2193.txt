go. jp Fumihiro AOYAMA Obirin University 3758 Tokiwa-ch5 Machida-shi, Tokyo 194-02, JAPAN Abstract We have constructed the IPA Lexicon of Basic Japanese Nouns (IPAL-BN), which has a hierarchical structure based on the syntactic and semantic properties of no,ms.
In our lexicon, each lexical entry consists of subentries, and subentries have semantic property information.
Among these elements, we focus here on the subentry description.
Conventional Japanese dictionaries only enmnerate various usages.
But it is also important to clarify the semantic relations between subentries.
Thus we have developed a method for specifying the kind of relationship between subentries, using special cognitiw~ devices such as metaphor, metonymy, and synecdoche.
After a brief review of the structure of our lexicon, we discuss how the nlethod can be applied to the lexical description.
1 Introduction
Tile Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) i has compiled the IPA Lexicon of the Japanese Language for Computers, Basic Japanese Verbs (IPAL-BV) (1987) and Basic Japanese Adjectives (IPAL-BA) (1990).
The IPAL-BV contains 861 verbs and the IPAL-BA contains 136 adjectives a~s lexical entries.
These lexicons are available for public use and have been widely used in various mfiversity and research institute projects that have yielded encouraging results.
We started work on the IPAL-BN project in 1990.
hi May 1996, we released tlie third edition of tile IPAL-BN, with 1,081 nouns as lexical entries, for the public on networks with FTP service.
The IPAL project is characterized by its linguistic basis.
For example, the hierarchical structure i A special juridical body under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of International Tradc and Industry, Japmt.
of the IPAL-BN, which consists of lexical entries, subentries, and semantic property information, reflects our linguistic considerations concerning the syntactic and semantic properties of nouns.
Another example of benefits fi'om our linguistically inspired approach is the description of the kind of relationship between subentries.
Such information would be useful in various applications, but is not yet explicitly provided in existing Japanese dictionaries.
In the following sections, we first briefly introduce the general structure of the IPAL-BN, and then describe our method for specifying the kind of relationship between subentries.
In the concluding renlarks, we also touch on implications of the nlethod for tile application systems.
2 Structure
of IPAL-BN Figure 1 shows the top-level structure of the IPAL-BN.
The H'AL-BN consists of 1,081 lexical entries.
IPAL-BN Figure 1: Basic Structure of IPAL-BN Each lexical entry is conlposed of orthographic information, idiomatic information, and subentries.
Tile idiomatic in\]ormation accommodates the idiomatic or proverbial uses of the noun that have to be treated separately.
Let us take an example, Hanako-wa hana-ga takai.
This Japanese sentence has the idiomatic meaning, "Hanako is proud," in addition to the ordinary nleaning, "Hanako has a long nose".
hi the idionlatic cases, the meaning of tile whole sentence cannot be decomposed into the meaning of each word.
Thus we reserve the idiomatic information separately fi'om 1082 ordinary meaning sections.
Then we introduce a hierarchy, subdividing each entry that has more than one usage of the word.
Each usage is (:ailed a subentry.
The subdivision to subentry is based not only on semantic but also on syntactic characteristics.
This categorization process can be ilhtstrated with an exampie of hankyo 'echo': hant:y5 q~('he' 01.
a somM t,hat is reflected off a surface such as tit(: wall of a lmilding.
Bbru-no oto-ga hcya-no natca-de hankyS-suru.
(The sound of the ball echoes in the room).
02. one's (,xpr(:ssion of an opinion about or at.tit.mh: toward som('thing.
Kon, o hanashi-wa hitobito-uo kokoro-ni hwnky5o yobiokosu darS.
(This story will arouse an echo in every man's heart) One may note that hanky&O1 has a usage in which a noun t)ecomes a verb when followed by "-suru", while hanky&02 does not.
On the basis of tlfis (lifference, we divide this i20,112 into these two subentries.
Figure 2 giw.'s an overview of each subc, ntry.
A subentry consists of subentry information and several pieces of semantic property information.
The subentry information contains syntaeti(:, semantic, and morphoh)gical information co,ninon to all parts of the subentry (each selnantie property ilfforlnation section).
The semantic t)roperty information in(hides syntactic and semantic information.
In the case of hanky5, we use the syntactic information in the subentry information to describe, tim difference in the usages (Kuwahata, 1995).

\[,'or example, 'the letter' in 'I read the letter' focuses oi1 tim information in the letter, whereas its counterpart in 'I l>urned the letter' focuses on the thing (i.e., piece of paper) bearing that information.
Since we can say 'I burned the letter that I had read', the word 'letter' does not have two meanings but rather has two aspects.
Tiros a noun is consi<lere<l here to have various aspects depending on the predicates used in the sentence containing the noun.
These aspects are called semantic properties (Aoyama, 1995).
Instead of subdividing the lexical entry into multiple subentries, we categorized the regular collocations in each subentry in terms of semantic properties.
For exan2ple, let, us take the word ha 'tooth /teeth' which has three semantic t)rot)erties.
In our notation, the semantic properties are labeled by three letters in square brackets.
The phrases ha-o migaku 'l)rush one's teeth' and ha-o nuku 'pull one's tooth' refer to tooth as a concrete object \[CON\].
And the phrases ha-ga haern 'cut teetlf and ha-ga nukeru 'h)se teeth' imply (natural) phenomena \[PHE\], while the t)hrases ha-ga jobu-da 'tlave sound teetlF and ha-ga guragurasuru 'a tooth feels h)ose' single out a condition of teeth from their potential conditions \[POT\].
3 Relationships
of Subentries 3.1 Problem Most, existing Japanese dictionaries merely enumerate various usages.
But clarifying the semantic relations between those usages is important.
For exan2ple, the noun tamago 'egg/spawn' has three senses: tanuulo 'egg/spawn' 01.
aIl ol)jec~ covered wit, It a hard shell or a membrane, produced by a female animal.
Kingffo-ga tarnago-o urtda.
(The gohlfish spawm:d).
02. a heat's egg (i.e., some kind of food).
Hana~:o-wa tamago-o ichi pa~:ku katta.
(tlanako bought 1 dozen eggs).
03. at person ~tt the Imginning of his/her carter.
Hanal~o-wa isha-no tam, a.qo-da.
(Hanako is a dot:for lit the inaking).
A hen's egg (02) ix one type of object that ix covered wittl a hard shell (01), and (03) is a metaphor with respect to the relation between hen's egg (02) and hen.
Our problem was to explicidy (lescribe these kinds of relations between meanings.
3.2 Approach
Ill the literat, ure, several attempts \]lave already been made to analyze such senlantie relationships 2.
Yanlanasld (1995), among others, 1)oints out that apt)re(taring such special cognitive devices as metaphor and metonymy is the 2Ulhnann, 1969; Lakoff and Johrlson, 1980; Kunihire, 1982; Yamanashi, 1995.
1083 key to understanding polysemy.
We emt)loy this method for sI)ecifying the kind of relationship l)etween subentries.
Currently we note three types of relations: • Metaphor, based on similarities • Metonymy, based on various (:ontiguitics • Synecdoche, l)ase.d oil the relation between m(mtl)er mM (:~0;(:gory Metaphor is the similm-ity-based instrument for exte,Ming the meaning of words.
At the outset met, al)horical expressions are temporarily used figures of speech.
However, some metaphors conm to be fixed and pass into everyday use.
Let us take some examples: h.on-no mushi 'a worm of books' (a person who is crazy about reading), arasof no tane 'a seed of argument' (a cause for argument), and kotoba-no kabe 'a wall of words' (a language barrier).
We regard these ext)ressions as flfll-fledged usages of dm nouns, and accordingly descrihe them in the IPAL-BN, while telnporal usages are not considered fl)r description in our lexicon.
Metonynly is an instrument for employing a word to refer to something that distinct front, hut, is associated in some way with, the original referent of the.
word. Tyi)ieal examples are Nabe-ga oishi, "The dish is nice;" and Ano kyateh&wa ( kata-o shiteiru, "The catcher has nice shoulders (The catcher has a powerflfl throw)".
In the former, the reference has shifted from the container to the content, and in the latter, the refl~.rence has shifted Dora the part of the body to its flmetion.
Synecdoche is the instrument that take.s the name of a category to stand for one of its members or taking the.
name of one ineml)er to stand for the whole category, as shown in the above hen's egg example: a hen's egg is one kind of object that is covered with a hard shell.
It is lint)or(ant not to confitse the colmoted relatio,l of synecdoche with the contiguity relation \[part\]-\[whole\] of lltetollyttly.
Let 11s take all ('xample of the relation \[part\]-\[whole\] to show the difference: te carln/hmtd' 0l.
upl)cr limbs of a hmnan (th(: (mtire.ty, consisting of ~rIn ~tiI(l hmtd).
"Ha.na~:o-wa ryShS-no te-o hirogcta".
(Hmmko st)r(.'~t(1 her arms).
02. the (:ml of a person's arm (tit(: part consisting only of the hand).
':Hanako-wa tc-o tataita".
(Ilanako (:lal)I)('d her ttands).
We do not consider the.
\[part\]-\[whole\] relation hetween the arm (01) and t;he hand (02)to be all instance of syne(:doehe.
Let us compare this example of te 'arm/hand' with the examph; of tamago 'egg'.
Besides a hen's egg, there are tmmy other sorts of eggs, such as a turtle's egg, a pigeon's egg, mid a swallow's egg.
By contrast of the arln as a whole, only the hand receives the de.',,}igiiation te.
For e.xamph'., we do not also express the elbow as te 'arm/hand'.
Hence. we consider the contiguity relation \[part\]-\[whole\] to be one type of metonymy.
We distinguish it fi'om the member-category relation of synecdoche a.
a.a Method In this section, we will show sonm examples of description.
Some metaphorical expressions need some nlodifier and others do ttt)t.
kata 'shoulder' 01.
ftana~:o-wa kata-o sukumcta.
(Hanako shrugged her shouhh:rs).
02. Sono uwagi-'no kata-wa 5l:\[.
(Thai; jacket has wide shoulders).
03. Sono yam, a-no t:ata-ni yamagoya-ga aru.
(There is a lodge on that mountain shonhtcr).
((}1) is a non-metaphorical use.
((}2) and (03) are metaphorical uses.
One may notice that, (02) can he used without y@zku-no 'of clothes', but ((13) requires yama-no 'mountain-'.
We have the impression that (02) is conventionalized.
We. classify metaphorical usages into two types: conventionalized and novel.
To the first group we assign expressions that can be used without being modified.
Such an expression is indicated by "A = > B".
The second group is indicated by "A • ".> B".
These mean that A is original and B in metaphorical.
We refer to the above relation, hence, as: "01 ::> 02.
01 "'> 03".
It is hard to judge which is metaphor if both SellSeS &re (;onvelltiotlal.
Consider: shi'wa ~wrinkle' 01.
Hana~:o-wa me-no mawari-ni shiwa-ga dekite~:ita.
(Hanako has got wrinkles r(mnd her eyes).
02. Hanako-wa shatsu-'no shiwa-o aitvn-de nobashita.
(Hanako ironed out the wrinkles in her shirt).
We regard (01) as non-metat)horical and (02) as metaphorical firsl; group.
Various contiguity relations cause metonymical extension.
We single (),at, the relation \[part\]\[whole\] as one.
group, and assign the other contiguity relations to a second group.
The first group is indicated by "A >> B" or "A << B" and the second group is indicated by "a \[X\] -> \[Y\] B".
"A > > B" means extension h'om \[whole\] to \[part\] and "A < < B" lile.ans extension in the opposite dire~cdon.
"A \[X\] --> \[Y\] B" me.ans that the relation \[X\]-\[Y\] links A to B.
These relations inchlde \[eontainer\]-\[eontent\], \[inaterial\]-\[t)roduct\], \[,neans\]-\[act\].
Here is an examl)le.
aSato (1992) also dist, inguishes I)(:tw(,(m synecdoche and mctonymy.
But. Ullmmm (1969) and Yainam~shi(1995) include synecdoche in m('|;onymy.
