The syntactic pattern used in (Lee (1997)) consists of four syntactic features such as Sentence Type, Main-Verb, Aux-Verb and Clue-Word because these features provide strong cues to infer speech acts.

Recently, machine learning models using a discourse tagged corpus are utilized to analyze speech acts in order to overcome such problems (Nagata (1994a), Nagata (1994b), Reithinger (1997), Lee (1997), Samuel (1998)).

Discourse structures of dialogues are usually represented as hierarchical structures, which reflect embedding sub-dialogues (Grosz (1986)) and provide very useful context for speech act analysis.

P(S~IUI,~)= P(SilS~,~-I)P(U~ISi) (1) It has been widely believed that there is a strong relation between the speaker's speech act and the surface utterances expressing that speech act (Hinkelman (1989), Andernach (1996)).

For the discourse structure analysis, we suggest a statistical model with discourse segment boundaries (DSBs) similar to the idea of gaps suggested for a statistical parsing (Collins (1996)).
P96-1025
Most works done in the past on the dialogue analysis has analyzed speech acts based on knowledge such as recipes for plan inference and domain specific knowledge (Litman (1987), Caberry (1989), Hinkelman (1990), Lambert (1991), Lambert (1993), Lee (1998)).
P91-1007
An utterance A is hierarchically recent to an utterance B if A is adjacent to B in the tree structure of the discourse (Walker (1996)).

As shown in table 4, the proposed models show better results than previous work, Lee (1997).

We estimate the probability of each term using the following representative equation: P(a lb)= P(a,b) y~ P(a', b) a (12) We can evaluate P(a,b) using maximum entropy model shown in equation (13) (Reynar 1997).
