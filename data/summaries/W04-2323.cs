Automatic segmentation of discourse forms the basis for many applications, from information retrieval and text summarization to anaphora resolution (Hearst, 1997).

While agreement among annotators regarding linear segmentation has been found to be higher than 80% (Hearst, 1997), with respect to hierarchical segmentation it has been observed to be as low as 60% (Flammia and Zue, 1995).

The a0 coefficient is computed as follows: a0 a47 a1a32a2 a9 a1 a30 a68 a9 a1a32a30 Carletta (1996) reports that content analysis researchers generally think of a0a34a33 a49a36a35a37 as “good reliability,” with a49a36a35a38a40a39a37a41 a0 a41a25a49a36a35a37 allowing “tentative conclusions to be drawn.” All that remains is to define the chance agreement probability a1 a30 . Let a1a32a41 a1 a30 a7 and a1a32a42 a1 a30 a7 be the fraction of utterances that begin or end one or more segments in segmentation a30 respectively.

Other attempts have had more success using improved annotation tools and more precise instructions (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).

The monologues were subsequently annotated by a group of subjects according to the Grosz and Sidner (1986) theory of discourse structure.

Carlson et al.(2001) also used conflict resolution when creating their discourse-tagged corpus.

The linguistic structure of a discourse is composed of utterances that exhibit meaningful hierarchical relationships (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

Hierarchical Approaches Most previous work that has combined multiple annotations has used linear segmentations, i.e. discourse segmentations without hierarchies (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).

Wiebe et al.(1999) use statistical methods to automatically correct the biases in annotations of speaker subjectivity.
P99-1032
Indeed, much of the work on automatic recognition of discourse structure has focused on linear, rather than hierarchical segmentation (Hearst, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), because of the difficulties of obtaining consistent hierarchical annotations.
J97-1003 P96-1038
In addition, those approaches that do handle hierarchical segmentation do not address automatic unification methods (Carlson et al., 2001; Marcu, 2000).

Rotondo (1984) reported that “hierarchical segmentation is impractical for naive subjects in discourses longer than 200 words.” Passonneau and Litman (1993) conducted a pilot study in which subjects found it “difficult and time-consuming” to identify hierarchical relations in discourse.
