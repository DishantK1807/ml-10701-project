Indeed, it is an instructive special case of (1) the inside-outside algorithm for estimation of probabilistic context-free grammars; (2) belief propagation for training singly-connected Bayesian networks and junction trees (Pearl, 1988; Lauritzen, 1995); (3) algorithms for learning alignment models such as weighted edit distance; (4) general finitestate parameter estimation (Eisner, 2002).

Their application to partof-speech tagging (Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988) kicked off the era of statistical NLP, and they have found additional NLP applications to phrase chunking, text segmentation, word-sense disambiguation, and information extraction.

39Advanced students might also want to read about a modern supervised trigram tagger (Brants, 2000), or the mixed results when one actually trains trigram taggers by EM (Merialdo, 1994).
