Thus, for instance, it has been a typical practice in LS-GRAM to distribute syntactic and semantic information over an analysis and a refinement grammar respectively; by this, parsing will not be affected by ambiguities residing in the semantic domain (cf., for instance, (Schmidt et al., 1996a) and (Schmidt et al., 1996b)).
