1Another possibility is normalization by the length of the longest alignment (Heeringa et al., 2006).

Like in other disciplines, computational methods are increasingly being combined with other more conventional approaches (Dyen et al., 1992; Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997; Kondrak, 2002; Ellison and Kirby, 2006).

The translation model is induced by combining the maximum similarity alignment with the competitive linking algorithm of Melamed (2000).

Different researchers have argued about the importance of order sensitivity and scaling in using string comparison algorithms (Heeringa et al., 2006; Ellison and Kirby, 2006).

Several methods for constructing comparative dictionaries have been proposed and applied to specific languagefamilies: Algonquian(Hewson, 1974), Yuman (Johnson, 1985), Tamang (Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994), and Malayo-Javanic (Oakes, 2000).

A recent work on applications of such techniques for linguistic study is by Heeringa et al.(Heeringa et al., 2006).

The specific details of this modification are described in more detail in Wieling et al.(2007). We do not normalise the Levenshtein distance measurement for length, because Heeringa et al.(2006)showedthatresultsbasedonrawLevenshtein distances are a better approximation of dialect differences as perceived by the dialect speakers than results based on the normalised Levenshtein distances.

But we would also like to test PairHMMs on a data set for which more sensitive validation is possible, e.g. the Norwegian set for which dialect speakers judgements of proximity is available (Heeringa et al., 2006); this is clearly a point at which further work would be rewarding.
