We used the NYU Linguistic String Project medical grammar, which is a modification of the Linguistic String Project English grammar including the sentence fragments and other constructs (such as descriptions of medication dosages) that appear in medical reports but not in standard English (Marsh 1983).
A83-1016
Such an approach has been suggested before by several computational linguists (for example, Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983), although primarily to account for ungrammatical input rather than for incompleteness of semantic knowledge.
J83-3003
We describe here, briefly, how these constraints are implemented in the Linguistic String Parser; more detailed descriptions are given in Grishman, Hirschman, and Friedman (1982, 1983).
A83-1007 C82-1014
Such an approach has been incorporated into some natural language interfaces for database retrieval, such as TEAM (Grosz 1983) and LDC (Ballard, Lusth, and Tinkham 1984).
A83-1006
Recent tests of this procedure on both medical records and equipment failure records indicate that accurate characterizations can be obtained from a sample of a few hundred sentences, and that (for both sublanguages) the size of the grammar used was roughly one-third the size of the full Linguistic String Parser English grammar (Grishman, Nhan, and Marsh 1984; Grishman, Nhan, Marsh, and Hirschman 1984).
P84-1023
Examples of sublanguages that have been studied are weather reports (Chevalier et al.1978), aircraft maintenance manuals (Lehrberger 1983), medical reports (Hirschman and Sager 1983), and equipment failure reports (Marsh, Hamburger, and Grishman 1984).
