The frame-based group attempts to deal with ungramnmtical input through extensions to pattern matching parsing/Hayes 1981/, through conceptual case frame instantiation/Schank 1980/and through approaches involving multiple cooperating parsing strategies /Carbonell 1983/.

The syntactically-oriented approaches/Kwansny 1981/ /Weischedel 1980,82,87/,/Heidorn 1982/,/Jensen 1983/are very similar.

The syntactically-oriented group includes robust parsers based on Augmented Transition Networks (ATN) which Use the relaxation technique/Kwansny 1981./or the meta-rule/Weisehedel 1980, 82, 87/, and the EPISTLE system which addresses the problems of the checking grammar and style of texts, such as letters, reports and manuals, written in ordinary English/Heidorn 1982/, /Jensen 1983/.
