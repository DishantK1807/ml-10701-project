Moreover, without a semantically powerful lexicon such as Pustejovsky’s (1991), even the most productive fragment of derivational morphology is hard to deal with (Sehitoglu and Bozsahin 1999).

Computational models of LFG (Tomita 1988) and GB (Johnson 1988; Fong 1991), on the other hand, have been noncommittal regarding inflectional morphology.
P88-1030
This is shown to be desirable from the perspective of prosody; for example, different bracketings are needed to match intonational phrasing with syntactic structure (Steedman 1991).
P91-1010
These studies correlate morphological case with type raising of arguments, in the case of Bozsahin (1998), via a value-raised category assignment to case morphemes.
P98-1025
CCG is worst-case polynomially parsable (Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993).
J93-4002
Apart from the matching of syntactic types and agreement, unification does no linguistic work in this framework, in contrast to structure-sharing in HPSG and slash passing in Unification CG (Calder, Klein, and Zeevat 1988).
C88-1018
The lexical semantics of the arguments and a qualia structure (Pustejovsky 1991) may indicate the function’s range of applicability.
J91-4003
As one reviewer noted, CCG formulation of the syntax-phonology interface moved from autonomous prosodic types (Steedman 1991a) to syntax-directed prosodic features (Steedman 2000b).
P91-1010
Our lexical type assignment to case morphemes (24e–f) departs from other CCG analyses of case (e.g., Steedman 1985, 1991a, Bozsahin 1998).
P91-1010 P98-1025
From the parsing perspective, the redundancy of analyses can be controlled by (1) grammar rewriting (Wittenburg 1987), (2) checking the chart for PAS equivalence (Karttunen 1989; Komagata 1997), (3) making the processor parsimonious on using long-distance compositions (Pareschi and Steedman 1987), or (4) parsing into normal forms (Eisner 1996; Hepple 1990b; Hepple and Morrill 1989; K¨onig 1989; Morrill 1999).

Positional encoding of such information as in Pulman (1996) allows efficient term unification for the propagation of these features.

Heylen [1997], in which the grammar rule imposes a fixed partial order, e.g., X/Y combines with Z if 12 This coincides with Steedman’s (1991b) observation that directionality of the main functor’s slash is also a property of the same argument.
P91-1010
Oflazer’s later (1996) morphological analyzer contained an abstract morphotactic component of around 50 states for inflections, which resulted in compilation to 30,000 states and 100,000 transitions when the morphophonemic rules were added to the system.
J96-1003
Statistical techniques developed for lexicalized grammars (e.g., Collins 1997), readily apply to CCG to improve the average parsing performance in large-scale practical applications (Hockenmaier, Bierner, and Baldridge 2000).
