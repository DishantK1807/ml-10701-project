† Sentence planning different languages can express the same content in various rhetorical structures, and planning must take it into consideration: either by avoiding the tailoring of structure to a specific language [R¨osner and Stede, 1994] or by taking advantage of knowledge on different realizations of rhetorical structures in different languages at the underlying representation [Delin et al., 1994].

We use existing generation resources for English – SURGE [Elhadad, 1992] for syntactic realization and the lexical chooser described in [Jing et al., 2000] and the HUGG grammar for syntactic realization in Hebrew [Netzer, 1997].

In an influential series of papers [Power and Scott, 1998], WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) was proposed as a method for the authoring of semantic information through direct manipulation of structures rendered in natural language text.

The ”WYSIWYM” approach was proposed ([Power and Scott, 1998], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996]) as a system design methodology where users author and manipulate an underlying logical form through a user interface that provides feedback in natural language text.

In Verbnet, verbs are classified following Levin’s classes [Levin, 1993] and thus its representation is easily adjustable with our verb lexicon [Jing et al., 2000], which combined information on argument structure of verbs from Levin, Comlex [Macleod and Grishman, 1995] and WordNet.

MLG systems share a common architecture consisting of the following modules: † A language-independent underlying knowledge representation: knowledge represented as AI plans [R¨osner and Stede, 1994] [Delin et al., 1994], [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996], knowledge bases (or ontologies) such as LOOM, the Penman Upper-model and other (domain-specific) concepts and instances [R¨osner and Stede, 1994].

The benefits of MLG over translation from single language source were documented in the past and include the high cost of human translation and the inaccuracy of automatic machine translation [Stede, 1996], [Coch, 1998], [Bateman, 1997].

Applications where the data is available in a database include report generators (e.g., ANA [Kukich, 1983], PlanDoc [Shaw et al., 1994], Multimeteo [Coch, 1998], FOG [Goldberg et al., 1994]).

† The construction and maintenance of context according to models of text planning [Reiter and Dale, 1992], allow the author to break a complex CG into a manageable collection of small utterances.

For microplanning, we have implemented the algorithm for reference planning described in [Reiter and Dale, 1992] and the aggregation algorithm described in [Shaw, 1995].
