It presents a contrastive study of French connectives puis (then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later) within the framework of Segmented Discourse Representation Theory.
It shows that puis is a marker of the Narration discourse relation, whereas un peu plus tard blocks Narration and licenses only a weaker discourse relation, that can be considered as a “weak Narration” involving only temporal succession.
In addition, puis blocks Result, while un peu plus tard does not.
1 Introduction
It is well known that tense, grammatical and predicational aspect are very important clues in the process of temporal interpretation of sentences, and of texts (see (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983) among others).
As far as discourse level is concerned, it has been shown that world knowledge and knowledge about discourse structure play a role in determining the text global temporal structure (Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Caenepeel and Moens, 1994).
In this paper we want to focus on the role of connectives and their intersentential semantics.
We want to give an account of the way some temporal connectives in French interact with discourse relations.
We will examine differences in the behavior of two connectives, namely puis (then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later), when different discourse relations hold.
At first sight, the temporal contribution of these two connectives should show little or no difference.
We will see that matters are not so simple.
This direction of work is inspired by a study of puis showing differences in behaviour according to the discourse relation at stake (Bras et al., 2001).
It is also grounded on previous studies of adverbials of temporal location and adverbials of spatial location and of their role to build the spatio-temporal structure of discourse (Asher et al., 1994; Asher et al., 1995a; Asher et al., 1995b; Asher et al., 2001).
We showed that, in the context of trajectories, relational adverbials like un peu plus tard and its spatial counterpart un peu plus loin (a bit further) had symetric roles in the process of locating the eventualities in space and time, and could both be given the same spatiotemporal interpretation.
We will tackle a comparative analysis of connectives within the framework of a theory of discourse structure and discourse relations.
We have chosen Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) for its effective methodology in investigating and formalizing how different linguistic clues interact at the semantic/pragmatic interface to recover the discourse structure of a text.
We will first briefly present SDRT (section 2), and the Discourse Relations (section 3) that we will use for our contrastive analysis of puis and un peu plus tard with respect to Discourse Structure (section 4).
2 SDRT
We first present the theorical framework that we chose to account for this interaction, namely SDRT.
SDRT is a non trivial extension of DRT that takes discourse structure into account and offers a theory of the semantics/pragmatics interface.
We give a brief outline of SDRT (see (Asher, 1993; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Asher, 1996; Busquets et al., 2001) for a thorough presentation).
In SDRT a discourse is represented by an SDRS.
An SDRS is a recursive structure consisting of elementary DRSs (i.e., DRSs representing a single clause) and sub-SDRSs linked together by Discourse Relations, such as Narration, Elaboration, Background, Continuation, Result, Contrast, Explanation.
.. These elementary DRSs and the subSDRSs corresponding to complex discourse segments are the constituents of the SDRS representing the discourse.
We use Greek letters as variables for constituents, and a0a2a1 as constants.
SDRSs are built up incrementally.
SDRT defines a “Glue Logic" and an “Update Function" that together determine a new SDRS for a given SDRS a3 representing the context (the discourse already processed), and a new constituent a4 representing the information to be integrated into that context.
The Glue Logic is embedded in the framework of “Commonsense Entailment" (Asher and Morreau, 1991), a logic that exploits both monotonic (a5 ) and non-monotonic (a6 )1 conditionals.
The Glue Logic is specified by: a7 definitions characterizing which constituents in a3 are open for attaching a4, a7 axioms detailing what discourse relations may be inferred, on the basis of a variety of linguistic and common knowledge clues, in order to actualize the attachment of a4 to some open constituent of a3, a7 axioms specifying the semantic effects of those discourse relations.
We will see some of these two kinds of axioms below.
The Update Function is in charge of the 1a8a10a9a12a11 means “if a8 then normally a11 ".
From a8a13a9a14a11 and a8, Commonsense Entailment entails a11 “by default", that is, defeasibly, in the absence of further information regarding the truth value of a11 . From a8a15a9a12a11, a8 and a16 a11, Commonsense Entailment no longer entails a11, but a16 a11 . proper hierachization of the structure and of the resolution of the possibly existing underspecifications (e.g., anaphora and ellipses).
3 Discourse
Relations In the following, we only present the discourse relations used in SDRT that will be helpful to analyse our data: Narration and Result.
One important aspect of SDRT that is worth emphasizing at this point is that several discourse relations may simultaneously link the same two constituents.
3.1 Narration
Narration is a relation which is based on the Gricean pragmatic constraint of orderliness.
When two clauses are linked by Narration, they describe in sequence two successive events “of the same story".
Let us first see more precisely what the semantics effects of Narration on discourse content are.
Building on the previous analyses of (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), we showed in (Asher et al., 1995a) that a relation of Narration between two constituents a4 and a17 entails a temporal overlap between the resulting state of the main eventuality of a4 (noted a18a20a19 2), a21a23a22a25a24a27a26a29a28a30a18a31a19a33a32, and the preceding state of a18a35a34, a21a23a36a25a18a37a28a38a18a35a34a37a32, in the absence of locating adverbials.
This is what axiom (A1) expresses: A 1 Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32a43a5 posta28a38a18 a19 a32a45a44 prea28a30a18a35a34a33a32 (A1) aims at capturing the fact that narratives must cohere in the sense that the events linked together by Narration must fit consistently and without significant spatio-temporal gaps as expressed in (Asher, 1996) and observed in earlier work on temporal order in narratives (see for example (Caenepeel, 1989)).
This doesn’t mean that there should be no interval of time between the two events a18 a19 and a18a27a34, but rather that no relevant event can occur during this interval.
From (A1) and uncontroversial ordering assumptions on events and their preand post-states3, we can deduce a relation of temporal precedence between 2As regards the ontology of eventualities, SDRT keeps building on DRT, and assumes the same Davidsonian approach.
Two basic aspectual classes are distinguished among eventualities: events and states.
3a46a48a47a50a49a52a51a54a53a38a55a56a49a52a57a59a58 a60a54a61a62a49a35a55a56a49a52a57a64a63a66a65a67a49a68a63a66a65a69a60a25a70a29a71a72a53a30a55a56a49a52a57, where a63a54a65 denotes temporal abutment, as used in DRT, or the “meets” relation as used in Allen’s theory (Allen, ).
the events a18 a19 and a18a27a34 : a18 a19a74a73 a18a27a34 . Actually, to fully capture the “no-significant-gap” constraint, a temporal overlap is too weak.
As we will see in Section 4.1, we should guarantee that a21a23a22a25a24a27a26a29a28a30a18 a19 a32 persists (at least) up to the beginning of a18 a34, and, conversely, that a21a23a36a25a18a37a28a38a18a35a34a33a32 starts when (or before) a18 a19 ends.
So we propose here an improved version of (A1), where a75 denotes the “intersection” operator4: A 2 Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a43a32a48a5 a18 a19a69a76a78a77 a28 posta28a30a18 a19 a32a79a75 prea28a30a18a27a34a37a32a41a32 a76a78a77 a18a35a34 Narration has another semantic effect.
It is motivated by the intuition that the elements of a Narration must belong to the “same story", i.e., they must have some common subject matter.
To this effect, axiom (A3) expresses that the constituents connected together by Narration must have a common Topic.
A topic is a simple constituent which is contingent (i.e., not vacuous, not contradictory, not tautologic), and subsumes the constituents of a sub-SDRS, in this case, the constituents linked by Narration.
If not already present in the context, it has to be added to the SDRS during the update.
(A3) and the rules of the underlying logic actually imply that Narration can be non-monotonically inferred only if such a topic exists or can be built.
A 3 a28a62a80 a3 a39a50a4a81a39a72a17a42a82 a83 Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32a41a32 a5 a84a86a85 a28 Contingenta28 a85 a32a64a83 a85a59a87 a4a88a83 a85a89a87 a17a42a32 where a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a43a82 means that a17 is to be attached to a4 in the SDRS a3, and a87 is a subordinating discourse relation whose semantics essentially involves subsumption between the topic and the elements of the narrative it summarizes.
Now, how do we infer Narration?
Since (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), the triggering axioms for Narration have changed to reflect the fact that Narration is not always a default in narratives (Asher, 1996).
It is only a default if no other relation can be inferred, that is, if in the discourse there are no clues that other axioms could exploit to infer other discourse relations: A 4 a28a62a80 a3 a39a50a4a81a39a72a17a42a82 a83 a90 Clues_ a91a13a92a20a28 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a43a32 a83 a90 Clues_ a91a10a93a94a28 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a32a95a83a97a96a20a96a20a96a98a83 4We assume that a71a50a99a101a100a10a71a103a102, when applicable, yields a new state lasting the maximum interval of time during which both a71a50a99 and a71a103a102 hold, and whose propositional contents is the conjunction of a71 a99 and a71 a102 ’s propositional contents.
a90 Clues_ a91a64a104a105a28 a3 a39a50a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a41a32a48a6 Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 where a91a13a92a45a96a20a96a20a96a106a91a64a104 are all the discourse relations used in SDRT5 but Narration, and Clues_ a91 a1 a28 a3 a39a50a4a81a39a72a17a42a32 holds whenever the propositional content of a4 and a17 and the discourse structure of a3 contain clues that could be exploited for inferring a91 a1 a28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 . In addition, Narration can be nonmonotonically inferred if the predicate Occasion holds between the clauses to be related: A 5 a28a103a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a43a82a95a83 Occasiona28a38a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a41a32a40a6 Narrationa28a30a4a81a39a72a17a42a32 Occasion holds if the two clauses contain clues indicating that their main eventualities are of types that may belong to “the same story".
In other words, Occasion exploits lexical semantics and shared knowledge in terms of scripts connecting certain event types in sequences in which one event “naturally" leads to the next.
For instance, (1) is an example of Narration where Occasion holds, since there is clearly in the shared knowledge a script in which, before entering, people knock at the door.
(1) Paul frappa à la porte.
Il entra.
(Paul knocked at the door.
He entered.) We can assume this kind of script to be encoded in the following axiom: A 6 a28a103a107 knocka28a38a18 a19 a39a52a108a109a39a52a110a86a32 a83 door-ofa28a30a110a23a39a50a111a54a32a106a112a113a4 6 a83 a107 entera28a30a18a35a34a23a39a50a108a45a39a50a111a54a32a106a112a114a17a42a32a43a5 Occasiona28a30a4a81a39a72a17a42a32 In this case, the sequence of events is only typical, i.e., “natural": knocking isn’t a necessary precondition to enter, and it doesn’t cause the entering.
Obviously, stronger dependence links between event types like precondition and cause also give rise to Occasion (and by non-monotonic inference, Narration), but some of them are also exploited to infer more specific discourse relations, like the next one to be presented here, Result.
5SDRT explicit states that there should be a finite number of discourse relations, even though what these are precisely is not a settled matter yet.
For the purposes of the present work, we will consider that these relations are: Narration, Background, Elaboration, Continuation, a115 (i.e., “Topic"), Result, Explanation, Contrast and Parallel, for which an SDRT account can be found in the literature.
6a116a8a118a117a120a119 means that the condition a8 appears in the constituent a119 . 3.2 Result The Result relation has the semantic effect of implying a causal link between the main eventualities of the constituents it relates: A 7 Resulta28a38a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a42a5 Causea28a30a18a31a19a98a39a52a18 a34 a32 The predicate Causea28a30a18a25a92a35a39a52a18a31a93a52a32 implies, among other things, that if a18 a92 and a18 a93 are events, the first temporally precedes the second: A 8 a28 Causea28a30a18 a92 a39a52a18 a93 a32a95a83 eventa28a30a18 a92 a32a121a83 eventa28a30a18 a93 a32a41a32a48a5 a18a25a92 a73 a18a31a93 Result may be monotonically inferred on the basis of the presence in a17 of an explicit marker of causation as e.g., the conjunct donc (therefore) or the verb to result: A 9 a28a62a80 a3 a39a50a4a81a39a72a17a42a82a95a83a122a107 donca112a114a17a42a32a48a5 Resulta28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 Result can also be non-monotonically inferred on the basis of lexical semantics or of some shared knowledge on the types of eventualities in a4 and a17, as in the following two famous examples: (2) Max poussa John.
Il tomba.
(Max pushed John.
He fell.) (3) Paul éteignit la lumière.
Il faisait nuit noire autour de lui.
(Paul turned off the light.
It was pitch dark around him.) In (2) and (3), it is again generic script-like information on pushing and falling event types, and on switching off the light event types and being dark state types that enables the reader to recover the causal links that the narrator most likely wanted to express.
The presence of such clues indicating a possible causal link is expressed by the predicate D-Permissible-Cause.
For instance, we assume that the following axiom encodes a plausible piece of shared knowledge: A 10 a28a62a107 pusha28a38a18 a19 a39a52a108a109a39a52a110a86a32a106a112a113a4a123a83 a107 falla28a30a18a27a34a23a39a52a110a86a32a106a112a114a17a43a32 a5 D-Permissible-Causea28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 which is in turn exploited by (A11) to infer Result: A 11 a28a62a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a82a86a83 D-Permissible-Causea28a30a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a41a32a40a6 Resulta28a30a4a40a39a41a17a43a32 4 Connectives and Discourse Structure In this section, we want to compare the behaviour of connectives puis and un peu plus tard7 in combination with Passé Simple sentences in order to find out to what extent they affect Discourse Structure.
We are first going to present series of examples and give the intuitions that native speakers may have about their interpretation.
Let us first compare the examples in (4): (4) a.
L’acide tomba dans le mélange.
Une explosion se produisit.
(The acid fell into the mixture.
An explosion happened.) b.
L’acide tomba dans le mélange.
Puis une explosion se produisit.
c. L’acide tomba dans le mélange.
Un peu plus tard une explosion se produisit.
The three examples are good.
They all express a relation of temporal sucession between the events.
But we feel that another issue is at stake.
In (4-a), the explosion event is not only interpreted as posterior to, but also as a result of, the acid falling event.
This interpretation is still valid for (4-c), but it is lost in (4-b).
With puis, it seems that the events are presented from an external, objective, point of view, as if the speaker did not intend to express any kind of resultative link.
Let us now look at (5): (5) a.
La petite fille s’endormit.
Il se mit à pleuvoir.
(The little girl fell asleep.
It began to rain.) b.
La petite fille s’endormit.
Puis il se mit à pleuvoir.
c. La petite fille s’endormit.
Un peu plus tard, il se mit à pleuvoir.
7Un peu plus tard is to be considered as representing a class of adverbials which have the same syntactic schema NP plus tard/après and the same semantic function, i.e. adverbials setting a temporal relation between two temporal referents.
Such relational adverbials introduce themselves a new time referent by coercion only in contexts requiring a temporal anchorage as in: Paul entra dans la pièce.
Cinq minutes plus tard, Marie pleurait.
(Paul entered the room.
Five minutes later, Mary was crying.).
Notice that puis cannot be coerced this way: Paul entra dans la pièce.
*Puis Marie pleurait.
We here compare a whole class of adverbials to the single adverb puis.
We feel that the use of puis in (5-b) is not as straightforward as the use of un peu plus tard in (5-c).
In order to interpret (5-b) —and (5-a) to a lesser extent— it seems that we have to imagine a specific context, for example “the story of a little girl lost in the woods", in which the contribution of each sentence to the coherence of the discourse is obvious.
Un peu plus tard does not require this kind of constraint.
The difference is less important when there is already a link between the events, as in (6): (6) a.
Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Elle alla la poster au village voisin.
(Marie wrote a letter to her cousin.
She went and post it to the next village.) b.
Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Puis elle alla la poster au village voisin.
c. Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Un peu plus tard, elle alla la poster au village voisin.
Here we do not need a particular context to interpret (6-b) —nor (6-a).
Nevertheless, the events seem to be more disconnected in (6-c) than in (6-b) or (6-a).
Now we want to examine how the intuitions described above may be accounted for in the SDRT framework.
4.1 Puis
and un peu plus tard with Narration In (Bras et al., 2001), we argue that puis is a rhetorical marker which introduces a relation of Narration: A 12 a28a62a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a82a95a83a97a107 puisa112a114a17a42a32a48a5 Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 In both (5-a) and (5-b), Narration will be inferred, by default with (A4) for (5-a), thanks to puis with (A12) for (5-b).
Our hypothesis to account for the different interpretation in (5-c), is that un peu plus tard blocks Narration.
But let us explain further.
Let us first consider the temporal effect of Narration described in (A2), setting that the intersection of the poststate of a18 a19 and the prestate of a18a27a34 exists and fills the interval between the two events.
Again, this means that the events must fit consistently and without significant spatio-temporal gaps.
A way to test the possibility of a relevant spatio-temporal gap between the two events is to try to insert a third event between a18 a19 and a18a35a34 such that it terminatesa21a23a22a25a24a35a26a35a28a30a18 a19 a32, i.e, an event whose poststate is incompatible with a21a23a22a25a24a27a26a29a28a30a18 a19 a32, for instance the event of the little girl’s waking up: 8 (7) a.
La petite fille s’endormit.
Il se mit à pleuvoir.
*Elle venait juste de se réveiller.
(She had just woken up.) / *Entretemps elle s’était réveillée.
(Meanwhile she had woken up.) b.
La petite fille s’endormit.
Puis il se mit à pleuvoir.*Elle venait juste de se réveiller.
/ *Entretemps elle s’était réveillée.
c. La petite fille s’endormit.
Un peu plus tard, il se mit à pleuvoir.
Elle venait juste de se réveiller.
/ Entretemps elle s’était réveillée.
The test on the temporal effect of Narration only fails in (7-c).
It is successful in (7-a) and (7-b), as the insertion of an intermediate event appears to be very difficult.
Let us insist that our examples are built in such a way that the intermediate events actually implies the end of posta28a30a18 a19 a32, hence a temporal gap between a18 a19 and a18a35a34 . If not so, the adding of another event with entretemps poses no problem.
For instance: (8) La petite fille s’endormit.
Puis il se mit à pleuvoir.
Entretemps la nuit était tombée.
(Meanwhile the night had fallen.) is perfectly acceptable, since the falling of the night does not imply that the little girl is no longer asleep.
Let us also note that it might be possible to improve (7-a) and (7-b), by introducing the third event with something like Ajoutons/précisons que, entretemps, la petite fille s’était réveillée (Let’s add / point out that, meanwhile, the little girl had woken up).
In such a case, however, there is an explicit phenomenon of correction (of the way the events have been narrated), and so it is not surprising that the temporal effects of Narration should be revised.
We come now to the second semantic effet of Narration, topic requirement (A3).
As we said 8See (Caenepeel, 1995) that investigates the conditions for the insertion intermediate events in a narrative sequence.
above, we do not need any special context to interpret (5-c).
On the contrary, a link seems to be required between the two events in (5-a) and (5-b), which corresponds to (A3) topic requirement.
Let us note that this requirement seems to be stronger in (5-b).
This is an indication that puis is more demanding on topic than a simple Narration.
We leave this apart for now, and turn to the difference between puis and un peu plus tard.
At this point, we need to address the issue of the relation between the sentence a17 introduced by un peu plus tard and the sentence a4 . Of course, un peu plus tard contributes a temporal relation of succession between the events.
But apart from this contribution, the relation between a4 and a17 does not match the semantic effects of Narration.
This leads us to claim that with the temporal indication contributed by un peu plus tard, the relation of Narration does not hold.
Now, (7-c) being a coherent discourse, what discourse relation holds?
We hypothesize that it should be a relation that only supports temporal precedence, that could be viewed as a kind of weak Narration.
To account for this, we propose to view Narration as a gradual relation that normally occurs under its strong form, and always at least under its weak form: A 13 Narrationa28a38a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a59a6 Strong-Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 A 14 Narrationa28a38a4a81a39a72a17a42a32a48a5 Weak-Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a43a32 This change implies updating the axioms given in the previous sections: Narration has to be substituted by Strong-Narration in the axioms (A2), (A3), (A5) and (A12).
In (A4), the general Narration relation remains.
Weak-Narration has no requirement on topic nor does it have the “no gap constraint”.
The only semantic effects of WeakNarration is temporal precedence: A 15 Weak-Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a43a32a42a5a124a18 a19a125a73 a18a27a34 With such limited semantic effects, un peu plus tard is obviously compatible with WeakNarration.
It must be noted though, that here we do not claim that adverbials of this kind should be considered as rhetorical markers of this relation.
Unlike puis, syntactically they do not behave as conjuncts.
Moreover, their main semantic contribution materializes compositionally within the constituent itself, specifying not only temporal succession between two temporal referents, but also the length of the temporal interval between these referents.
Let us now come back to example (6) in the light of these considerations on the role of un peu plus tard.
In both (6-a) and (6-b), a StrongNarration relation will be inferred, because Occasion holds and (A5) is triggered for (6-a), by (A12) for (6-b).
Unlike for example (5) just analysed, Occasion holds in both cases, and thus we can assume it is easy to buid a common topic to both sentences.
The example in (6-c) is perfectly all right, but bears a slightly different interpretation: here the strong link between the two events is lost.
It is indeed quite possible to introduce an intervening event, as (9-c) shows, while this is not possible for the two other examples, viz.
(9-a) and (9-b): (9) a.
Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Elle alla la poster au village voisin.
*Entretemps, elle l’avait retouchée à plusieurs reprises.
(Meanwhile she had altered it several times.) b.
Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Puis elle alla la poster au village voisin.
*Entretemps, elle l’avait retouchée à plusieurs reprises.
c. Marie écrivit une longue lettre à son cousin.
Un peu plus tard, elle alla la poster au village voisin.
Entretemps, elle l’avait retouchée à plusieurs reprises.
Therefore, un peu plus tard blocks StrongNarration not only when it could have been inferred by default, but also when Occasion holds.
In order to account for this blocking, we introduce the following axioms: A 16 a28a62a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a82 a83 a107 un peu plus tarda112a114a17a42a32 a6 a90 Strong-Narrationa28a30a4a81a39a72a17a42a32 A 17 a28a62a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a82 a83 Occasiona28a30a4a40a39a41a17a43a32 a83 a107 un peu plus tarda112a126a17a42a32a59a6a88a90 Strong-Narrationa28a30a4a40a39a41a17a42a32 (A16) will block the inference of StrongNarration in absence of other relations (i.e., a Strong-Narration that could have been inferred with (A4) and (A13)).
(A17) is needed as well for the cases in which Occasion holds.
Applying the Penguin Principle, it circumvents a Nixon Diamond schema between (A5) and (A16) that precludes the inference of any relation at all9.
Let us come back again to (6) to add that the perception of difference between (6-a) and (6-b) on the one hand, and (6-c) on the other hand, is certainly also due to a particularity of un peu plus tard concerning plans.
As a matter of fact, it seems that the presence of un peu plus tard has the effect of blocking the interpretation that events a18a31a19 and a18a27a34 are part of a plan (a plan in which a18 a19 is intended to lead to a18a35a34 ).
The difference in terms of planning is more obvious on examples like (10): (10) Marie rejoignit son ami, puis lui glissa à l’oreille qu’elle voulait partir.
(Marie rejoined her friend, then she dropped in his ear that she wanted to leave.) This example lends itself to an interpretation in which Marie reaches her friend in order to tell him something.
But the plan interpretation seems to be suspended when puis is replaced with un peu plus tard10: (11) Marie rejoignit son ami ; un peu plus tard, elle lui glissa à l’oreille qu’elle voulait partir.
It seems to us that the difference in behaviour evidenced here should be explained once more at the rhetorical level.
It would probably require in some contexts the use of a relation of Enablement (Sandström, 1993), allowed by puis, and again, blocked by un peu plus tard.
We leave this for further research since how exactly Enablement is to be accounted for in SDRT has not yet been investigated in the literature.
4.2 Puis
and un peu plus tard with Result Let us now come back to (4).
We want to account for the different interpretations of (4-a) and (4-c) on the one hand, and of (4-b) on the other hand.
Assuming that there is most probably some piece of shared knowledge on chemicals implying that 9From a8a13a9a14a11, a127 a9 a16 a11, a8 a58 a127, a8 and a127, a11 (and not a16 a11 ) is inferred (Penguin principle).
From a8a10a9a128a11, a127 a9 a16 a11, a8 and a127, if a8 and a127 are logically independent, CE cannot conclude a11 nor a16 a11 (Nixon Diamond).
10Or, for that matter, another adverbial indicating an even shorter temporal separation like immédiatement après D-Permissible-Cause holds between the two constituents representing the two clauses, SDRT nonmonotonically concludes Result with (A11).
As was shown in (Bras et al., 2001), puis blocks the non-monotonic inference to Result.
Notice that (4-b) remains neutral regarding the truth value of a129a131a130a37a132 a24a20a18a37a28a38a18 a19 a39a52a18a27a34a37a32 and it could still be that the two events described are actually causally connected.
Simply, the narrator doesn’t commit himself.
Puis directly blocks the rhetorical relation of Result, and not the factual relation of Cause.
Hence we need as an additional axiom: A 18 a28a62a80 a3 a39a52a4a40a39a41a17a42a82a121a83a122a107 puisa112a126a17a42a32a48a5a133a90 Resulta28a30a4a81a39a72a17a42a32 For its part, un peu plus tard doesn’t seem to directly interfere with the Result relation.
In (4-c) we get the reading of a mere “delayed” result, which the theory accounts for by inferring Result just like for (4-a).
However, in some contexts, un peu plus tard also appears to block Result: (12) a.
Max trébucha.
Il tomba et se cassa la jambe.
(Max stumbled.
He fell and broke his leg.) b.
Max trébucha.
Puis il tomba et se cassa la jambe.
c. Max trébucha.
Un peu plus tard, il tomba et se cassa la jambe.
In both (12-b) and (12-c), the causal reading of (12-a) is lost.
The preferred reading is not that the narrator doesn’t want to commit himself regarding the causal connection, but rather that he is describing two unrelated, temporally separated, occasions on which Max lost his balance.
A Cause relation between two events may entail a more precise temporal relation than temporal succession.
Shared knowledge may stipulate that some kinds of events causally related occur in a single flow, without any temporal gap at all between them.
This stronger temporal relation corresponds to the a76a78a77 relation, and is clearly incompatible with any indication that there exists a (non-null) temporal interval between the two events.
In (12-a), it seems indeed that as soon as the stumbling ends, the falling has started.
With this piece of knowledge, both puis and un peu plus tard prevent a129a134a130a86a132 a24a31a18a37a28a30a18 a19 a39a52a18a27a34a37a32 to hold, since they both specify the existence of a temporal interval between a18 a19 and a18a35a34 . We here again see the usefulness of theoretically separating the rhetorical level of the discourse relations from the level of the description of the facts, to which the temporal relations belong.
5 Conclusion
We wanted to compare two connectives and the way they affect Temporal Structure and Discourse Structure.
From the temporal point of view, we have observed that both puis and un peu plus tard express temporal succession, but that puis has a stronger temporal semantics contents (a18 a19a69a76 a77 a28 posta28a30a18 a19 a32a40a75 prea28a30a18a35a34a86a32a41a32 a76a78a77 a18a35a34 ).
From the Discourse Structure point of view, we have shown that puis is a marker of Strong-Narration, involving the notion of telling the “same story” (topic), whereas un peu plus tard blocks Strong-Narration and licences Weak-Narration, involving no more semantic effects than temporal succession.
In addition, puis blocks Result, while un peu plus tard doesn’t.
We believe it particularly interesting to notice that a priori temporally equivalent adverbials may have so different effects on Discourse Structure.
On the one hand, puis has an important role at the rhetorical level, which is no surprise given its conjunct character.
On the other hand, un peu plus tard is not the purely temporal adverbial that one could expect, since it is capable of blocking some discourse relations, among which Strong-Narration, the usual case of Narration.
And this is certainly not an obvious fact for an adverbial primarily indicating temporal succession.
