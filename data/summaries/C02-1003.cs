The optimal bilingual parsing tree for a given sentence-pair can be computed using dynamic programming (DP) algorithm(Wu 1997).

b ij is the translation probability that source word u i translates into target word v j . b ij can be obtained using a statistical word-translation model (Melamed 2000) or word alignment(Lü 2001a).

The English POS tag and phrase tag set are the same as those of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus 1993) and the Chinse POS tag set please refer to the web site: http://mtlab.hit.edu.cn.

bilingual language model – ITG Wu (1997) has proposed a bilingual language model called Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG), which can be used to parse bilingual sentence pairs simultaneously.

parsing supervised bilingual bracketing Because of the difficulty in finding a suitable bilingual syntactic grammar for Chinese and English, a practical ITG is the generic Bracketing Inversion Transduction Grammar (BTG)(Wu 1995).

The availability of large tagged and syntactically bracketed corpora, such as Penn Tree bank, makes it possible to extract syntactic structure and grammar rules automatically (Marcus 1993).

Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English, and many powerful models have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins 1997).
P97-1003
The operator [ ] performs the usual concatenation, so that C -> [A B] yields the string-pair (C 1, C 2 ), where C 1 =A 1 B 1 and C 2 =A 2 B 2 . On the other hand, the operator <> performs the straight concatenation for language 1 but the reversing concatenation for language 2, so that C -> <A B> yields C 1 =A 1 B 1, but C 2 =B 2 A 2 . The inverted concatenation operator permits the extra flexibility needed to accommodate many kinds of word-order variation between source and target languages (Wu 1995).
P95-1033
Because the expressiveness characteristics of ITG naturally constrain the space of possible matching in a highly appropriate fashion, BTG achieves encouraging results for bilingual bracketing using a word-translation lexicon alone (Wu 1997).
