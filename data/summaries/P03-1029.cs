6(Sudo et al., 2001) required the root node of the chain to be a verbal predicate, but we have relaxed that constraint for our experiments.

In this section, we review two of the previous models in detail, namely the Predicate-Argument model (Yangarber et al., 2000) and the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001).

(e.g., “One person was killed as the result of a bomb explosion.”) Predicate-Argument model The PredicateArgument model is based on a direct syntactic relation between a predicate and its arguments1 (Yangarber et al., 2000).

As the field of IE has developed, the focus of study has moved towards automatic knowledge acquisition for information extraction, including domain-specific lexicons (Riloff, 1993; Riloff and Jones, 1999) and extraction patterns (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000; Sudo et al., 2001).

The compared models are the direct predicate-argument model (PA)9, and the Chain model (CH) in (Sudo et al., 2001).

The model of our previous work (Sudo et al., 2001) was based on the paths from predicate nodes in dependency trees.

3Yangarber refers this as a noun phrase pattern in (Yangarber et al., 2000).

The association of NE classes and slots in the template is made automatically; Person, Organization, Post (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, CORG, C-POST (NE-classes), respectively, in the Succession scenario, and Suspect, Arresting Agency, Charge (slots) correspond to C-PERSON, C-ORG, C-OFFENCE (NE-classes), respectively, in the Ar9This is a restricted version of (Yangarber et al., 2000) constrained to have a single place-holder for each pattern, while (Yangarber et al., 2000) allowed more than one place-holder.

Most IE systems have hard-coded inference rules, such Chain model Our previous work, the Chain model (Sudo et al., 2001)5 attempts to remedy the limitations of the Predicate-Argument model.

In the prior work on extraction pattern acquisition, the representation model of the patterns was based on a fixed set of pattern templates (Riloff, 1996), or predicate-argument relations, such as subject-verb, and object-verb (Yangarber et al., 2000).
