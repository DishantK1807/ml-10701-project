We now assume that 12 llc is normally distributed, following Gale & Church (1991), and transform it into a new gaussian variable of standard form (i.e., with mean 0 and variance 1) by appropriate normalization: 12 11 c (4) x/~l tr 2 This is the quantity that we choose to define as 6(/1,12).

The aligned results using this model were evaluated by hand for the entire contents of a ran4The difference is also partly due to the fact that Gale & Church (1991) plot paragraph lengths instead of sentence lengths.

Our report concerns three related topics: (1) progress on the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus; (2) experiments addressing the applicability of Gale ~ Church's (1991) lengthbased statistical method to the task of alignment involving a non-Indo-European language; and (3) an improved statistical method that also incorporates domain-specific lexical cues.

The subsequent sections report experiments addressing the applicability of a suitably modified version of Gale & Church's (1991) length-based statistical method to the task of aligning English with Chinese.

Although it has been suggested that lengthbased methods are language-independent (Gale & Church 1991; Brown et al.1991), they may in fact rely to some extent on length correlations arising from the historical relationships of the languages being aligned.

These probabilities are taken directly from Gale & Church (1991); slightly improved performance might be obtained by estimating these probabilities from our corpus.

Gale & Church's (1991) length-based alignment method is based on the model that each English character in L1 is responsible for generating some number of characters in L2.

1989; Gale & Church 1991; Brown et al.1991; Chen 1993), and coarser approaches when sentences are difficult to identify have also been advanced (Church 1993; Dagan e~ al.

Again, the distribution deviates from a gaussian distribution substantially more than Gale & Church (1991) report for French/German/English.

In fact this plot displays substantially greater scatter than the English-French data of Gale & Church (1991).
P91-1023
Note that there are other length-based alignment methods 81 that measure length in number of words instead of characters (Brown et al.1991). However, since Chinese text consists of an unsegmented character stream without marked word boundaries, it would not be possible to count the number of words in a sentence without first parsing it.

Analogously to the bilingual texts of the Canadian Hansard (Gale & Church 1991), LegCo transcripts are kept in full translation in both English 1Some newer methods are also intended to be applied to non-Indo-European languages in the future (Fung $z Church 1994).
C94-2178 P91-1023
In summary, we have found that the statistical correlation of sentence lengths has a far greater variance for our English-Chinese materials than with the Indo-European materials used by Gale & Church (1991).
