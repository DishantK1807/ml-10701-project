To enable computer-based analysis of Chinese sentences in natural language texts we have developed a semantic framework, taking into account concepts used in the Berkeley FrameNet Project (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe 1998; Fillmore & Baker 2001) and the Penn Chinese Tree Bank (Nianwen Xue; Fei Xia et al.2000). The FrameNet Project, as a computational project, is creating a lexical resource for English, based on the principle of semantic frames.
