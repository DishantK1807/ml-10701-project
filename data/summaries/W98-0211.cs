The "derivation checkers" or tree editors of (Calder, 1993) and (Paroubek et al, 1992) can be viewed as a mode in which each action by a user is verified for consistency with respect to a grammar.

One response, as seen in the tree editors described by (Paroubek et al, 1992) and by (Calder, 1993) and in the feature structure editor designed by (Kieffer and Fettig, 1995), is to fix a relatively small amount of graphical devices and restrict the operations defined over, and potential combinations of, those devices (perhaps to the extent that only operations which don't violate consistency with respect to a particular grammar are allowed).
