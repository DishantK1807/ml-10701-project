Selectional preferences can be used for WSD in combination with other knowledge sources (Stevenson and Wilks 2001), but there is a need to ascertain when they work well so that they can be utilized to their full advantage.

The tagger (Elworthy 1994) uses a bigram hidden Markov model augmented with a statistical unknown word guesser.

The set of ncsinΓ are selected from all the possibilities in the hyponym hierarchy according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle (Rissanen 1978) as used by Li and Abe (1995, 1998).

The distribution of senses was also perhaps more skewed for Resnik’s test set, since the first sense heuristic was 82.8% (Abney and Light 1999), whereas it was 53.6% for the polysemous direct objects in the all-words task.

These results were obtained for three systems (Resnik 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000) on a training and test data set constructed by Resnik containing nouns occurring as direct objects of 100 verbs that select strongly for their objects.

Although a modest amount of sense-tagged data is available for English (Miller et al.1993, Ng and Lee 1996), for other languages with minimal sense-tagged resources, the heuristic is not applicable.
H93-1061 P96-1006
There has been some work looking at other slots (Resnik 1997), and on using nominal arguments as disambiguators for verbs (Federici, Montemagni, and Pirrelli 1999; Agirre and Martinez 2001), but the problem of coverage remains.

The parser uses a wide-coverage unification-based shallow grammar of English POS tags and punctuation (Briscoe and Carroll 1995) and performs disambiguation using a context-sensitive probabilistic model (Briscoe and Carroll 1993), recovering from extra-grammaticality by returning partial parses.

The preference models are modifications of the tree cut models (TCMs) originally proposed by Li and Abe (1995, 1998).

We are also investigating the disambiguation of verb senses in running text before subcategorization information for the verbs is acquired, in order to produce a subcategorization lexicon specific to sense (Preiss and Korhonen 2002).
W02-0815
One problem is coverage: Most previous work has focused on acquiring selectional preferences for verbs and applying them to disambiguate nouns occurring at subject and direct object slots (Ribas 1995; McCarthy 1997; Abney and Light 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson 2000; Stevenson and Wilks 2001).
