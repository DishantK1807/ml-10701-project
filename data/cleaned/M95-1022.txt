James, chairman and chief executive officer of McCann-Erickson, and John J . Dooner Jr ., the agency's president and chief operating officer, is quit e telling: Mr. James enjoys sailboating, while Mr . Dooner owns a powerboat . </p> <p> Now, Mr. James is preparing to sail into the sunset, and Mr. Dooner is poised to rev up the engines to guide Interpublic Group' s McCann-Erickson into the 21st century . Yesterday, McCann made official what had been widely anticipated : Mr . James, 57 years old, is stepping down as chief executive officer on July 1 and wil l retire as chairman at the end of the year . He will be succeeded by Mr . Dooner, 45 . </p> <p> It promises to be a smooth process, which is unusual given th e volatile atmosphere of the advertising business . But Mr. Dooner has a big challenge that will be his top priority . "I'm going to focus on strengthening the creative work," he says . "There is room to grow.
2:12	We can make further improvements in terms of the perception of our creative work . "</p> <p> Even Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber, who believe s McCann is filled with "vitality" and is in "great shape," says tha t from a creative standpoint, "You wouldn't pay to see their reel" of commercials . </p> <p> While McCann's world-wide billings rose 12% to $6 .4 billion last 1 . This article reprinted with permission from Dow Jones . 283 year from $5 .7 billion in 1992, the agency still is dogged by the loss of the key creative assignment for the prestigious Coca-Col a Classic account . "I would be less than honest to say I'm no t disappointed not to be able to claim creative leadership for Coke, " Mr. Dooner says . </p> <p> McCann still handles promotions and media buying for Coke . But the bragging rights to Coke's ubiquitous advertising belongs t o Creative Artists Agency, the big Hollywood talent agency . "We are striving to have a strong renewed creative partnership wit h Coca-Cola," Mr. Dooner says . However, odds of that happening are slim since word from Coke headquarters in Atlanta is that CAA an d other ad agencies, such as Fallon McElligott, will continue t o handle Coke advertising . </p> <p> Mr. Dooner, who recently lost 60 pounds over three-and-a-hal f months, says now that he has "reinvented" himself, he wants to do the same for the agency.
3:12	For Mr . Dooner, it means maintaining his running and exercise schedule, and for the agency, it means developing more global campaigns that nonetheless reflect loca l cultures . One McCann account, "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter," a butter substitute, is in 11 countries, for example . </p> <p> McCann has initiated a new so-called global collaborative system, composed of world-wide account directors paired with creativ e partners . In addition, Peter Kim was hired from WPP Group's J . Walter Thompson last September as vice chairman, chief strategy officer, world-wide . </p> <p> Mr . Dooner doesn't see a creative malaise permeating the agency . He points to several campaigns with pride, including the Taster' s Choice commercials that are like a running soap opera.
4:12	"It's a $19 million campaign with the recognition of a $200 million campaign, " he says of the commercials that feature a couple that must hold a record for the length of time dating before kissing . </p> <p> Even so, Mr . Dooner is on the prowl for more creative talent and is interested in acquiring a hot agency.
5:12	He says he would like to finalize an acquisition "yesterday . I'm not known for patience . " </p> <p> Mr . Dooner met with Martin Puris, president and chief executive officer of Ammirati & Puris, about McCann's acquiring the agenc y with billings of $400 million, but nothing has materialized . "There is no question," says Mr . Dooner, "that we are looking for quality acquisitions and Ammirati & Puris is a quality operation . There are some people and entire agencies that I would love to see be part o f the McCann family ".
6:12	Mr . Dooner declines to identify possible acquisitions . 284 </p> <p> Mr . Dooner is just gearing up for the headaches of running one o f the largest world-wide agencies .
7:12	(There are no immediate plans to replace Mr . Dooner as president; Mr . James operated as chairman, chief executive officer and president for a period of time ).
8:12	Mr . James is filled with thoughts of enjoying his three hobbies : sailing, skiing and hunting . </p> <p> Asked why he would choose to voluntarily exit while he still i s so young, Mr . James says it is time to be a tad selfish about how h e spends his days . Mr . James, who has a reputation as an extraordinarily tough taskmaster, says that because he had a great time" in advertising," he doesn't want to "talk about the disappointments ".
9:12	In fact, when he is asked his opinion of the new batch of Coke ads from CAA, Mr . James places his hands over hi s mouth.
10:12	He shrugs . He doesn't utter a word . He has, he says, fond memories of working with Coke executives . "Coke has given us great highs," says Mr . James, sitting in his plush office, filled with photographs of sailing as well as huge models of, among othe r things, a Dutch tugboat . </p> <p> He says he feels a "great sense of accomplishment ".
11:12	In 36 countries, McCann is ranked in the top three ; in 75 countries, it i s in the top 10 . </p> <p> Soon, Mr. James will be able to compete in as many sailing race s as he chooses . And concentrate on his duties as rear commodore a t the New York Yacht Club . </p> <p> Maybe he'll even leave something from his office for Mr . Dooner . Perhaps a framed page from the New York Times, dated Dec . 8, 1987, showing a year-end chart of the stock market crash earlier that year . Mr . James says he framed it and kept it by his desk as a "personal reminder . It can all be gone like that .
