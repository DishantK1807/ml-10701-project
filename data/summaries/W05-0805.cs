Threeand five-dimensional EM-based clustering has been applied to monolingual phonological data (M¨uller et al., 2000) and two-dimensional clustering to syntax (Rooth et al., 1999).
P99-1014
Kondrak (2000) presents an algorithm to align phonetic sequences by computing the similarities of these words.

Covington. 1996.
J96-4002
Nerbonne and Heeringa (1997) use phonetic transcriptions to measure the phonetic distance between different dialects.
W97-1102
Covington (1996), for instance, suggests different algorithms to align the phonetic representation of words of historical languages.

Cahill and Tiberius (2002) is based on mere counts of phoneme correspondences; Kondrak (2003) generates Algonquian phoneme correspondences which are possible according to his translation models; Kondrak (2004) measures if two words are possible cognates; and Knight and Graehl (1998) focus on the back-transliteration of Japanese words to English.

Another interesting generative model can be found in Knight and Graehl (1998).
J98-4003
Cahill and Tiberius (2002) use a manually compiled cognate list of Dutch, English and German cognates and extract crosslinguistic phoneme correspondences.
