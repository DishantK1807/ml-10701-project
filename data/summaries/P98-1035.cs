The workings of the parser module are similar to those of Spatter (Jelinek et al., 1994).

The equivalence classification of the WkTk word-parse we used for the parser model (4) was the same as the one used in (Collins, 1996): p (pk / Wk Tk ) = p (pk / ho, h-x) It is worth noting that if the binary branching structure developed by the parser were always rightbranching and we mapped the POStag and nonterminal label vocabularies to a single type then our model would be equivalent to a trigram language model.

Statistically speaking, we were satisfied with the output of an enhanced version of the procedure described in (Collins, 1996) -also known under the name "Magerman & Black Headword Percolation Rules".
