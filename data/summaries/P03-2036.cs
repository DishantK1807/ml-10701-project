We hereafter refer to PB and TNT for the C++ implementations of the former and a valiant1 of the latter, respectively.2 We first acquired LTAGs by a method proposed in Miyao et al.(2003) from Sections 2-21 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and its subsets.3 We then converted them into strongly equivalent HPSG-style grammars using the grammar conversion described in Section 2.1.

However, CFGPB (also a CFG produced by the other work (Harbusch, 1990)) cannot avoid generating invalid parse trees that connect two lo5This means that the extracted LTAGs should be compatible with CFG and were completely converted to CFGs by TNT.

We performed a comparison between the existing CFG filtering techniques for LTAG (Poller and Becker, 1998) and HPSG (Torisawa et al., 2000), using strongly equivalent grammars obtained by converting LTAGs extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) into HPSG-style.

We will also conduct experiments on trade-offs between the degree of CF approximation and the size of approximated CFGs as in Maxwell III and Kaplan (1993).

Along with the independent development of parsing techniques for individual grammar formalisms, some of them have been adapted to other formalisms (Schabes et al., 1988; van Noord, 1994; Yoshida et al., 1999; Torisawa et al., 2000).

In this paper, we compare CFG filtering techniques for LTAG (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998) and HPSG (Torisawa et al., 2000; Kiefer and Krieger, 2000), following an approach to parsing comparison among different grammar formalisms (Yoshinaga et al., 2001).

approximation of LTAG In CFG filtering techniques for LTAG (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998), every branching of elementary trees in a given grammar is extracted as a CFG rule as shown in Figure 1.

In this section, we introduce a grammar conversion (Yoshinaga and Miyao, 2001) and CFG filtering (Harbusch, 1990; Poller and Becker, 1998; Torisawa et al., 2000; Kiefer and Krieger, 2000).
P90-1036
Various parsing techniques have been developed for lexicalized grammars such as Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al., 1988), and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994).
