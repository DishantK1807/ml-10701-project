Some variants of Right Association (also characterized as Late Closure or Low Attachment) which have Dean proposed are Final Arguments (Ford et al.1982) and Shifting Preference (Shieber 1983); the former is roughly Late Closure restricted to the last obligatory constituent and any following optional constituents of verb phrases, while the latter is Late Closure within the context of an LR(1) shiftreduce parser.

(My assumption is that an unambiguous meaning representation of a phrase is computed on the basis of its initial logical form by contextdependent pragmatic processes; see Schubert & Pelletier 1982).

Schubert & Pelletier 1982 briefly described a full-paths parser which chains upward from the current word to current "expectations" by "left-corner stack-ups" Of rules.

Ford et al's (1982) variant is Invoked Attachment, and Shieber's (1983) variant is Maximal Reduction; roughly speaking, the former amounts to early closure of no___nn-final constituents, while the latter chooses the longest reduction among those possible reductions whose initial constituent is "strongest" (e.g., reducing V NP PP to VP is preferred to reducing NP PP to PP).
P83-1017
Shieber's (1983) shift-reduce parser is welldefined.
