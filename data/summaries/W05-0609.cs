At a higher level, (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) disambiguated personal names by clustering people’s home pages using a TFIDF similarity, and several other researchers have applied clustering at the same level in the context of the entity identification problem (Bilenko et al., 2003; McCallum and Wellner, 2003; Li et al., 2004).

For example (Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004) compare similarity metrics such as the Cosine, Manhattan and Euclidean distances, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and Jaccard’s Coefficient, that could be applied in general clustering tasks, on the task of measuring distributional similarity.

A few works (Xing et al., 2002; Bar-Hillel et al., 2003; Schultz and Joachims, 2004; Mochihashi et al., 2004) outside the NLP domain have also pursued this general direction, and some have tried to learn the metric with limited amount of supervision, no supervision or by incorporating other information sources such as constraints on the class memberships of the data elements.

However, in many cases, supervision is used at the application level when determining an appropriate distance metric (e.g., (Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004; Bilenko et al., 2003) and more).

Similarly, approaches to coreference resolution (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999) use clustering to identify groups of references to the same entity.

A key example is that of class-based language models (Brown et al., 1992; Dagan et al., 1999) where clustering approaches are used in order to partition words, determined to be similar, into sets.

A large number of different metrics and algorithms have been experimented with these problems (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1997; Weeds et al., 2004).
