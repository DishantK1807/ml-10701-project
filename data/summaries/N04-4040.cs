Recent work on detecting edits for use in parsing of speech transcripts (Core and Schubert, 1999), (Charniak and Johnson, 2001) has shown an improvement in the parser error rate by modeling disfluencies.
N01-1016
Techniques using parse trees to identify disfluencies have shown success in the past (Hindle, 1983).
P83-1019
Lexical modeling of disfluencies with only minimal acoustic cues has been shown to be successful in the past using strongly statistical techniques (Heeman and Allen, 1999).
J99-4003
We use a Transformation-Based Learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995) algorithm to induce rules from the training data.
J95-4004
2We use a POS tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) trained on switchboard data with the additional tags of FP (filled pause) and FRAG (word fragment).
