Others allow the generation of phrase-level alignments, such as (Och et al., 1999), (Marcu and Wong, 2002) or (Zhang, Vogel, Waibel, 2003).

(Callison-Burch, Bannard and Scroeder, 2005) used them (in a way similar to us) to compute and store phrase translation probabilities over very large corpora.

The problem, which was described in (Melamed, 1997) in a word-to-word alignment context, is as follows: if e 1 is the translation of f 1 and f 2 has a strong monolingual association with f 1, e 1 and f 2 will also have a strong correlation.

(Xu, Zens and Ney,2004) have overcome part of these objections by using multiple segmentations of a Chinese sentence and letting a SMT system choose the best one, as well as creating a segmentation lexicon dictionary by considering every Chinese character to be a word in itself and then creating a phrase alignment.
