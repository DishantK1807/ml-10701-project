In addition, our system exploits the heuristic introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out very unlikely constituents.
W04-3212
It improves the basic Winnow multiplicative update rule with a regularization term, which has the effect of trying to separate the data with a large margin separator (Grove and Roth, 2001; Hang et al., 2002) and voted (averaged) weight vector (Freund and Schapire, 1999).
C02-1151
We use the inference process introduced by (Punyakanok et al., 2004).
C04-1197
The rules of the NEG and MOD features are used in a baseline SRL system developed by Erik Tjong Kim Sang (Carreras and M`arquez, 2004).
W04-2412
and Evaluation The learning algorithm used is a variation of the Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth, 1998; Roth and Yih, 2002), a multi-class classifier that is tailored for large scale learning tasks.
C02-1151
This is the feature introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004).
