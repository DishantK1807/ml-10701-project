Miyazaki et al.(2002) proposed a method combining Nakano et al.â€™s (1999) method and n-best recognition hypotheses, and reported improvement in discourse understanding accuracy.

There are approaches that propose statistically estimating the dialogue act type from several previous dialogue act types using N-gram probability (Nagata and Morimoto, 1994; Reithinger and Maier, 1995).
P95-1016
Work Nakano et al.(1999) proposed a method that holds multiple dialogue states ordered by priority to deal with the problem that some utterances convey meaning over several speech intervals and that the understanding result cannot be determined at each interval end.

Information Probability of a dialogue act type sequence Based on the same idea as Nagata and Morimoto (1994) and Reithinger and Maier (1995), we use the probability of a dialogue act type sequence, namely, the N-gram probability of dialogue act types.
P95-1016
although there are some recent attempts to apply them to spoken dialogue systems as well (Allen et al., 2001; Rich et al., 2001); however, considering the current performance of speech recognizers and the limitations in task domains, we believe framebased discourse understanding and dialogue management are sufficient (Chu-Carroll, 2000; Seneff, 2002; Bobrow et al., 1977).
