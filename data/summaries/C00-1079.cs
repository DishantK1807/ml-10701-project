In previous researches, some tended to simplify the problem by treating only special types of MWTUs, while others had some recognition errors and took too much recognition time because they did not restrict the recognition scope (D.Santos,1990; Yoon Sung Hee,1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994; Seen-He Kim, 1997).

Although some researches (D.Santos,1990; Linden E.,1990; Yoon Sung Hoe, 1992; Ha Gyu Lee, 1994; D.Arnold,1994) employ the term "idiom" for these units, we prefer MWTU (Multi-Word Translation Unit) because it is a more general and broader term for MT environment.
