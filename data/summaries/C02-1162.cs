The only previous work that we are aware of which uses unrelated corpora is that of Rapp (1995), a study on word co-occurrence statistics in unrelated German and English corpora.
P95-1050
The method used in this paper is an extension of work from Fung and Lo (1998).
P98-1069
The numerous notable approaches can usually be divided into those which utilize the hierarchical information from an ontology, such as Resnik (1995) and Agirre and Martinez (2002); and those which simply use word distribution information from a large corpus, such as Lin (1998) and Lee (1999).
P98-2127 P99-1004
The difference in the co-occurrence patterns between the two halves of the corpora are best illustrated by a dotplot (Church, 1993).
P93-1001
Finally, the English half of the corpus was part-of-speech tagged with fnTBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001), the fast adaptation of Brillâ€™s transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1995).

There has also been a lot of work involving bilingual corpora, including the IBM Candide project (Brown et al., 1990), which used statistical data to align words in sentence pairs from parallel corpora in an unsupervised fashion through the EM algorithm; Church (1993) used character frequencies to align words in a parallel corpus; Smadja et al.(1996) used cooccurrence functions to extract phrasal collocations for translation, and Melamed (1997) identified non-compositional compounds by comparing the objective functions of a translation model with and without NCCs.
