Because the data is sparse, empirical methods that train on word occurrences alone (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) have been supplanted by algorithms that generalize one or both of the nouns according to classmembership measures (Resnik, 1993; Resnik and Hearst, 1993; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Li and Abe, 1998), but the statistics are computed for the particular preposition and verb.

Brill and Resnik (1994) use Brill’s transformation-based algorithm along with simple counts within a lexical hierarchy in order to generalize over individual words.

We also plan to compare the results to the tree cut algorithm reported in (Li and Abe, 1998), which allows diﬀerent levels to be identiﬁed for diﬀerent subtrees.

Resnik (1993; 1995) use classes in Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998) and a measure of conceptual association to generalize over the nouns.

Severalresearchers have tackled the syntactic analysis (Lauer, 1995; Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Liberman and Sproat, 1992), usually using a variation of the idea of ﬁnding the subconstituents elsewhere in the corpus and using those to predict how the larger compounds are structured.

Vanderwende (1994) uses a sophisticated system to extract semantic information automatically from an on-line dictionary, and then manipulates a set of hand-written rules with handassigned weights to create an interpretation.

The Uniﬁed Medical Language System (UMLS) is a biomedical lexical resource produced and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (Humphreys et al., 1998).

Li and Abe (1998) use a minimum description length-based algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal tree cut over WordNet for each classiﬁcation problem, ﬁnding improvements over both lexical association (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) and conceptual association, and equaling the transformation-based results.
