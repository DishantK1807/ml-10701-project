(Broeder and Wittenburg, 2001) is also proposing a scheme for connecting the descriptions of tools and resources.

From the side of the Language Engineering there are initiatives for describing standards and (Calzolari et al., 2001) present such an initiative, the ISLE project, which is the continuation of the EAGLES initiative.

Therefore the classification can be enriched by the products submitted 1 As (Bird and Simons, 2001) names it.
W01-1506
(Broeder and Wittenburg, 2001) give a good overview of metadata initiatives for Language Resources and propose a contrastive description of OLAC and IMDI, where the main distinction can be seen in the top-down versus bottom-up approach.
W01-1508
But (Erjavec and V´aradi, 2001) are not proposing a discussion on how to integrate in the description of the tools the particular relation to a specific corpus.
W01-1503
While (Calzolari et al., 2001) concentrate on the description of the task of the ISLE computational lexicon working group and address the topic of metadata for encoding multilingual lexical resources, (Broeder and Wittenburg, 2001) presents the work of the ISLE Metadata initiative (IMDI), which is directly relevant for the topic addressed here.
W01-1507 W01-1508
Thus addressing also one point mentioned in (Bird and Simons, 2001), where 3 main classes of providers are described: DATA, TOOLS and ADVICE providers.
W01-1506
And this need was getting even more urgent after the Registry Team was asked for permission of harvesting the ACL repository for the purpose of creating a prototype service provider in the context of an Open Archive Initiative for Language Resources, which is called OLAC (Open Language Archives Community) and described in (Bird and Simons, 2001).
W01-1506
for Tools Repositories (Erjavec and V´aradi, 2001) are proposing a very interesting description of the TELRI-II concerted action for a tool catalogue specialized for corpus processing tools.
W01-1503
(Lavelli et al., 2001) show the use of metadata description for tools in the context of an infrastructure for NLP application development.
