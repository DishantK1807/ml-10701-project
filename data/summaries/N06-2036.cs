We chose this WSD algorithm as it provides some of the best published results to date, as the comparison with top performing WSD systems in Senseval3 presented in Table 1 shows---see http://www.senseval.org and Snyder & Palmer (2004) for terms of reference on Senseval3.

Interestingly enough, word subject domains have been widely used to improve the performance of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithms (Wilks and Stevenson 1998, Magnini et al.2001; Gliozzo et al.2004). However, comparatively little effort has been devoted so far to the word domain disambiguation itself.

Following Dang & Palmer (2005) and Kohomban & Lee (2005), Sanfilippo et al.(2006) use contextual, syntactic and semantic information to inform our verb class disambiguation system.

The extension consisted in extending the training data set so as to include a selection of WordNet examples (full sentences containing a main verb) and the Open Mind Word Expert corpus (Chklovski and Mihalcea 2002).

The most notable exceptions are the work of Magnini and Strapparava (2000) and Suarez & Palomar (2002).

143 obtain further gains in WSD accuracy, following Wilks and Stevenson (1998), Magnini et al.(2001) and Gliozzo et al.(2004). A more accurate WSD model will in turn yield yet better WDD results, as demonstrated in this paper.

The algorithm employs the OpenNLP MaxEnt implementation of the maximum entropy classification algorithm (Berger et al.1996) to develop word sense recognition signatures for each lemma which predicts the most likely sense for the lemma according to the context in which the lemma occurs.

For example, Sanfilippo (1998) describes a summarization system where subject domains provide users with useful conceptual parameters to tailor summary requests to a userâ€™s interest.
