While manual classification of large numbers of words has proved difficult and time-consuming, recent research shows that it is possible to automatically induce lexical classes from corpus data with promising accuracy (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003).

Lexical classes which capture the close relation between the syntax and semantics of verbs have attracted considerable interest in NLP (Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000).

We extended the system of Korhonen et al.(2003) with additional clustering techniques (introduced in sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.4) and used it to obtain the classification for the biomedical domain.

In this paper, we extend an existing approach to lexical classification (Korhonen et al., 2003) and apply it (without any domain specific tuning) to the domain of biomedicine.

Korhonen et al.(2003) observed the opposite with general language data.

The closest possible comparison point is (Korhonen et al., 2003) which reported 50-59% mPUR and 15-19% APP on using IB to assign 110 polysemous (general language) verbs into 34 classes.

We extract them from corpus data using the comprehensive subcategorization acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) (Korhonen, 2002).

Lexical verb classes have been used to support various (multilingual) tasks, such as computational lexicography, language generation, machine translation, word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, and subcategorization acquisition (Dorr, 1997; Prescher et al., 2000; Korhonen, 2002).
