This approach was used in a named entity recognition system (Mikheev et al., 1998) where it proved to be one of the key factors in the system achieving a nearly human performance in the 7th Message Understanding Conference (MUC'7) evaluation (Chinchor, 1998).

To evaluate the performance of part-of-speech taggers on the proper-noun identification task we ran an HMM trigram tagger (Mikheev, 1997) and the Brill tagger (Brill,.1995) on our corpus.

This is a difficult case even for sentence boundary disambiguation systerns ((Mikheev, 1998), (Palmer&Hearst, 1997) and (Reynar&Ratnaparkhi, 1997)) which are built for exactly that purpose, i.e., to decide whether a capitalized word which follows an abbreviation is attached to it or whether there is a sentence boundary between them.

However, as Church (1988) rightly pointed out "Proper nouns and capitalized words are particularly problematic: some capitalized words are proper nouns and some are not.

The first obvious strategy for deciding whether a capitalized word in an ambiguous position is a proper name or not is to apply lexicon lookup (possibly enhanced with a morphological word guesser, e.g., (Mikheev, 1997)) and mark as proper names the words which are not listed in the lexicon of common words.
