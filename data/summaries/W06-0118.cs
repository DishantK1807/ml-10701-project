Also, the CRF model using maximum subword-based tagging (Zhang et al., 2006) and the CRF model using minimum subword-based tagging, both of which are statistical methods, are used individually to solve the problem.

Compared to our system, (Zhang, 2005) proposed a segmentation system that contains morphologically derived word recognition post-processing component to solve this problem.

In our system, the well-known forward maximum matching algorithm (Chen and Liu, 1992) is implemented.

Description In our segmentation system, a hybrid strategy is applied (Figure 1): First, forward maximum matching (Chen and Liu, 1992), which is a dictionary-based method, is used to generate a segmentation result.

Recently (Zhang et al., 2006) proposed a maximum subword-based IOB tagger for Chinese word segmentation, and our system applies their approach which obtains a very high accuracy on the shared task data from previous SIGHAN competitions.
