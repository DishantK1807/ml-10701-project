Computational works about BT have been mainly concerned with providing lists of possible or impossible antecedents for the NPs of a sentence (see Correa (1988); Ingria & Stallard (1989)); additional procedures select actual antecedents 1 R-expressions can take split antecedents too, at least in certain cases (epithets); however, we will not explicitly address this point here.

In a sense, ~ni), B(n i) and C(ni) are partial encodings of, respectively, Principles A, B and C of BT; see Giorgi, Pianesi, Satta (1990) for algorithms that compute these sets.

Finally, Fong (1990) performs a combinatorial analysis of the paradigm of free indexation, as proposed in (Chomsky, 1981); he shows that free indexation gives rise to an exponential number of alternatives and argues for the necessity of interleaving indexing and structure computation.
