Term matching can rely directly on raw word forms (Bodenreider et al., 2001), on morphological variants (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999), on syntactic structure (Bourigault, 1994; Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999) or on semantic variants (synonyms, hyperonyms, etc.) (Hamon et al., 1998).

The detection of appropriate syntactic patterns of cooccurrence is another method to uncover relations between terms in corpora (Hearst, 1992; Séguéla and Aussenac, 1999).
