2003), Keller and Lapata (2003) show that Web counts correlate well with counts collected from a balanced corpus: the size of the Web compensates for the noise in the data.

We compare our results with those of Edmondsâ€™s (1997), whose solution used the texts from the year 1989 of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to build a lexical cooccurrence network for each of the seven groups of near-synonyms from Table 2.

Grefenstette (1999) used the Web for example-based machine translation; Kilgarriff (2001) investigated the type of noise in Web data; Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) used it as an additional resource for word sense disambiguation; Resnik (1999) mined the Web for bilingual texts; Turney (2001) used Web frequency counts to compute information retrieval-based mutual-information scores.

The choices could come from various inventories of near-synonyms or similar words, for example the Roget thesaurus (Roget, 1852), dictionaries of synonyms (Hayakawa, 1994), or clusters acquired from corpora (Lin, 1998).
P98-2127
The fourth column presents the results reported in (Edmonds, 1997).
P97-1067
We estimate the counts by using the Waterloo MultiText1 system (Clarke and Terra, 2003b) with a corpus of about one terabyte of text collected by a Web crawler.

In fact, the only work that addresses exactly the same task is that of Edmonds (1997), as far as we are aware.
P97-1067
We tried only PMI because it is easy to compute on a Web corpus and because PMI performed better than other measures in (Clarke and Terra, 2003a).
