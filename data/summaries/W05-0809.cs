Given numerous (constructive) debates held during the previous word alignment evaluation, which questioned the informativeness of the NULL alignment evaluations, we decided 67 Team System name Description Carnegie Mellon University SPA (Brown et al., 2005) Information Sciences Institute / USC ISI (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) Johns Hopkins University JHU (Schafer and Drabek, 2005) Microsoft Research MSR (Moore, 2005) Romanian Academy Institute of Artificial Intelligence TREQ-AL, MEBA, COWAL (Tufis et al., 2005) University of Maryland / UMIACS UMIACS (Lopez and Resnik, 2005) University of Sheffield Sheffield (Aswani and Gaizauskas, 2005a) University of Montreal JAPA, NUKTI (Langlais et al., 2005) University of Sao Paulo, University of Alicante LIHLA (Caseli et al., 2005) University Jaume I MAR (Vilar, 2005) Table 1: Teams participating in the word alignment shared task to evaluate only no-NULL alignments, and thus the NULL alignments were removed from both submissions and gold standard data.

Se-veral teams used symmetrization metrics, as introduced in (Och and Ney, 2003) (union, intersection, refined), most of the times applied on the alignments produced for the two directions source–target and target–source, but also as a way to combine different word alignment systems.

The fourth measure was originally introduced by (Och and Ney, 2000), and proposes the notion of quality of word alignment.

This year’s shared task follows on the success of the previous word alignment evaluation that was organized during the HLT/NAACL 2003 workshop on ”Building and Using Parallel Texts: Data Driven Machine Translation and Beyond” (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

This is the same training data set as used in the 2003 word alignment evaluation (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

Several teams had approaches that relied (to varying degrees) on an IBM model of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), with different improvements brought by different teams, consisting of new submodels, improvements in the HMM model, model combination for optimal alignment, etc.
