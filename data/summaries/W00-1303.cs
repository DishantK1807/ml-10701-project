Accuracy Sekine (Sekine et al., 2000) gives an interesting report about the relationship between the beam width and the parsing accuracy.
C00-2109
The static features are basically taken from Uchimoto's list(Uchimoto et al., 1999) with little modification.

However, if we optimized the voting weight more carefully, the further improvements would be achieved (Inui and Inni, 2000).
C00-1051
with Related Work Uchimoto (Uchimoto et al., 1999) and Sekine (Sekine et al., 2000) report that using Kyoto University Corpus for their training and testing, they achieve around 87.2% accuracy by building statistical model based on Maximum Entropy framework.

On the other hand, as large-scale tagged corpora have become available these days, a number of statistical parsing techniques which estimate the dependency probabilities using such tagged corpora have been developed(Collins, 1996; Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998).
P96-1025
Sekine suggests an efficient parsing technique for Japanese sentences that parses from the end of a sentence(Sekine et al., 2000).
C00-2109
Decision Trees(Haruno et al., 1998) and Maximum Entropy models(Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Charniak, 2000) have been applied to dependency or syntactic structure analysis.
