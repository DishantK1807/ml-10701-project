Finally, many other projects in machine learning of natural language use input that is annotated in some way, either with part-of-speech tags (Brill 1992; Brill and Marcus 1992; Magerman and Marcus 1990) or with syntactic brackets (Pereira and Schabes 1992).

On the other hand, Hindle (1991) does use inferential statistics, and Brill (1992) recognizes the value of inference, although he does not use inferential statistics per se.

Finally, the lexical ambiguity problem could probably be reduced substantially in the applied context by using a statistical tagging program (Brill 1992; Church 1988).

Variants of these cues are presented in Brent (1991a, 1991b).

Brent From Grammar to Lexicon either uses no a priori grammatical knowledge (Brill and Marcus 1992; Ellison 1991; Finch and Chater 1992; Pereira and Schabes 1992), or else it relies on a large and complex grammar (Hindle 1990, 1991).

Many other projects have used statistics in a way that summarizes facts about the text but does not draw any explicit conclusions from them (Finch and Chater 1992; Hindle 1990).
