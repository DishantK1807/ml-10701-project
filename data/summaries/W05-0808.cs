Brown et al.(1991) and Gale and Church (1993) are amongst the most cited works in text alignment work.

Haruno and Yamazaki (1996) use a POS tagger for source and target languages and use an online dictionary to find matching word pairs.
P96-1018
Given that lexical methods can be computationally expensive, our idea was to try a simple length-based approach similar to that of Brown et al.(1991) for sentence alignment and then use lexical methods to align words within aligned sentences.
P91-1022
Other examples of lexical methods are Warwick et al.(1989), Mayers et al.(1998), Chen (1993) and Haruno and Yamazaki (1996).
P93-1002 P96-1018
Kay and Roscheisen (1993) tried lexical methods for sentence alignment.
J93-1006
Chen (1993) constructs a simple word-to-word translation model and then takes the alignment that maximizes the likelihood of generating the corpus given the translation model.
P93-1002
Examples of such alignment techniques are Brown et al.(1991), Kay and Roscheisen (1993), Warwick et al.(1989), and the “align” programme by Gale and Church (1993).
J93-1006 P91-1022
Yarowsky et al.(2001) introduced a new method for developing a Part-of-Speech tagger by projecting tags across aligned corpora.
H01-1035
Haruno and Yamazaki (1996) pointed out that though dictionaries cannot capture context dependent keywords in the corpus, they can be very useful to obtain information about words that appear only once in the corpus.
P96-1018
The method used by Brown et al.(1991) measures sentence length in number of words.
