Source-target pairs are either extracted from bilingual documents or dictionaries (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006; Zelenko and Aone, 2006), or gathered explicitly from human transliterators (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Zelenko and Aone, 2006).

Machine transliteration methods are divided into grapheme-based (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; LindÂ´en, 2005), phoneme-based (Jung et al., 2000; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) and combined techniques (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006).

This finding is supported by Papineni et al.(2002) who recommend that four people should be used for collecting judgments for machine translation experiments.
