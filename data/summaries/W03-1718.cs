Ji(2001), Zheng (2000), Shen(1995) and Sun(1994) used statistics from dictionaries and large corpus to generate PN or LN candidates, and used linguistic rules to filter the result, and Yu (1998) used language model to filter.

Unfortunately, most of these results are incomparable due to the different test sets used, except the results of Chen (1998) and Yu (1998).
