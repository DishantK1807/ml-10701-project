In comparison, Cowan and Collins (2005) report an f-score of 85.1% (≤ 70) using a version of Collins’ parser adapted for Cast3LB, and using reranking to boost perforsuch as grup.nom.ms (masculine singular), grup.nom.fs (feminine singular), grup.nom.mp (masculine plural) etc.

Prior to parsing, we perform one of the tree transformations described by Cowan and Collins (2005), i.e. we add a CP and SBAR nodes to subordinate and relative clauses.

Work 3.1 LFG Annotation A methodology for automatically obtaining LFG f-structures from trees output by probabilistic parsers trained on the Penn-II treebank has been described by Cahill et al.(2004). It has been shown that the methods can be ported to other languages and treebanks (Burke et al., 2004; Cahill et al., 2003), including Cast3LB (O’Donovan et al., 2005).

Jijkoun and de Rijke (2004) describe a method of enriching output of a parser with information that is included in the original Penn-II trees, such as function tags, empty nodes and coindexations.

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) use a probabilistic model with feature dependencies encoded by means of feature trees to add Penn-II Treebank function tags to Charniak’s parser output.

Function Tagging For the task of Cast3LB function tag assignment we experimented with three generic machine learning algorithms: a memory-based learner (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005), a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) and a Support Vector Machine classifier (Vapnik, 1998).

Some properties of Spanish and the encoding of syntactic information in the Cast3LB treebank make it non-trivial to apply the method of automatically mapping c-structures to f-structures used by Cahill et al.(2004), which assigns grammatical Tag Meaning ATR Attribute of copular verb CAG Agent of passive verb CC Compl.

The research presented in this paper forms part of an ongoing effort to develop methods to induce wide-coverage multilingual LexicalFunctional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 2001) resources from treebanks by means of automatically associating LFG f-structure information with constituency trees produced by probabilistic parsers (Cahill et al., 2004).

The f-structure annotation algorithm used for inducing LFG resources from the Penn-II treebank for English (Cahill et al., 2004) uses configurational, categorial, function tag and trace information.
