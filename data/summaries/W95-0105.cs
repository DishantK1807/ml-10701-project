Consider, for example, the cluster containing attorney, counsel, trial, court, and judge, used by Brown et al.(1992) to illustrate a "semantically sticky" group of words.

and Future Work The results of the evaluation are exlremely encouraging, especially considering that disambiguating word senses to the level of fine-grainedness found in WordNet is quite a bit more difficult than disambiguation to the level of homographs (Hearst, 1991; Cowie et al., 1992).

Example. Consider the following word group: 5 burglars thief rob mugging stray robbing lookout chase crate thieves 3An alternative worth mentioning, however, is the distributional approach of Pereira et al.(1993): within their representational scheme, distributionaUy defined word senses emerge automatically in the form of cluster centroids.

For example, Hearst and Schtltze (1993) take steps toward a distributional treatment of WordNet-based classes, using Schtltze's (1993) approach to constructing vector representations from a large co-occurrence matrix.

1Actually, this depends on the fine-grainedness of sense distinctions; clearly one could annotate corpora with very high level semantic distinctions For example, Basili et al.(1994) take such a coarse-grained approach, utilizing on the order of 10 to 15 semantic tags for a given domain.

Z; Word_Net is described by Miller et al.(1990). 54 It is quite small, by current corpus standards (on the order of hundreds of thousands of words, rather than millions or tens of millions); the direct annotation methodology used to create it is labor intensive (Marcus et al.(1993) found that direct annotation takes twice as long as automatic tagging plus correction, for partof-speech annotation); and the output quality reflects the difficulty of the task (inter-annotator disagreement is on the order of 10%, as contrasted with the approximately 3% error rate reported for part-of-speech annotation by Marcus et al.).

The pairs come from an example given by Church and Hanks (1989), illustrating the words that human subjects most frequently judged as being associated with the word doctor.
