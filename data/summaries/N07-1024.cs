Chen and Lin (2000) is the only study that used contextual information for the same task.

Window Size For WSD, both topical context and microcontext have been used (Ide and Véronis 1998).

We then compute the weight of a context word w in context c, W(w, c), using mutual information and t-test, which were reported by Weeds and Weir (2005) to perform the best on a pseudo-disambiguation task.

Chen (2004) used the χ 2 measure to compute character-character and word-word associations, but not word-category associations.

While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD research and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g., Roark and Charniak 1998; Ci190 aramita 2003; Curran 2005), it has been used in only one previous study on semantic classification of Chinese unknown words (Chen and Lin, 2000).

Chen and Chen (2000) adopted similar exemplar-based models.
C00-1026 W00-1202
As Chen (2004) noted, excluding all the words in the development and test data in the testing stage worsens the data-sparseness problem for knowledge-based models, as some categories have few member words, and some characters appear in few words in some categories.

Chen (2004) proposed a model that retrieves the word with the greatest association with the target word.
