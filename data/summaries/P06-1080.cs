To avoid this problem, many smoothing techniques have been proposed for construction of D2-gram models (Chen and Goodman, 1996).
P96-1041
According to the previous work (Lee et al., 2002), the hidden Markov model shows the best performance when it sees two previous tags and two previous syllables.
W02-1208
Tagging Since natural language sentences are sequential as their nature, the word spacing can be considered as a special POS tagging task (Lee et al., 2002) for which a hidden Markov model is usually adopted.
W02-1208
For this purpose, (SchÂ¨utze and Singer, 1994) adopted a variable memory Markov model proposed by (Ron et al., 1996), (Kim et al., 2003) applied selective extension of features to POS tagging, and (Dickinson and Meurers, 2005) expanded context of D2-gram models to find errors in syntactic anno634 tation.

This results coincide with the previous report (Lee et al., 2002).
