In our work, we adopt the method proposed in (Tao and Zhai, 2005) and apply it to the problem of transliteration; note that (Tao and Zhai, 2005) compares several different metrics for time correlation, as we also note below — and see (Sproat et al., 2006).

Comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the literature — e.g.,(Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Franz et al., 1998; Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Masuichi et al., 2000; Sadat et al., 2004), but transliteration in the context of comparable corpora has not been well addressed.

However one could also train such costs, either from an existing list of known transliterations, or as part of an iterative bootstrapping method as, for example, in Yarowsky and Wicentowski’s (2000) work on morphological induction.

(Knight and Graehl, 1998; Meng et al., 2001; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Gao et al., 2004) — has mostly assumed that one has a training lexicon of transliteration pairs, from which one can learn a model, often a source-channel or MaxEnt-based model.

Recently, a Pearson correlation method was proposed to mine word pairs from comparable corpora (Tao and Zhai, 2005); this idea is similar to the method used in (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) for sentence alignment.

The general idea of exploiting time correlations to acquire word translations from comparable corpora has been explored in several previous studies — e.g., (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996).

In contrast, Chinese candidates were extracted using a list of 495 characters that are frequently used for foreign names (Sproat et al., 1996).

Transliteration from English to Arabic and Chinese is complicated (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).

We then extract named-entities in the English text using the named-entity recognizer described in (Li et al., 2004), which is based on the SNoW machine learning toolkit (Carlson et al., 1999).
