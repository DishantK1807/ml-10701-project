Lin’s work (Lin, 1998b; Pantel and Lin, 2002) makes use of distributional syntactic contextual information to define semantic proximity.

While the context may mean different things in natural language, many previous work in statistically natural language processing defined “context” as an n-word window around the target word (Gale et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1991; Roth, 1998).

An exhaustive PhraseNet list is intersected with word lists generated based on clustered contexts given by (Pantel and Lin, 2002).

However, this database does not 3The attempt to label these semantic roles automatically in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) assumes knowledge of the frame and covers only 20% of them.

With the resurgence of lexical semantics and corpus linguistics during the past two decades, this so-called linking regularity triggers a broad interest of using syntactic representations illustrated in corpora to classify lexical meaning (Baker et al., 1998; Levin, 1993; Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Lin, 1998b; Pantel and Lin, 2002).

At this point, we implement the construction of PhraseNet using a clustering of contexts, as done in (Pantel and Lin, 2002).

It is inspired by the work on reformulation, e.g., (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001).

Our approach to QC follows that of (Li and Roth, 2002).

This seems to be due to lack of topical context (Harabagiu et al., 1999; Agirre et al., 2001) as well as local context (Fellbaum, 1998).

In many cases, reported (and unreported) problems are due to the fact that WordNet enumerates all the senses of polysemous words; attempts to use this resource automatically often result in noisy and non-uniform information (Brill and Resnik, 1994; Krymolowski and Roth, 1998).

By adding contextual information, many researchers, (e.g., (Green et al., 2001; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Landes et al., 1998)), have already made some improvements over it.

prepositional phrase attachment (Pantel and Lin, 2000; Stetina and Nagao, 1997), co-reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002) to text summarization (Saggion and Lapalme, 2002), semantic information is a necessary component in the inference, by providing a level of abstraction that is necessary for robust decisions.

FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) produces a semantic dictionary that documents combinatorial properties of English lexical items in semantic and syntactic terms based on attestations in a very large corpus.
