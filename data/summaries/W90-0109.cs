While it is recognized that this division is problematic (Hovy, et al.1988), nearly all generation systems today make this division.

Mann & Moore 1981, Derr & McKeown 1984, Hovy 1988) have two major deficiencies: (1) they are presuming underlying programs have units of this size that may be simply selected for inclusion in the message and then realized intact, and (2) they are underutilizing the power of natural language, which can use complex noun phrases, nominalizations, adverbial phrases, and other adjuncts to pack information from multiple units into one clause.

Most state of the art text planning systems follow a common design (see for example McKeown 1985, Derr & McKeown 1984, Paris 1987, or Hovy 1988).
