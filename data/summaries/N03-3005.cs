Other techniques are focused on implementational aspects (Wintner and Francez, 1999), or propose approaches similar to indexing for typed-feature structures (TFS) retrieval (Ninomiya et al., 2002).

Indexing for TFS 6.1 Path Indexing Our statistical approach to indexing has its roots in the automaton-based indexing from (Penn and Popescu, 1997), used in generation, but adapted to indexed edge retrieval.

A method (similar to the one introduced in Section 7) that uses pre-compiled rule filters is presented in (Kiefer et al., 1999), although the authors did not focus on the indexing potential of the static analysis of mother-daughter relations, nor present the indexing in a large experimental context.
P99-1061
From the existing methods that efficiently encode TFS into Prolog terms ((Mellish, 1988), (Gerdemann, 1995), (Penn, 1999a)), we used embedded Prolog lists to represent feature structures.

An automaton-based indexing for generation is proposed in (Penn and Popescu, 1997), while (Penn, 1999b) improves the efficiency by reEdmonton, May-June 2003 Student Research Workshop, pp.
