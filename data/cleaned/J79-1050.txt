4:334	Besides presenting the proposed organization, the paper characterizes thc lexical "senses" which result.
5:334	1.
6:334	Introduction.
7:334	This paper describes an internal lexical organization which is particularly designed to capture the facts about synonymy.
8:334	Besides recording the inclusion of each word in one or more synonym sets (identified with its various "senses"), the scheme attempts to distribute attributes per~picuously between "senses", "wordings", and the intersections of the two.
9:334	In addition, there is provision to record multi-word idioms, stock phrases, and the like.
10:334	and to include these as elements in synonym sets when appropriate.
11:334	Briefly, "senses" are represented in their own right, along with "words" and "phrases", by distinct data items.
12:334	Each word or phrase is associated with a list of the "senses" which it can express; conversely, each "sense" is associated with a list of "alternative wo iings" Additionally.
13:334	each word is associated with a list of phrases in which it occurs.
14:334	Grammatical category, features, selection restrictions, and the like are applicable at three different levels: to words or phrases as such, to "senscs" as such, or to particular usages of words or phrases (equivalently, to particular wordings of "senses").
15:334	An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses This lexical organization has been inlplemerlted at 1BM Research, Yorktown Heights, N.Y., by a program -not to be described here -which builds such dictionaries in a very compact form, giving interactive assistance to the person making the entries.
16:334	(For cxaniple, the plrogram pdn ts out the possibility of merging "senses" whenever their wordings overlap and their attributes arc compatible, and merges them if so directed).
17:334	There are suitable I'acilities for saving the results, retrieving them in various ways, and for altering such things as sclienies of classification witlio~~~ scrapping previously prepared work.
18:334	The ultimate intent is that the "dictionary of senses" should serve as the lexical coniponent in a natural language fact-retrieval system.
19:334	Pending its incorporation in that rolc, it will be used to amass and organize information on the semantic relations among words and phrases.
20:334	The balance of this paper conies in two sections: Section 2 presents the proposed lexical data structures, and suggests haw they arc to be used.
21:334	Included is a sketch of how various types of grammatical anri semantic "attributes" fit into thc scheme.
22:334	Section 3 discusses the character of the "senses" encoded in the resulting dictictlary.
23:334	Reasons arc advanced for regarding lexical "senses" as something far short of semantic primitives.
24:334	At the same time, synonym sets are defended against the view that "true paraphrases are rare or rtonexistcnt".
25:334	An Organization far a Dictionary of Word Senses 2.
26:334	The Internal Remesentation.
27:334	It will be our purpose in this section to say just enough about internal representation to lay bare the organizing principles of the lexicon.
28:334	The focus is on architecture afid motivations; details of field layouts, internal codes, etc. are not at issue here.
29:334	To make the discllssion concrete, suppose we are interested in the senses of the word "changev Assuming that none of the words are unfamiliar, the following should put us in mind of two senses: change: 1.
30:334	v alter; 2.
31:334	n small coin.
32:334	This, of course, is just a dictionary entry in the traditional format (though with synonyms offered in lieu of definitions), On the other hand, we might approach the same information from a different direction: starting with the two concepts, we might seek words to express them.
33:334	It is difficult to picture this latter situation without assigning artificial labels to the concepts.
34:334	Call them concepts 1 and 2, and suppose for a moment that there were a practical way to look the concepts up (witlzozlt having thought of either word for either concept).
35:334	Then the information to be retrieved might be envisioned this way: I. v change, alter 2.
36:334	n change, small coin It is this duality of viewpoint -that words have senses, while senses have wordings -that our lexical representation must reflect.
37:334	The starting point, then, is that words, phrases, and "senses" are separately represented.
38:334	There are three principal types of data item, plus a standard connector: 1.
39:334	A "Key Data Item " (KDI) represent:; a single word.
40:334	2.
41:334	A "Phrase Data Item" (PDI) represents a string of two or more words which are to serve as a unit in some context An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 3.
42:334	A "Sense Data Item" (SDI) represents one distinct sense common to a set of wordq and/or phrases.
43:334	In general, a word or phrase may be usable in more than one sense, while a given sense may have alternative (synonymous) wordings.
44:334	Both these types of variability are recorded making use of the next data item: 4.
45:334	A "Sertse Link Element" (SLE) is a connective item, to be explained shortly.
46:334	Three principal fields will engage our attention in each type of data item.
47:334	Fig.
48:334	1 summarizes the fields for each type.
49:334	KDI (Key Data Item) "Alteynative Senses" Link PDI (Phrase Data Item) Global Attributes "Alternative Senses" Link L i "Phrase lnvol~einents" Link SDI (Sense Data Item) Global Attributes "Alternative Wordings" Link "Component Word" Links SLE (Sense Link Element) Global Attributes "Alternative 'Senses" Link Fig.
50:334	1 Schematic of Data Items, with Principal Contents 1 "Sense Chain" Link Each KDI (Key Data Item) or PDI (Phrase Data Item) coiltains an "alternative senses" link -al pointer to the first SLE (Sense Link Element) in a chain of SLE's which represent the various senses of the word or phrase.
51:334	The SLE's are chained via their own "alternative senses" links, and the final member points back to the KDI or PDI.
52:334	Thus, we shall speak of such a chain as a ring Local Attributes "Alternative Wordings" Link An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 6 specifically, an "alternative senses ring".
53:334	If no senses are on record for a particular word ox phra, the "alternative senses" link in the KDI or PDI is ssl: referent.
54:334	Reciprocally, each SDI (Sense Data Item) contahs an "alt-native wordings" link.
55:334	This leads to a chain of SLE~S which represent more-or-less synonymous wordings mat express the sense.
56:334	These SLE's are chained through their own "alternative wordink links, and again the chain is closed into a ring -this time beginniog and ending with the SDI.
57:334	The structure that is shaping up may now be seen in Fig.
58:334	2, The crtrcicrl poirir is that encll SLE represents the intersection betwen nn "alternntive sense^ ring nrrd an "cllterncirive wordi~rgs" ring.
59:334	From the standpoint of the word or phrase, it; represents a particular scnse; from the standpoint of the sense, it represents a particular wordink Starting from a KDI or PDI, one gets to the SDI for a particular sense by advancing along the "alternative senses" ring to the relevant SLE, then &touring along the ring which connects th~ latter to the SDI (as one of the SDI's "alternative wordings").
60:334	Starting from an SDI, one gets to a particular wording by the reverse process.
61:334	Since each "alternative senses" ring contains exactly one KDI or PDI, while each "alternative wording#' ring contains exactly one SDI, each SLE is tied to exactly one sense of one word or phrase.
62:334	(Eani~alently, it is tied to one wording of one sense).
63:334	The next point of interest is that "attribute" f'i~lds are present in all four types of data item -even in the connectors (SLE's).
64:334	The attributes which may be recorded in each, however, come from different bags.
65:334	To begin with, the attributes found in an SDI characterize a11 the wordings of a given sense whenever the wording-, are used in that sense.
66:334	In Fig.
67:334	2, for example, sense "I" should be marked as a "verb" sense, whil?
68:334	sense "2" is a "noun".
69:334	One would not wish to record the attribute "verb" in the KDI for the word "change", for the KDI represents facts about the word itself, irrespective of sense, and "verb" does no! 'hold for all uses of the word "change".
70:334	On the other hand, "verb" does characterize all wordings of sense "I", whenever they're being employed to express that sense.
71:334	It would furthermore apply to any additional wordings which we might think of, such as "modify", provided they are really used in a synonymous way.
72:334	As a matter of fact, it turns out that the traditional parts of speech -noun, verb, adjective, preposition, etc. -fit best in this scheme as global attributes of senses, recorded ill the SDI's.
73:334	An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses senses of "alter" Fig.
74:334	2 "Alternative Senses" and "Alternative Wordings" Rings (The first sense has two wordings: "alter" and "change".
75:334	The second sense has wordings "change" and "small coin".
76:334	Two senses are recorded for "change", and one sense each for "alter''.
77:334	and "small coin").
78:334	A different sort of attribute may be recorded in a KDI, as a global feature of the word itself.
79:334	For example, we may note of the word "change" that it is "regularly conjugated".
80:334	That is, when used An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 8 as a verb, it forms the third person singular by adding "s", and both past ~nd past participle by adding "ed" To be sure, this "global" attribute applies only to the "verb" senses of "change"; but a moment's reflection will confirm that "change" has more than one "verb" sense, and the regularity of its conjugation is common to all of them.
81:334	Thus, it is useful to note this regularity as an attribute of the word itself.
82:334	(Contrast this with the behavior of the word "can", which is regular whn it means "to pack in cans", but irregular when it means "is able to").
83:334	Various other attributes suggest themselves as global characterizers of the words thcn~selvcs, to bc recarded in the KDI's.
84:334	For example, one might wish to note of "change" that it drops its final "e" whon adding "ing" (this is the normal rule) but of "singe" that it doesn't.
85:334	Still other attributes are appropriate when characterizing multi-word units (in PDl's).
86:334	A string of words whose meaning is not evident from the nlere juxtaposition of its constittlents (such as "givc up") may be classified as an "idiom", A string of words whose meaning could be figured out from the meanings of its constituents, but which occurs with enough frequency to warrant inclusion in the dictionary, might be classed as a "stock phrase".
87:334	(Example: "drop dead").
88:334	A string like "perform in a subordinate role", which one would not normally expect to encounter in its own right, might be classed as a "definition" (for a certain sense of the word "accompany", difficult to reword except with a definition).
89:334	Perhaps the most unexpected site for recording attributes is in the connective elements (SLE's).
90:334	These are the logical place, though, to note features that apply to a specific sense of a word, without being global to either the sense or the word.
91:334	Consider the following four senrenccs: On the way to the office, he stopped daydreaming.
92:334	On the way to the office, he ceased daydreaming.
93:334	On the way to the office, he ceased to daydream.
94:334	versus: On thebway to the office, he stopped to daydream.
95:334	Suppose we choose to view this as a restriction upon the (surface) object of the verb: "stop", when applied to an action, must take a gerund as its object; "cease" can take either a gerund or an infinitive.
96:334	(It wouldn't affect the point being made if we said that "stop" inhibits a certain grammatical transformation en route to surface structure, while "cease" pennits it).
97:334	An Organization tur a Dictionary of Word Senses 9 Now, we wouldn't want to mark "gerund object only" as a global.
98:334	attribute of the sense, for we have just shown that "cease" and "stop", two wordings of the sense, differ with respect to this restriction.
99:334	On the other hand, it doesn't belong among the global attributes of the word "stop" as such, for "stop" has other verb senses, even transitive ones, tu which the restriction is completely inapplicable.
100:334	(Consider "stop a hole in the dike", "stop a catastrophe", etc).
101:334	That leaves the alternative we are suggesting: treat the restriction as an attribute of one particular usage of thc word (equivalently, one particular wording of the sense).

103:334	3 "Phrase Involvement" Rings (1) "play" (Where numbers are shown on connecting links, they indicate the position of the word in the phrase which is linked to).

106:334	Fig.
107:334	3 shows the plan of attack.
108:334	I'n the KDI for each word, there is a link connecting it to the PDI for the first phrase in which the word is known to occur, together with a number designating the position of the word (Ist, Znd, 3rd.
109:334	etc).
110:334	in that phrase.
111:334	In the PDI itself, there is a coiltinuation link for each word of the phrase, together with its niiri~ber in the next phrase.
112:334	In the final PDI involving a given word, the link for that word points back to the KDI.
113:334	Thus, independent of its "altcrnative senses" ring, each KDI tnay hmc r~ "phrase invol\~cit~ents" ring.
114:334	This structure makes it possible to retrieve all the idioms, stock phrases, definitions, etc. , in which a given word has made its appearance, anywhere in the dictionary.
115:334	As the same structure is used to encode every multi-word unit, no occurrence of a word is ever lost sight of, and r~ phrase can be looked up via any of its constituent words.
116:334	Of the fields to which Fig.
117:334	1 calls attention, we have discussed all but one.
118:334	In the SDI for each "sense", tbpre is a "sense chain" link field.
119:334	This links the SDI to its successor in a global chain of "senses".
120:334	Using this chain, it is possible to make an exhaustive, non-duplicative list of all the "senses" recorded in the dictionary.
121:334	The listing program has only to proceed down the chain, retrieve frdm each SDI its attributes, decode them, then chase around the "alternative wordings' ring of the SDI and list the wordings alongside the attributes.
122:334	One more feature of the internal representation deserves mention: the data items for words occur as "leaves" in a lexical tree (Fig.
123:334	4).
124:334	That is, the KDI for a word can be looked up letter-by-letter, following a chain of pointers that correspond to successive letters.
125:334	The chain ends at a KDI after following a substring sufficient to distinguish the word fro111 the nearest thing like it in thc dictionary.
126:334	The lexical tree has the advantage that words can be looked up either at random or in sequence.
127:334	Recapitulating, these are the essential features of the representation: *1) "Senses" are represented separately from "wordings", and the mutual connections between them are made explicit in both directions.
128:334	*2) "Wordings" may be either single words or multi-word pnrases.
129:334	I hese are representea by distinct types of data item, and may be subject to distinct schemes of classification.
130:334	but they are on the same footing with regard to "sense" connections.
131:334	With each word is associated an exhaustive list of the phrases in which it occurs.
132:334	An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses (start) I "monkey" B "above" &, Fig.
133:334	4 Lexical Tree $( Y?
134:334	(For a dictionary containing only the words a, "above", "abate", and "monkey", this would be the full tree.
135:334	The path to each word is only as long as needed to distinguish it from the neighbor with which it shares the longest leading substring).
136:334	*3) Classifiers and features, drawn from appropriate sets, may be attributed separately to words, to phrases, to senses, or to particular senses of words or phrases (i.e. , to particular wordings of senses).
137:334	*4) The data items which represent senses are globally chained, and may be exhaustively listed.
138:334	An Organhation for a Dictionary of Word Senses *5) The data items which represent words are accessible as "leaves" of a lexical tree; hence they may either be retrieved by lookup (in response to presentation of the words) or volunteered in alphabetical order, Given a con~mitn~ent to repreiknt a lexicon as suggested by points * 1 through 9 tabovc, various implementations would be possible.
139:334	Alternative implementations of individtlal points (though not of the scheme as a whole) have in fact been described by other writers.
140:334	Tlte lexical tree (*S), for example, is no great novelty: Sydney M Lamb and William H. Jacobsen describe implementation details of one such tree [SJ.
141:334	[lo] also concerns a dictionary which uscs this general style of organization for lookup.
142:334	For '.hat matter, the lexical tree is reminiscent of Fcigcrrbr~um's "discrin~ination tree".
143:334	[ 11 More interestingly, the Separate representation of senses n11d wordings has been incorporated in othei.
144:334	systems by R. F. Simnlons ([Ill, [12]) and by Larry R. Harris (31.
145:334	This way of looking at matters led Harris to remark some of the same points that we have been stressing: that senses have alternative wordings just as words have alternative senses; that multi-word phrases might occur on the same footing as individual words in the expression of a sense; and (interestingly enough) that part-of-speech information really adheres to the "sense", not to the "word" Similarly, Simmons associates his "deep case" information with lexical nodes representing "wordsenscs",, while words the~nselves are treated as "print image" attributes of the wordsenses.
146:334	Harris's dictionary was only a minor component in a small-scale model of concept acquisition.
147:334	No great number of either words or concepts was required to illustrate the principles at stake, so Harris programmed the dictionary as an array, with words represented by rows and "concepts" by columns.
148:334	Elements of the array were merely frequencies, indicating the strength of association between each word and each concept.
149:334	Needless to say, for a full-scale vocabulary of words and concepts, such an array is mostly empty; nobody would dream of expanding it in that form.
150:334	From a programming standpoint, the only thinkable choice is some form of list structure.
151:334	Having decided in principle to use "some form of list structure", though, one might well ask: Why chains?
152:334	Why rings?
153:334	Why not just include in each Key Data Item a full list of pointers to the corresponding Sense Data Items.
154:334	and vice-versa?
155:334	The answer is simply one of convenience.
156:334	It's easier to handle insertions and deletions when they don't require the movement of expanded items to new quarters, or the provision of "overflow" pointers.
157:334	It's easier to reclaim freed storage when deleted items come in a handful of standard An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 13 sizes.
158:334	As for "rings", they eliminate the need for two-way pointers, since one can break into a ring at any point and follow it to its source.
159:334	It should be noted that to make rings an attractive representation, the details of the material being represented must cooperate, In particular, the rings must not become too long, or the processing requlred to follow them becomes excessive.
160:334	It happens that "alternative senses" rings and "alternative wordings" rings are typically short rarely more than a dozen links per ring.
161:334	"Phrase involvement" rings, on the other hand, can become spectacularly long, especially for words like "a*' and "to".
162:334	In practice, it's necessary to provide these rings with short-cut links.
163:334	Any of these, programming details could be altered, however, without abando~ting tltc ossencc of the scheme, which is given in points * 1 through *5 above.
164:334	An OqginiZatioh for a Dictionary of Word Senses 3.
165:334	The Character of Lexical Senses.
166:334	-Pe~haps the first tljing to get straight about the "senses" represented in this dictionary is what they are not.
167:334	They are aot "concepts"; they are not a set of "primitives" into which human espurlcncc an be decomposed, No conjecture is put forivard here [hot any such collcrtion of discrete, i~tr~riiic concepts even exists, let ulonc that it might be finite.
168:334	Rather, the "senses" of the dictionary are in thc nr.urc of fuzzy equivalcncc sets among worcis.
169:334	(This is only a metaphor; we shall do more and more violence to thc ttchnicul notion of an "equivalence set" as we proceed).
170:334	Each "sense" groups n set of words which, in n set of appr:~priate cu.ntexts; might be tiscd ~nore or less intcrchangenbly.
171:334	That the cq\livalenct.
172:334	sots arc fu7'r.y. nrie can convir~cc otleself with but the briefest im~~~crsion in the r~lntcrials of thc.
173:334	lang~i~p~ -trying to decide whether particular words belong in particular groups or justiPi\~ the crcr~tion of new groups.
174:334	Consider, for example, the following set of words and phrases: (abandon, give up, surrender, relinquish, let go.
175:334	desert, leave, forsake, abdicate) Clearly, there is a common theme that can run through all of these, given the right circumstances.
176:334	It might be expressed as "reluctant parting from somebody or something".
177:334	This can be seen by coupling the verbs with var.ious possible objects: (abandon, give up, surrender) a town to the enemy (abandon, give up) all hope (give up, relinquish) one's claim to an estate (give up, let go) our entire stock at a loss (abandon, desert, leave) one's wife and children (desert, forsake) a friend in need (give up, abdicate) the throne An Organhtion for a Dictionary of Word Senses (abandon, desert) an exhausted mine (forsake, give up) all other, keeping thee only to her/him (abandon, desert, leave) the area threatened by the storm Should we, then, declare this group of words to be a "sense"?
178:334	There are difficulties.
179:334	The various words carry nuances, which it may or may not be easy to ignore in a particular context, "Forsake", for example, can suggest that there is something reprehensible about the action.
180:334	It can also connote formal renunciation, and the above example from a marriage vow shows that the formality can be present without the reprehensibility.
181:334	Nuances get in the way of interchangeability; it would sound strange to substitute "desert" into the marriage vow.
182:334	Besides nuances, the individual words have conventional areas of application.
183:334	One does not normally say that the doctors "deserted" all hope, or that an errant husband "surrendered" his wife and children.
184:334	The minister officiating at a wedding would be considered daft if be adjured the bride and groom to "abdicate" all others, and a merchant would not advertize that he was "relinquishing" his entire stock at a loss.
185:334	(Somehow, the larkr situaaon calls for more pedestrian language).
186:334	At the opposite extreme, overawed by this lack of interchangeability, we might decide to respect the unique personality of each word, abolishing equivalenioe classes altogether.
187:334	The inconvenience of such a cop-out is obvious: we then have to introduce some other mechanism for recognizing the equivalence of utterances that are intended synonymously, though they employ different words.
188:334	But beyond being inconvenient, the exclusion of equidence sets is a denial of linguistic facts -just as bad, in its own way, as the naive attribution of unconditional synonymy.
189:334	For it is a commonplace of everyone's experience that the speaker and the listener agree to ignore the nuances of words, whenever nuances get in the way of communication.
190:334	A writer who has used the word "give up" eight times in five lines will surely cast about for some alternative ways of saying the same thing.
191:334	If "relinquish" and "abandon" would normally be too flowery, or if "mender" would in other circumstances call to mind an armistice ceremony in a railway wagon.
192:334	that will not deter the writer from tossing in a few occurrences of those words -once a context has been established that discourages the overtones.
193:334	Nor will the reader understand matters any differently.
194:334	It is as if writer and reader conspired: "We're fed up with that word, let's hear another".
195:334	Or, perhaps, the writer simply connives at jolting the reader awake with frequent changes of idiom, maybe even an occasional incongruity.
196:334	En any case, synonymy is imposed upan An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 16 the words, and this literary behavior merely exaggerates what people do habitually in cbmmon speech.
197:334	Not only can words be stripped of nuances normally present; they can toke on colorations suggested by the context.
198:334	The suggestion of "reluctance" conveyed by all thc verbs of our example can be inferred, in at least one case, from the setting alone; and in this case, a variety of rnorc neutral verbs could be used synonymously: (part with, take leave of) our entire stock at a loss One could even substitute the word "sell", and it wouldn't change the meaning that was already bad into the utterance.
199:334	But to adnlit contest-dependent synonyniy of this clcgrcc is to strctch the equivalence sets" to thc point of uselessness.
200:334	It comes to this: neither the grouping nor the separation of words can be fully justified.
201:334	Grouping is nearly always conditional, and separation is often so.
202:334	If one could anticipate all possible contexts in which a group of words could occur, one could perhaps enumerate all possible equivalence sets -one for each combination of word group with a set of contexts making the words interchangeable.
203:334	Anyone, however, can see the futility of that aspiration.
204:334	In the end, one settles for messy compromises.
205:334	Words are grouped if a largish set of contexts in which they are interchangeable springs readily to mind.
206:334	They are separated (into perhaps overlapping groups) if the imagination readily suggests contexts in which their meanings differ "significantly" -whatever "significantly" may mean.
207:334	In doubtful cases, when words are grouped somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add markings some clay that will prevent misuse of the equivalence.
208:334	When words are separated somewhat questionably, one promises oneself to add a mechanism some day that will recognize their relatedness.
209:334	In the end, too, one assigns internal structure to the equivalence sets.
210:334	That's the effect of assigning local attributes to the alternative wordings ("animate subject", "object a vehicle", etc.): constraints are imposed upon the interchangeability of the wordings.
211:334	More radical structuring can be accomplished if, for example, one notes "government" as an alternative wording of the sense "govern, rule, control", with the attribute "nominalization".
212:334	A trenchant discussion of such difficulties may be found in Kelly and Stone [4].
213:334	There the emphasis is upon disambiguation: given a word in a passage of text, they seek to identify (by selection from a fixed list of possibilities) the sense in which it is used.
214:334	Building a computerized An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses dictionary for the purpose, they soon became concerned with the arbitariness and the proliferation of target "senses", as taken from standard desk dictionaries.
215:334	They argue, with persuasive examples, that what lexicographers conventionally distinguish as separate senses of a word are often just applications of the word's underlying concept to different contexts.
216:334	To cover the various contexts, the underlying concept has to be stretched a little, by a process of metaphoric extension.
217:334	This metaphoric process is beyond our present power to computerize, but for 'the long run looks indispensable for successful language processing.
218:334	Meanwhile, the authors advocate a dictionary which records for each word as few discrete senses as practicable, combining into one scnsc all the usages which can reasonably be united by a common underlying thougl~t. It is interesting to re-examine Kelly and Stone's argument with a diffcrent task in n~inii: not tile disambiguation of one word, but the recognition of synonymy between two words.
219:334	A n~etaphorical capability would be as useful for the one task as for the other, but in the case of synonynl rccognition, some of the considerations which have guided traditional lexicography remain pertinent.
220:334	In particular, it is necessary to ask not merely whether the concepts overlap, but whether the one word may in fact be used in place of the other.
221:334	As noted before, usage is restricted by conventional domaitls of application; for example, an "alteration" is conceptually both a "change" and a "modification", but one wouldn't call it a change or a modification when painting a sign for a tailor's shap.
222:334	The arbitrariness of the equivalence sets is not all that disqualilies then1 as "conceptual primitives".
223:334	There is a much deeper difficulty in the fact that practically all "senses" can be paraphrased in terms of other "senses".
224:334	Take, for example, the intransitive sense of "change" (as in "My, but you've changed!").
225:334	Surely, one would suppose, the concept of "change" must be primitive?
226:334	Change of state is what well-nigh a third of all verbs are about.
227:334	But if "change" is a "primitive", it's a peculiar sort of "primitive", for it can be paraphrased in a variety of ways: (change, become different, cease to be the same, assume new characteristics, make a transition into a new state) Note that the multi-word paraphrasals are not idioms; the individual words contribute their usual meaqings to concatenated meanings which express the concept "change".
228:334	An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 18 But perhaps we were merely unlucky?
229:334	Perhaps we chanced upon a concept which looked elemental but actually turned out to be complex.
230:334	Maybe the real primitives are "become", "be", "cease", "different", "same", etc. Let's dig into that possibility.
231:334	What does it mean to "become X", where X is an adjective?
232:334	The meaning can bc \~ario\isly expressed: (become X, come to bq X, get to be X, get X, turn X, grow X, assume thc charrtctcristic X) That's a discouraging number of ways for a "primitive" to be re-expressible -though if we choose to regard "come to be" and "get to be" as idiomatic concatcnr\tions of words, only onc of the alternatives makes use of other concepts to explain the one at hand.
233:334	As for "different", it implies a whole underlying anecdote about sortlebody making a contparisoi~, after first making a judgment about relevant things to compare.
234:334	In the combination of the two concepts -"become different" --, we furthermore drop mention of the objects being compared.
235:334	It's simply understood that they are certain attributes of the subject at two points in time.
236:334	It is tempting to invent ad-hoc "transformational" explanations for these phenomena.
237:334	One might conjecture, for example, tliat "The man changed".
238:334	is a surface realization of four underlying sentences: (Man be X at time m. Man be Y at time n. X not equal Y, Time n greater-than time n~).
239:334	Thetrouble with explanations of this sort -apart from the fact that they introduce growing complexity into the understanding of straightforward utterances -is that they assign arbitrary primacy to some concepts at the expense of others.
240:334	Why should "time n greater-than time m" be an assumed primitive?
241:334	May we not equally well conjecture that "time n greater-than time m" is a surface realization of these?: (Time be m. Time change.
242:334	Then time be n).
243:334	For that matter, why not view An Organization for a Dictibnary of Word Senses "Time elapsed.
244:334	" as a surface form of this?: "At least one thing in the universe changed".
245:334	After all, what is "time" but a nominalized way of talking about the presence and partitioning of change?
246:334	The difficulty, it would seem, lies in the very notion of context-independent "conceptual primitives".
247:334	The metaphor itself is at fault: it calls to mind a fixed set of dements, like thosc of which matter is composed, out of which all ideus must be compounded.
248:334	But where concepts arc concerned, primitivity is a matter of focus, Shift the perspective a little, and new elenlcnts swim into view as fundamentals, while former simples become con~plex.
249:334	A more promising metaphor is the analogy to a 'vector space.
250:334	A set of basis vectors is, in a way, a set of "primitives" out of which all the entities in the space can be composed.
251:334	These primitives have the appealing property that they are only primitive relative to one frame of reference.
252:334	Rotatc your point of view, and what used to come natural as basis vectors are now at an angle; they become easier to express as sums of vectors that lie along new axes.
253:334	That bears a resemblance to what we have seen,in tlhe case of lexical "primitives".
254:334	Thus far and no further may the analogy be pushed, however.
255:334	The elements which span "conceptual space" can be no such uniform set of objects as those in a vettor space, while the rules of composition are coextensive with grammar -at a minimum.
256:334	Composition of concepts itself contributes to the meaning.
257:334	(For that matter, it is arguable whether concepts are sufficiently separable to model them as discrete objects at all -whether simple or composite).
258:334	Moreover as "conceptual space" must encompass all things thinkable, the rules of composition must themselves be part of the space.
259:334	That is, the operators as much as the things operated upon lie within the space to be spanned.
260:334	A seming counterexample to these remarks may be found in the "primitive ACT's" of conceptual dependency theory, as propounded by Schank, Goldman, Rieger, and Riesbeck (121, [7], [8], [9]).
261:334	On a close reading, however, the "primitive ACT's" turn out to be verb paradigms -powerful, semantically motivated generalizations about large classes of verbs.
262:334	The names of these paradigms replace specific verbs as building blocks in the "conceptual" representation of an utterance.
263:334	The An manbation f~r a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 0 effect is to provide strong guidelines for the inference of unstated information, for the comparison of related utterances, for paraphrasal, etc. TO represent a particular verb in terms of these ACT's, however, it is necessary to augment each ACT with various substructures which detail the manner, the means, the type of actor or object, etc. No reduced set of representatives is as yet offered for the adverbs, nouns, adjectives, etc. in terms of which the "primitive ACT's" are qualified.
264:334	If such additional condcnsntion werc attempted, the elaboration of a given utterance in terms of the full set of "primitives" might well ramify without practical end.
265:334	In other words, reduction of the set of names L'or nodes (and labels for arcs) must be purchased at the expense of extending the number of them required to represent each utterance, In conceptual dependency representation, just as in the sernantic networks" of Quillinn [6], Simmons ([I I], [12]), Slocum, and others, reality ultimately appears as a shimmering web, every part of which trembles when any part of it is touched upon.
266:334	Taken in its totality, the system -as yet -is entirely compatible with skepticism about a corrrprehensive set of "conceptual primitives" In any case, the verbal "senses" proposed here lie at a far lower level of generality than the "primitive ACT's" used in conceptual dependency theory.
267:334	In terms of that theory, they come closest to the so-called "CONCEXICON entries" used by Goldman in realizing surface expressions 'of a concept from its conceptual representation [2].
268:334	Given a primitive ACT, Goldman narrows it down to a particular "CONCEXICON" entry by applying the tests in a discrin~ination tree to the rest of the structure in which the ACT appears.
269:334	Our lexical "senses", therefore, are lcft with a humbled role.
270:334	If they span anything, it might best be thought of as "communication space", not "conceptual space".
271:334	Even in this light, they arc a hugely redundant basis, and a not at all unique one.
272:334	They form no inventory of the experiences being communicated about; "meaning" is still a step removed, still evoked rather than embodied by the elements of this basis.
273:334	If we persist in calling these things "senses", it is because that is the traditional term for what is brought to mind as the synonym sets of a given word are enumerated.
274:334	The tie-in with meaning is tenuous, but the human user is able to supply it.
275:334	There is at least this much justification for the term: synonym sets, more forcefully than words, direct attention to the points at which a tie-in must be made between the tokens of communication and the underlying representation of "world knowledge" An Organization for a Dictionary of Word Senses 2 1 In a full-fledged system for processing natural language, then, we must envision the "dictionary of senses" as a component stretching vertically across the "upper" layers.
276:334	Its "sense data items" must link, ifi some way, to the deeper-lying data structures which encode "knowledge of the world" (the "pragmatic component").
277:334	The "key data items" and "phrase data items" register tokens to be expected or employed in "surfzrce" utterances.
278:334	Global and local attributes recorded in the various data items guide parsing and interpretation.
279:334	Where one takes it froin there depends upon thc linguistic approach to be used.

When addressed to an abstract Tb1 the question is absurd, but not when addressed to a physically realized TM.
290:334	Putiirlm equivocates about the notion of stnte, discussirig only abstract TM's when introducing the notion of state, but making an argument which is cohcrer~t only with respect ot a physicaliy renli~cd TM.
291:334	There is thus, in effect, n cot)fusion between 'state' as of an ai1t0111;lt n rind 'stnte' as of a real Y machine which is executing a program which rcalizes that automaton--any of a iiun~ber of states of the machine might correspond to one state of the nutonlaton embodied in the progranl.
292:334	Thus Putnam's argument fails.
293:334	Clarke's criticisms of Putnam are rilisguided but instructive.
294:334	A more serious notion of ir~achine privacy can be constructed by noting that it is impossible to inter the machine's real activitity deterrninately from the content of registers.

Ncroth University of California, Berkeley Computers & Grapltics I:227-231, 1975 The experimental problem solving environrnen t is one of formulating specifying, debugging and executing (algebraic) procedures interactively on a small processor.
296:334	The speech recognition system is a real time, syntax directed, limited vocabulary, highly cost effective scheme specifically tailored to this environment.
297:334	The data transformation operations of the language are verbally specified and the control flow is specified graphically as a twodimensional directed graph.
298:334	The semantics of the latter structure is independent of the time sequence of its input.
299:334	An input restricted (conditional input) pseudo-finite state machine model is used for the continuous syntax checking of the input on an atomic token basis and for directing the speech recognizer.
