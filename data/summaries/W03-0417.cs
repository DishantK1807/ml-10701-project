State-of-theart machine learning techniques including Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1995), AdaBoost (Schapire and Singer, 2000) and Maximum Entropy Models (Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Berger et al., 1996) provide high performance classifiers if one has abundant correctly labeled examples.

Until now, many methods have been proposed for this problem including winnow-based algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1999), differential grammars (Powers, 1998), transformation based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994).

Those approaches include a naive Bayes classifier combined with the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; Nigam et al., 2000; Pedersen and Bruce, 1998), Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Nigam and Ghani, 2000), and Transductive Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1999).

The effect of a huge amount of unlabeled data for confusion set disambiguation is discussed in (Banko and Brill, 2001).
P01-1005
Yarowsky (1995) presented an approach that significantly reduces the amount of labeled data needed for word sense disambiguation.
