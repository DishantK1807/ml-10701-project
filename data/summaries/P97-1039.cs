Two teams of researchers have reported results on the same "parliamentary debates" bitext for algorithms that map correspondence at the sentence level (Gale & Church, 1991a; Simard et al., 1992).

In 1991, two teams of researchers independently discovered that sentences can be accurately aligned by matching sequences 310 with similar lengths (Gale & Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1991).

In the nontechnical Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debate transcripts available in English and in French), cognates can be found for roughly one quarter of all text tokens (Melamed, 1995).

For example, a tool originally designed for automatic detection of omissions in translations (Melamed, 1996b) was adopted to detect misalignments.

Although sentence maps do not have sufficient resolution for some important bitext applications (Melamed, 1996b; Macklovitch, 1995), sentences were an easy starting point, because their order rarely changes during translation.

correspondence points associated with frequent token types (Church, 1993) or by deleting frequent token types from the bitext altogether (Dagan et al., 1993).

1995; Melamed, 1996b).

Soon thereafter, Church (1993) found that bitext mapping at the sentence level is not an option for noisy bitexts found in the real world.

In addition to their use in machine translation (Sato & Nagao, 1990; Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997), translation models can be applied to machineassisted translation (Sato, 1992; Foster et al., 1996), cross-lingual information retrieval (SIGIR, 1996), and gisting of World Wide Web pages (Resnik, 1997).

As the search rectangle grows, it will eventually intersect with the TBM, even if the discontinuity is quite large (Melamed, 1996b).

Early bitext mapping algorithms focused on sentences (Kay & RSscheisen, 1993; Debili & Sammouda, 1992).

Melamed (1996a) showed that sentence boundary information can be used to convert SIMR's output into sentence alignments that are more accurate than those obtained by either of the other two approaches.

In other cases, they can be constructed automatically or semi-automatically using any of several methods (Fung, 1995; Melamed, 1996c; Resnik & Melamed, 1997).

Bitexts also play a role in less automated applications such as concordancing for bilingual lexicography (Catizone et al., 1993; Gale & Church, 1991b), computer-assisted language learning, and tools for translators (e.g.
H91-1026 P91-1023
The cognate heuristic of the character-based algorithms works better at the word level, because cognateness can be defined more precisely in terms of words, e.g. using the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (Melamed, 1995).

One important application of bitext maps is the construction of translation lexicons (Dagan et al., 1993) and, as discussed, translation lexicons are an important information source for bitext mapping.

Church's char_align algorithm (Church, 1993) is the only algorithm that does not use sentence boundary information for which comparable results have been reported, char_align's RMS error on this bitext was 57 characters, exactly ten times higher.

These filters can be efficiently combined so that SIMR's expected running time and memory requirements are linear in the size of the input bitext (Melamed, 1996a).

When dealing with language pairs that have dissimilar alphabets, the matching predicate can employ phonetic cognates (Melamed, 1996a).

Function words are translated inconsistently and make unreliable points of correspondence (Melamed, 1996a).

This distribution can be compared to error distributions reported in (Church, 1993) and in (Dagan et al., 1993).
