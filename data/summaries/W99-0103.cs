Figure 1: Motivational example I Previous rescaw, h on a multi-modal dialogue system was focused on finding the relationship between a pointing gesture and a deictic expression (Bolt (1980), Neal et al.(1988), Salisbury et al.(1990.), Shimazu et al.(1994), Shimazu and Takmhima (1996))and on mapping a predefined symbol to a simple t S means a multi-modal dialogue system and U means a user.

To resolve referring expression, one of the well known methods is centering theory developed by Grosz, Jo~hi, and Weinstein (Grosz et al.(1983)). The centering algorithm was further developed by Brennan, Friedman and Pollard for pronoun resolution (Brennan et al.(1987)) and was improved by Walker (Walker (1998)).

21 command (Johnston et al.(1997)). None of them, however, suggest methods of resolving deictic expressions with which pointing gestures are omitted: e.g.. the red item in utterance (8).

If the items have the same priority, the algorithm ranks them by the obliqueness of grammatical relation of the subcategorized functions of the main verb: that is, first the subject, object, and objects2, followed by other subcategorized fen~ons, and finally, adjuncts (Grosz and Sidner (1986), Brennan et ul.
