It is an upgraded version from the one discussed in Delmonte (1999;2002a;2002b) and tries to incorporate as much as possible of the more sophisticated version implemented in the complete GETARUN (see Delmonte 1990;1991;1992;1994; 2003;2004).

Fig. 1 GETARUNS AR algorithm 3.2 Focussing Revisited Our version of the focussing algorithm follows Sidnerâ€™s proposal (Sidner C., 1983; Grosz B., Sidner C., 1986), to use a Focus Stack, a certain Focus Algorithm with Focus movements and data structures to allow for processing simple inferential relations between different linguistic descriptions co-specifying or coreferring to a given entity.

In a number of papers (Delmonte 1990;1991; 1992;1994; 2003;2004) and in a book (Delmonte 1992) we described our algorithms and the theoretical background which inspired it.
