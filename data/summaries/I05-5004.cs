From this viewpoint, research on paraphrasing has adapted techniques fostered in the literature of machine translation (MT), such as transformation algorithms (Lavoie et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 2001), corpus-based techniques for paraphrase pattern acquisition (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004), and fluency measurements (Lapata, 2001; Fujita et al., 2004).

Toour best knowledge, the paraphrase corpus developed by Dolan et al.(2004) is one of the very few collections available for free1.

Some studies exploit topically related articles derived from multiple news sources (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Dolan et al., 2004).
