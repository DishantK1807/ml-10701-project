Approaches The ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER programme in the US, now entering its third phase, has also produced a data-driven architecture for NLP systems (Grishman, 1996).

We plan to provide this type of control in GATE via collaboration with the Corelli project at CRL, New Mexico see (Zajac, 1997) for more details.

Our response to these considerations has been to design and implement a software environment called GATE a General Architecture for Text Engineering (Cunningham, Gaizauskas, and Wilks, 1995; Cunningham, Wilks, and Gaizauskas, 1996) which attempts to meet the following objectives: 1.

NLP systems produce information about texts 1, and existing systems that aim to provide software infrastructure for NLP can be classified as belonging to one of three types according to the way in which they treat this information: additive, or markup-based: information produced is added to the text in the form of markup, e.g. in SGML (Thompson and McKelvie, 1996); referential, or annotation-based: information is stored separately with references back to the original text, e.g. in the TIPSTER architecture (Grishman, 1996); abstraction-based: the original text is preserved in processing only as parts of an integrated data structure that represents information about the text in a uniform theoretically-motivated model, e.g. attribute-value structures in the ALEP system (Simkins, 1994).

5 VIE: An Application In GATE To illustrate the process of converting pre-existing LE systems into GATE-compatible CREOLE sets we use as an example the creation of VIE (Vanilla Information Extraction system) from LaSIE (LargeScale Information Extraction system) (Gaizauskas et al., 1995), Sheffield's entry in the MUC-6 system evaluations.
M95-1017
The initial distribution of the system includes a MUC-6 (Message Understanding Conference 6 (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996)) style information extraction (IE) system and an overview 1These texts may sometimes be the results of automatic speech recognition see section 2.6. 237 of these modules is given.

The TIPSTER architecture has been fully specified (Grishman, 1996) and its specification should be consulted for further details, in particular for definitions of the API.
C96-1079
Related points are that: TIPSTER avoids the difficulties referred to earlier of representing graphstructured information in SGML; LT NSL is inefficient where processing algorithms require non-sequential access to data (McKelvie, Brew, and Thompson, 1997).

Figure 1 shows an example from (Grishman, 1996).
C96-1079
LaSIE was designed as a research system for investigating approaches to information extraction and to be entered into the MUC-6 conference (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996).
