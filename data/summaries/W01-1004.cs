On the one hand machine learning is used to automate as much as possible the tasks an IE expert would perform in application development (Cardie 1997) (Yangarber et al.2000). The goal here is to reduce the porting time to a new application (and hence the cost).

In the literature approaches to construction of taxonomies of concepts have been proposed (Brown et al.1992, McMahon and Smith 1996, Sanderson and Croft 1999).

In addition we intend to employ classic Information Extraction techniques (described below) such as named entity recognition (Humphreys et al.1998) in order to pre-process the text, as the identification of complex terms such as proper names, dates, numbers, etc, allows to reduce data sparseness in learning (Ciravegna 2000).

The main challenge for NLG will be to develop robust and efficient techniques for knowledge publishing which can operate on large-scale knowledge resources and support the personalised presentation of diverse information, such as speech, video, text, graphics (see (Maybury 2001)).

The University of Sheffield has pioneered in the Gate and Gate 2 projects the development of an architecture for text engineering (Cunningham et al.1997), (Cunningham et al.2000). Given the modular architecture and component structure of Gate, it is natural to build on this basis to extend the capabilities of Gate so as to provide the most suitable possible environment for tool development, implementation and evaluation in AKT.
