Generators with "open" architectures include Jacobs' PHRED/Jacobs 1985a/, which allows hashing on any factor for lexical access; and FIG, in which any factor can be a source of activation.

The key characteristic for generation is that this representation is a semantic network which includes language knowledge, after Jacobs /Jacobs 1985b/.

(versus "a floating peach'3 KING's knowledge consists of a taxonomy of concepts/Jacobs 1985b/, so it can simply choose the most "specific" word.

Jacobs' KING exploited a uniform representation but relied on diverse algorithms and processes/Jacobs 1985b/.

Commnnly distinguished are open-class words and closed-class words /Pustejovsky and Nirenburg 1987/or content words and function words /Kempen and Hoenkamp 1987/, phrase-heads and modifiers/Goldman 1974/, and words with valence and words without.

Jacobs' KING /Jacobs 1985b/ "searches" through world knowledge to find words.

It is hard, if not impossible, to fix an order such that no choice is made before a choice which it depends on/Danlos 1984/.

This information is v ariou sly called a ' 'message," ' ' meaning," "content," or "realization specification\]' Many have pointed out, however, that such a "message" can not contain enough information/Appelt 1985//Danlos 1984/ /Hovy 1987L In particular, even seemingly mundane choices of words can be sensitive to the speakers goals.
P84-1107
However, most research so far has focused on syntactic choice; word choice has received little attention/Pustejovsky and Nirenburg 1987/.
