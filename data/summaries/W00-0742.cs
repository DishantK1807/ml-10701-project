Among these studies, (Pustejovsky et al., 1993) presents a research whose aim is to acquire GL nominal qualia structures from a corpus; this work is however quite different from ours because it supposes that the qualia structure contents are initialized and are only refined with the help of the corpus by using the type coercion 3 mechanism.

For example, (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997) and (Faure and N~dellec, 1999) try to automatically learn verbal argument structures and selectional restrictions; (Agarwal, 1995) and (Bouaud et al., 1997) build semantic classes; (Hearst, 1992) and (Morin, 1997) focus on particular lexical relations, like hyperonymy.
