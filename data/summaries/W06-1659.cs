The approaches proposed to the ACE RDC task such as kernel methods (Zelenko et al., 2002) and Maximum Entropy methods (Kambhatla, 2004) required the availability of large set of human annotated corpora which are tagged with relation instances.

We conducted two groups of experiments, the first with simple syntactic tuple matching, and the second with semantic tuple clustering as described in section 4.3 6 Results and Discussion We compare our results to a state-of-the-art supervised system similar to the system described in (Kambhatla, 2004).

Other works tried to exploit the duality of patterns and their extractions for the purpose of inferring the semantic class of words like (Thelen & Riloff, 2002) and (Lin et al, 2003).

We use the similarity P P P P P T T T T T P P T T Patterns Tuples Figure 2: A bipartite graph representing patterns and tuples 504 measure described in (Wu and Palmer, 1994) which finds the path length to the root node from the least common subsumer (LCS) of the two word senses which is the most specific word sense they share as an ancestor.
