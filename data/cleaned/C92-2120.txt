CONSTRUCTION OF CORPUS-BASED SYNTACTIC RULES FOR ACCURATE SPEECH RECOGNITION JUNKO HOSAKA TOSHIYUKI TAKEZAWA ATR Interpreting Telephony Research Laboratories Hikaridai 2-2, Seika-cho, Soraku-gun Kyoto 619-02, Japan hosaka@at r-la.at r.co.jp takezawaQat r-la.~t r.co.j p Abstract This paper describes the syntactic rules which are applied in the Japanese speech recognition module of a speech-to-speech translation system.
Japanese is considered to be a free word/phrase order language.
Since syntactic rules are applied as constraints to reduce the search space in speech recognition, applying rules which take into account all possible phrase orders can have almost the same effect as using no constraints.
Instead, we take into consideration the recognition weaknesses of certain syntactic categories and treat them precisely, so that a miuimal number of rules can work most effectively.
In this paper we first examine which syntactic categories are easily misrecognized.
Second, we consult our dialogue corpus, in order to provide the rules with great generality.
Based ou both stndies, we refine the rules.
Finally, we verify the validity of the refinement through speech recognition experiments.
1 Introduction
We are developing the Spoken Language Tl~ANSlation system (SL-TRANS)\[1\], in which both speech recognition processing and natural language processing arc integrated.
Currently we are studying automatic speech translation from Japanese into English in the domain of dialogues with the re ception service of an international conference office.
In this framework we are constructing syntactic rules for recognition of Japanese speech.
In speech recognition, the most significant concern is raising the recognition accuracy.
For that purpose, applying linguistic information turns out to be promising.
Various approaches have been taken, such as using stochastic models\[2\], syntactic rules\[3\], semantic information\[4\] and discourse plans\[5\].
Among stochastic models, the bigram and trigram succeeded in achieving a high recognition accuracy in languages that have a strong tendency toward a standard word order, such as English.
On the contrary, Japanese belongs to free word order languages\[6\].
For such a language, semantic information is more adequate a.s a constraint.
However, building semantic constraints for a large vocabulary needs a tremendous amount of data.
Currently, our data consist of dialogues between the conference registration office and prospective conference participants with approximately 199,000 words in telephone conversations and approximately 72,000 words in keyboard conversations.
But our data are still not sufficient to build appropriate semantic constraints for sentences with 700 distinct words.
Processing a discourse plan requires excessive calculation and the study of discourse itself must be further developed to be applicable to speech recognition.
On the other hand, syntax has been studied in more detail and makes increasing the vocabulary easier.
As we are working on spoken language, we try to reflect real language usage.
For this purpose, a stochastic approach beyond trigrams, namely stochastic sentence parsing\[7\], seems most promising.
Ideally, syntactic rules should be generated automatically from a large dialogue corpus and probabilities should also be automatically assigned to each node.
But to do so, we need underlying rules.
Moreover, coping with phoneme perplexity, which is crucial to speech recognition, with rules created frmn a dialogue corpus, requires additional research\[8\].
In this paper we propose taking into account tile weaknesses of the speech recogniton system in the earliest stage, namely when we construct underlying syntactic rules.
First, we examined the speech recognition results to determine which Syntactic categories tend to be recognized erroneously.
Second, we utilized our dialogue corpus\[9\] to support the refinement of rules concerning those categories.
As examples, we discuss formal nouns 1 and conjunctive postposi~ions 2.
Finally, we carried out a speech recognition experiment with the refined rules to verify the validity of our approach.

23-28, 1992 2 Issues in HMM-LR Speech Recognition in the Japanese speech recognition module of our experimental system the combination of generalized I,R parsing and fIidden Markov Model (IIMM) is realized ~s IIMM-LR \[10\].
The system predicts phonetnes by using an LR parsing table and drives IIMM phoneme verifiers to detect/verify them without any intervening structure, such as a phoneme lattice.
The speech recognition unit is a Japanese bunselsu, which roughly corresponds to a phrase and is the next largest unit after the word.
The ending of the bunselsu (phrase) is usually marked by a breath point.
This justities its treatment as a distinct unit.
A Japanese phrase consists of one independent word (e.g.
noun, adverb, verb) and zero, one or more than one dependent words (e.g.
postposition, auxiliary verb).
The nmnber of words in a phreLse ranges from 1 to 14, and the mean number is about 3, according to our dialogue corpus.
We will clarify the weaknesses of HMM-Llt speech recognition both in phrases and in sentences.
2.1 Phrase
Recognition Errors We examined which syntactic categories tmtd to be erroneously recognized, when using IIMM-LR pltraae speech recognition.
For this purl)ose, we applied syntactic rules containing no constraints on word sequences s.
This me,ms tllat any word can follow any word.
Examples (1) and (2) show the resnlts of IIMM-LH Japanese speech recognition "l.
The nttered phoneme strings are enclosed in I I.

In the examples, the symbols >, -, ng and N have special meaning: A correctly recognized plmme is nmrked with >.
® A word boundary is marked with -.
A nasalized /g/is transcribed ng.
* A syllabic nasal is transcribed N.
In (1), after recognizing the tirst word, the system selected subsequent words solely to produce a phoneme string similar to the original utterance.
(2) is an example of phrase recognition which failed.
In this example tou was erroneously recognized as to.
Suhsequently, no fllrther correet words were selected.
Examples (1) and (2) both show that IIMM-LR tends to select words consisting of extremely few phonemes when it fails in word recognition.
To avoid this problem, precise rules should be written fin' sequences of words with small nnmbers of phonemes.
In Japmmse, postpositions(e.g, ga, o, nit, wh-pronouiis(e.g, itsu, nani, claret\[Ill, numerals(e.g.
ichi, hi, san) and certain nouns(e.g, kata, mono) particularly tit this description.
2.2 Sentence
il.ecognition Errors To exanfine the error tendency of sentence speech recognition we applied a two-step method\[12\].
First, we applied phra~e rules to the ItMM-LR speech recognition s.
Second, we applied phrase-ba-sed sentence rules tt, the phrase candidates as a post-filter, in order to obtain sentence candidates, while filterins out unacceptable candidates.
We experimented with the 353 phrases making up 1:/7 sentences.
The recognition rate ff)r the top candidates wins 68.3 % by exact string tnatching, and for the top 5 candidates 95.5 %.
Based on the top 5 phr~me candidates, we condncted a ;;entente experiment, ht this experiment we applied loosely constrained sentence rules.
With these rules, altproxinnttely 80 % of all the possibh', combinations of phrase candidates were re-.
cepted. Following are examples which did not exactly match the uttered sentences a . Notice that misrecognized words consist of a relatively small number of phoneluesj gig }ve have seen iil section 2.1.

While (3) is affirmative, 3b is interrogative, which is indicated by the sentence final postposition ka.
This cannot be treated with sentence rules.
To haudle this problem, we need dialogue management.
The uttered phrase kochira-~a in (4), meaning "this," was recognized erroneously as kat.a-wa in 4a, meaning "person".
The word kata belongs to the formal noun group, a kind of noun which should be modified by a verbal phrase \[13\].
Sentence 4a is acceptable, if modified by a verbal phrase, as in 4a': 4a': midori-no seihukn-o kiteiru kata-wa kaigizimukyoku-desu (The person who is wearing a green uniform is \[with\] the conference office).
This is also true of the phrase mono in 5c meaning "thing," which was erroneously recognized instead of doumo meaning "very much": 5c': kouka-na mono aringat-ou-gozaima-shi-ta (Thank you for the expensive thing).
In sentence candidates 5a and 5b, the numeral go, meaning "five," is used.
These sentences may seem strange at first glance, but in a situation such as playing cards, these sentences are quite natural.
If someone plays a 5 when you need one, you would say: "Thanks for the five".
Similarly, when you need a 3 and a 5, and someone plays a 3 and after that someone else plays a 5, you would say: "Thanks for the five, too".
In the sentence candidate 6a, the conjunetiveposlposilion (conj-pp) shi is used sentence finally.
In principle, a conj~pp combines two sentences, functioning like a conjunction, such as "while" and "though," and is used in the middle of a sentence.
Erroneous sentence recognition such as in the case of 3a-b cannot be treated by sentence rules.
Therefore, we are trying to cope with erroneous recognition, as seen in sentence candidates 4a, 5a-c and 6a, with sentence rules.
3 Dealing
with Speech Recognition Errors We are going to deal with sentences containing tile following phrases: • Phrases with formal nouns • Phrases with numerals • Phrases with conj-pps used in the sentence final position In order to decide how to cope with the above problems, we used our dialogue corpus.
Currently we have 177 keyboard conversations consisting of approximately 72,000 words and 181 telephone conversations consisting of approxilnately 199,000 words 7.
We regard keyboard conversations as representing written Japanese and telephone conversations as representing spoken Japanese.
When retrieving the dialogue corpus, we always compare written and spoken Japanese, in order to clarify the features of the latter.
We examined the actuM usage of formal nouns as well as that of eonj-pps.
3.1 Formal
Nouns We examined the behavior of formal nouns, such as koto and mono.
Formal nouns are considered to be a kind of noun which lacks the content usually found in common nouns such as "sky" or "apple".
They function similarly to relative pronouns and therefore are used with a verbal modifier\[13\], as in examples 7 and 8: 7 : kinou ilia koto~wa torikeshitai.
(I would like to take back what I said yesterday).
8 : nedan-ga takai mono-ga shitsu-ga ii wakedewanai.
(It is not always true that an expensive thing has good quality).
In examples 7 and S, the formal nouns, kolo and mono, are modified by kinou ilia (yesterday said) and nedan-ga takai (price expensive), respectively.
But it is also true that these nouns behave like common nouns and can be used without any verbal modifier, as in examples 9 and 10: 9 : sore-wa koto desu ne.
7The dialogue corpus is ?.rowing constantly.
When we retrieved formM nouns, we had 113 keyboard conversations and 96 telephone conversations.

10 : mono-wa ta.shika-da.
(This stuff is trustworthy).
Considering the examples 7-10, we coukl define two kinds of usage for formal nouns.
This distinction is applicable to sentence analysis, but is meaningless from the standpoint of applying syntactic rules ms constraints.
3.1.1 Formal
Nouns in the Corpus Ill our dialogue corpus, koto, mono, hou and kata are tile most frequently used formal nouns.
Table 1 shows how often tile formal nouns are used with a verbal modifier.
We have also rctrieved formal nouns used in the sentence initial position, w~ in example 10.
Table 1: Formal Nouus Keyboard \] Telepho~ With Verb.
Mod. Without Verb.
Mod. Sent.
Initial Total 214 3 0,~72 po I~ Table 1 indicates that tile coverage reaches 63 % in written Japanese, when we allow only formal nouns preceded by a verbal modifier in the syntactic rules.
llowever, the coverage remains at 40 %, which is less than half, in the spoken Japanese we are dealing with.
We have further examined those sentences in which fortnal nouns are not modified by verbals.
Most of them are modified by phrases consisting of a noun and postposition no, which approximately corresponds to "of".
Further, some are modified by phrases cousist~ ing of a verb tbllowed by postpositions to and no.
Others are moditled by words which cars be used exclusively,as nominal modifiers such as donna (what kind of) and sono (that).
We found only one exampie in the keyboard conversation in which a fortnal noun is not modified at all: 11 : osorakn kyouju-ni koto-no shidm-o tsutaeru koto-ga ii-to omoim~su.
(it might be good if you tell the professor how the tiring is going).
In our diMogue corpus we found 2,491 phrases con taining the formal nouns kolo, mono, hou and kala.
Out of 2,491 examples, there is only one which is not modified at all.
If we define formal lsouns,~s those which are always modilied in some manner, i.e. even if we do not allow formal nouns to be used alone, the coverage still exceeds 99 %.
Since the occurrence rate of formal nmms without ally moditier is very low, we can treat the usage of formal nouns (as in examples 9-11) as semi-frozen expressions.
3.2 Conjunctive
Postpositions Japanese pc,stpositions such m~ 9 a, o and hi, which function a.s case markers, are usually attached to nominals.
Different from this kind of postposition, conj-pps such a~s ga, te and ba are used after verbMs.
Conj-pps combine two clauses, fimctiouing similarly to conjunctions such as "because" and "whilc," and are thus often used in the middle of a sentence, as in example 12.
But they cars also be used in the sentence final position,,as ill exmnple 13.
12: kaigi-ni mousikomi-tai-no-desu-ga, DttT mousikomiyousi-o ookurikudasai.
AKK \]\]ecanse I would like to apply for the conference, plee, se send me a registration form.
13: kaigi-ni mousikomi-tui-uo-desu-ga.
DA\]' 1 would like to apply for the conference, ...
Example 13 sounds vague, if uttered in isolation.
There should follow some additional words to express the complete meaning.
Sentences finishing with a eonj-pp leave the interpretation to tile hearer.
And, in general, the hearer can correctly interpret the sentence from the context.
Understanding conj-pps, therefore, plays an important role in treating spoken Japanese.
3.2.1 Sentence
Final Conj-pps in the Corpus In the dialogue corpus the following conj-pps are used: ga (beeanse, while), node and udc (because), te aud~ (and), k.r~ 0 ......... fret), k'~,'~.,l ...... k~,'edo, kedo and kedomo (though, but), shi (and, and then), ....... de (because), tara (if), to (if, when), ba (if) and nagara (while).
Table 2 shows conj-pps used sentence finally.
According to Table 2, the conj-pp ga is the one most used in keyboard conversations.
While the usage of conj-pps in keyboard conversations is heavily concentrated on ga with all occurrence rate of 85%, it is more balanced m telephone conversations.
In addition to ga (38%), kcredomo (30%) and conj-pps which carry a similar meaning such as kercdo, kedo and kedomo are frequently used.
In telephone conversations, node (13%) is also frequently nsed.
Treating only the six conj-pps in sentence final position, the coverage reaches 91% for Sl)oken Japanese.
l)itt~ren~ tiatmg conj-pps which can Ire used in sentence final position i?om those which can be used only in the middle of a sentence is also supported by the speech recognition results\[14\].
The conj-pps shi and cha are especially subject to erroneous recognition.

AIM we decided to treat numerals only in a restricted en-vironment, because they are significant noise factors in speech rccognitionS: • Phrases with formal nouns nmst be modified.
• Phrases with numerals can be used only ill certain environments.
Numerals are allowed in addresses, telephone numbers, dates aim prices.
Japanese nnlYlera\]s consist of all extremely small number of phonemes, e.g. ichi, hi, san (1, 2, 3) and are therefore especially easy to misrecognize 9.
"\['bus, they should be strongly constrained.
The domain we have chosen is limited to dialogues between all international conferenee receptkmist and prospcctive participants and we are going to deal only with tile anticipated usage in the domain.
Another condition, sue\]l as playing cards, will be treated when speech recognition is further improved.
• We classify conj-pps into two groups: conj-pps which call be used in the sentence final position as well as in the milldlc of a sentence, and conjpps which can be used only ill the nfiddle of a seutence.
We refined the loosely constrained syntactic rules introduced ill section 2.2. ill the new version of the sentence rules, formal nouns, numerals and eonjq)ps are more precisely treated.
Ill the following, we ex plain the rules for formal nouns and conj-llpS.

But in the case of a formal noun IqN-FOKK file phrase must be modified.
Phrases with a conj-pp which is exclusively used in tile middle of a sentence vaux-s, those with a eonjpp which is used both ill the middle of a sentence and in tile sentence final vaux-s+~, and verb phrases without any eonj-pps vaux, are treated as follows: (<SS> <--> (<NVS>)) (<NVS> <--> (<VS>)) (<VS> <--> (<VC>)) (<VS> <--> (<ADVPH> <VS>)) <ADVPH> <--> (<ADV-s>)) (<ADV-s> <--> (<ADVI>)) (<ADV-s> <--> (<ADVI> <ADV-s>)) <ADVP}I> <--> (<ADV-c>)) (<ADV~c> <--> (<VADVS>)) (<VADVS> <--> (<VADV>)) (<VADVS> <--> (<ADV-s> <VADVS>)) (<VADV> <--> (<vaux-s>)) (<VADV> <--> (<vaux-s+f>)) (<VC> <--> (<vaux>)) (<VC> <--> (<vaux-s+f>)) A sentence SS does uot always need a noun phrase.
A sentence SS can consist of only one verb phrase VC, or call be preceded by adverbial pfir,~ses ADVPH.
A sentence SS can end either with a verb phrase without a conj-pps vaux or with a verb phrase with a certain kind of conj-pps vaux-s+:f.

But in the No Grmamar case we determined tile rank solely based on phoneme probability.

The phrase recognition rate for the top 5 candidates was again 95.5% by exact string matching.

For constructing rules we took into account the error tendency in speech recognition.
We treated precisely those syntactic categories which tend to be recognized erroneously.
To increase the efficacy of each rule, the rule construction is strongly motivated by our dialogue corpus.
By applying the refined phrase-based syntactic rules, the speech recognition rate for the top candidates improved from 37.2 % to 70.1% and for the top 5 candidates from 73.7 % to 83.9 %.
The implementation of syntactic rules bascd on our dialogue corpus is continuing in order to increase coverage.
Currently we are studying postposition deletion in nominal phrases, which is one of the features of spoken Japanese.
When adding rules and enlarging vocabulary, we cammt avoid decreasing speech recognition accuracy, but our further experiments showed that careful rule construction filtered out unacceptable sentence candidates much more effectively.
Though we believe that our dialogue corpus for the, current domain provides enough expressions of spoken Japanese, we are going to apply the same method to other domains to establish the generality of the rules.
