In previous research on semantic lexicon induction, Roark and Charniak (Roark and Charniak, 1998) showed that 3 of every 5 words learned by their system were not present in WordNet.

In one set of experiments, we generated lexicons for PEOPLE and ORGANIZATIONS using 2500 Wall Street Journal articles from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

Hearst (Hearst, 1992) extracted information from lexico-syntactic expressions that explicitly indicate hyponymic relationships.
C92-2082
For example, Hearst (Hearst, 1992) learned hyponymy relationships by collecting words in lexico-syntactic expressions, such as “NP, NP, and other NPs”, and Roark and Charniak (Roark and Charniak, 1998) generated semantically related words by applying statistical measures to syntactic contexts involving appositives, lists, and conjunctions.

Caraballo (Caraballo, 1999) also exploited these syntactic structures and applied a cosine vector model to produce semantic groupings.
P99-1016
Roark and Charniak (Roark and Charniak, 1998) followed up on this work by using a parser to explicitly capture these structures.
P98-2182
For example, Riloff and Shepherd (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) developed a statistical co-occurrence model for semantic lexicon induction that was designed with these structures in mind.

Some researchers (Roark and Charniak, 1998; Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) have applied statistical methods to identify the strongest semantic associations.

Named entity recognizers (e.g., (Bikel et al., 1997; Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999)) can be trained to recognize proper names associated with semantic categories such as PERSON or ORGANIZATION, but they typically are not aimed at learning common nouns such as “surgeon” or “drugmaker”.
