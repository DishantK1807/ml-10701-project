The mapping for the dependents in the alternation can be taken from existing lexical resources (Dorr, 1997), learned from corpora (McCarthy, 2000) or learned from existing lexicons (Bond et al., 2002).

This is still the approach taken by large projects such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or OntoSem.
