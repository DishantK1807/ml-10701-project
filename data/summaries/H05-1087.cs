Scenarios in which log-linear models have been applied often involve simple binary classification decisions or probability assignments, as in the following three examples: Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994) consider a restricted form of the prepositional phrase attachment problem where attachment decisions are binary; Ittycheriah et al.(2003) reduce entity mention tracking to the problem of modeling the probability of two mentions being linked; and Greiff and Ponte (2000) develop models of probabilistic information retrieval that involve binary decisions of relevance.

This is analogous, and in a certain sense equivalent, to empirical risk minimization, which has been used successfully in related areas, such as speech recognition (Rahim and Lee, 1997), language modeling (Paciorek and Rosenfeld, 2000), and machine translation (Och, 2003).
