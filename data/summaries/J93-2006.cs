We tested capitalization separately, since some data, such as that in the Third Message Understanding Conference (Sundheim 1991) is uppercase only.

Our own natural language database query systems, JANUS (Weischedel et al.1989), ParlanceTM, 1 and Delphi (Stallard 1989), have used these techniques quite successfully.

An alternative to traditional parsers is represented in FIDDITCH (Hindle 1983), MITFP (de Marcken 1990), and CASS (Abney 1990).
H90-1052
Statistical models based on local information (e.g., DeRose 1988; Church 1988) might operate effectively in spite of sentence length and unexpected input.

In these experiments, we used the grammar of the Delphi component from BBN's HARC system (Stallard 1989), which combines syntax and semantics in a unification formalism.

It was run as a preprocessor to Grishman's Proteus system for the MUC-3 competition (Grishman and Sterling 1989).
H89-2011
Traditionally such semantic knowledge is handcrafted, though some software aids exist to enable greater productivity (Ayuso, Shaked, and Weischedel 1987; Bates 1989; Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan 1986; Weischedel et al.1989). Instead of handcrafting this semantic knowledge, our goal is to learn that knowledge from examples, using a three-step process: 1.

The effectiveness of such models is well known (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Kupiec 1989; Jelinek 1985), and they are currently in use in parsers (e.g.
A88-1019 H89-2014 J88-1003
Work In addition to the work discussed earlier on tools to increase the portability of natural language systems, another recent paper (Hindle and Rooth 1990) is directly related to our goal of inferring case frame information from examples.
H90-1052
Some well-known previous efforts (Church 1988; de Marcken 1990) have dealt with unknown words using various heuristics.

Rather in the domain of terrorist incidents of the Third Message Understanding conference (MUC-3) (Sundheim 1991), roughly 20,000 vocabulary items appear in a corpus 430,000 words long.
M91-1001
De Marcken (1990) developed an approximate method for finding multiple tags for each word given the preceding words and one following word.
P90-1031
Chitrao and Grishman (1990) used a similar context-free model.
H90-1053
In a related test, we explored the bracketings produced by Church's PARTS program (Church 1988).
