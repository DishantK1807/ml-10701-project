(Lin, 1998), (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997)) by using a statistical base, and on the other hand from state-of-the-art statistical approaches (e.g.
A97-1011
The parser has been trained, developed and tested on a large collection of syntactically analyzed sentences, the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
J93-2004
These results, slightly lower than state-of-the-art ((Lin, 1998), (Preiss, 2003)), are least merit figures or a proof of concept rather than accurate figures.

Heads are extracted from the chunks and lemmatized (Minnen et al., 2000).

For tagging, (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997) have shown that a manually built tagger can equal a statistical tagger.
