Other researchers, not wishing to abandon context-flee grammar (CI"G) but disillusioned with its lexica\] blind spot, have tried to re-parameterize stochastic CI"G in context-sensitive ways (Black et al., 1992) or have augmented the formalism with lexical headwords (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 11996).
