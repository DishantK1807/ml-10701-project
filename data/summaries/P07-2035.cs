Work HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) and WordNet provide domain information for Chinese and English, but there has been no domain resource for Japanese that are publicly available.8 Domain dictionary construction methods that have been developed so far are all based on highly structured lexical resources like LDOCE or WordNet (Guthrie et al., 1991; Agirre et al., 2001) and hence not applicable to languages for which such highly structured lexical resources are not available.

Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.
