The best system in the MUC-6 named entity task, using hand-coded rules, returned F-Measures of 98.50 for person, 96.96 for place, and 92.48 for entity as shown in Table 3 (Krupka, 1995). We found that RoboTag's best English results were obtained with a sampling ratio of 10, a radius of 2, and certainty factors of 0.75 for pruning for all the tag types.
