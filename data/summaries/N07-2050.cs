Compared to European-language NER, Chinese NER seems to be more difficult (Yu et al., 2006).

It has been demonstrated that Boosting can be used to build language-independent NER models that perform exceptionally well (Wu et al.(2002), Wu et al.(2004), Carreras et al.(2002)). In particular, reasonable Chinese NER results were still obtained using Boosting, even though there was no Chinese-specific tuning and the model was only trained on one-third of the provided corpora in SIGHAN bakeoff-3 (Yu et al., 2006).
