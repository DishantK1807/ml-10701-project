380 3 Semantic IE Pattern Learning For these experiments extraction patterns consist of predicate-argument structures, as proposed by Yangarber (2003).

Pattern Learning We begin by outlining the general process of learning extraction patterns, similar to one presented by (Yangarber, 2003).
P03-1044
Yangarber et al.(2000) developed an indirect method which allowed automatic evaluation.
C00-2136
Yangarber et al.(2000) chose an approach motivated by the assumption that documents containing a large number of patterns already identified as relevant to a particular IE scenario are likely to contain further relevant patterns.
C00-2136
It is important to mention that this implementation is not identical to the one described by Yangarber et al.(2000). Their system makes some generalisations across pattern elements by grouping certain elements together.
C00-2136
In addition, Sudo et al.(2003) proposed representations for IE patterns which extends the SVO representation used here and, while they did not appear to significantly improve IE, it is expected that it will be straightforward to extend the vector space model to those pat385 tern representations.
P03-1029
Yangarber et al.(2000) proposed an algorithm for learning extraction patterns for a small number of examples which greatly reduced the burden on the application developer and reduced the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
C00-2136
This approach has been shown to successfully acquire useful extraction patterns which, when added to an IE system, improved its performance (Yangarber et al., 2000).
C00-2136
For example, Lehnert et al.(1992) reported that their system required around 1,500 person-hours of expert labour to modify for a new extraction task.
