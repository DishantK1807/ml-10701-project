SRI'S REAL-TIME SPOKEN LANGUAGE SYSTEM Patti Price and Robert C.
Moore SRI International Menlo Park, CA 94025 PROJECT GOALS This project involves the integration of speech and naturallanguage processing for spoken language systems (SLS).
The goal of this project, to develop a multi-modal interface to the Official Airline Guide database, is being developed along two overlapping research and development lines: one focussed on an SLS kernel for database query, and the other on the full interactive system.
RECENT RESULTS Speaker-dependent and speaker-independent demos to illustrate the combined recognition/natural language system and accompanying graphical user interfaces.
Improved robustness through the development of a template matcher for generating database queries; the template matcher has a tunable parameter to control how much constraint is ignored, so that wrong answers can be traded with no answers.
Implementation of a bottom-up parser for CLE-formalism grammars; the new parser is about twice as fast as our original left-corner parser, and about 17 times faster than an initial bottom-up parser.
Exploration of two schemes to integrate the recognizer and current NL schemes: N-best recognition with a statistical grammar, and recognition guided by a probabilistic finitestate representation of the templates.
Evaluation of SRI's NL, SLS, and speech recognition technologies.
SRI's February-91 weighted sentence error rate for ATIS Class A sentences was 33.8% (NL) and 44.1% (SLS); word error rate for the Resource Management speaker independent speech recognition evaluation was 17.6% with no grammar and 4.8% with the standard wordpair grammar.
Improvements in the CLE grammar: extended coverage of numerical expressions, ATIS domain sortal restrictions, and conjoined noun phrases.
Implementation of tied-mixture hidden Markov models, which resulted in a 20% reduction in the word-error rate compared to the discrete-density version.
Training of a discrete-density DECIPHER using 20,000 sentences of read and spontaneous speech from Resource Management, TIMIT, and ATIS corpora.
We achieved 10% word error on the June-90 ATIS test set.
New techniques for statistical language models: a back-off estimation algorithm, Good-Turing estimates, and interpolation of word-based grammars with class-based grammars.
Current test-set perplexity ranges from 15 to 30.
Initial implementation of fast-search recognition algorithms for near real-time recognition.
Initial implementation of speaker-adaptation using tiedmixture codebook adaptation.
Implementation of an HMM reject-word model for dealing with noises and out-of-vocabulary items in digit recognition tasks; we plan to incorporate this in our ATIS SLS.
PLANS FOR THE COMING YEAR Continue data collection and analysis and expand the ATIS domain.
Implement a new architecture to combine the advantages of the robust template matcher with the new bottom-up parser.
The parser will feed individual constituents to the template mateher, even if it cannot find a complete interpretation of an utterance, and will also form the basis of a phrase-level statistical language model to guide recognition (see Jackson et aL, this volume).
Continue efforts in statistical language modeling: Determine why low perplexity systems do not always improve accuracy; Develop means for making efficient use of language-model training data, and for using out-of-task training data; Combine statistical language modeling with finguistic models of syntax and semantics.
Improve acoustic modeling performance: consistency modeling, speaker-adaptation, rejection modeling (including alternative topologies and training techniques), spontaneous speech phenomena (variations in phonology and speaking rate), corrective training; Implement a continuous-distribution version of DECIPHER. 425
