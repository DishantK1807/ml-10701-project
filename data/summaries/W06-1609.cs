Recently, new reordering strategies have been proposed in the literature on SMT such as the reordering of each source sentence to match the word order in the corresponding target sentence, see Kanthak et al.(2005) and Crego et al.(2005b). Similarly, Matusov et al.(2006) describe a method for simultaneously aligning and monotonizing the training corpus.

During the last few years, SMT systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al., 1993) to phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003).

This translation approach is described in detail by Mari no et al.(2005). The n-gram-based system follows a maximum entropy approach, in which a log-linear combination of multiple models is implemented (Och and Ney, 2002), as an alternative to the source-channel approach.

This feature, which is based on the lexical parameters of the IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993), provides a complementary probability for each tuple in the translation table.
