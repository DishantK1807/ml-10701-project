1 Introduction
The task of coreferenceresolutionis to recognize
all the mentions(also known as noun phrases, in-
cluding names, nominal mentions and pronouns)
in a text and cluster them into equivalence classes
where each quivalence class refers to a real-world
entityorabstractconcept.TheCoNLL-2011shared
task1 usesOntoNotes2 astheevaluationcorpus.The
coreferencelayerin OntoNotesconstitutesone part
of a multi-layer, integrated annotationof the shal-
low semanticstructuresin the text with high inter-
annotator agreement. In addition to coreference,
thisdatasetis alsotaggedwithsyntactictrees,high
coverage verb and some noun propositions,partial
verb and noun word senses, and 18 named entity
types. ThemaindifferencebetweenOntoNotesand
anotherwellknown coreferencedatasetACE is that
the formerdoes not labelany singletonentityclus-
ter, whichhasonlyonereferenceinthetext. Wecan
deleteall the singletonclustersas a postprocessing
step for the finalresults. Alternatively, we can also
firsttraina classifierto separatesingletonmentions
fromthe rest and applythis mentiondetectionstep
beforecoreferenceresolution.Inthisworkweadopt
thesecondstrategy.
In our paper, we use a traditionallearningbased
pair-wise model for this task. For mention detec-
tion,we firstextractall the nounphrasesin the text
and then use a classificationmodelcombinedwith
some effective featuresto determinewhethereach
nounphraseis actuallya mention. The featuresin-
cludewordfeatures,POSfeaturesinthegivennoun
phrase and its context, string matching feature in
its context, SRLfeatures,andnamedentityfeatures
among others. More details will be given in Sec-
tion 3. Fromour in-houseexperiments,the finalF-
scores for coreferenceresolutioncan be improved
by thismentiondetectionpart. For coreferenceres-

olution, a traditinalpair-wise model is applied, in
whichwefirstuseexactstringmatchingto generate
somepre-clusters.It shouldbe notedthateachpro-
nounmustbe treatedas a singletonpre-cluster, be-
causethey are not like namesor nominalmentions,
whichcan be resolved effectively with exact string
matching.We thenimplementa classificationbased
pre-cluster pair model combined with several ef-
fective coreferenceresolutionfeaturesto determine
whethertwopre-clustersrefertothesameentity. Fi-
nally, we use closest-firstclusteringmethodto link
all thecoreferentialpre-clustersandgeneratethefi-
nal clusterresults. As mentionedbefore,mentions
havethreetypes:names,nominalmentionsandpro-
nouns. Among them pronouns are very different
fromnamesandnominalmentions,becausetheycan
onlysupplylimitedinformationliterally. So wede-
fine three kinds of link types for pre-clusterpairs:
NP-NPlink,NP-PRPlinkandPRP-PRPlink.(Here
NP meansNoun Phrasesand PRP meansPronom-
inal Phrases.) One link representsone pre-cluster
pair. Intuitively, differentlinktypestendto usedif-
ferentfeaturestodeterminewhetherthiskindoflink
is coreferentialor not. We implementthree kinds
of pre-clusterpair modelbasedon threelink types.
Experimentalresultsshow that combinedwith out-
puts from different link type based pre-clusterpair
model can give better results than using an uni-
fiedclassificationmodelfor threedifferentkindsof
linktypes. For all the classificationmodels,we use
opennlp.maxent3 package.

2 MentionDetection
We select all the noun phrases tagged by the
OntoNotescorpus as mention candidates and im-
plement a classification-based model combined
with several commonlyused featuresto determine
whethera given nounphraseis a mention.Thefea-
turesaregivenbelow:
• WordFeaturesThey includethefirstwordandthe
last word in each given noun phrase. We also use
words in the context of the noun phrase within a
windowsizeof2.
• POS FeaturesWe use the part of speech tags of
eachwordinthewordfeatures.
• Position Features These features indicate where
the given noun phraseappearsin its sentence: be-
gining,middle,orend.
• SRL Features The Semantic Role of the given
nounphraseinitssentence.
• Verb Features The verb related to the Semantic
Roleofthegivennounphrase.

heuristicrules to cluster them with the purposeof

That means we cannot use these two important
heuristicrules to generatepre-clusters. In our sys-
tem,we justput all the mentions(namesandnomi-
nalmentions,exceptpronouns)whichhavethesame
stringintotheidenticalpre-clusters.Withthesepre-
clusters and their coreferentialresults, we imple-
menta classificationbasedpre-clusterpairmodelto
determinewhether a given pair of pre-clustersre-
fer to the same entity. We follow Rahmanand Ng
(2009) to generate most of our features. We also
includesome other featureswhichintuitively seem
effective for coreferenceresolution. Thesefeatures

useci andcj to representpre-clustersi andj. Each
pre-clusterpaircanbeseenasa link. We have three
kindsof link types: NP-NPlink, NP-PRPlink and
PRP-PRPlink.Differentlinktypesmayhavediffer-
ent featurepreferences. So we train the classifica-
tionbasedpre-clusterpair modelfor eachlink type
separatelyanduse differentmodelsto predicatethe
results. With the predicatingresultsfor pre-cluster
pairs,weuseclosest-firstclusteringtolinkthemand

4 ExperimentalResults
We present our evaluation results on development
datasetforCoNLL-2011sharedTaskinTable3,Ta-
ble 4 and Table 5. Official test results are given
in Table 6 and Table 7. Three different evaluation
metricswere used: MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3
(Bagga andBaldwin,1998)andCEAF(Luo,2005).
Finally, theaveragescoresofthesethreemetricsare
used to rank the participatingsystems. The differ-
ence betweenTable 3 and Table 4 is whethergold
standardmentionboundariesaregiven. Here”men-
tion boundaries”meansa morebroadconceptthan
the mentiondefinitionwe gave earlier. We should
also detect real mentionsfrom them. From the ta-
bles,wecanseethatthescorescanbeimprovedlitt-

betterthanusinganunifiedclassificationmodel.For
official test results, our system did not performas
wellaswehadexpected.Somepossiblereasonsare
as follows. First,verbsthat are coreferentialwitha
nounphraseare also taggedin OntoNotes. For ex-
ample, “grew ” and “the stronggrowth” shouldbe
linked in the following case: “Sales of passenger
cars grew 22%. The strong growth followed year-
to-year increases.” But we cannot solve this kind
of problemin our system. Second,we shouldper-
formfeatureselectiontoavoidsomeuselessfeatures
harmingthe scores. Meanwhile,we did not make
full use of the WordNet,PropBankand otherback-
groundknowledgesourcesas featuresto represent
pre-clusterpairs.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we present our system for CoNLL-
2011 shared Task, ModelingUnrestrictedCorefer-
ence in OntoNotes. First some heuristicrules are
performedto pre-clusterall thementions.Andthen
we use a classificationbasedpre-clusterpairmodel
combined with several cluster level features. We
hypothesizethat the main reason why we did not
achieve goodresultsis thatwe didnotcarefullyex-
amine the features and dropped the feature selec-
tionprocedure.Specially, we did not make full use
ofbackgroundknowledgelike WordNet,PropBank,
etc. In our future work, we will make up for the
weaknessanddesignamorereasonablemodeltoef-
fectivelycombineallkindsoffeatures.
