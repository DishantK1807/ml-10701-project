Alternatively, Cohen (1984) adopts a taxonomy of connectives based on Quirk (1972) to assign each class of cue phrase a function in her model of argument understanding.

For example, the discourse use of and is defined as 'parallelism' in Cohen (1984), 'a marker of addition' or 'sequential continuity' in Schriffin (1987), and 'conjunction' in Warner (1985).

Our model is based on several empirical studies (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990): two studies of individual cue phrases in which we develop our model, and a more comprehensive study of cue phrases as a class, in which we confirm and expand our model.

Study of Well Based on the findings of our study of now, we proposed that listeners may use prosodic information to disambiguate discourse from sentential uses of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1987).

508 Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litman Disambiguation of Cue Phrases In Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1990), a compositional approach to intonational meaning is proposed in which pitch accents are viewed as conveying information status, such as newness or salience, about the denotation of the accented items and the relationship of denoted entities, states, or attributes to speaker and hearer's mutual beliefs about the discourse.

4. Single Cue Phrase Studies Our first study of cue phrase disambiguation investigated multispeaker usage of the cue phrase now in a recorded, transcribed radio call-in program (Hirschberg and Litman 1987).

Additionally, cue phrases are widely used in the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse (Hobbs 1979; Mann and Thompson 1983; Reichman 1985), and have been claimed in general to reduce the complexity of discourse processing and to increase textual coherence in natural language processing systems (Cohen 1984; Litman and Allen 1987; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).

Our findings for our single-speaker multi-cue phrase study support the intonational model of discourse/sentential characteristics of cue phrases that we proposed based on our earlier multispeaker single-cue phrase studies of now and well (Hirschberg and Litman 1987; Litman and Hirschberg 1990).

In fact, most systems that recognize or generate cue phrases assume a canonical (usually first) position for discourse cue phrases within 504 Julia Hirschberg and Diane Litrnan Disambiguation of Cue Phrases the clause (Reichman 1985; Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).

3. Phrasing and Accent in English The importance of intonational information to the communication of discourse structure has been recognized in a variety of studies (Butterworth 1975; Schegloff 1979; Brazil, Coulthard, and Johns 1980; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990; Silverman 1987).

This talk yielded 953 tokens, based upon a set of possible cue phrases derived from Cohen (1984), Grosz and Sidner (1986), Litman and Hirschberg (1990), Reichman (1985), Schiffrin (1987), Warner (1985), and Zuckerman and Pearl (1986).

Grosz and Sidner (1986), in their tripartite model of discourse structure, classify cue phrases based on the changes they signal to the attentional and intentional states.

The structural information conveyed by these phrases is crucial to many tasks, such as anaphora resolution (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985), the inference of speaker intention and the recognition of speaker plans (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Sidner 1985; Litman and Allen 1987), and the generation of explanations and other text (Zuckerman and Pearl 1986).
J86-3001
For example, it has been shown that cue phrases can assist in the resolution of anaphora, by indicating the presence of a structural boundary or a relationship between parts of a discourse (Grosz 1977; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985).
