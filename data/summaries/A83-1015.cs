Details of the EPISTLE system and of its core grammar may be found in Miller et al., 1981, and Heidorn et al., 1982.

In EPISTLE, (a) the core grammar consists at present of a set of about 300 syntax rules; (b) ambiguity is resolved by using a metric that ranks alternative parses (Heidorn 1982): and (c) parse failure is handled by the fitting procedure described here.

Thus Weischedel and Black, 1980, suggest three techniques for responding intelligently to unparsable inputs: (al using presuppositions to determine user assumptions; this course is not available to a syntactic grammar like EPISTLE's; Ibl using relaxation techniques; (cJ supplying the user with information about the point where the parse blocked; this would require an interactive environment, which would not be possible for every type of natural language processing application.

This is undoubtedly a useful strategy -one which EPISTLE makes use of, in fact, in its rules for detecting grammatical errors (Heidorn et al.1982). However.
