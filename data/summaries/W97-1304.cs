Furthermore, when the English analyzer contains an anaphora resolution process such as Lappin and Leass (1994), even if the antecedents of zero pronouns in Japanese are anaphoric expressions such as pronouns and definite noun phrases, the anaphora resolution process determines the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and the overall system can determine intersentential and intrasentential resolution rules of Japanese zero pronouns by using extracted pairs of the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in English and their Japanese equivalents.

In the implementation in ALT-J/E, the rules are extracted using the case type of the zero pronoun, the verbal semantic attributes (VSA; 107 categories) of the verb which governs the zero pronoun (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and categorized types of modal expression (134 categories) in the unit sentence which contains the zero pronoun (Kawai, 1987) and categorized types of conjunction (56 categories) which are directly connected to the unit sentence.

Furthermore, I would like to realize an overall system with an English syntactic and semantic parser and evaluate the effect of the anaphora resolution and omission of ellipsis in English for the rThis method does not uses any heuristics which were used in other methods of anaphora resolution such as Murata and Nagao (1997) for Japanese nouns and Lappin and Leass (1994) for English pronouns and achieves relatively high accuracy (87.6%) even in the blind test.

Furthermore, according to an analysis of these aligned sentence pairs (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996), zero pronouns in the corpus can be successfully resolved using three kinds of semantic and syntactic constraints: verbal semantic attributes, the types of modal expressions and conjunctions.

These methods use categorized semantic and pragmatic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns and determine antecedents of zero pronouns depending on the typical category of three types of semantic and pragmatic constraints.

of Japanese Zero Pronouns and Their Antecedents The method to extract Japanese zero pronouns and their English equivalents consists of the following steps 1. 1) Analysis of Japanese and English sentences In this step, I use morphological, syntactic and semantic analyzers of Japanese in ALT-J/E for the analysis of Japanese sentences and Brill's English tagger (Brill, 1992) for the analysis of English sentences ~.

Several methods have been proposed with regard to acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al., 1995).

Several methods have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1990; Yoshimoto, 1988; Dousaka, 1994).

With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasukawa, 1996).
C96-2139
To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider applications for a practical machine translation system with an unlimited translation target area, have been proposed (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996).
