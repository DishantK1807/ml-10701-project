It forms a baseline for performance evaluations, but is prone to sparse data problems (Dunning, 1993).

However, a theoretically sound definition of context is needed to ensure that such re-ranking and deleting of word-choices helps and not hinders (Gale & Church, 1990).

The most promising possibilities are: • re-ranking the confusion set (and assigning new confidence-values to its entries), and, • deleting low-confidence entries from the confusion set (after applying contextual knowledge) Several researchers in NLP have acknowledged the relevance of context in disambiguating natural language input ((Evett et al., 1991); (Zernik, 1991); (Hindle & Rooth, 1993); (Rosenfeld, 1994)).
