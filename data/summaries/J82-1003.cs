The most advanced parser for Gazdar-style grammars that we are aware of is Thompson's chartparser (Thompson 1981), which provides for slash categories and coordination, but does not (as of this writing) generate logical translations.

A review of this literature would be out of place here; but we would like to indicate that the case against decomposition (and hence against conventional translations) is not closed, by offering the fol9 With regard to our system-building objectives, such resort to lexical decomposition is no liability: the need for some use of lexical decomposition to obtain "canonical" representations that facilitate inference is widely acknowledged by AI researchers, and carried to extremes by some (e.g., Wilks 1974, Schank 1975).
