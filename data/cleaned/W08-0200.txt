Introduction
Many of us in this field face the daily challenge of trying to teach computer scientists, linguists and/or
psychologists together. Following the success of the two previous ACL workshops (2002 and 2005,
http://www.eecs.umich.edu/∼radev/TeachingNLP) on this theme, we held this 2-day
workshop associated with ACL-HLT 2008 to carefully examine the advantages and disadvantages of
an interdisciplinary approach, and to explore techniques specifically aimed at teaching programming
to social scientists and linguistics to computer scientists. As computational linguistics (hopefully)
becomes of more and more relevance to industrial applications, we must ensure that our students (both
undergraduate and graduate) are given adequate preparation for functioning in a practical industrial
environment as well as an academic research environment. We need to exchange views on appropriate
curriculum for both undergraduate students and graduate students, and linguists, psychologists and
computer scientists. There are many questions to be addressed about the necessary background for
linguists, psychologists and computer scientists before they can communicate effectively with each
other and learn at the same pace.
How much math is necessary? Is it possible to teach linguists Natural Language Processing techniques
without first teaching them how to program? Can undergraduates hold their own in graduate courses?
Can linguists and computer scientists make separate but equal contributions to term projects? How
can linguistics students get ACL publications? What is the relevance of psycholinguistics?
In addition to fifteen high quality reviewed papers and an invited talk by Lori Levin and Drago Radev
on the recent very successful American Computational Linguistics Olympiad, the program includes
three panels: a panel on industry expectations for computational linguists organized by Chris Brew; a
panel on essential curriculum for computational linguistics organized by Emily Bender and Fei Xia;
and a panel on techniques for teaching extremely interdisciplinary classes organized by Gina Levow.
The specific goals of this workshop build upon the goals of past CL teaching workshops:
• To provide a setting for mutual feedback on participants’ instructional approaches as well as
guidance on future directions.
• Toidentifyandseparatefromthegeneralteachingaspirationsofhostdepartmentsthekeyfeatures
of an elective undergraduate and graduate curriculum in computational linguistics.
• To determine a curriculum that embraces diversity of background as an opportunity rather than
shies from it as a problem.
• To generally promote visibility for the study of CL teaching as a bona fide scholarly activity
• In the case of the industrial panel, to set up a situation in which those responsible for education
and training in CL-using industry become more aware of the diversity of backgrounds available
in the ACL world.
We are especially grateful to the panel organizers, the presenters who submitted excellent papers
and to our hard working program committee. Particular thanks go to Richard Wicentowski for being
Publications Chair.
