And in fact, (Black et al., 1998) demonstrate a significant "tag trigger-pair" effect.

Both the model underlying a standard tag-n-gram-based tagger, and the same model augmented with extrasentential contextual information, are trMned on the 850,000-word ATR General English Treebank (Black et al., 1996), and then tested on the accompanying 53,000-word test treebank.

This experiment measures the effect of employing the triggers specified in (Black et al., 1998) --i.e.

Procedure The performance of each the tagging models is measured on a 53,000-word test treebank handlabelled to an accuracy of over 97% (Black et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998).

Where these intrasentential words were included, they 1 (Black et al., 1998) determined a 6-sentence window to be optimal for this task.

This is especially so for a large semantic and syntactic tagset such as the roughly-3000-tag ATR General English Tagset (Black et al., 1996; Black et al., 1998).

However, despite promising results when measuring mutual information gain (Black et M., 1998), the baseline model combined only with extrasentential tag triggers reduced perplexity by just a modest 7.6% . The explanation for this is that the information these triggers provide is already present to some degree in the n-grams of the tagger and is therefore redundant.

The model we use is similar to that of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

Our model exploits the same kind of tag-n-gram information that forms the core of many successful tagging models, for example, (Kupiec, 1992), (Merialdo, 1994), (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

Table 1, taken from (Black et al., 1998), provides examples of the tag trigger-pair effect.

In other words, we are measuring the contribution of this long-range information over and above a model which uses local tag-n-grams as context, rather than measuring the gain over a naive model which does not take context into account, as was the case with the mutual information experiments in (Black et al., 1998).
