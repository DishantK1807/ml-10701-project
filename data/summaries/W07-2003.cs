Proposals for computing acceptability (or preference) include raw frequency counts ((Evans and Zhai, 1996) and (Lapata and Keller, 2004)), Latent Semantic Indexing ((Buckeridge and Sutcliffe, 2002)) and statistical measures of association ((Lapata et al., 1999) and (Nakov and Hearst, 2005)).
J02-3004
We computed these measures as described in Lewis (1991).
H91-1061
(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2005) gave the annotators an example of each phrase in a sentence along with WordNet senses and position of arguments.
W04-2609
In previous research on natural language processing, many methodologies for extracting various relations from corpora have been developed, such as the ?is-a??relation (Hearst 1992), ?part-of??relation (Berland and Charniak 1999), causal relation (Girju 2003), and entailment relation (Geffet and Dagan 2005).
C92-2082
The recognition of textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) is an example of successful use of this type of deeper analysis in high-end NLP applications.
H05-1047
Chklovski and Pantel (2004) introduce a 5-class set, designed specifically for characterizing verb-verb semantic relations.
W04-3205
Moldovan et al.(2004) propose a 35class scheme to classify relations in various phrases; the same scheme has been applied to noun compounds and other noun phrases (Girju et al., 2005).
W04-2609
In (Tatu et al., 2005), a deep semantic representation is paired with a large amount of general and task specific semantic rules (explicit knowledge).
H05-1047
(Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use supervised methods and explore classification features from a simple structured type hierarchy.
W01-0511 W04-2609
Patterns 4.1 Motivations Syntactic patterns provide clues for semantic relations (Hearst, 1992).
C92-2082
We built the patterns manually, following Hearst (1992) and Nakov and Hearst (2006).
C92-2082
Lapata (2002) presents a binary classification of relations in nominalizations.
J02-3004
The two best systems (Tatu et al., 2005; Hickl et al., 2005), which are significantly above all the others (more than +10% accuracy), use implicit or explicit knowledge bases larger than all the other systems.
H05-1047
Based on Event Term Clustering 2.1 Event Term Graph We introduce VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004), a broad-coverage repository of semantic verb relations, into event-based summarization.
W04-3205
Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.
W04-2609
Rosario et al.(2002) classify noun compounds using the MeSH hierarchy and a multi-level hierarchy of semantic relations, with 15 classes at the top level.
P02-1032
Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound.
W01-0511
For example, Hearst(1992) uses the pattern ?NP such as List??to indicate that nouns in List are hyponyms of NP.
