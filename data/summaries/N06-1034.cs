a binary representation of whether the task was completed) (Mcurrency1oller, 2005a; Mcurrency1oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1997).

8Researchers have also used average score (Mcurrency1oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 1997); single survey statements can also be used (Walker et al., 1997).

Unlike our other parameters, these annotations are not currently available, although they can be predicted automatically (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b), in our sys270 tem.

The PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997) proposes instead to predict system performance, using parameters representing interaction costs and benets between system and user, including task success, dialogue ef ciency, and dialogue quality.
P97-1035
Although affect parameters have not been used in other PARADISE studies (to our knowledge), they are generic; for example, in various spoken dialogue systems, user affect has been annotated and automatically predicted from e.g., acoustic-prosodic and lexical features (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004b; Lee et al., 2002; Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003).
P04-1045 W04-2326
In other types of spoken dialogue systems, the userâ€™s subjective judgments about using the system are often considered a primary system performance metric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measured via surveys which ask users to rate systems during use along dimensions such as task ease, speech input/output quality, user expectations and expertise, and user future use (Mcurrency1oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 1992).
