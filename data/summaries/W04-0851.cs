For stemming we used Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980) and for tagging we used Brill tagger (Brill, 1995).

This observation agrees with the Lee and Ng results (Lee and Ng, 2002), that in the case of SVM also have obtained the best performance with linear kernel.

Sources and Feature Space We follow the common practice (Yarowsky, 1993; Florian and Yarowsky, 2002; Lee and Ng, 2002) to represent the training instances as feature vectors.
H93-1052 W02-1004 W02-1006
Lee and Ng (Lee and Ng, 2002) report a fine-grained score for SVM of only 0.648 if they do not use syntactic knowledge source.
W02-1006
For example the best two results reported until now on Senseval-2 data are 0.654 (Lee and Ng, 2002) obtained with SVM and 0.665 (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) obtained by classifiers combination.
