The advantages of the LF notation are mantfold: a0 it allows a simple syntax/semantics interface a0 it is user friendly a0 it has positional syntactic arguments that ease other NLP tasks such as textual interpretationa and textual inference a0 if predicates are disambiguated with respect to a general ontology such as WordNet it leads to concept predicates a0 it is easily customizable (for example to distinguish between arguments and adjuncts) For details about the principles of Logic Forms read Chapter 2 in (Rus, 2002), (Rus and Moldovan, 2002) and (Hobbs, 1986).
