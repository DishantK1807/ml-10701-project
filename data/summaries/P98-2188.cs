Researchers in discourse, such as Grosz and Sidner (1986), Lambert (1993), Hirschberg and Litman (1993), Chen (1995), Andernach (1996), Samuel (1996), and Chu-Carroll (1998) have suggested several features that might be relevant for the task of computing dialogue acts.

Transformation-Based Learning To compute dialogue acts, we are using a modified version of Brill's (1995a) TransformationBased Learning method.

TBL has been effective on a similar 2 task, Part-of-Speech Tagging (Brill, 1995a).
J95-4004 W95-0101
Brill (1995b) developed an unsupervised version of TBL for Part-of-Speech Tagging, but this algorithm must be initialized with words that can be tagged unambiguously, 13 and in discourse, there are very few unambiguous examples.

Introduction Although machine learning approaches have achieved success in many areas of Natural Language Processing, researchers have only recently begun to investigate applying machine learning methods to discourse-level problems (Reithinger and Klesen, 1997; Di Eugenio et al., 1997; Wiebe et al., 1997; Andernach, 1996; Litman, 1994).
