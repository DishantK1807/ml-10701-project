Examples. Schubert (1984; 1986) presents a number of sentences that he claims show a preference for attachment that he claims cannot be explained on the basis of structural, syntactic preferences.

180) or default unification (Bouma 1990), denoted by n.

Secondly, the wish to be able to give an interpretation of a sentence at any stage of the parsing process stems from the fact that humans are able to make guesses about continuations of sentences that stop before they have come to a proper ending (Schubert 1984).
P84-1054
Firstly, from empirical, corpusbased studies it may be concluded that lexical preferences are successful heuristics for resolving ambiguity (Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner 1990; Hobbs and Bear 1990).

Another lexicalist model that features incremental processing can be found in Stock (1989).

It is therefore possible to relate the syntactic category of the idiom to that of its head (see also Zernik and Dyer 1987).

3. Inheritance and the Hierarchical Lexicon To allow the inference engine to reason about lexical structures in which inheritance relations are present, the calculus should be extended, and a more sophisticated structure should be assigned to the categorial lexicon than the list or bag that is usually considered in CG (with the exception of Bouma 1990).
P90-1021
The modifiers in both cases are preferably attached contrary to expectations on the basis of syntactic preferences (see Schubert 1984, 1986; Wilks, Huang, and Fass 1985).

In PHRAN (Wilensky and Arens 1980), specificity plays a role, but only in suggesting patterns that match the input: evaluation takes place on the basis of length and order of the patterns.

the P-calculus (Bouma 1989) a shift-reduce strategy is modeled for a categorial parser.

In Stock's (1989) approach to ambiguity resolution the idiomatic and the nonidiomatic analyses are processed in parallel.
J89-1001
Zernik and Dyer (1987) present lexical representations for idioms, but do not discuss ambiguity.
