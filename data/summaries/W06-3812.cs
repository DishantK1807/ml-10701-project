In this case, we use the log-likelihood measure as described in (Dunning 1993).

How to use this kind of word clusters to improve the accuracy of POS-taggers is outlined in (Ushioda, 1996).
W96-0103
Similar to the approach as presented in (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) we construct a word graph.

To judge results, the methodology of (Bordag, 2006) is adopted: To evaluate word sense induction, two sub-graphs induced by the neighborhood of different words are merged.
