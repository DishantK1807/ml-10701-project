There are two different action schemas for modifier; one is for absolute modifiers, 4 Note that several category predications might be true of an object, and we do not explore which would be best to use, but see Edmonds (1994) for how preferences can be encoded.

The inference of judgment plans must be sensitive to the fact that such a plan includes the constraint that the speaker found the judged plan to be in error even though the 11 If the error occurred in an instance of headnoun, a different replace-plan schema would need to be used, one that for instance relaxed the category that was used in describing the object (Goodman 1985; Heeman 1991).

Such special procedures have been the mainstay for accounting for the content of referring expressions, both in constructing and in understanding them, as exemplified by Dale (1989), who chose descriptors on the basis of their discriminatory power; Ehud Reiter (1990), who focused 1 For simplicity, we have not shown the change in speakers between refashionings and judgments.

Third, this research needs to be integrated into a more complete plan-based approach to language, and needs to be extended so as to handle more general discourse plan failures (McRoy and Hirst 1993; McRoy and Hirst 1995; Horton and Hirst 1991; Heeman 1993; Edmonds 1994; Hirst et al.1994). A benchmark for such future work could be dialog (8.1) below, from the London-Lund corpus (Svartvik and Quirk 1980, S.2.4a:1-8, which is the basis of the example used in Section 6.

Goodman (1985) has addressed this problem for the case of when the referring expression overconstrains the choice of referent.
