Dependency parsing has been actively studied in recent years (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Isozaki et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Corston-Oliver et al., 2006).

McDonald et al.(2005) propose structured multilabel classification as opposed to sequential labelling for dealing with nested, discontinuous, and overlapping NEs.
