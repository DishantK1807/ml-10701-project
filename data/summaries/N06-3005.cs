So far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (Wiebe et al., 2004; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Morinaga et al., 2002).

We evaluate the subjectivity of each sentence using the patterns automatically extracted from foreign news documents (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that 65.6% of Palestinian sentences and 66.2% of Israeli sentences are classified as subjective.
