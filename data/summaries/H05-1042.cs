This result compares favorably with Duboue and McKeown (2003) whose best model has an F-score of 51.00% on a simpler domain.

Work The generation literature provides multiple examples of content selection components developed for various domains (Kukich, 1983; McKeown, 1985; Sripada et al., 2001; Reiter and Dale, 2000).

Previous work (Duboue and McKeown, 2003) has tackled the content selection problem for biographical summaries, a simpler domain with fewer entities and interactions among them.

This formulation is similar to the energy minimization framework, which is commonly used in image analysis (Besag, 1986; Boykov et al., 1999) and has been recently applied in natural language processing (Pang and Lee, 2004).

The sports domain has enjoyed popularity among natural language generation practitioners (Robin, 1994; Tanaka-Ishii et al., 1998).
P98-2209
Similar to previous work (Duboue and McKeown, 2003; Sripada et al., 2001), we employ a simple matching procedure that considers anchor overlap between entity attributes and sentence tokens.

Duboue and McKeown (2003) were the first to propose a method for learning content selection rules automatically, thus going beyond mere corpus analysis.
W03-1016
Similarly to Duboue and McKeown (2003), we view content selection as a classification task and learn selection rules from a database and its corresponding corpus.
