<context>ual. However, on the noisy document our cost function performed much better. The statistical significance of the difference is more than 99% (for both recall and precision). This indicates (see also (Church, 1993)) that when the input is noisy, length based methods tend to break down. Hence, timing information is essential when the alignment task is not trivial. 6.

Lavecchia et al. (2007) constructed an English-French parallel corpus using a method they refer to as Dynamic Time Warping. The corpus was quite small, consisting only 37,625 aligned subtitle pairs which were collected from</context>
