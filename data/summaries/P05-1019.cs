A skewed variant of the Kullback-Leibler divergence function was used to compare co-occurrence distributions (Lee, 1999, with α = 0.95).

Hutchinson (2005) presents further experiments on modelling connective similarity, and discusses their implications.
P05-1019
Sentences containing discourse connectives were gathered from the British National Corpus and the world wide web, with discourse connectives identified on the basis of their syntactic contexts (for details, see Hutchinson (2004b)).

Similar methods have been developed for predicting the similarity of nouns and verbs on the basis of their distributional similarity, and many distributional similarity functions have been proposed for these tasks (Lee, 1999).
P99-1004
For such cases, unsupervised approaches have been developed for predicting relations, by using sentences containing discourse connectives as training data (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).

Addressing this, a body of research has considered the problems of generating appropriate discourse connectives (for example (Moser and Moore, 1995; Grote and Stede, 1998)).

(KL divergence, unlike most similarity functions, is sensitive to the order of arguments related by hyponymy (Lee, 1999)).
P99-1004
For example, in psychology, Miller and Charles (1991) report that psychologists ‘have largely abandoned “synonymy” in favour of “semantic similarity”.’ In addition, work in automatic lexical acquisition is based on the proposition that distributional similarity correlates with semantic similarity (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran and Moens, 2002; Weeds and Weir, 2003).
