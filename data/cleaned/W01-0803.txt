Jussieu 75251 Paris Cedex 05 France roussari@linguist.jussieu.fr Abstract In this paper, the issue of document structuring is addressed.
To achieve this task, we advocate that Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) is a most expressive discourse framework.
Then we sketch a discourse planning mechanism which aims at producing as many paraphrastic document structures as possible from a set of factual data encoded into a logical form.
1 Introduction
Using the terms of (Reiter and Dale, 2000), we consider that the Document Planner architecture is pipelined: first the content determination task does its work, and then the document structuring task takes the result and build a document plan.
Following the work of (Roussarie, 2000), we adopt SDRT (Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 1998), which was designed first for text understanding, for the document structuring task1.
The input to the document structuring component is a set of factual data encoded into a logical form, as in (1).

The work presented here differs from his work in the following: content determination and document structuring are pipelined here, while they are interleaved in his work.

Our goal is to produce a wide range of paraphrases from the same factual data.
For example, from the logical form in (1), we want to produce at least all the texts in (2).
These texts have different communicative structures and so correspond to different communicative goals.
However, these issues will not be addressed here.

His leaving brought Mary into a fit of tears.
d. Mary burst into a fit of tears.
This is due to Fred’s leaving.
To produce paraphrases, we start by producing several document plans (i.e.
SDRSs) from the same factual data.
The SDRS underlying (2a) is in (3a) in which the discourse relation Result between a42 a3 and a42 a8 expresses the predicate causea15a17a1a10a3a43a5a7a1a27a8a27a19 . The SDRS underlying (2b) is similar to (3a) except that Explanationa15a42 a8a44a5 a42 a3a45a19 is involved instead of Resulta15a42 a3a5a42 a8 a19 . The SDRS underlying (2c) is in (3b).
It includes the discourse relation Commentary2 defined in (Asher, 1993).
To ensure the cohesion of texts, we add the following constraint to his definition: Commentarya15a42 a3a27a5a42 a8a27a19 requires that one element in a42 a8 is coreferent with one element in a42 a3, as it is the case in (3b) with a1a27a46a47a29a48a1 a3 . In (3b), the causal relation has been reified as the discourse referent f (see section 5).
This discourse referent is ex2The discourse relation in (2c) is not Result since the second sentence denotes both the cause and the effect.

It leads to nothing when there is a lexical (or syntactic) gap in the target language.
For example, if there is no verbal predicate semantically equivalent to be due to in the target language, the SDRS underlying (2d) leads to nothing.
Similarly, if a SDRS includes a discourse relation which cannot be realized in the target language (e.g.
volitionalResult proposed in (Mann and Thompson, 1987) cannot be linguistically realized in French (Danlos, 2001)), it leads to nothing4.
A given SDRS leads to several texts when there are several lexicalizations for at least one predicate.
Thanks to the use of SDRT, we are able to give a formal background to the following assump3In the generation community, causative verbal predicates such as bring into or provoke are considered as elementary ones, although it should not be so.
For example, Elixir provokes an allergic reaction is not analyzed and so is simply represented as (allergic-reaction (Elixir)) in (BouayadAgha et al., 2000).
Whereas, it should get a representation translating x’s taking Elixir causes x’s having an allergic reaction with a causal relation between two events.
4We adopt the position that there exists a set of discourse relations which are likely to be language independent.
tions generally used in bottom-up documentstructuring approaches: a78 “The content determination mechanism has produced a set of messages which are required to be included in the final document plan” (Reiter and Dale, 2000, p.
114). In formal terms, it translates as follows: a SDRS a42 built from a logical form LF is such that the logical form derived from a42 is logically equivalent to LF.
For example, the logical forms derived from the SDRSs in (3a) and (3b) are equivalent to that in (1) modulo axioms which will be presented in section 4.
a78 “The NLG system has a means of determining what discourse relation (if any) can be used to link two particular messages or component document plans” (Reiter and Dale, 2000, p.
114). Our formal approach is based on reversing the SDRT conditions to establish discourse relations.
As an illustration, in SDRT for text understanding, there is the Axiom in (4) for Narration.
This axiom states that if Narration holds between two SDRSs a42 a3 and a42 a8, then the main event (me) of a42 a3 happens before the main event ofa42 a8 .

2 Crash
course in SDRT 2.1 Introduction SDRT (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) was introduced in (Asher, 1993) as an extension of DRT (Discourse Representation Theory, (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) in order to account for specific properties of discourse structure.
The original motivation for developing SDRT can be found in Asher’s study of the reference to abstract objects in discourse.
Asher argues that a sound discourse theory has to cope with some anaphora whose antecedents turn out to be text segments larger than a clause or a sentence.
Moreover, it is necessary to reveal a hierarchical discourse structure which makes appear the sites available for anaphora–antecedent binding.
Consider the example in (6) taken from (Asher, 1993, p.
318): (6) (1) After 38 months, America is back in space.
(2) The shuttle Discovery roared off the pad from Cape Kennedy at 10:38 this morning.
(3) The craft and crew performed flawlessly.
(4) Later in the day the TDRS shuttle communication satellite was successfully deployed.
(5) This has given a much needed boost to NASA morale.
The pronoun this (6.5) can only refer to the whole trip or (possibly) to the last mentioned event (TDRS launch).
Consequently, the structure of (6) must be such that : i) there exists a constituent which semantically encompasses the whole story (6.1–4), and ii) neither (6.2) nor (6.3) correspond to available constituents for the anaphora resolution when computing the attachment of (6.5) in the context.
Avaibility (or openness) of constituents is a formal property that can be accounted for by the use of discourse relations.
2.2 DRSs
as formal discourse units SDRT can be viewed as a super-layer on DRT whose expressiveness is enhanced by the use of discourse relations.
Thus the DRT structures (Discourse Representation Structures or DRS) are handled as basic discourse units in SDRT.
Formally, a DRS is a couple of sets a84 U,Cona85 . U (the universe) is the set of discourse referents.
Con is a set of conditions which describe the meaning of the discourse in a truth-conditional semantics fashion.
For instance, the DRS representing the sentence (7a) is given in (7b).
(7) a.
Fred left.
b. a56 a55 a56a34a58 Fred a55 –leave a59a56a53a60 a55 a61a64a63a53a65a86a67 Note that in addition to individual referents (a11 ), U includes event referents (a1 ).
DRT adopts a Davidsonian approach (Davidson, 1967): it considers that events have to be denoted by singular terms in the logical form of sentences.
In the semantic model, events are handled as world immanent entities, and event referents (a1 ) can occur in argumental slots of certain predicates (like fcausea15a17a1a46 a5a7a1a27a8a27a19 in (3b)).
The statement a1 –leavea15a18a11a62a19 is a predicative notational variant and stands for “a1 is a leaving ofa11 ”.
DRSs do not correspond to linguistic categories but are formal units: from the SDRT point of view, one should see them as (intensional) meaning structures.
This is why some discourse abstract objects (such as facts, situations, propositions)... can be referred to by discourse referents (we will say that they are reified) and semantically characterized by (sub-)DRS.

145). (8) a.

U is a set of labels of DRS or SDRS which may be viewed as “speech act discourse referents” (Asher and Lascarides, 1998).
Con is a set of conditions on labels of the form: a78 a42a93a92a44a94, where a42 is a label from U and a94 is a (S)DRS (labelling); a78 R a15 a42a69a95 a5 a42a51a96 a19, where a42a24a95 and a42a44a96 are labels and R a discourse relation (structuring).
The set of SDRT relations includes Narration (for temporal sequence), Background (for temporal overlap), Elaboration (for whole-part or topicdevelopment), Explanation and Result (for causation), Commentary (for gloss).
According to (Asher, 1993, p.
319), (9) sketches the SDR-theoretic analysis of (6) where eacha82a4a95 stands for the DRS representing the content of the a97 th sentence in (6).

For instance, one rule states that if a discourse constituent a101 may be connected to a discourse constituent a102 in the context, then normally the relation Narrationa15a102 a5a101 a19 holds.
Another rule states that ifa101 may be connected to a102 and if the main event of a101, i.e. mea15a101 a19, is known as a cause of mea15a102 a19, then normally the relation Explanationa15a102 a5a101 a19 holds.
3 Comparison
with RST As nearly everybody in the NLG community uses RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory, (Mann and Thompson, 1987)) as a discourse framework, it is generally considered that the task of document structuring is to produce a tree in the RST style.
Since RST is a descriptive theory without any formal background, there exists a wide range of interpretations and several notions of Rhetorical Structure.
For some authors, e.g.
(Marcu et al., 2000), the Rhetorical Structure is very surfacic: it is an ordered tree isomorphic to the linearized structure of the text and a rhetorical relation can be viewed as a nickname for a small set of cue phrases.
For other authors, the rhetorical structure is more abstract: it aims at representing meaning.
For example, in (RAGS Project, 1999; BouayadAgha et al., 2000), the Rhetorical Structure is an unordered tree in which terminal nodes represent elementary propositions, while non terminal nodes represent rhetorical relations which are abstract relations such as cause.
This rhetorical representation is mapped into a Document Representation which is an ordered tree reflecting the surfacic structure of the text.
Our approach is closer to the RAGS’one if we consider our logical form as equivalent to their Rhetorical Structures.
However, we differ basically on the following point: their Rhetorical Structure is a tree, while our logical form, when graphically represented, is a (connex) graph and not a tree.
Let us justify our position by considering the discourses in (10).
(10) a.
Fred run the vacuum cleanera103 while Sue was sleepinga104 in order to bother hera105 . b.
Fred run the vacuum cleanera103 while Sue was sleepinga104 in order to please hera105 . They can be given various meanings, however we focus on the following: a78 for (10a), running the vacuum cleaner is supposed to be noisy and Fred attempts to bother Sue by making something noisy exactly when she is sleeping, a78 for (10b), running the vacuum cleaner is supposed to be an awful chore and Fred attempts to please Sue by relieving her of a chore.
It just happens that he run the vacuum cleaner while she was sleeping.
In RST, both (10a) and (10b) are given the tree representation in (11), in which CIRC abbreviates CIRCUMSTANCE.
(11) CIRC a106 a107 a108 N S SN PURPOSE The semantic interpretation of a rhetorical tree is given by the “nuclearity principle” (Marcu, 1996): whenever two large spans are connected through a rhetorical relation, that rhetorical relation holds also between the most important parts of the constituent spans.
In (11), the nuclearity principle amounts to saying that there is only one interpretation, namely that in which the nucleus argument of PURPOSE is a109, which is the nucleus argument of CIRCUMSTANCE.
This is the right interpretation for (10b).
However, (11) cannot represent the meaning of (10a) for which the first (nucleus) argument of PURPOSE is the subtree rooted at CIRCUMSTANCE.
In conclusion, a RST tree structure is too poor: it cannot account for the expressiveness of texts.
This can be accounted for by the use of representations which correspond graphically to (connex) graphs.
The graphical representations of (10a) and (10b) and their equivalent in pseudo logical forms are respectively shown in (12a) and (12b)5.
(12) a.
PURPOSE 1 2 a110a111 a112 CIRC a113 a114 a109 a115 a116a118a117 a119a88a120 a121 a122a20a123 a72a17a124a125a72a127a126a74a72a129a128 a59a128 –CIRCa59 a123 a72a129a124a88a60a44a130 PURPOSEa59a128a131a72a132a126a25a60a17a60 b.

It is the interpretation of the RST tree in (11) without the nuclearity principle.
(12b) is a graph in whicha109 is part of two relations6.
This graph corresponds to the interpretation of the RST tree in (11) given by the nuclearity principle.
This principle makes that a109 is part of both the relation PURPOSE with a121 and the relation CIRCUMSTANCE with its satellitea115 . The SDRSs underlying (10a) and (10b) are shown respectively in (13a) and (13b) (the notation a94a64a103 stands for the DRS representing a109 and so on).
Here we replace CIRCUMSTANCE by the SDRT relation Background for temporal overlap7.
5The arguments of a binary semantic predicate are noted as 1 and 2 after the fashion of MTT (Meaning to Text Theory, (Mel’ˇcuk, 1988)) and not as Nucleus and Satellite in the RST tradition.
6This graph can be annotated to mark the element(s) which are focused on.

In (13b), a42 a3 is part of two discourse relations.
The graphical representations of (13a) and (13b) (in which Ra15a42 a3a134a5a42 a8a27a19 is represented as a tree rooted at R) have the same topology as (12a) and (12b) respectively.
In summary, in document structuring approaches based on RST, a rhetorical structure is always a tree, whenever understood as abstract representation or a more surfacic one.
This cannot be maintained.
First, if the rhetorical structure is an abstract conceptual representation closed to a logical form, its graphical representation is a connex graph (and not always a tree).
Second, if the rhetorical structure is a discourse representation, as it is the case for SDRS, its graphical representation is also a connex graph.
This criticism is not the only one against RST.
This discourse framework has already been criticized in the generation community (de Smedt et al., 1996).
So we advocate the use of SDRT.
This theory presents the following advantages : a78 it is a formalized theory which benefits of all the progress in formal semantics most often realized in the understanding perspective around DRT or SDRT.
a78 adopting SDRT for text generation by “reversing” the rules (see (4) reversed in (5)) allows us to have reversible systems: the same linguistic data can be used for both text understanding and generation.
a78 as it will be shown in section 5, the document structuring component à la SDRT gives hint on referring expressions: it indicates when a pan the Background-related constituents.
See (Asher and Lascarides, 1998) for details.
discourse referent should be expressed as an anaphoric NP.
a78 a SDRS (i.e.
a document plan) can be given to existing microplanners and surface realizers with perhaps some modifications (see section 6).
For example, a SDRS can be given as input to G-TAG (Danlos, 2000) implemented in CLEF (Meunier and Reyes, 1999) provided small fits are realized.
In conclusion, we think that SDRT is a better discourse framework than RST (for both text generation and understanding).
4 Equivalence
between logical forms Recall that we want to compute both the SDRS in (3a) with Result and the SDRS in (3b) with Commentary from the logical form in (1).
Let us show that the logical forms derived from these SDRSs are equivalent.
In SDRT, there is an axiom for Result from which one can entail the rule in (14), which is similar to the axiom in (4) for Narration.
(14) Resulta15a42 a3a9a5a42 a8a9a19a81a80 causea15a18a138a139a1a44a15a42 a3a45a19a86a5a12a138a139a1a44a15a42 a8a43a19a12a19 Therefore, the logical form derived from (3a) is (1) repeated in (15) without the temporal information.

Therefore, the logical form derived from (3b) is (16).
(16) a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a7a1a9a8a10a5 fa5a12a11a71a5a12a14a140a15a17a1a10a3 –leavea15a18a11a62a19a38a21 a1a27a8 –fit-of-tearsa15a18a14a24a19a62a21 f–causea15a17a1a4a3a9a5a7a1a9a8a27a19a38a21a28a11a30a29 Freda21a140a14a141a29 Marya19 The difference between (15) and (16) consists in considering the causal relation between the two events either as only a predicate or as a variable plus a predicate.
However, the axioms in (17a) and (17b) can be laid down.
With these axioms, (15) and (16) are equivalent since they are both equivalent to (18), in which the causal relation gets represented twice.
In other words, we have the following logical entailments: (15), (17a) a142 (18), and (16), (17b) a142 (18).

Therefore, the document structuring task has to produce SDRS such as (3a) and (3b) from one of these logical forms.
There is a an important difference between SDRSs and logical forms.
SDRSs represent discourses and their variables are discourse referents.
Logical forms represent meanings and their variables are pure logical variables.
To compute a SDRS from a logical form, one has to decide which variables from the logical form become discourse referents, as explained in the next section.
5 Building
SDRSs 5.1 Basic principles To get a recursive process, first, we translate the logical form into a DRS8.
In case of a purely existential formula such as those we have been dealing with so far, this just amounts to putting all the variables into the universe of the DRS and split the formula into elementary conjoined conditions9.
The document structuring task amounts then in building a SDRS from a DRS.
The simplest way to do that is simply to transform : universe conditions into a49 a49 : universe conditions . More complex structures are obtained by splitting the DRS into sub-DRSs as illustrated below.
8This DRS is considered as a logical representation.
It is not yet a discourse representation.
9More complex formulas are not considered here.
universe conditiona50 conditiona52 conditiona75 conditiona100 conditiona98 conditiona149 conditiona150 a151a10a152 a49 a50 a49 a52 a49 a75 a49a51a50 : universea50 conditiona50 conditiona150 a49 a52 : universea52 conditiona52 conditiona98 a49 a75 : universea75 conditiona100 a153 a50a59a49 a50a73a72a49 a52a12a60a57a154 condition a75 a153 a52a59a49a53a52a72a49 a75 a60a57a154 conditiona149 a155 a3a27a15 a42 a3a9a5 a42 a8a27a19a41a156 conditiona46 means that the discourse relation a155 a3 to be established between a42 a3 and a42 a8 must have conditiona46 among its consequences: no other element is in charge of expressing conditiona46 . In SDRT for text understanding, the conditions are not ordered.
However, in text generation, a document plan indicates the order of its components.
As a consequence, when a document plan is a SDRS, its components (labelleda42a24a95 ) have to be ordered.
In the pseudo SDRS above, it is supposed thata42 a3 precedesa42 a8 which precedesa42 a46 . Let us examine the principles governing the splitting of the conditions and the universes.
For the splitting of the conditions, the whole content of the factual database has to be verbalized.
Therefore all the conditions in the DRS have to be expressed in the SDRS.
Two cases appear: a78 either a condition in the DRS appears as a condition in one of the sub-DRS; that is the case fora157a37a43a35a38a158 a97a129a159a77a97a37a26a35 a3 in the DRS labelleda42 a3 ; a78 or it is expressed through a discourse relation; that is the case for a157a37a26a35a38a158 a97a127a159a132a97a37a26a35 a46 . One of the criteria for choosing an appropriate discourse relation is that its consequences have to contain the condition involved.
For example, the condition causea15a17a1a10a3a9a5a7a1a9a8a27a19 can be expressed through Resulta15a42 a3a9a5a42 a8a27a19 whena42 a3 and a42 a8 label the sub-DRSs that contain the descriptions ofa1a10a3 anda1a9a8 respectively.
Let us now look on how to determine the universes of the sub-DRSs, i.e. the discourse referents.
First, there are technical constraints, namely: a78 the arguments of any condition in a sub-DRS must appear in the universe of this DRS; a78 the universes of all the sub-DRSs have to be disjoint.
This constraint is the counterpart of the following constraint in understanding: “partial DRSs introduce new discourse referents” (Asher, 1993, p.
71). These two constraints are not independent.
Assuming that the first constraint is respected, the second one can be respected with the following mechanism: if a variable a11 already appears in a preceding sub-DRS labelled a42a24a160, then a brand new variablea14 is created in the universe of the current sub-DRS labelled a42a24a161 and the condition a14a162a29a163a11 is added into the conditions of a42a69a161 . The discourse referent a14 will be generated as an anaphora if a42a24a160 is available to a42a69a161 (see section 2.1), otherwise it will be generated as a definite or demonstrative NP.
Secondly, as mentioned in section 4, it has to be decided which variables become discourse referents.
When we have for instance a0 fa5a7a1 a3a5a7a1a8 f–causea15a17a1 a3a5a7a1a8 a19, we can decide to apply axiom (17b), and then remove the variable f and every condition having f as an argument (in particular the condition f–causea15a17a1a10a3a9a5a7a1a27a8a27a19 ).
In order for such an operation to be valid, we have to ensure that no information is lost.
In practice, this supposes that no other condition than f–causea15a17a1a4a3a9a5a7a1a9a8a27a19 has f as an argument.
We call this operation dereification.
Conversely from such a formula as a0a146a1a4a3a6a5a7a1a9a8 causea15a17a1a10a3a43a5a7a1a9a8a27a19, we can apply axiom (17a), and then remove the condition causea15a17a1a4a3a9a5a7a1a9a8a27a19 . We call this operation reification.
Contrarily to dereification, no information can be lost.
These two operation are a mix between something which is pure logic (that adds information) and a discourse operation that deals with discourse referents.
As our objective is to build as much dicourse plans as possible, reification and de-reification are systematically performed whenever possible.
The process is recursive: once all this is done (splitting the conditions, universes determination (including reification and de-reification) and choice of discourse relations), the process can apply recursively on each of the embedded DRSs (this is the reason why the logical form is first translated into a DRS).
5.2 Algorithm
A naive solution to implement these principles will be first described.
Next some refinements will be proposed.
The naive solution amounts to considering all the possible splittings of the set of conditions.
If there are a35 conditions, the number of sub-SDRSs ranks from a113 toa35 . In the hypothesis of a splitting into a164 sub-SDRSs, each condition may be put in any of thea164 sub-SDRSs or in any of thea164a166a165 a113 sets of conditions to be expressed by a discourse relation10.
Next the universes of the sub-SDRSs are built according to the principles described above.
This leads to availability constraints (e.g.
a42a69a160 is available toa42a69a161 ) to be checked later on.
In the next step, the possible discourse relations are computed according to their consequences.
At this step, a lot of hypotheses are ruled out.
For example, any hypothesis assuming that a condition such as a1 –leavea15a18a11a71a5a12a14a146a19 is to be expressed through a discourse relation will be ruled out.
Finally, the availability constraints have to be checked using the same rules as in understanding.
With this naive solution, a lot of document plans will be rejected by the linguistic component.
As an illustration, each sub-SDRS has to be verbalized as a clause (see section 6).
Therefore, any sub-SDRS that does not include an eventuality or a fact will be rejected by the linguistic component.
This naive solution is theoretically valid, however it is not usable in practice.
A lot of possible failures can be foreseen.
For example, the conditions that can be expressed through a discourse relation, e.g. causea15a17a1 a3a5a7a1 a8 a19, should be considered first.
If it is decided that such a condition is indeed expressed by a discourse relation, e.g.
Resulta15a42 a3a27a5a42 a8a6a19, then the sub-SDRSs a42 a3 and a42 a8 are created with the conditions concerning a1a4a3 and a1a27a8 respectively.
To sum up, the process of splitting the conditions should not be blind.
The content of the conditions has to be taken into account in order to guide the splitting and avoid thereby failures that can be foreseen.
However, the details of this optimization will not be presented here.
10In SDRT, any element in the universe of a SDRS must be linked to another element.
Therefore, a SDRS witha167 subSDRSs must include (at least)a167 a151a140a168 discourse relations.
6 Generating
a text from a SDRS A SDRS, i.e. a document plan, is given to a microplanner and surface realizer which computes one or several texts.
It is the topic of another paper to explain in detail this process.
Here we will only give the basic principles which guide the choices to be made in the tactical component.
The process to generate a text from a SDRS a84 U,Cona85 is basically recursive: a78 an element a42a69a95 in U has to be generated as a clause if a42 a95 labels a DRS and recursively as a text (possibly a complex sentence) if a42a69a95 labels a SDRS.
a78 a condition R a15 a42a69a95 a5 a42a51a96 a19 in Con has to be generated as a text “a169 a95a77a170 a121a41a171 a1 a169 a96a4a170” or as a complex sentence “a169a148a95 a121a172a171 a1 a169a146a96 a170”, where a169a148a95 generates a42a24a95, a169a146a96a70a42a44a96, and a121a172a171 a1 is a cue phrase lexicalizing R (a121a172a171 a1 may be empty).
a78 a condition a42a93a92a57a94 in Con where a94 is a DRS a84 U,Cona85 has to generated as a clause according to the following constraints: – in analysis, a discourse referent is the trace of either a determiner or an inflexion mark.
Therefore, in generation, a discourse referent has to be generated as an NP or a tensed verb (noted V).
Such an information is noted as e.g. a1 a3 :NP/V; – the conditions guide the lexical choices.
The conditions a11a173a29 Fred correspond to proper names which is noted asa11 :PN[Fred].
The equality conditions between discourse referents (e.g.
a11a174a29 a14 ) give rise to (pronominal or nominal) anaphora which is noted as a11 :ANA[a14 ].
The other conditions are associated to lexical predicates.
With these constraints, an element which is reified, e.g. f–causea15a17a1a10a3a9a5a7a1a27a8a27a19, gives rise to an NP or a verb (a cause of, provoke) and an element which is not reified, e.g. causea15a17a1a10a3a9a5a7a1a27a8a27a19, gives rise to a modifier on a1 a3 or a1 a8 with a1 a3 anda1a27a8 generated either as verbs or NPs.
This process results in a list such as: – a1a10a3 :NP/V[a1a10a3 –leave(a11 )], – a11 :PN[Fred(a11 )], – f:NP/V[f–cause(a1a10a3, a1a9a8 )], – a1a9a8 :NP/V[a1a27a8 –fit-of-tears(a14 )], – a14 :PN[Mary(a14 )].
Such a list guides the lexical choices and syntactic realization performed by the micro-planner.
7 Illustration
on examples Let us show how to compute the SDRSs in (3a) and (3b) from the logical form in (1).
First, this formula is translated in the DRS in (19), in which the conditions are numbered for the sake of convenience.
(19) a55a50 a55a52 a56a175a68 conda50 : a55a50 –leavea59a56a53a60 conda52 : a55a52 –fit-of-tearsa59a68a26a60 conda75 : causea59 a55 a50a12a72 a55 a52a73a60 conda100 :a56a34a58 Fred conda98 :a68a70a58 Mary conda149 : a55a50a38a61a64a63a66a65a7a67 conda150 : a55a52 a61a64a63a66a65a7a67 From (19), one possibility is to express conda46 through Resulta15a42 a3a9a5a42 a8a9a19 in which a42 a3 and a42 a8 label the sub-DRSs grouping the conditions on a1a10a3 and a1a9a8 respectively.
Therefore, a42 a3 has to group conda3 and conda176 . As conda3 introduces the variable a11, conda177 has to figure also in a42 a3 11.
The universe of the DRS labelled by a42 a3 is a178 a1a4a3a9a5a12a11a38a179 . Similarly for a42 a8, its universe is a178 a1a9a8a10a5a12a14a180a179, its conditions are conda8, conda181 and conda182 . All the conditions of (19) are therefore expressed in (3a) which is a well-formed document plan.
Following the rules sketched in section 6, (3a) will be generated in (2a) by the linguistic component, if Result is lexicalized as the cue phrase therefore which links two sentences.
From (19), another possibility is to split all the conditions into two sub-DRSs: the first one labelleda42 a3 grouping the conditions ona1a4a3 (as in the previous possibility), the second one labelled a42 a8 grouping all the other conditions.
conda46 ina42 a8 has a1a10a3 as argument.
This variable already appears in a42 a3 . Therefore a brand new variable a1a46 is created in the universe of a42 a8 and the condition a1 a46 a29a183a1a4a3 11This is an optimization: if cond a100 were not included in a49a51a50, the surface realizer would fail ona49a51a50 and the hypothesis would be ruled out.
is added ina42 a8 . As all the conditions are split into the sub-DRSs, a42 a3 and a42 a8 have to be linked with a discourse relation which adds no information (i.e.
which has no consequence).
Commentary is such a discourse relation, and it is valid here since its constraint (one element ina42 a8 has to be coreferent with one element in a42 a3, see section 1) is respected with the coreference relation a1 a46 a29a184a1a4a3 . At this step, the SDRS in (20) has been built.
From (20), one possibility is to transmit this SDRS as it is to the tactical component.
If Commentary is lexicalized as an empty cue phrase linking two sentences, (20) will be generated in (21) where causea15a17a1a46 a5a7a1a27a8a27a19, which is not reified, is expressed through the modifier because of.
(20) a49 a50 a49 a52 a49a44a50 a54 a55 a50a51a56 a56a34a58 Fred a55 a50 –leavea59a56a53a60 a55 a50a38a61a64a63a53a65a86a67 a49 a52a185a54 a55 a52 a55a76a75 a68 a68a91a58 Mary a55 a52 –fit-of-tearsa59a68a43a60 causea59a55a75a72a55a52a12a60 a55a7a75 a58 a55 a50 a55 a52 a61a64a63a53a65a86a67 Commentarya59a49 a50a12a72a49 a52a73a60 (21) Fred left.
Mary burst into a fit of tears because of that.
In text understanding, (21) is likely to be analyzed with the discourse relation Narrationa15a42 a3a9a5a42 a8a27a19, which has for consequence a1a4a3 a33 a1a27a8 . This condition is compatible with those in a42 a8 since causea15a17a1 a46 a5a7a1a9a8a27a19 with a1a46 a29a186a1a4a3 implies a1 a3a187a33 a1 a8 . So, there is no conflict between the understanding and the generation of (21).
From (20), another possibility is to reify causea15a17a1a9a46a10a5a7a1a8 a19 in a42 a8 . The SDRS in (20) becomes that in (3b).
If f–cause is lexicalized as bring into (a colloquial variant of cause when the second argument is a fit of tears), (2c) will be generated.
8 Conclusion
We have dealt with the document structuring task, considering that it should be able to produce several outputs so that it can cope, among other things, with real lexical gaps in the target language (and also actual gaps in a realistic surface realizer).
We therefore aim at producing as much document plans as possible.
We suppose that the content determination component provides a logical form encoding the factual data to be linguistically verbalized.
Axioms may apply on this logical form which enable reifications and de-reifications.
As a consequence, some predicates may be realized either as a verb, an NP or a modifier.
The document structuring component is based on SDRT, a formalized discourse framework which can account for the expressiveness of texts, contrarily to RST.
A document plan is a SDRS.
This level of representation is likely to be language and domain independent and can be provided to existing surface realizers.
Building SDRSs from a logical form is a recursive process for which a basic strategy has been presented and exemplified.
No implementation has been realized yet, however we foresee to do it and to interface it with the tactical component CLEF (Meunier and Reyes, 1999).
