is typically a correspondence between the removed text and the resumed text, and following Bear, Dowding and Shriberg (1992), we annotate this using the labels m for word matching and r for word replacements (words of the same syntactic category).
P92-1008
We have implemented a pattern builder (Heeman and Allen, 1994b), which builds potential repair patterns based on word matches and word replacements.

In order to provide a large training corpus for the statistical model, we use a tagged version of the Brown corpus, from the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini and Marcinklewicz, 1993).

Bear, Dowding and Shriberg (1992) looked at the number of matching words versus the number of intervening words.

Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993), the question arises as to what the tagger should do with them.

4. Part.of-Speech Tagging Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning to a word the category that is most probable given the sentential context (Church, 1988).

Lastly, Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) also used the ATIS corpus, but in this case, focused only on detection, but detection of all three types of repairs.

Bear, Dowding, and Shn'berg (1992) use the ATIS corpus, which is a collection of queries made to an automated airline reservation system.
P92-1008
In a test set of 756 utterances containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al., 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a precision rate of 62%.

Recently, Dowding et al.(1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the Darpa Airline reservation corpus.

Good partof-speech results can be obtained using only the preceding category (Weischedel et al., 1993), which is what we will be using.
J93-2006
The SRI g~up (Bear, Dowding and Shn%erg, 1992) removed the assumptiml of an explicit edit signal, and employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs (they removed all utterances with abridged repairs from their corpus).
P92-1008
Dowding et al.(1993) used a similar setup for their d~t~= As part of a complete system, they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 85%; and for correction, a recall rate of 30% and a precision of 62%.
P93-1008
Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) investigated using acoustic informarion to detect the interruption point of speech repairs.

Heeman and Allen, 1994Â¢); words have been transcribed and the speech repairs have been annotated.
