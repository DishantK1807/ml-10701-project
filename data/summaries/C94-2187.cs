It derives a linguistic motivation front the view that discourse consists of what we call discourse segments, minimal coherent mtits of discourse (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993), while statistically it is guided by ideas from intbrmatiou retrieval (Salton, 1988).

Previous quantitative approaches to text segmentation (Hearst, 1993; Kozima, 1993; Youmans, 1991) have paid little attention to a statistically important structure that a discourse might have and detined it away ~Ls a lump of words or sentences.

Fnrthermore, we do not intend the disD Figure 1: Discourse Structure course structure to be anything close to the ones that rhetorical theories of discourse (tIovy, 1990; Mann and Tholnpson, 1987; Itobbs, 1979) claim it to be, or inteulional structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) ; indeed we do not assmne any functional relation, i.e. causation, elaboration, extension, etc., among the segments that constitute a discourse structure.

One of the problems with tim analysis has to do with its generality (Kozima, 1993); a text with many repetitions and/or limited vocabulary would yield a flattened VMP, which, of course, does not tell us much about its inner strncturings.

For the semantics of a discourse segment, Nomoto and Nitta (1993) observes an interesting tendency that zero (elliptical) anapl,ora occurring within the segment do not refer across the segment boundary; that is, their references tend to be resolved internally 1. Now we take a very simple view about tile gk)bal structure of discourse: syntactically, discourse is just lllerc and throughout we use 01 for a subject(NOMinative) zero; 02 for a object(ACCusative) zero; TOP for a topic case; I)AT fox" a dative(indirect object) c~me; PASS for a passive mor\].)heIIle.

Experiments Earlier quantitative approaches to text partitioning (Youmans, 1991; Kozima, 1993; Ilearst, 1993) work with an arbitrary block of words or sentences to determine a strneture of discourse.

The approach builds on tile ttleory of discourse segment (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993), incorporating ideas from the research on information retrieval (Salton, 1988).
E93-1037
It is quite possible that a set of discourse segments are not aggregated into a single discourse but may have diverse discourse groupings (Nomoto and Nitta, 1993).
