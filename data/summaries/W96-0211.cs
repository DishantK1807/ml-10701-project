Examples include the use of decision trees for syntactic analysis (Magerman, 1995), coreference (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), and cue phrase identification (Litman, 1994); the use of inductive logic programming for learning semantic grammars and building prolog parsers 113 (Zelle and Mooney, 1994; Zelle and Mooney, 1993); the use of conceptual clustering algorithms for relative pronoun resolution (Cardie, 1992a; Cardie 1992b), and the use of case-based learning techniques for lexical tagging tasks (Cardie, 1993a; Daelemans et al., submitted).

Case-based learning algorithms have been used in NLP for context-sensitive parsing (Simmons and Yu, 1992), for text categorization (Riloffand Lehnert, 1994); for lexical tagging tasks like part-of-speech tagging and semantic feature tagging (Daelemans et al., submitted, Cardie, 1994, Cardie, 1993a); for semantic interpretation (e.g., concept extraction (Cardie, 1994, Cardie, 1993a)); and for a number of low-level language acquisition tasks, including stress acquisition (Daelemans et al., 1994) and graphemeto-phoneme conversion (Bosch and Daelemans, 1993).

We then apply the linguistic bias approach to feature set selection in one natural language learning task -the relative pronoun (RP) disambiguation task from Cardie (1992a, 1992b). Experiments indicate that the case-based learning algorithm improves on the relative pronoun task as relevant biases are incorporated into the underlying instance representation.

For these experiments, we drew training and test cases (241 instances) from MUC-3 texts that describe Latin American terrorist events (Chinchor et al., 1993).

Centering constraints (see Brennan et al., 1987), for example, can be encoded as linguistic biases and applied to the pronoun resolution task to increase system performance.
