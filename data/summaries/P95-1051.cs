See, for example, (Moran, 1988) 2. What we suggest, instead, is that quantifiers in natural language be treated as ambiguous words whose meaning is dependent on the linguistic context, as well as time and memory constraints.
P88-1005
In such an oversimplified model, quantifier ambiguity has often been translated to scoping ambiguity, and elaborate models were developed to remedy the problem, by semanticists (Cooper, 1983; Le Pore et al, 1983; Partee, 1984) as well as computational linguists (Harper, 1992; Alshawi, 1990; Pereira, 1990; Moran, 1988).
