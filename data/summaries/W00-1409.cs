For an easy adaptation to other domains and languages, we have emphasized an organization based on a general kernel system and the declarativity of knowledge sources (Becker et al., 1998).

The processing is .based,on a fully lexicatized TreeAdjoining Grammar derived from the HPSG grammar used in the deep-processing parser module (Kasper~et aL, 1995; Becker, 1998).

Work and Conclusions VERB~;IOBIL also contains a component that automatically generates dialogue scripts and result summaries of the dialogues in all target languages (Alexandersson and Poller, 1998; Alexandersson and ::Poller~ 2000 ) ~:: ~This component, uses the'generation modules of VERB1V\[OBIL for sentence generation as well as the translation system itself to achieve multilinguality.

We first present our classical generator architecture (see also (Becker et al., 1998; Becker et al., 2000)) in terms of the RAGS architecture and then discuss its extension to the task-inherent problems.

It can easily be added to a RAGSlike system whose whiteboard is perfectly suited for lVerbmobil Interface Term, (Bos et al., 1996; Dorna, 1996) the transformations that the robustness preprocessing module performs.
