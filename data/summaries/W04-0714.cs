Another method employs statistical models or AI techniques, such as machine learning, to compute the most likely candidate (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Connoly et al., 1994; Ge et al., 1998; Seki et al., 2002).

Our method is an inexpensive, fast and reliable procedure for anaphora resolution, which relies on cheaper and more reliable NLP tools such as partof-speech (POS) tagger and shallow parsers (Baldwin, 1997; Ferrández et al., 1998; Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Mitkov, 1998; Yeh and Chen, 2003).

Model In the centering theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al, 1995; Walker et al., 1994; Strube and Hahn, 1996), the 'attentional state' was identified as a basic component of discourse structure that consisted of two levels of focusing: global and local.

In addition to the structures for centers, C b, and C f, the centering model specifies a set of constraints and rules (Grosz et al, 1995; Walker et al.1994). Constraints For each utterance U i in a discourse segment consisting of utterances U 1, …, U m : 1.

They are not constrained by features of any previous utterance in the discourse segment (DS), and the elements of C f (U n ) are partially ordered to reflect relative prominence in U n. Grosz et al., in their paper (Grosz et al, 1995), assume that grammatical roles are the major determinant for ranking the forward-looking centers, with the order “Subject > Object(s) > Others”.

Parsing Shallow (or partial) parsing which is an inexpensive, fast and reliable method does not deliver full syntactic analysis but is limited to parsing smaller constituents such as noun phrases or verb phrases (Abney, 1996; Li and Roth, 2001; Mitkov, 1999).
