(Mitkov (1997) does a detailed study on factors in anaphora resolution).

(Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) for another application in which no explicit indicators are available in the stream).

The idea is similar to that used in the centering approach (Brennan et al., 1987) where a continued topic is the highest-ranked candidate for pronominalization.
P87-1022
Mitkov (1997) describes an approach that uses a set of factors as constraints and preferences.

gender/animaticity statistics After we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute P(p\[wa) where wa is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p (Note the pronouns are grouped by their gender): \[ wain the antecedent for p \[ P(pl o) = When there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by Dunning (1993) on all the words in the candidate NP.

This program differs from earlier work in its almost complete lack of hand-crafting, relying instead on a very small corpus of Penn Wall Street Journal Tree-bank text (Marcus et al., 1993) that has been marked with co-reference information.
J93-2004
The likelihood ratio is adapted from Dunning (1993, page 66) and uses the raw frequencies of each pronoun class in the corpus as the null hypothesis, Pr(gc0i) as well as Pr(ref E gci) from equation 9.
J93-1003
Lappin and Leass (1994) report on a (essentially non-statistical) approach that relies on salience measures derived from syntactic structure and a dynamic model of attentional state.
