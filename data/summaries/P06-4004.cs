Fields like the analysis of the lexical text cohesion (Morris and Hirst, 1991), word sense disambiguation (Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), ontology learning (Navigli and Velardi, 2005), etc.

1,000 sentences were uniformly selected from the set of documents in the semantically-tagged SemCor corpus (Miller et al., 1993).

have certainly benefited from the availability of wide-coverage computational lexicons like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), as well as semantically annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993).

Recently, a knowledge-based algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation, called Structural Semantic Interconnections1 (SSI) (Navigli and Velardi, 2004), has been shown to provide interesting insights into the choice of word senses by providing structural justifications in terms of semantic graphs.

The tool can indeed provide richer information than interfaces like the Open Mind Word Expert (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002), and the annotator can take advantage of the resulting graphs to improve awareness in the decisions to be taken, so as to make consistent choices with respect to the reference lexicon.

The grammar consists of a small number of rules, inspired by the notion of lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991).

For instance, the agreement in the Open Mind Word Expert project (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2002) was 67:3%.
