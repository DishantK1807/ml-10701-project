As with the pure statistical translation model described by Wu (1996) (in which a bracketing transduction grammar models the channel), alternative hypotheses compete probabilistically, exhaustive search of the translation hypothesis space can be performed in polynomial time, and robustness heuristics arise naturally from a language-independent inversiontransduction model.

Estimation of the parameters has been described elsewhere (Brown et al., 1993).

This approach was used for the SBTG channel (Wu, 1996), using the language-independent bracketing degenerate case of the SITG: 3 all A -4 \[AA\] aO A --+ (AA) A b(54Y) x/y VX, y lexical translations A b(.~Â¢).z'/~?

I Various models have been constructed by the IBM team (Brown et al., 1993).

Subsequently, a method was developed to use a special case of the ITGRthe aforementioned BTGRfor the translation task itself (Wu, 1996).

3Wu (Wu, 1996) experimented with Chinese-English translation, while this paper experiments with English-Chinese translation.

A step was taken by Wu (Wu, 1996) who introduced a polynomial-time algorithm for the runtime search for an optimal translation.

The model employs a stochastic version of an inversion transduction grammar or ITG (Wu, 1995c; Wu, 1995d; Wu, 1997).

The corpus was sentence-aligned statistically (Wu, 1994); Chinese words and collocations were extracted (Fung and Wu, 1994; Wu and Fung, 1994); then translation pairs were learned via an EM procedure (Wu and Xia, 1995).

The SBTG can be regarded as a model of the language-universal hypothesis that closely related arguments tend to stay together (Wu, 1995a; Wu, 1995b).

2 Review: Noisy Channel Model The statistical translation model introduced by IBM (Brown et al., 1990) views translation as a noisy channel process.
J90-2002
If the target CFG is purely binary branching, then the previous theoretical and linguistic analyses (Wu, 1997) suggest that much of the requisite constituent and word order transposition may be accommodated without change to the mirrored ITG.
