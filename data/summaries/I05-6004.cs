Work We are currently experimenting with moving some of the information (in particular the type name and criteria) into the actual grammar files, in the same way as Dini and Mazzini (1997).
W97-1504
We take our examples from JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002), a large grammar of Japanese built in the HPSG framework.
W02-1210
Secondly, we extract words that are judged to belong to a given lexical type and sentences that contains the words (Example (3b)) from the treebank database compiled from the Hinoki treebank (Bond et al., 2004a).

• The grammar database contains the actual implementation of the grammar, written as typed feature structures using TDL (Krieger and Schafer, 1994).
C94-2144
Hypertextual Grammar development (Dini and Mazzini, 1997) attempted a similar task, but focused on documenting the grammar, not on linking it to a dynamic treebank.

W04-2209
We currently link lexical types of our grammar to those of ChaSen (Matsumoto et al., 2000), Juman (Kurohashi and Nagao, 2003), ALTJ/E (Ikehara et al., 1991) and EDICT (Breen, 2004).

Treebanks constructed with detailed linguistic information play an important role in various aspects of natural language processing; for example, grammatical knowledge acquisition; world knowledge acquisition (Bond et al., 2004b); and statistical language model induction.
C04-1193 W04-1901
We have constructed a linguistically enriched treebank named ‘Hinoki’ (Bond et al., 2004a), which is based on the same framework as the Redwoods treebank (Oepen et al., 2002) and uses the Japanese grammar JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002) to construct the treebank.1 In the construction process, we have also encountered the problem just mentioned.

Another notable related work is the COMLEX syntax project (Macleod et al., 1994).
