40 Salvan Road Waltham, Massachusetts 02254 Contrary to the long-held belief of transfo~national E~mmarians for communication in general, the majority cf natural languaEe sentences which people actually use in oommunicating with a co~puter, in an unconstrained mode, are not novel.
As Thompson and Thompson 1981s660 obselwez "monotony of structure is the rule rathe~ than the exception in homan-computer communication".
Thompson 1981"41 reports in her study of such communications that 75 percent of the queries were wh-questions, 1% percent were commands, 5 percent were statements, and 1 percent were yes/no questions.
The repetitive feature of natural language is not a new concept.
Similar observations have been made bsforeo Damerau 1971 used collocation of lexioal items as the basis for a Marker model in an experiment for text generation.
Becket claims that "the wonderful feats of the homan intellect.., are based as much on memorization as on any impromptu problem-solving" (1975:62).
He posits a phrasal lexicon oonslstln~ of six major categories of lexioal phrases by which we "stitch tcgether swatches of text that we have hear~ before| productive processes have the secondary role of adapting the old phrases to the new situations" (1975z60)o All of these approaches to natural languaEe data rely heavily on the observation that many lexlcal items tend 106 co-occur.
This surface co-occurrence is the result of what may at times be complicated syntactic and semantic interrelations of language unite.
Unfortunately, a systematic accounting of these interrelations has not been achieved in any linguistic theory.
The thrust of our approach is that the more of language which can be handled lexical!y, the easier will homan language be able to be modelled.
Actual data on the frequency of lexical collocation are very spares.
A study of word sequences in PANALOG text has shown a surprising amount of repetition of word sequences (Bienstock and Smith in preparation).
(PANALOG is a system for passing messages among small ~oups in computer conferenclng with telemall and calendar features.
See Housman 1979.
The data are of human-homan communication and not homan-computer cc~.,nunication and are thematically restricted.
They therefore resemble Damerau's data).
A study of parts of the Brown English Corpus has been undertaken in order to get less thematically homogeneous material.
In addition, Wizard of OZ experiments with unconstrained h,-.an-computer input will begin soon at GTE Laboratories in order to gather the more relevant human-oomputeu~ data.
A PANALOG text of 16,133 words chosen for study.
The longest string which occurred more than once was a seven word quote from Ntetzsche.
Two six-word strings occurred twice and at length five, one occurred three times and thirteen were repeated twice.
An interesting feature of these distributions is that the number of hapaxes (those strings occurring only once at a given string length) reaches a peak at length three (see Figure i).

String Length This is a reveall~ measure of the Amount of repetition in a text of this length.
In particular, recurring two word strings account for 40.8 percent of the running text and recu~ring three word strings comprise 8.1 percent of the text.
The basic assumption of the frequent occurrence of lexical collocation in natul-al language texts, especially in h,-,an-ocmputer communication, is the basis for the development of a new type of natural language processor.
Ford, 1981, has constructed a natural languaEe processing system for database updating, retrieval, and manipulationt which relies critically on the observation that real users tend to employ a very limited set .of lexical dtri~ types in queryi~ databases.
The Ford natural language processor consists of a two stage reduction algorithm for ~ranslating natural languaEs inputs into basic functions which are then used to perform the query.
The first stags of the reduction changes the input words to meaning representations usinE a list of lexioal items and a meaning correlate list.
The second stage takes as input strings of these meaning correlates and oha~es them into basic llst.
409 numeric representations for words mapped down to 132 unique meanings and 1328 canonical sentence vectors mapped down 108 to 19 functions.
This two stage reduction scheme worked efficiently enough to respond to 93.8 percent of the 1697 input queries, including ungrammatical ones from inexperienced users, with a response time of 1.5 seconds, operating in an environment of 90K 8-bit bytes.
This compares very favorably to Thompson 1981 where only 67.7 percent of REL queries were correctly parsed with an average response time of 10 seconds.
(Space requirements were not reported).
Similarly, Damerau 1981 and Patrick 1981 report a success rate for TQA of 65.1 percent inputs correctly parsed with the time required to process a sentence typically being 10 seconds.
The reason why the system works so well in terms of accuracy, speed, and small storage reqairements is based on the two stags reduction technique which, in t~rn, is based on the fact that a great ma~v inputs in human-computer communication are repetitious syntactically, semantically, and lexl~ally.
Repetition is a principal characteristic of human-computer communication.
