Experimentally, KRISP compares favorably to other existing semantic parsing systems and isparticularly robust to noisy training data (Kate and Mooney, 2006).

Several learning systems have been developed for semantic parsing, many of them recently (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006).

We modify KRISP, a supervised learning system for semantic parsing presented in (Kate and Mooney, 2006), to make a semi-supervised system we call SEMISUP-KRISP.

2.1 KRISP: The Supervised Semantic Parsing Learning System KRISP (Kernel-based Robust Interpretation for Semantic Parsing) (Kate and Mooney, 2006) is a supervised learning system forsemantic parsing which 81 takes NL sentences paired with their MRs as training data.
