to be confused by collocates" (Dagan et al., 1993).

For example, frequent words are translated less consistently than rare words (Melamed, 1997).

2We could just as easily use other symmetric "association" measures, such as Â¢2 (Gale & Church, 1991) or the Dice coefficient (Smadja, 1992).

For each co-occurring pair of word types u and v, these likelihoods are initially set proportional to their co-occurrence frequency n(u,v) and inversely proportional to their marginal frequencies n(u) and n(v) z, following (Dunning, 1993) 2.

for their models (Brown et al., 1993b).

It is analogous to the step in other translation model induction algorithms that sets all probabilities below a certain threshold to negligible values (Brown et al., 1990; Dagan et al., 1993; Chen, 1996).

Resnik & Melamed (1997) report that the model produced 494 translation lexicons with 94% precision and 30% recall, when trained on French/English software manuals totaling about 400,000 words.

This imbalance foils thresholding strategies, clever as they might be (Gale & Church, 1991; Wu ~z Xia, 1994; Chen, 1996).

The co-occurrence relation can also be based on distance in a bitext space, which is a more general representations of bitext correspondence (Dagan et al., 1993; Resnik & Melamed, 1997), or it can be restricted to words pairs that satisfy some matching predicate, which can be extrinsic to the model (Melamed, 1995; Melamed, 1997).

Promising features for classification include part of speech, frequency of co-occurrence, relative word position, and translational entropy (Melamed, 1997).

Machine readable bilingual dictionaries, even when they are available, have only limited coverage and rarely include domain-specific terms (Resnik & Melamed, 1997).

We induced a two-class word-to-word model of translational equivalence from 13 million words of the Canadian Hansards, aligned using the method in (Gale & Church, 1991).

2 Co-occurrence With the exception of (Fung, 1998b), previous methods for automatically constructing statistical translation models begin by looking at word cooccurrence frequencies in bitexts (Gale & Church, 1991; Kumano & Hirakawa, 1994; Fung, 1998a; Melamed, 1995).

Fortunately, indirect associations are usually not difficult to identify, because they tend to be weaker than the direct associations on which they are based (Melamed, 1996c).

Over the past decade, researchers at IBM have developed a series of increasingly sophisticated statistical models for machine translation (Brown et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993a).

The most common way is to divide each half of the bitext into an equal number of segments and to align the segments so that each pair of segments Si and Ti are translations of each other (Gale & Church, 1991; Melamed, 1996a).
