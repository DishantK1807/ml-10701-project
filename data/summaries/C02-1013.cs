Recently, Schmid and Rooth (2001) have described an algorithm for computing expected governor labels for terminal words in labelled headed parse trees produced by a probabilistic context-free grammar.

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) report an F-score of 87% for assigning grammatical function tags to constituents, but the task, and therefore the scoring method, is rather different.

tuples also constitute a convenient intermediate representation in applications such as information extraction (Palmer et al., 1993; Yeh, 2000), and document retrieval on the Web (Grefenstette, 1997).

In recent work on unsupervised learning of prepositional phrase disambiguation, Pantel and Lin (2000) derive training instances only from relevant data appearing in syntactic contexts that are guaranteed to be unambiguous.

Research on unsupervised acquisition of lexical information from corpora, such as argument structure of predicates (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; McCarthy, 2000), word classes for disambiguation (Clark and Weir, 2001), and collocations (Lin 1999), has used grammatical relation/head/dependent tuples.

Analysis System In this investigation we extend a statistical shallow parsing system for English developed originally by Carroll, Minnen and Briscoe (1998).

Approaches based on memory based learning have also used chunking as a first stage, before assigning grammatical relation labels to heads of chunks (Argamon, Dagan and Krymolowski, 1998; Buchholz, Veenstra and Daelemans, 1999).

In addition, the system is able to perform parse failure recovery, finding the highest scoring sequence of phrasal fragments (following the approach of Kiefer et al., 1999), and the system has produced at least partial analyses for over 98% of the sentences in the written part of the British National Corpus.

Thus, Brent (1993) only creates hypotheses on the basis of instances of verb frames that are reliably and unambiguously cued by closed class items (such as pronouns) so there can be no other attachment possibilities.

Statistical finite-state approaches have also been used: Brants, Skut and Krenn (1997) train a cascade of Hidden Markov Models to tag words with their grammatical functions.

The GR scheme is decribed in detail by Carroll, Briscoe and Sanfilippo (1998).

Blaheta and Charniak (2000) assume a richer input representation consisting of labelled trees produced by a treebank grammar parser, and use the treebank again to train a further procedure that assigns grammatical function tags to syntactic constituents in the trees.

GRs are in general compared using an equality test, except that in a specific, limited number of cases (described by Carroll, Minnen and Briscoe, 1998) the parser is allowed to return more generic relation types.
