A weaker reliability metric on the pooled data from nine coders, therefore, would provide a reliable majority coding on this dialogue (see (Passonneau and Litman, 1997) for discussion of how reliability is computed for pooled coding data).

The Toot system is described in (Litman et el., 1998).
P98-2129
Following (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), macro-level analysis captures two fundamental intentional relations between I-units, those of domination (or parent-child) and satisfactionprecedence (or sibling) relations.

CGUs are similar in many respects to other mesolevel coding schemes, such as initiative-response in the LINDA coding scheme (Ahrenberg et al., 1990; Dahlb~ck and JSnsson, 1998), or conversational games (Carletta et al., 1997).
J97-1002
The second scheme concerned intentional/informational structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Nakatani et al., 1995) as content, operated at a macro level of granularity, and was structured as hierarchical trees (with annotations for capturing discontinuities).
