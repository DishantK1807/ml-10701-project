Furthermore, good results have been produced in other areas of NLP research using maximum entropy techniques (Berger et al., 1996; Koeling, 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1997a).

As has already been noted by Yarowsky (1994), using lemmas helps to produce more concise and generic evidence than inflected forms.

features seen in testing not occurring in training), smoothing is essential as a way to optimize the feature weights (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2003).

The statistical classifier used in the experiments reported in this paper is a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997b).

Lemmatization allows for more compact and generalizable data by clustering all inflected forms of an ambiguous word together, an effect already commented on by Yarowsky (1994).
