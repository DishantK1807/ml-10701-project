This should be of interest to a wider audience within computational linguistics, especially as SFG has recently been attracting an increasing amount of interest in the field (see, e.g.: Houghton and Isard, 1987; Kasper, 1988; Patten, 1988; Patten and Ritchie, 1987; Mellish, 1988; Paris and Bateman, 1989).

In practise, when using SPL it is possible to abbreviate or to default commonly used combinations of inquiry responses; thus, for example, it is possible to replace all of the :speech-act, :speech-act-id, and :e~ent-time features shown in Figure 1 with the more coarsely-grained, specification :speech-act ~sssrt :tense present-in-past For more details see Kasper (1989).

We have described some of the motivations for and the basic organisation of the combined framework in Steiner and Sch~tz (1988) and Bateman, Kasper, Schfitz, and Steiner (1989).

projects involved 2.1 Eurotra-D Analysis Module The German analysis module of our proposed MT system is based on the Eurotra Engineering Framework (Bech and Nygaard, 1988) enhanced by a semantic component derived from systemic theory.

In effect, the upper model can often mediate between the results of the MT analysis, expressed in ET-D Interface Structures, and the input that must be specified for Penman, expressed in the Penman Sentence Plan Language (SPL) (Kasper, 1989).

The function of predicate-argument structures, especially in connection with semantic casls is another interesting research topic (as suggested by Somers (1986) which can be addressed in the present context, especially as the two components involved share their essential notions of predicate-argument structures from systemic linguistics.
