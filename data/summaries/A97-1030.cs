Tall and a woman named April Wednesday (McDonald 1993) come to mind.

Like common nouns, ((Jensen and Binot 1987), (Hindle and Rooth 1993) and (Brill and Resnick 1994)), proper names exhibit structural ambiguity in prepositional phrase (PP) attachment and in conjunction scope.

Several (e.g., (McDonald 1993), (Mani et al.1993), (Paik et al.1993) and (Cowie et al.1992)) look in the local context of the candidate proper name for external information such as appositives (e.g., in a sequence such as Robin Clark, presiden~ of Clark Co).

Although this problem is well known, a seazch of the computational literature shows that few solutions have been proposed, perhaps because the conjunct ambiguity problem is harder than PP attachment (though see (Agarwal and Boggess 1992) for a method of conjunct identification that relies on syntactic category and semantic label).
P92-1003
Most proper name recognizers that have been reported on in print either take as input text tagged by part-of-speech (e.g., the systems of (Paik et al.1993) and (Mani et al.1993)) or perform syntactic and/or morphological analysis on all words, including capitalized ones, that are part of candidate proper names (e.g., (Coates-Stephens 1993) and (McDonald 1993)).
