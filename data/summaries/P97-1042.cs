When interpreted as a transduction that maps an input to an output, they cannot always be turned into a deterministic form (see (Mohri, 1994; Roche and Schabes, 1995)).

One issue which remains to be resolved, however, is to determine which approach for compiling rules into automata is more efficient: the standard method of (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) (also (Mohri and Sproat, 1996) which follows the same philosophy) or 334 Algorithm Intersection Determini(N 2) zation (2 N) KK (n -i) "J3 ~in_-i ki 8 ~'\]~=1 ki EKP 1 ± ~"\]n n,i=t ki 1 ..t.

the subtractive approach of (Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996).

It was mentioned that the algorithm presented here is based on the work of (Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996) rather than (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).

the incorporation of rule features in contexts, are independent of the algorithm itself and can be also applied to (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) and (Mohri and Sproat, 1996).

~More 'user-friendly' notations which allow mapping expressions of unequal length (e.g., (Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996)) are mathematically equivalent to the above notation after rules are converted into same329 R1 k:cl:k:0 ::¢, ___ R2 b:c3:b:0 =¢.

9This is a generalization of the operator Id in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).

Note that complementation requires determinization, and subtraction requires one intersection and one complementation since AB = An B (27) Although statistically speaking the number of operations used in (Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996) is less than the ones used in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), only an empirical study can resolve the issue as the following example illustrates.

Algorithms which compile regular grammars into automata (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Mohri and Sproat, 1996; Grimley-Evans, Kiraz, and Pulman, 1996) do not make use of this important mechanism.
C96-1077 J94-3001 P96-1031
It has long been proposed that regular formalisms (e.g., rewrite rules, two-level formalisms) accommodate rule features which provide for finer and more elegant descriptions (Bear, 1988).
