However, the psycholinguistic literature does not support Walker's contention that a cache in combination with main memory, as is standard in computational architectures, provides a good basis for a computational model of human attentional capacity in processing discourse (Walker 1996b).

Gordon* University of North Carolina Walker (1996) presents a cache model of the operation of attention in the processing of discourse as an alternative to the focus space stack that was proposed previously by Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986).

In earlier work (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) we have argued that it is important to distinguish between two levels of discourse structure and processing: global and local.
J86-3001
Walker presents as an alternative to the focus space stack previously proposed to model global attentional state (Grosz 1977a; Grosz and Sidner 1986) a cache model in which linear recency and a highly constrained cache capacity play primary roles.
J86-3001
The claim of centering theory is not that centering alone suffices for resolving all pronominal reference (see Kehler \[1997\]), but that when attentional state plays a role, it is local, not global attentional state.
J97-3006
The main claims about its use in processing have been for handling definite descriptions (Grosz 1977a; Grosz 1981) and reasoning about intentional structure (Lochbaum 1998).
J98-4001
An important related claim is that (4) only items in the cache are available for various discourse processes like the inference of discourse relations (Walker 1996, 258).
J96-2005
Instead, the cache model assumes the cache is sufficiently limited in size that everything in it is "almost instantaneously accessible" (Walker 1996, 258).
J96-2005
A recent article by Walker (1996) argues that the attentional mechanism has limited capacity, that this limited capacity determines the accessibility of information in discourse processing, and that certain linguistic behavior can only be explained in terms of this limited capacity.
J96-2005
Implicit focus (Grosz 1977b) and the treatment of functionally related entities (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) respond to a related issue in discourse processing, namely, what other than an entity itself becomes focused when the entity is focused?
J95-2003
In particular, as used in computer systems, stacks do not differentiate among different kinds of frames, but interruptions seem to operate differently from normal embeddings (Grosz and Sidner 1986) and there are open issues in explaining pronominal reference at discourse segment boundaries.
J86-3001
Many different cues have been discussed in the literature, including cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Sidner 1981), intonation (Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Nakatani 1997), repetition of previous content (Sidner 1979), and tense (Polanyi 1988).
J81-4001 J93-3003
In subsequent work we have defined a centering model for attentional state at this level (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995) and have explored the ways in which pronominal reference and centering interact (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993, interalia).
