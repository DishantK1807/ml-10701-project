A user study (Brill et al., 1998) showed that humans can utilize linguistic knowledge at various levels to improve the SR output by selecting the best utterance hypotheses from N-best lists.

Most of features were extracted from the output of syntactic or semantic parsers, including full/robust/no parse, number of words parsed, gap number, slot number, grammar rule used, and so on (Rayner et al., 1994; Pao et al., 1998; Carpenter et al., 2001; San-Segundo et al., 2001).

However, such features have only been discussed in the context of conversational dialogue in specific domains such as ATIS (Rayner et al., 1994), JUPITER (Pao et al., 1998), and Communicator (Carpenter et al., 2001; SanSegundo et al., 2001; Zhang and Rudnicky, 2001; Sarikaya et al., 2003).

Features For each word w, the following lexical features are extracted: • word: w itself • pos: part-of-speech tag from Brill’s tagger (Brill, 1995) • syllables: number of syllables in w, estimated based on the distribution patterns of vowels and consonants • position: the position of w in the sentence: beginning, end, and middle 3.2 Syntactic Features Speech recognition errors may result in ungrammatical sentences under the assumption that the speaker follows grammar rules while speaking.

A Prolog based TBL tool, µTBL (Lager, 1999) 2 is used in this study.

It has been successfully used in many natural language applications such as partof-speech tagging (Brill, 1995).
