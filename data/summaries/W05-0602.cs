The syntactic parameters are the same as in Section 5.1 and are smoothed as in (Collins, 1997).

Bikel. 2004.
J04-4004
Most recent work in learning for semantic parsing has focused on “shallow” analysis such as semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
J02-3001
As in (Collins, 1997), the parameter C8 D0 B4C4 CX B4D0D8 CX BND0DB CX B5CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVB5 is further smoothed as follows: C8 D0BD B4C4 CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVB5 A2 C8 D0BE B4D0D8 CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVBNC4 CX B5A2 C8 D0BF B4D0DB CX CYC8BNC0BNDBBND8BNA1BNC4BVBNC4 CX B4D0D8 CX B5B5 Note this smoothing is different from the syntactic counterpart.
P97-1003
Sentences were parsed by Collins’ head-driven model 2 (Bikel, 2004) (trained on sections 02-21 of the WSJ Penn Treebank) to generate an initial syntactic parse tree.
J04-4004
We augment Collins’ head-driven model 2 (Collins, 1997) to incorporate a semantic label on each internal node.
P97-1003
Only one word is labeled with the concept; the syntactic head word (Collins, 1997) is preferred.
P97-1003
History-based models of parsing were first introduced in (Black et al., 1993).
P93-1005
The syntactic model in (Miller et al., 2000) is similar to Collins’, but does not use features like subcat frames and distance measures.
A00-2030
In the following section, we follow the notation in (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
Note this threshold is smaller than the one used in (Collins, 1997) since the corpora used in our experiments are smaller.
P97-1003
The queries in this corpus are more complex than those in the ATIS database-query corpus used in the speech community (Zue and Glass, 2000) which makes the GEOQUERY problem harder, as also shown by the results in (Popescu et al., 2004).
C04-1021
Collins. 1997.
P97-1003
The systems introduced in (Miller et al., 1996; Miller et al., 2000) also integrate semantic labels into parsing; however, their SAPT’s are used to pro15 duce a much simpler MR, i.e., a single semantic frame.
A00-2030 P96-1008
The probabilities from these back-off levels are interpolated using the techniques in (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
In (Lev et al., 2004), a syntax-driven approach is used to map logic puzzles described in NL to an MRL.
W04-0902
Otherwise they are generated along with the words using the same approach as in (Collins, 1997).
