<context>andthisisthefocusof this paper. What is usually done (see among others (Setzer et al., 2006)) is to use inference rules capturing the formal linksbetween relations, suchas Allen’salgebra onrelations (Allen, 1983), and compute a temporal closure on the graph of temporal relations on events. Temporal closure is a reasoning mechanism that consists in composing known pairs of temporal relations in order to obtai</context>
<context> nodes. Only closures are compared, with potentially a110a50 relations if there are a110 events in a text. Using inference rules capturing the formal links between relations, such as Allen’s algebra (Allen, 1983), and computing a temporal closure, is now widely accepted as necessary (Setzer et al., 2006). 2.1. Importance of relations However, in a temporal graph, all relations do not have all the same import</context>
