For example, the gloss definition of concept sport NN#1 is an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition, which yields the logic representation: active JJ(x1) & diversion NN(x1) & require VB(e1,x1,x2) & or CC(x2,x3,x4) & physical JJ(x3) & exertion NN(x3) & competition NN(x4) Ranking Answer answers Answer explanation QLF ALF XWN axioms Lexical chains NLP axioms Builder Axiom Ranked Justification Relaxation success prooffails Figure 1: COGEX Architecture Lexical Chains A much improved source of world knowledge is obtained when the gloss words are semantically disambiguated (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002).

87-93 Proceedings of HLT-NAACL 2003 2 Integration of Logic Prover into a QA System The QA system includes traditional modules such as question processing, document retrieval, answer extraction, built in ontologies, as well as many tools such as syntactic parser, name entity recognizer, word sense disambiguation (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002), logic representation of text (Moldovan and Rus 2001) and others.

This is referred to as the 10-90 rule (Moldovan and Rus 2001).

We developed software that automatically provides connecting paths between any two WordNet synsets a0a2a1 and a0a4a3 up to a certain distance (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002).

This represents a significant improvement in the performance of the logic prover for QA over the one reported in (Moldovan 2002).
