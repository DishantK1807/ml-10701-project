Given the emphasis within NLG research on text-level issues, a major bottleneck for work here is the encoding of corpora with semantic and discourse structural features; see Di Eugenio, Moore, and Paolucci (1997).

For example, systems have been evaluated by using human judges to assess the quality of the texts produced (Lester and Porter 1997; Chu-Carroll and Carberry, this issue); by comparing the system's performance to that of humans (Yeh and Mellish 1997); by corpus-based evaluation (Robin and McKeown 1996); and indirectly through "task efficacy" measures (Young 1997).

Specifically, three linguistic realization packages, FUF/SURGE (Elhadad 1993a, 1993b; Elhadad and Robin 1996), PENMAN/NIGEL (Penman group 1989), and its descendant KPML/NIGEL (Bateman 1997), are widely used in the field.

We predict that the World Wide Web will be a major factor in forcing some of the issues here: if systems are to automatically generate the text on Web pages (see, for example, Milosavljevic and Dale \[1996\]), then they also need to consider other elements of that container.

should be noted, however, that there is a body of work that looks at the use of bidirectional grammars, where a common declarative representation of grarmnatical knowledge is used both for parsing and for realization; see, for example, Shieber et al.(1990). 347 Computational Linguistics Volume 24, Number 3 There is also the question of text structure: texts are not just random collections of sentences; they exhibit a structure that plays a key role in conveying their meaning.
