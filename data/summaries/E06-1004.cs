The parameters of the models are estimated by iterative maximum-likelihood training on a large parallel corpus of natural language texts using the EM algorithm (Brown et al., 1993).

In the classic work on SMT,Brownandhiscolleagues atIBMintroduced the notion of alignment between a sentence f and its translation e and used it in the development of translation models (Brown et al., 1993).

Increasingly, parallel corpora are becoming available for many language pairs and SMT systems have been built for French-English, German-English, Arabic-English, Chinese-English, Hindi-English and other language pairs (Brown et al., 1993), (AlOnaizan et al., 1999), (Udupa, 2004).

Exact Decoding is the original decoding problem as defined in (Brown et al., 1993) and Relaxed Decoding is the relaxation of the decoding problem typically used in practice.

An open question in SMT is whether there existsclosed formexpressions (whoserepresentation is polynomial in the size of the input) for P (f|e) and the counts in the EM iterations for models 3-5 (Brown et al., 1993).

Note that our results for decoding are sharper than that of (Knight, 1999).

(e∗,a∗) = argmax (e,a) P(f,a|e) P(e) Viterbi Alignment computation finds applications not only in SMT but also in other areas of Natural Language Processing (Wang, 1998), (Marcu, 2002).

In (Knight, 1999) it was proved that the Exact Decoding problem isNP-Hard when the language model is a bigram model.

The models are then used to decode, i.e. translate texts from the source language to the target language 1 (Tillman, 2001), (Wang, 1997), (Germann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004).

Decoding is an integral component of all SMT systems (Wang, 1997), (Tillman, 2000), (Och et al., 2001), (Germann et al., 2003), (Udupa et al., 2004).

Statistical Machine Translation is a data driven machine translation technique which uses probabilistic models of natural language for automatic translation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).

In their seminal paper on SMT, Brownand his colleagues highlighted the problems weface aswe go from IBM Models 1-2 to 3-5(Brown et al., 1993) 3: “Asweprogress from Model1toModel5, evaluating the expectations that gives us counts becomes increasingly difficult.

Expectation Evaluation is the soul of parameter estimation (Brown et al., 1993), (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).
