Mellish 1988), giving an efficient way of applying plausibility constraints on domain predicates.

Bound variable anaphora, on the other hand, involves replacement of the a_term by a variable bound by a logical form quantifier (Partee 1978).

We will not be discussing the process of quantifier scoping here: a scoping mechanism for the CLE has already been described by Moran (1988), and a later version is described by Pereira in Alshawi et al.(1988). Formally, it may be possible to regard the resolution process as defining a function from (QLF,context) pairs to LFs.

One way of viewing a QLF expression is as a conditional interpretation in the sense of Pollack and Pereira (1988).

In our current semantic rules, the list is built up by unification by accumulating it in a pair of features that are "threaded" through the daughters of each constituent in a manner similar to the threading of long distance dependency gaps (Pereira 1981).

The constraint gives also the expected behavior for comparatives such as: John is taller than him (Bill) John is as tall as him (John)* because it applies to the arguments of a predicate more used in the LF representation of comparative constructions (Alshawi and van Eijck 1989), the final LF for the first of the examples above being \[more, E" F" \[tall--degree,E,FLjohn,bill\].

This is in contrast to approaches (e.g., Hobbs 1976; Carter 1987) in which these details are encoded in the algorithm, leading to different success rates for different algorithms depending on the type of text 134 Computational Linguistics Volume 16, Number 3, September 1990 Hiyan Alshawi Resolving Quasi Logical Forms (Walker 1989 compares the performance of two such algorithms).

LFs FROM QLFs 2.1 QLF CONSTRUCTS The QLF language is a superset of the LF (logical form) language used in the CLE (Alshawi and van Eijck 1989).
