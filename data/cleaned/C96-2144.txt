tr Abstract We present a constraint-based case flame lexicon arctfitecture fbr bi-directionM mapping between a syntactic case Dame and a semantic Dame.
The lexicon uses a semantic sense as the basic unit and employs a multi-tiered constraint structure for the resolution of syntactic information into the appropriate senses and/or idiomatic usage.
VMency changing transfbrmations such as morptnologieally marked passivized or causativized forms are handled via le:xical rules that manipulate case Dames templates.
The system has been implemented in a typedfeature system and applied to Turkish.
1 Introduction
-Recent adwmces in theoreticM and practical aspects of feature and constraint-based tbrmMisms for representing linguistic information have fostered research on the use of such formMisms in the design and implementation of computational lexicons (Briscoe el al., 1993).
Case frame approach has been the representation of choice especially for languages with free constituent order, explicit case marking of noun phrases and embedded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles.
The semantics of such syntactic role fillers are usually determined by their lexicM, semantic and morplmsyntactic properties, instead of position in the sentence.
In this paper, we present an approach to building a constraint-based case Dame lexicon for use in natural language processing in Turkish.
A number of observations tha.t we have made on Turkish tmve indicated that we have to go beyond the traditional transitive and intransitive distinction, and utilize a Damework where verb valence is considered as the obligatory co-existence of an arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with the obligatory exclusion of certain others, relative to a verb seuse.
Additional morphosynt~ctic, lexical and semantic selectional constrMnts are utilized to map a given syntactic argument structure to a specific verb sense.
In recent years, there have been several studies on constrmnt-based lexicons.
iR,ussell el al.
(1993) propose an approach to multiple default inheritance tbr unification-based lexicon.
In another study by Lascarides et el.
(1995), an ordered approach to default unification is suggested, de Paiva (1993) tbrmalizes the system of well-fornmd typed feature struetures.
In this study, type hierarchies and relations are mathematically defined.
They also formalize unification and generalization operators between tin(; featm:e structures, along with defining well-formedness notion that we use in our system.
2 Representing
Case Frame Information In rlhu'kish, (and possibly in many other languages) verbs often convey several meanings (some totally unrelated) when they are used with subjects, objects, oblique objects, adverbiM adjuncts, with certain lexical, morphological, and semantic features, and co occurrence restrictions.
In addition to the usual sense wu:iations due to selectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in most cases, the meaning conveyed by a.
case Dante is idiomatic, with subtle constrMnts.
For example, the Turkisln verb ye (cat), when used with a direct object noun phrase whose head is: 1.
para (money), with no case or possessive markings and a lmman subject, means to accept bribe, 2.
pare (money), wittn a non-human subject, means to cost a lol, 3.
para (or any other NP whose head is ontologically IS-A money, e.g., dolar, mark, etc).
with obligatory accusative markilig ~md optional possessive meriting, means to spend *~IO~tCy~ 4.
kafa (head) with obligatory accusative marking and no possessive marking, means to get mentally deranged, 5.
hak (right) with optionM accusative and possessive markings, mearls to be unfair, 854 6.
I~(t.s( (head, of'.
d) (or a.ny N\] ) whose het~(/ is ontologically IS-A hnma.n) with optional accusative mill optio,al i)ossessivc marking (obligatory only with ba,~), lilea31s lo waste or demote, a person.
On the other ha.rill: I.

if the abla.tive case-ll,au'ked oblique o|)ject does not denote something edible, but rather a.
container, then the sense maps to to eat oul of, with the optio'naldirect (cdil)le) ol)ject denoting the ol).iect eat(,,.

This structure is simib~r to the structure proposed in Laser, rides cl al.
(:1995). Ilowevcr, instead of classifying argument structures as simply tr~nsit, ive, intransitive, etc., we need to consider all relewmt elements of the l)ower set of t)ossible arguments.

elude in the argument slot (for a verb in active voice) are the following: • subject (nominative NP), 1 • direct object (nominative or accusative easemarked ~IP), • oblique objects (ablative, dative, locative case-marked NP), • beneficiary object (dative case-marked ~lP, or pP with a certain PFORN), • instrument object (instrumental case-marked gP or PP with a certain PFORIt), • value object (dative case-marked NP or PP with a certain PFORH).
In general, there may be more than one instantiation of the SEM frame for a given instantiated set of case frame arguments (and vice versa).
For instance, for the ye verb discussed above, the argument structure for the third case giving rise to the meaning to get mentally deranged may conceivably give rise to a literal meaning in a rather improbable context (such as eating the head of a fish at dinner much in the spirit of the two interpretations of the English idiom kick the bucket), or the same semantics may be expressed by a different surface form.
3.2 Constraint
Arehlteeture We express constraints on the arguments in the case frame of a verb via a 5-tier constraint hierarchy sharing constraints among the specification of other constraints and sense definitions, whenever possible: NP's that have no case-marking in Turkish.
1. Constraints on verb features that describe any relevant constraints on tile morphological features of the verb, such as agreement or voice markers.
2. Constraints on mou)hological features that describe any obligatory constraints on the arguments, such as case-marking, verb form (in the case of embedded clauses), etc.
3. Constraints on argument co-occurrence that express obligatory argument co-occurrence constraints along with constraints that indicate when certain arguments should not occur in order resolve a sense.
4. Lexieal constraints that indicate any specific constraints on the heads of the arguments in order to convey a certain sense, and usually constrain the stem of the head noun to be a certain lexical form, or one of a small set'of lexical forms.
5. Semantic Constraints that indicate semantic selectional restriction constraints that may resolved using a companion ontological database (again implemented in TFS) in which we model the world by defining semantic categories, such as human, thing, nonliving object, living object, etc., along the lines described by Nagao et al.(1985). Figure 2 illustrates the simplified form of the constraint-sense mapping of the verb yc (eal).
a.a Valeney Changing Transtbrmations As we have already stated, we encode senses of verbs in active voice unless a verb has an idiomatic usage with obligatory passive, causative and/or 856 reflexive voices.
2 In
order to handle these valency changing transfor-mations, we dellne lexical rules as shown in Figure 3.
INPUT ~ CASE I,RAME Refl~.xivi/~,ql(-iN: \] Rellexive: \[I little I ~I < t, Rellexive:~+ \[" ~ c,,.,~,.~.,,,~,,,/ IN: ~~ c, ~a v e i (~illl sil li V13,.~ ~ ~ 1 .I~XICON P~ssbi*ali~,rl ( IN: "~ ~ Passive Passive: ~1 t I,'igure 3: Valency transforma.tions using lexical rllles.
This ligure describes how a given case fi'ame with its syntactic constituents is processed by a sequence of lexical rules each stripping off a certain voice marker and then attempting unification wii;h t;he lexicon for any possible sense resohttion.
The order of lexieal rules in this figure reflects the reverse order of voice markers in 'Purkish verbal morphology, a So a given case frame m~y have to go through three lexical rules until it finds a unifying entry in the lexicon.
\[h|itications before going through all le×ical rule.s are for (possiMy idiomatic)senses which explicitly require w~rious voice \]na,rkings.
Two additional constituents are a,dded via these lexieal rules.

The sub.icct of the senl;ences a causative voice marked verb is indicated by CAUSER in the seInani;ics fi:ame.
Our current implementation does not deal with multiple cansatiw: w)ice rnarkings (which Turkish allows), or with the rather tricky surface case change of the object of causation depending on the transitivity of Lit(: causativized verb.

3.4 Examples
In this section wc present n \[hw exmnples that show how one c~m describe a given verb sense.
For the tirst example tile following constraints a.re employed: l.
VERB-IS-YE is it constr~fint corresponding to \[vl.:itm I S't'r0:m: "ye'\] 2.
VERB-TAKES-IqO-PASSIVE-NO-REFLEXIVE is the verb constr&illt VEIB: \[/I,'LX: nil 3.
DIR-0BJ-ttAS-N0-POSS is the morphological eonstrainl, \[An C~s: I ~m~-OlIJ: Ivoss .......
\] 4.
DIR-OBJ-IS-ACC is the morphological constraint |AlmS: I~)m-ouJ: I c:as~ .......
\] 5.
NO-DATIVE-OBL-OBJ is the argument co occurrence constraint \[An.c;s: I,)AT-O|,L:,,lit 6.
SUBJEGT-IS-ttUMAig is the semantic constr~fint 7.
DIR-OBJ-HEAD-LEX-KAFA is a lexical constraint |Alms: IDm-Ol3a: IIn.mD: ILItX: "k~t~"\] 8.
SEM-GET-MEIgTt~LLY-DERANGED is the feature structure for the semantics portion M| We can then express the constraint for the verb sense by unifying (denoted by g~ in 'FFS) all the 857 lex-rule F I IN: OUT: V E I1,13 : ARGS: SEM: I VFIZB: I AII.GS: SIBM: -STEM: CAUS: PASS: nI,'LX: SUB J: \[~\]\] DIILOBJ: nil A13L-OBJ: .., nOLPS: \[CAUStDI): "STIgM: CAUS: PASS: I~.FLX: "SUB,I: I)IFCOILI : ABL-OIlJ: \['rOLES: \[TIIEME: Figure 5: 'l'he simplified causation rule for intransitive verbs constraints ~.d~ove: SENSE-GET-MENTALLY-DERANGED := VERB-IS-YE VERB-TAKES-N0-PASS IVE-N0-REFLEXIVE DIR-OBJ-HAS-NO-POSS ~ DIR-0BJ-IS-ACC & NO-DATIVE-0BL-OBJ g DIR-0BJ-LEX-KAFA & SUBJECT-IS-HUMAN g SEM-GET-MENTALLY-DERANGED.
The resulting constraint when unified with partially specified case frarne entry -an entl:y where only tile argument and verb entries have been specified, will supply the unspecified SEN component(s).
That is, when a partially specified ease \[rame such as VEIIB: AP(;S: S'PEM: "yc".
1 PASS: nil CAUS: Lm~,i,x: nil J I CAT: NIASE: -CAT: STEM: SUB J: IIEAD: I AGR: LPOSS: CAT: iP -CAT: STEM: DIR-OBJ: IlEAD: CASE: kposs: N "&d&rn" noln 3SG llOlle "\] "kM&" ~tcc / 3SG IIOIle .~ unifies successfully with the given constraint above, the unspecified portion will be properly instantiated with the experieneer being coindexed with the subject in the arguments.
As a second example, consider tile default sense of ye corresponding to cat (somcthi~z.q).
'\['he constraints are: 1.
VERB-IS-YE is the verb constraint 2.
VERB-TAKES-N0-REFLEXIVE is the verb c-onstraint \[vEa,: I I~\],'Lx:,,ill 3.
NO-DAT-OBL-OBJ is tile co-occurrence const,'ain~ \[AR.S: I--A'~-O\]~, .... i~\] 4.
DIR-0Ba-IS(optional-ed±ble) is the disjunctive argument constraint (Tiffs is just explanatory, see below for how this is implemented in TFS).
5. kBL-0BJ-IS(opt±onal-container) is the argument constraint, \[---{P '...... 6.
IgST-OBJ-IS(optional-instrument) is tile argument constraint 7.
SEN-EAT1 is the tha~lu:e structure for the semantics portion Ants: |Dm-Ol?3: \[\] ABI,-OU3: UNS'r: "PILED: "to eat" SNM: ltOLES: / SOUIt'CE: LINST: In inost eases, there are arguments that are not obligatorily required for resolving a verb sense.
These, nevertheless, have to be constrained, usually on semantic grounds.
For instance the direct object is not obligatory for the basic sense of ye, but has to be an edible entity if it, is present.
We handle these constraints by defining a slightly more complex type hierarchy: argument = noun-phrase I case-frame I optional.
optional = optional-edible I opt ional-cont ainer I optional-instrument .... optional-edible = nil I edible-obj.
edible-obj ~ noun-phrase & IS-A-EDIBLE.
where IS-A-EDIBLE is a constraint of the t'orrrt \[IIEAD: I SEM: edible\].
The optional ablative and instrumental objects are defined similarly.
4 The
4Note th~Lt the surface case constraints for these are defined in the ha,sic definition of the case fl:ame.
858 sense definition then becomes: SENSE-EAT1 := VERB-IS-YE & VERB-TAKES-NO-REFLEXIVE g NO-DATIVE-OBL-OB J DIR-0B J-IS (optional-edible) ABL-0BL-0BJ (optional-container) INST-OBJ-IS(optional-instrument) g SEN-EAT1.
As a more cornplicated exaInl)le employing nested clauses, we presenl, below the case frame for the last example in Secl, ion 2, where the verb rut (catch) is used with a clausal subjecl; for a very specilic idiomatic usage.

' In this case, the sense resoluliou of the embedded case frame is also pe~Jbrmed concurrently with, the ease flame resolution of the lop-level frame.
