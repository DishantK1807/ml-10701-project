Everyday dictionaries are obviously not structured in a way that enables their immediate use in NLP systems, but several Studies have shown that relatively simple procedures can be used to extract taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for example, Amsler, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Cbodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens, 1986; Byrd et al., 1987; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988; Vtronis and Ide, 1990~ Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990).

Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn (1985) proposed a heuristic for extracting hypernyms which exploits the fact that definitions for nouns typically give a hypemym 227 term as the head of the defining noun phrase.

Sense disambiguation in dictionary definitions is a difficult problem, and we will not address it here; this problem is the focus of much current research and is considered in depth elsewhere (e.g., Byrd et al., 1987; Byrd, 1989; Vtronis and Ide, 1990; Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et al., 1990).
