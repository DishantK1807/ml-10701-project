There s This observation is predicted by Nakhimovsky's work on the discourse structure of narrative text, in which it is suggested that paragraph breaks accompany discontinuities (Nakhimovsky & Rapaport 1988; Naldaimovsky 1988).

If there isn't one, then the algorithm cannot identify the subjective character at this point in the text (see Wiebe & Rapaport 1988 and Wiebe 1990 for ~;xamples i~x which the reader must read further in the text in order to identify the subjective characÂ° ter).

Second, we are extending the algorithm to make connections with work on focus of attention and discom'se structure (such as Grosz & Sidner 1986); in particular, we are investigating how resolving anaphora and tracking the current point of view are related (Stark 1987, Hewitt 1988).

A preliminary version of the algorithm was presented by Wiebe & Rapaport 1988.
