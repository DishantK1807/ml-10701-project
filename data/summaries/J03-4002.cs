For example, the antecedent e r of a singular demonstrative pronoun (in English, this or that) is often an eventuality that derives from a clause, a sentence, or a larger unit in the recent discourse (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991).

As is the case with resolving a discourse deictic (Asher 1993; Byron 2002; Eckert and Strube 2000; Webber 1991) this resolution process would use syntactic and semantic constraints that it accumulates as the incremental sentence-level parser/interpreter processes S.

We are clearly not the first to have proposed a grammatical treatment of low-level aspects of discourse semantics (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent 1997; Polanyi and van den Berg 1996; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996), but we are the first to have recognized that the key to avoiding problems of maintaining a compositional semantics for discourse lies in recognizing discourse adverbials as anaphors and not trying to shoehorn everything into a single class of discourse connectives.
C88-2120
One early hint that adverbial cue phrases (called here discourse connectives) might be anaphoric can be found in an ACL workshop paper in which Janyce Wiebe (1993) used the following example to question the adequacy of tree structures for discourse: (1) a.

As with (36d), the relevant elements of (37b) can be represented as α = then R α = after S = turn right on County Line σ = e 3 :turn-right(you, county line) and the unresolved interpretation of (37b) is thus [λ x.after(x, EV)]e 3 ≡ after(e 3, EV) 560 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 4 As for resolving EV, in a well-known article, Moens and Steedman (1988) discuss several ways in which an eventuality of one type (e.g., a process) can be coerced into an eventuality of another type (e.g., an accomplishment, which Moens and Steedman call a culminated process).

In showing how DLTAG and an interpretative process on its derivations operate, we must, of necessity, gloss over how inference triggered by adjacency or associated with a structural connective provides the intended relation between adjacent discourse 578 Computational Linguistics Volume 29, Number 4 units: It may be a matter simply of statistical inference, as in Marcu and Echihabi (2002), or of more complex inference, as in Hobbs et al.(1993). As we noted, our view is that there are three mechanisms at work in discourse semantics, just as there are in clause-level semantics: Inference isn’t the only process involved.
P02-1047
in an earlier paper (Webber and Joshi 1998), we discuss reasons for taking the lexical anchors of the initial trees in Figures 7 and 8 to be feature structures, following the analysis in Knott (1996) and Knott and Mellish (1996), here we just take them to be specific lexical items.

The pronoun this in T2 is resolved anaphorically to the nearest consistent eventuality (Eckert and Strube 2000; Byron 2002) which in this case is interp(T1).

(On the contrast between choices, which seem to lead to implicatures, and mere alternative linguistic formulations, which do not seem to, see, for example, Dale and Reiter [1995] and Levison [2000].) In several previous papers (Webber, Knott, and Joshi, 2001; Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b), we described how our approach fits into the framework of tree-adjoining grammar.
P99-1006
She j often beats her i . (Strube 1998) This suggests that in examples (11)–(13), the relationship between the discourse adverbial and its (initial) argument from the previous discourse might usefully be taken to be anaphoric as well.
P98-2204
(Of course, there may also be a separate intentional relation between the two sentences [Moore and Pollack 1992], independent of the relation conveyed by the discourse adverbial.) One must distinguish, however, between whether a theory allows a distinction to be made and whether that distinction needs to be made in a particular case.
J92-4007
• An incremental anaphor resolution mechanism, similar to that in Strube (1998), but extended both to deictic pronouns, as in Eckert and Strube (2000) and Byron (2002) and to the anaphoric argument of discourse adverbials.

Consider “other NPs” (Bierner 2001a; Bierner and Webber 2000; Modjeska 2001, 2002), as in: (26) Sue grabbed one phone, as Tom darted to the other phone.

the left of the horizontal arrow are the elementary trees to be combined: T1 stands for the LTAG tree for clause (64a), T2 for clause 18 The latter use of an auxiliary tree is related to dominant topic chaining in Scha and Polanyi (1988) and entity chains in Knott et al.(2001). 19 We comment on left-to-right incremental construction of DLTAG structures in parallel with sentence-level LTAG structures at the end of Section 5.2. 577 Webber et al.Anaphora and Discourse Structure (64b), and β:punct1 for the auxiliary tree assocated with the period after (64a).

But this isn’t the only reason to recognize discourse adverbials as anaphors: In the next section, we suggest a framework for anaphora that is broad enough to include discourse adverbials as well as definite and demonstrative pronouns and NPs, along with other discourse phenomena that have been argued to be anaphoric, such as VP ellipsis (Hardt 1992, 1999; Kehler 2002), tense (Partee 1984; Webber 1988) and modality (Kibble 1995; Frank and Kamp 1997; Stone and Hardt 1999).

Somewhat more complex than coreference is indirect anaphora (Hellman and Fraurud 1996) (also called partial anaphora [Luperfoy 1992], textual ellipsis [Hahn, Markert, and Strube 1996], associative anaphora [Cosse 1996] bridging anaphora [Clark 1975; Clark and Marshall 1981; Not, Tovena, and Zancanaro 1999], and inferrables [Prince 1992]), in which the anaphor (usually a definite NP) denotes a discourse referent associated with one (or more) discourse referents in the current discourse context; for example, (25) Myra darted to a phone and picked up the receiver.

when semantics underspecifies syntactic dependency (as discourse semantics must, on our account) is known to be intractable (Koller and Striegnitz 2002).
P02-1003
Byron (2002) advocates a similar approach to resolving discourse anaphora.
P02-1011
This is a goal that researchers have been pursuing for some time, using both compositional rules and defeasible inference to determine these additional aspects of meaning (Asher and Lascarides 1999; Gardent 1997; Hobbs et al.1993; Kehler 2002; Polanyi and van den Berg 1996; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Schilder 1997a, 1997b; van den Berg 1996) If that portion of discourse semantics that can be handled by mechanisms already needed for resolving other forms of anaphora and deixis is factored out, there is less need to stretch and possibly distort compositional rules and defeasible inference to handle everything.
C88-2120
(Further discussion of such examples can be found in Isard [1975]; Dale [1992]; and Webber and Baldwin [1992]).
P92-1013
As we have pointed out in earlier papers (Webber, Knott, and Joshi 2001; Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b), structural connectives have two relevant properties: (1) they admit stretching of predicate-argument dependencies; and (2) they do not admit crossing of those dependencies.
P99-1006
Example (69b) is a simpler version of an example in Moser and Moore (1995), in which This is because is treated as an unanalyzed cue phrase, no different from because in (69a).
P95-1018
Essentially, we follow Hobbs (1985) in using a rich ontology and a representation scheme that makes explicit all the individuals and abstract objects (i.e., propositions, facts/beliefs, and eventualities) (Asher 1993) involved in the LF interpretation of an utterance.

Preliminary accounts are given in Grosz and Sidner [1990] and Moser and Moore [1996].
