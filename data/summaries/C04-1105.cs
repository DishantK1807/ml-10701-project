Technologies for extracting pairs of translation equivalents from parallel corpora have been established (Gale and Church 1991; Dagan, et al.1993; Fung 1995; Kitamura and Matsumoto 1996; Melamed 1997).

This can be done by using the sense-vs.-clue correlation algorithm that the author developed for unsupervised word-sense disambiguation (Kaji and Morimoto 2002).

The second one is a newly devised method using the ratio of associated words that suggest each translation equivalent; it was inspired by a research on word-sense disambiguation using bilingual comparable corpora (Kaji and Morimoto 2002).

Several researchers have developed a contextual-similarity-based method for extracting pairs of translation equivalents (Kaji and Aizono 1996; Fung and McKeown 1997; Fung and Yee 1998; Rapp 1999).

The mutual information of a pair of words is defined in terms of their co-occurrence frequency and respective occurrence frequencies (Church and Hanks 1990).
