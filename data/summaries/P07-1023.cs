What we have called a context-freeλ-term grammar is nothing but an alternative notation for an abstract categorial grammar (de Groote, 2001) whose abstract vocabulary is second-order, with the restriction to linear λ-terms removed.

Our method essentially relies on the encoding of diﬀerent formalisms in terms of abstract categorial grammars (de Groote, 2001).

A string-generating grammar coupled with Montague semantics may be represented by a synchronous CFLG, a pair of CFLGs with matching rule sets (de Groote 2001).
