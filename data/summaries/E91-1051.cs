Conclusion. Our starting point in this paper was the observation that a treatment proposed for cases such as (2) in Kaplan et al (1989) is unworkable.
E89-1037
We have then discussed alternative approaches available within the general model assumed by Kaplan et al (1989).
E89-1037
We first show that the most natural analysis proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the range of data for the translational phenomenon in question.

In this section we have shown that the proposal as outlined in Kaplan et al (1989) does not produce an adequate analysis of these cases, The problem, which is not at first apparent, arises from the combination of the regular and irregular equations from the emphasised lines.

We then go on to discuss alternatives which depart from or extend the formalism proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) in various respects, pointing out some directions for further research.

0. Introduction Recent work in LFG uses the notion of projection to refer to linguistically relevant mappings or convspondences between levels, whether these mappings are direct or involve function composition (I-lalvorsen & Kaplan (1988), Kaplan (1987), Kaplan et al (1989)).

Existing approaches to generation from f/s-structure in LFG are too restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and our current implementation over-compensates.

The discussion in section 2 raises intricate technical issues about the formalism itself, but also relates to wider issues concerning the modularity of the approach to translation proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) as well as the suitability and expressivity of the formalism, raising serious questions about the feasibility of a large MT system along these lines.

CTYPE) SAm) (14b) on the adverb just: (1` TYPE = XCOMP) Notice that the "c annotation to ADVP (which states that the translation of the containing fstructure is the translation of the f-structure associated with the ADVP (i.e: the SADJ slot)) simply equates the x of two f-structures and avoids the problem which beset the proposal in Kaplan et al (1989).

We first show that the most natural analysis proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the range of data for the important translational phenomenon in question.

facilitate discussion, it is worth noting that the proposal in Kaplan et al (1989) involves basically three elements: (11a) a set of (regular) equations constraining both source and target: (~ (t SUB~) = ((~ t) sum) (llb) a set of (regular) equations assigning target PRED values: ((~ t) PRED ~9 = sere form (llc) a (special) equation on ADVP constraining both source and target: ((~ (I' SADJ)) XCOMP) = (~ t) The problem noted above arises from the combination of an equation from (a) with the equation (c).

Kaplan et al (1989) sketch two alternative approaches to head-switching.

Kaplan et al (1989) extend this approach to Machine Translation by defining two translation functions "~ (between f-structures) and "~' (between semantic structures).

Section 1 The discussion here concerns the translational data of head-switching or splitting/fusing discussed in Kaplan et al (1989) as cases of differences of embedding: (2a) John just arrived.

In this direction, the 'special' equations are within the lexieal entry for venir: 20) (( â€¢ T) SADJ PRED FN) = just (~ t) = (~ (t XCOMP)) Substituting variables for clarity, combining fhese equations with the regular equation from the embedding verb (penser) produces no inconsistency, since the path specifications -all COMP and xf5 can be equated: (21) (~ (n COMP) = ((~ a) COMe) = (-c 13) = (('~ fl) COMP) (~ 13) = (~ (13 XCOMP)) (~ 13) = O: (fs)) (( "~ 13) SADJ PRED FN) = just This observation raises interesting questions concerning the directionality assumed in Kaplan et al (1989).

The z annotation to ADVP states that the x of the mother fstructure is the XCOMP of the "~ of the SADJ I Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Kaplan el al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treating the adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simply means that the mapping problem we describe below arises in the monolinsual mapping between f-structure and s-structure.
