Note that these previous experiments were performed using word lists extracted from corpus, not Swadesh-like word lists (Swadesh, 1952; Dyen et al., 1992) handcrafted by linguists. The CPMS takes advantage of the fact that most of the major Indian languages use Brahmi origin scripts, which have a lot of similarities. It models all the similarities as </context>

Both of these are designed to use some linguistic information at the level of writing system, phonology and lexicon (Singh and Surana, 2007). The basic idea is to first extract a list of highly frequent words from the unannotated corpus of each language. No other language resource is used. Since these words are highly frequent, they are </context>
