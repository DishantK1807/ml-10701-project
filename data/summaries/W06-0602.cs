We construct a new SRL system (called a BIOmedical SeMantIc roLe labEler, BIOSMILE) that is trained on BioProp and employs all the features used in our WSJ SRL system (Tsai et al., 2006).

To develop an automatic SRL system for the biomedical domain, it is necessary to train the system with an annotated corpus, called proposition bank (Palmer et al., 2005).

The Penn-style treebank for GENIA, created by Tateisi et al.(2005), currently contains 500 abstracts.

This corpus contains annotations of semantic PAS’s superimposed on the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).

Hacioglu et al.(2004) showed that tagging phrase-byphrase (P-by-P) is better than word-by-word (Wby-W).
W04-2416
However, Punyakanok et al.(2004) showed that constituent-by-constituent (C-by-C) tagging is better than P-by-P.

In spite of the above difficulties, there are proposition banks in the newswire domain that are adequate for training SRL systems (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Palmer et al., 2005).

In the following, we report on the selection of biomedical verbs, and explain the difference between their meaning in PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), developed by the University of Pennsylvania, and their meaning in BioProp (a biomedical proposition bank).

In addition, according to the CoNLL-2005 shared task (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005), the performance of SRL systems in general does not decline significantly when tagging out-of-domain corpora.

The annotation process consists of the following steps: (1) identifying predicate candidates; (2) automatically annotating the biomedical semantic roles with our WSJ SRL system; (3) transforming the automatic tagging results into WordFreak (Morton and LaCivita, 2003) format; and (4) manually correcting the annotation results with the WordFreak annotation tool.
