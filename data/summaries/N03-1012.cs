Experiments In a previous study (Gurevych et al., 2002), we tested if human annotators could reliably classify SRHs in terms 2As the numbers evident from large vocabulary speech recognition performance (Cox et al., 2000), the occurrence of less well formed and incoherent SRHs increases the more conversational a system becomes.

The modeling of Process as a kind of event that is continuous and homogeneous in nature, follows the frame semantic analysis used for generating the FRAMENET data (Baker et al., 1998).

More recently also scores provided by the NLU system have been employed, e.g. parsing scores or discourse scores (Litman et al., 1999; Engel, 2002; Alexandersson and Becker, 2003).

The resulting Kappa statistics (Carletta, 1996) over the annotated data yields a0a2a1 a3a5a4a7a6, which seems to indicate that human annotators can reliably distinguish between coherent samples (as in Example (1a)) and incoherent ones (as in Example (1b)).
