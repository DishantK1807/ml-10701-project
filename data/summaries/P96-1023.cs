The model is intended to combine the lexical sensitivity of N-gram models (Jelinek et al.1992) and the structural properties of statistical context free grammars (Booth 1969) without the computational overhead of statistical lexicalized treeadjoining grammars (Schabes 1992, Resnik 1992).

Lindop and Tsujii 1991 and Dorr 1994) including manyto-many word mapping, argument switching, and head switching.

This way we can keep the benefits of monolingual/bilingual modularity (Isabelle and Macklovitch 1986) without the computationM overhead of transfer-and-filter (Alshawi et al.1992). 172 It is possible to apply the subtree search directly to the whole graph starting with the initial runtime entries from lexical matching.

A similar smoothing technique has been applied to the specific case of prepositional phrase attachment by Collins and Brooks (1995).
W95-0103
We are not advocating an approach in which linguistic structure is ignored (as it is in the IBM translator described by Brown et al.1990), but rather one in which the syntactic and semantic structure of a string is implicit in the way it is processed by an interpreter.

(See Dunning 1993 on the application of likelihood ratios in computational linguistics).

The node mapping function f for the entire tree thus has a different role from the alignment function in the IBM statistical translation model (Brown et al.1990, 1993); the role of the latter includes the linear ordering of words in the target string.

Dynamic programming is again used to make exhaustive search tractable, avoiding the combinatoric explosion of shake-and-bake translation (Whitelock 1992, Brew 1992).

The system translates sentences in the ATIS domain (Hirschman et al.1993) between English and Mandarin Chinese.

These head automata are applied by an algorithm with admissible incremental pruning based on semantic association costs, providing a practical solution to the problem of combinatoric disambiguation (Church and Patil 1982).
