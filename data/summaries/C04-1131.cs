Many studies do not consider all the words of the context (El-Bèze, Loupy, Marteau, 1998; Mooney, 1996; Ng, Lee, 2002).
W02-1006 W96-0208
The choice of the appropriate set of features is an important issue for WSD (Bruce, Wiebe, Perdersen, 1996; Ng, Zelle, 1997; Pedersen, 2001).
W96-0210 W97-0201 W97-0323
A general agreement seems to emerge according to which morpho-syntatic disambiguation and sense disambiguation can be disentangled (Kilgarriff, 1997; Ng, Zelle, 1997).
W97-0201 W97-0323
We have also selected a decision list classifier (DL) which is similar to the classifier used by (Yarowsky, 1994) for words having two senses, and extended for more senses by (Golding, 1995).
W95-0104
For instance, by using these dictionaries, the inter-annotator agreement may sometimes reach only 57% (Ng, Lee, 1996) or may simply be equivalent to random sense allocation (Véronis, 1998).
P96-1006
At present, this type of approach is widely used and seems to yield the best results (Kilgarriff, Rosenzweig, 2000; Ng, 1997b).
W97-0201 W97-0323
We have chosen the Naïve-Bayes classifier (NB) for its simplicity and widespread use, as well as for its well-known state-of-the-art accuracy on supervised WSD (Domingos, Pazzani, 1997; Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997a).
