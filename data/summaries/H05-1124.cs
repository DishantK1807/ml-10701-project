Sequential tagging with the BIO tag set has proven quite accurate for shallow parsing and named entity extraction tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

Dickinson and Meurers (2005) point out that, as language processing begins to tackle problems in free-word order languages and discourse analysis, annotating and extracting non-contiguous segmentations of text will become increasingly important.

For the named entity experiments we used the CoNLL 2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) data with people, organizations, locations and miscellaneous entities.

We compare our methods with both the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) and conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) using identical predicate sets.

Models of that form include hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989; Bikel et al., 1999) as well as discriminative tagging models based on maximum entropy classification (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; McCallum et al., 2000), conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003), and large-margin techniques (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Taskar et al., 2003).

For the NP chunking experiments we used the standard CoNLL 2000 data set (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003) using the predicate set defined by Sha and Pereira (2003).
