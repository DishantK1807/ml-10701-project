Since the precision of the segmentation is not critical, a language independent segmentation system like the one presented by Amithay, Richmond and Smith (1997) is adequately reliable for this task.

work For future work, natural next steps include incorporating a language independent word segmentation phase like the one proposed by Amitay, Richmond and Smith (1997), to improve the performance on large texts.

We will use this property in conjunction with the one sense per discourse tendency noted by Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992b), who showed that words strongly tend to exhibit only one sense in a document/discourse.

It is important to mention that the F-measure for the human performance on this task is about 96%, (Sundheim 1995).

Day and Palmer (1997) showed that a baseline Fmeasure score for the ENAMEX task varies from 21.2% for English to 73.2% for Chinese.

As Day and Palmer (1997) observed, "the fact that existing systems perform extremely well on mixed-case English newswire corpora is certainly related to the years of research and organized evaluations on this specific task in this language.
