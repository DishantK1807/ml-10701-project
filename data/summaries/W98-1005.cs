Extending this notion, (Knight and Graehl, 1997) built five probability distributions: 1.
P97-1017
We applied the EM learning algorithm described in (Knight and Graehl, 1997) on this data, with one variation.
P97-1017
Resolving that ambiguity is bonus when going in the backwards direction--English T, for example, can be safely posited for Arabic t or T without losing any informationâ€¢ 4 New Model for Arabic Fortunately, the first two models of (Knight and Graehl, 1997) deal with English only, so we can reuse them directly for Arabic/English transliteration.
P97-1017
(Knight and Graehl, 1997) describe a backtransliteration system for Japanese.
P97-1017
(Knight and Graehl, 1997) present a computational treatment of Japanese/English transliteration, which we adapt here to the case in Arabic.
