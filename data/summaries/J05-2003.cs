An alternative formalism for scrambling is V-TAG (Rambow 1994a, 1994b; Rambow and Lee 1994), a formalism that has nicer formal properties than nonlocal MCTAG.

However, the definition of the derived tree in Schabes and Shieber (1994) is such that if first β 1 and then β 2 are adjoined at some node µ (i.e., in the derivation tree there are edges from some γ to β 1 and β 2, both with the position p of the node µ in γ), then first the whole tree derived from β 1 is added to position p, and afterwards the whole tree derived from β 2 is added to position p.

TAGs are not powerful enough to describe scrambling in German in an adequate way (Becker, Joshi, and Rambow 1991).

A similar idea has led to the definition of extended derivation in Schabes and Shieber (1994).

Rambow (1994a) proposes detailed analyses of a large range of different word order phenomena in German using V-TAG and thereby shows the linguistic usefulness of V-TAG.

Verbs and Subject-Auxiliary Inversion Other phenomena often mentioned in the TAG literature (see, e.g., Rambow, VijayShanker, and Weir 1995; Kulick 2000; Dras, Chiang, and Schuler 2004) as being problematic for TAG and tree-local MCTAG are sentences with raising verbs and subject-auxiliary inversion, as in examples (7) and (8): (7) Does Gabriel seem to be likely to eat gnocchi?

usual (see Vijay-Shanker 1987; Weir 1988), γ[p,γ prime ] is defined as follows: If γ prime is (derived from) an initial tree and the node at position p in γ is a substitution node, then γ[p,γ prime ] is the tree one obtains by substitution of γ prime into γ at node position p.Ifγ prime is (derived from) an auxiliary tree and the node at position p in γ is an internal node, then γ[p,γ prime ] is the tree one obtains by adjunction of γ prime to γ at node position p.Otherwiseγ[p,γ prime ] is undefined.

5 Actually, in a feature-structure based TAG (FTAG) (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1988), the top feature structure of the root of the derived tree is the unification of the top of the root of verspricht and the top of the root of reparieren.
C88-2147
a way, the idea of node sharing is already present in description-based definitions of TAG-related formalisms (see Vijay-Shanker 1992; Rogers 1994; Kallmeyer 2001).
J92-4004
D-tree substitution grammars (DSGs) (Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir 2001) are another TAG variant one could use for scrambling.
J01-1004
It has been argued (see Rambow 1994a) that in German, there is no bound on the number of scrambled elements and no bound on the depth of scrambling (i.e., in terms of movement, the number of VP borders crossed by the moved element).
P94-1036
One of the first proposals made was an analysis of German scrambling data using nonlocal MCTAG with additional dominance constraints (Becker, Joshi, and Rambow 1991).
E91-1005
A problem with DSG is that the expressive power of the formalism is probably too limited to deal with all natural language phenomena: According to Rambow, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir (2001) it “does not appear to be possible for DSG to generate the copy language” (page 101).
