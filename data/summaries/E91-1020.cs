\[Shieber et al.1990\]). Most of this work shares a Montagovian view of semantics by assuming that LF be integrated into the grammar rules, thus assigning to each syntactic category its semantic representation.

Recent work on semantic-head-driven generation \[Shieber et al.1990, Calder et al.1989, Noord 1990, Russell et al.1990\] provides a very promising step towards efficient, goal-directed reconstruction of LF that is espescially suited for lexicon-centered grammar formalisms such as IIPSG or UCG.
