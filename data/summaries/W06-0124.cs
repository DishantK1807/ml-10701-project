For preprocessing we used an off-theshelf Chinese lexical analysis system, the open source ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003), to segment and POS tag the training and test corpora.

It also performs well on a number of natural language processing problems, including text categorization (e.g., Schapire and Singer (2000), Sebastiani et al.(2000)) and word sense disambiguation (e.g., Escudero et al.(2000)). In particular, it has also been demonstrated that boosting can be used to build language-independent NER models that perform exceptionally well (Wu et al.(2002), Wu et al.(2004), Carreras et al.(2002)).
