"A, B, and C do D, E, and F, respectively") of various natural languages (e.g., Savitch et al.1987). Although there 37 = (a, b} L = (l} R = (partner} C = conjunction of the following subformulas: • (word(pos(x))=a ~ word(mod(x))=a) & (word(pos(x))=b ~ word(mod(x))=b) • mod(x) = pos(y) ~ rood(y) = pos(x) • rood(x) ¢ pos(x) & rood(x) nil • pos(x) < pos(y) < mod(y) pos(x) < mod(x) < mod(y) • rood(y) < pos(y) < pos(x) mod(y) < mod(x) < pos(x) Figure 9: Definition of Gww ~aa a b Figure 10: Assignment for a sentence of Lww is no context-free grammar that generates Lww, the grammar Gww =< E,L,R,C > shown in Figure 9 generates it (Maruyama 1990).
