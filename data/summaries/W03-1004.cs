We also compare our algorithm with two state-ofthe-art systems, SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999) and Decomposition (Jing, 2002).10 Figure 6 shows Precision/Recall curves for the different systems.

Text-to-text generation is an emerging area of research in NLP (Chandrasekar and Bangalore, 1997; Caroll et al., 1999; Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing and McKeown, 2000).

Jing (2002) identifies phrases that were cut and pasted together using a Hidden Markov Model with features incorporating word identity and positioning within sentences, thereby providing an alignment of the document and its summary.

In the context of multidocument summarization, SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999) identifies sentences that convey similar information across input documents to select the summary content.

2Texts without adequate paragraph marking could be segmented using tools such as TextTiling (Hearst, 1994).
P94-1002
Comparable corpora have primarily been used to build bilingual lexical resources (Fung and Yee, 1998).
P98-1069
In MT, a weak similarity function is compensated for by searching for a globally optimal alignment, using dynamic programming or taking advantage of the geometric/positional or contextual properties of the text pair (Gale and Church, 1991; Shemtov, 1993; Melamed, 1999).
E93-1054 J99-1003 P91-1023
10Jing (2002) reports that Decomposition outperforms the algorithm of Marcu (1999); we, therefore, did not compare our method against his system.
