Several authors tried to approximate unification grammars by means of context-free grammars (Rayner et al., 2001; Kiefer and Krieger, 2004) and even finite-state grammars (Pereira and Wright, 1997; Johnson, 1998), but we are not aware of any work which relates unification grammars with the class MCSL.
P98-1101
They all generate the class of mildly context-sensitive languages (MCSL), all members 1089 of which have recognition algorithms with time complexity O(n6) (Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993; Satta, 1994).1 As a result of the weak equivalence of four independently developed (and linguistically motivated) extensions of CFG, the class MCSL is considered to be linguistically meaningful, a natural class of languages for characterizing natural languages.
