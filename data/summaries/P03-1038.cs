TnT (Brants, 2000) based on a second order HMM, is an example of this class of models and is accepted as one of the best part-of-speech taggers used around.

Many machine learning techniques have been developed to tackle such random process tasks, which include Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989), Maximum Entropy Models (MEs) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1998), etc.

The interpolation parameters are estimated by deleted interpolation algorithm introduced in (Brants, 2000).

As for POS tagging, recent comparisons (Brants, 2000; SchrÂ¨oder, 2001) show that HMMs work better than other models when they are combined with good smoothing techniques and with handling of unknown words.
