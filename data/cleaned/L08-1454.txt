Still, we believe that for our purposes this is not a problem, because persuasive dynamics are still presents (an “interruptive</context>

In fact a CONTRAST relation is present in about 30% of the sentences preceding APPLAUSE (Atkinson, 1984; Heritage and Greatbatch, 1986). In Table 3 a comparison between the positive-focus and negative-focus top 50 most persuasive words is given (note that named entities have not been discarded). It is </context>
