Abstract
We present a novel method for build-
ing a large-scale Japanese ontology from
Wikipedia using one of the largest
Japanese thesauri, Nihongo Goi-Taikei
(referred to hereafter as  Goi-Taikei ) as
an upper ontology. First, The leaf cat-
egories in the Goi-Taikei hierarchy are
semi-automatically aligned with seman-
tically equivalent Wikipedia categories.
Then, their subcategories are created au-
tomatically by detecting is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network below the
junction using the knowledge de ned in
Goi-Taikei above the junction. The re-
sulting ontology has a well-de ned taxon-
omy in the upper level and a  ne-grained
taxonomy in the lower level with a large
number of up-to-date instances. A sam-
ple evaluation shows that the precisions of
the extracted categories and instances are
92.8% and 98.6%, respectively.
1 Introduction
In recent years, we have become increasingly
aware of the need for up-to-date knowledge bases
offering broad-coverage in order to implement
practical semantic inference engines for advanced
applications such as question answering, summa-
rization and textual entailment recognition. One
promising approach involves automatically ex-
tracting a large comprehensive ontology from
Wikipedia, a freely available online encyclopedia
with a wide variety of information. One problem
with previous such efforts is that the resulting on-
tology is either fragmentary or trivial.
Ponzetto and Strube (2007) presents a set of
lightweight heuristics such as head matching and
modifier matching for distinguishing between is-
a and not-is-a links in the Wikipedia category
network. The most powerful heuristics is head
matching in which a category link is labeled as
is-a if the two categories share the same head
lemma, such as CAPITALS IN ASIA and CAPI-
TALS. For Japanese, Sakurai et al. (2008) present
a method equivalent to head matching in Japanese.
As Japanese is a head  nal language, they intro-
duced a heuristics called suffix matching in which
a category link is labeled as is-a if one category
is the suf x of the other category, such as a0a2a1a4a3
a5a7a6 (airports in Japan) and a5a8a6 (airports). The
problem with the ontology extracted by these two
methods is that it is not a single interconnected
taxonomy, but a set of taxonomic trees.
One way to make a single taxonomy is to use
an existing large-scale taxonomy as a core for the
resulting ontology. In YAGO, Suchanek et al.(2007) merged English WordNet and Wikipedia
by adding instances (namely Wikipedia articles)
to the is-a hierarchy of WordNet. Of the cate-
gories assigned to a Wikipedia article, they re-
garded one with a plural head noun as the article’s
hypernym, which is called a conceptual category.
They then linked the conceptual category to a
WordNet synset by heuristic rules including head
matching. For Japanese, Kobayashi et al. (2008)
present an attempt equivalent to YAGO, where
they merged Goi-Taikei and Japanese Wikipedia.
The problem with these two methods is that the
core taxonomy is extended only one level al-
though many new instances are added. They can-
not make the most of the  ne-grained taxonomic
11
information contained in the Wikipedia category
network.
In this paper, we present a novel method for
building a single interconnected ontology from
Wikipedia, with a  ne-grained taxonomy in the
lower level, by using a manually constructed the-
saurus as its upper ontology. In the following
sections, we  rst describe the language resources
used in this work. We then describe a semi-
automatic method for building the ontology and
report our experimental results.
2 Language
Resources
2.1 Nihongo
Goi-Taikei
Nihongo Goi-Taikei (a0 a1 a1a2a1a4a3a6a5a2a7 , ‘compre-
hensive outline of Japanese vocabulary’)1 is one
of the largest and best known Japanese thesauri
(Ikehara et al., 1997). It was originally developed
as a dictionary for a Japanese-to-English machine
translation system in the early 90’s. It was then
published as a book in 5 volumes in 1997 and as
a CD-ROM in 1999. It contains about 300,000
Japanese words and the meanings of each word
are described by using 2,715 hierarchical seman-
tic categories. Each word has up to 5 semantic
categories in order of frequency in use, and each
category is assigned with a unique ID number and
category name such as 4:person and 388:place2.
Goi-Taikei has different semantic category hi-
erarchies for common nouns, proper nouns, and
verbs, respectively. We used only the common
noun category in this work. For simplicity, we
mapped all proper nouns in the proper noun cate-
gory to the equivalent common noun category us-
ing the category mapping table shown in the Goi-
Taikei book.
Figure 1 shows the top three layers for common
nouns3. For example, the transliterated Japanese
word raita (a8a10a9a12a11a14a13 ) has two semantic cate-
gories 353:author and 915:household appli-
ance. The former originates with the English
1Referred to as  Goi-Taikei unless otherwise noted.
2We use Sans Serif for the Goi-Taikei category and
SMALL CAPS for the Wikipedia category. The Goi-Taikei
category is pre xed with ID number.
3The maximum depth of the common noun hierarchy is
12. Most links are is-a relations, but some are part-of rela-
tions, which are explicitly marked
word  writer while the latter originates with En-
glish word  lighter . By climbing up the Goi-
Taikei category hierarchy, we can infer that the
former refers to a human being (4:person) while
the latter refers to a physical object (533:con-
crete object).
2.2 Japanese
Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a free, multilingual, on-line ency-
clopedia actively developed by a large number of
volunteers. Japanese Wikipedia now has about
500,000 articles. Figure 2 shows examples of an
article page and a category page. An article page
has a title, body, and categories. In most articles,
the  rst sentence of the body gives the de nition
of the title. A category also has a title, body, and
categories. Its title is pre xed with  Category: 
and its body includes a list of articles that belong
to the category.
Although the Wikipedia category system is or-
ganized in a hierarchal manner, it is not a tax-
onomy but a thematic classi cation. An article
could belong to many categories and the category
network has loops. The relations between linked
categories are chaotic, but the lower the category
link is in the hierarchy, the more it is likely to be
an is-a relation. For example, the category link
between a15a17a16a19a18a4a20 (COCKTAIL) and a21 (ALCO-
HOLIC BEVERAGE) is an is-a relation. Although
the article a22a24a23a4a9a25a15a4a13 (shaker) is in the category
a15a26a16a27a18a28a20 (COCKTAIL), a shaker is not a cocktail
but an appliance. Extracting a taxonomy from the
Wikipedia category network is not trivial.
3 Ontology
Building Method
Figure 3 shows an outline of the proposed ontol-
ogy building method. We  rst semi-automatically
align each leaf category in the Goi-Taikei category
hierarchy with one or more Wikipedia categories.
We call a Wikipedia category aligned with a Goi-
Taikei category a junction category. We then ex-
tend each Goi-Taikei leaf category by detecting
the is-a links below the junction category in the
Wikipedia category network using the knowledge
de ned above the junction category in Goi-Taikei
.

3.1 Category
Alignment
For each leaf category in Goi-Taikei, we  rst make
a list of junction category candidates. Wikipedia
categories satisfying at least one of the following
three conditions are extracted as candidates:
 The Goi-Taikei category name exactly
matches the Wikipedia category name.
 One of the instances of the Goi-Taikei cate-
gory exactly matches the Wikipedia category
name.
 More than two instances of the Goi-Taikei
category exactly match either instances or
subcategories of the Wikipedia category.
Here, an instance of a Goi-Taikei category refers
to words belonging to the Goi-Taikei category
while that of a Wikipedia category refers to the
title (name) of articles belonging to the Wikipedia
category.
If a Goi-Taikei category and a Wikipedia cate-
gory refer to the same concept, we regard them
as semantically equivalent. If an instance of a
Goi-Taikei category and a Wikipedia category re-
fer to the same concept, we regard the name of
the Goi-Taikei instance as a subcategory of the
Goi-Taikei category and regard the subcategory
and the Wikipedia category as semantically equiv-
alent.
This is a sort of word sense disambiguation
problem. For example, Wikipedia category a0
a1a3a2a5a4 (
ROCKET) exactly matches the word a0
a1a3a2a5a4 in Goi-Taikei, which has two semantic
categories, 990:aircraft (rocket) and 834:acces-
sories (locket). Only the 990:aircraft sense of
the word in Goi-Taikei matches the Wikipedia cat-
egory.
We performed manual alignment because the
accuracy of this category alignment is very im-
portant as regards the subsequent steps. Manual
alignment is feasible and cost effective since there
are only 1,921 leaves in the Goi-Taikei category
hierarchy. However, we also report the result of
automatic alignment in the experiment.
3.2 Hypernym
Extraction
As preparation for detecting is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network, we automatically
extract a hypernym of the name of each article and
category in advance.
We regard the  rst sentence of each article page
as the de nition of the concept referred to by
the title. We applied language dependent lexico-
syntactic patterns to the de nition sentence to ex-
tract the hypernym. The hypernym of the category
name is extracted from the de nition sentence if it
exists. If there is an article whose title is the same
as its category, the hypernym of the article is used
as that of the category.
As for lexico-syntactic patterns, we used almost
the same patterns described in previous work re-
lated to Japanese such as (Kobayashi et al., 2008;
Sumida et al., 2008), which is basically equivalent
to work related to English such as (Hearst, 1992).
Here are some examples.
[hypernym] a3 (a6a8a7 ja6a10a9 ja11a13a12 j. . . )
(onejkindjnamej. . . ) of [hypernym]
[hypernym](a105a13a14a15a14 ja16a18a17 a91 j. . . )
(is ajrefers toj. . . ) [hypernym]
[hypernym]<EOS>
<BOS>[hypernym]
where <BOS> and <EOS> refer to the begin-
ning and the end of a sentence.
For example, from the  rst article in Figure 2,
the words a113 a20 a114a14a13 a20a106a116a106a117 (alcoholic beverage)
are extracted as the hypernym of the article a15a2a16 a18
a20 (cocktail), using the third lexico-syntactic pat-
tern above. Since the title of the article is the same
as the category name, a113 a20 a114a25a13 a20a65a116a65a117 (alcoholic
beverage) is regarded as the hypernym of the cat-
egory a15 a16 a18a25a20 (COCKTAIL).
3.3 Is-a Link Detection
We automatically detect is-a links in the
Wikipedia category network to extend the origi-
nal Goi-Taikei category hierarchy. Starting from
a junction category, we recursively traverse the
Wikipedia category network if the link from the
current category to the child category is regarded
as an is-a link.
We regard a link between a parent category and
a child category as an is-a link if the suf x of the
child category name matches one of the hypernym

Figure 4: Extending Goi-Taikei leaf categories using the Wikipedia category network
candidates for the child category. We de ne the
hypernym candidates for a category as the union
of the following words:
 The names of three super categories in Goi-
Taikei from the junction category, namely the
leaf category, its parent, and its grandparent.
 All instance names belonging to the above
three categories in Goi-Taikei.
 The names of all super categories in
Wikipedia from the current category to the
junction category.
We also regard a link as being is-a if the suf x
of the hypernym (de ned in Sec 3.2) of the child
category name matches one of the hypernym can-
didates for the child category.
Figure 4 shows examples. The link between
the category a123a125a124a26a21 (DISTILLED BEVERAGES)
and the category a126a26a9a119a88a128a127a26a13 (WHISKIES) in
Wikipedia is regarded as is-a because the word a126
a9a112a88a129a127a24a13 (whisky) is an instance of Goi-Taikei
category 861:liquor just above the junction cat-
egory a21 (ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES). The link
between the category a21 ALCOHOLIC BEVER-
AGES and the category a15 a16 a18 a20 (COCKTAILS) in
Wikipedia is regarded as is-a because the suf x
of a113 a20a89a114a28a13a19a20a106a116a65a117 (alcoholic beverage), the hy-
pernym of the category a15a10a16a19a18a28a20 (COCKTAILS),
matches a116a94a117 (beverage), an instance of the cate-
gory 857:beverages in Goi-Taikei. However, the
link between the category a21 (ALCOHOLIC BEV-
ERAGES) and the category a21a131a130 (GODS OF ALCO-
HOLIC BEVERAGES) in Wikipedia is not is-a be-
cause the two Japanese strings do not have a com-
mon suf x.
3.4 Instance
Extraction
For each Wikipedia category included in the is-a
hierarchy constructed by the procedure described
in the previous subsection, we extract the title of
Wikipedia articles listed on the category page as
an instance. The instance extraction method is ba-
sically the same for is-a category detection. We
regard the link between a category and an article

4 Experimental
Result and Discussion
4.1 Category
Alignment
We used the XML  le of the Japanese Wikipedia
as of July 24, 20084. There are 49,543 cate-
gory pages and 479,231 article pages in the  le.
4http://download.wikimedia.org/jawiki/
For each of the 1,921 Goi-Taikei leaf categories
with the total of 108,247 instances, we applied the
three conditions described in Sec 3.1 and obtained
6,301 Wikipedia categories as junction category
candidates. We then manually selected 2,477 cat-
egories as the junction categories. The number of
Goi-Taikei leaf categories with one or more junc-
tion categories is 719 (719/1921=38.4%).
We performed some preliminary experiments
on the automatic selection of junction cate-
gories. We trained an SVM classi er us-
ing the above junction category candidates
and manual judgement results. Given a pair
consisting of a Goi-Taikei category and a
Wikipedia category, the SVM classi er pre-
dicts whether or not the two categories should
be aligned. We used standard ontology map-
ping features (Euzenat and Shavaiko, 2007) such
as whether the (classjinstance) name of the
(selfjparentjchildrenjsiblings) match one and the
other. We undertook a  vefold cross validation
and obtained about 90% precision and 70% recall.
The results were encouraging but we decided to
use the manual alignment results for subsequent
experiments.

Figure 6: The precision of is-a links classi ed by the depth in the constructed category hierarchy
4.2 Is-a Link Detection
We extracted 23,289 categories from 49,543 cat-
egories in Wikipedia (47%) to extend the Goi-
Taikei category hierarchy. We evaluated the Is-a
link detection accuracy for the Wikipedia category
network by employing the following two criteria:
 parent-child precision: whether the link be-
tween the current category and its immediate
parent is an is-a relation.
 ancestor-descendant precision: whether all
the links from the current category to the root
are is-a relations.
We randomly selected 100 categories at each
depth from the constructed hierarchy and manu-
ally evaluated the parent-child precision and the
ancestor-descendant precision. Figure 6 shows the
precisions of is-a links classi ed by the depth in
the constructed category hierarchy. It also shows
the number of categories at each depth.
The parent-child precision is more than 90%
from depths 1 to 7, while the ancestor-descendant
precision is more than 90% froms depth 1 to 5.
After excluding depth 1 categories (junction cat-
egories whose precision is 100%), the average
parent-child precision is 92.8% and the average
ancestor-descendant precision is 82.6%.
4.3 Instance
Extraction
We extracted 263,631 articles from 479,231 arti-
cles in Wikipedia (55%) as instances of the con-
structed category hierarchy. The category with
the largest number of instances is a0 a1 a3a85a84a87a86
(JAPANESE ACTORS) with 5,632 instances. The
average number of instances for a category is 17.8.
We evaluate the accuracy of instance extraction
as follows: For each category in the constructed
hierarchy, we list all its articles, and construct a
pair consisting of a category and an article. We
randomly sample these pairs and leave only the
pairs in which all the links from its category to the
root are is-a relations by manual inspection. For
319 category-article pairs obtained by this proce-
dure, 247 articles are manually classi ed as in-
stances of the category, while 208 articles are au-
tomatically classi ed as instances. The intersec-
tion of the two is 205. Thus, the precision and
recall of instance extraction are 98.6%(205/208)
and 83.0%(205/247), respectively.

4.4 Comparison
to Previous Methods
Sakurai et al. (2008) reported the parent-child pre-
cision of their suf x matching-based method was
91.2% and 6,672 Wikipedia categories are used to
construct their (fragmentary) hierarchy. We used a
much larger set of Wikipedia categories (23,239)
to extend the Goi-Taikei to form a single uni ed
hierarchy with a comparable parent-child preci-
sion (92.8%). Kobayashi et al. (2008) reported
their alignment accuracy (parent-child precision)
was 93% and 19,426 Wikipedia categories are
directly aligned with Goi-Taikei categories. We
used a signi cantly larger set of Wikipedia cat-
egories (19426/23239=0.84) to extend the Goi-
Taikei with retaining the is-a relations included in
the Wikipedia category network.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a method for building
a large-scale, Japanese ontology from Wikipedia
using one of the most popular Japanese thesauri,
Nihongo Goi-Taikei, as its upper ontology. Unlike
previous methods, it can create a single connected
taxonomy with a well-de ned upper level taxon-
omy inherited from Goi-Taikei, as well as a  ned-
grained and up-to-date lower level taxonomy with
broad-coverage extracted from Wikipedia.
Future work will include automatic category
alignment between Goi-Taikei and Wikipedia to
fully automate the ontology building. It would
be interesting to use another Japanese thesaurus,
such as the recently released Japanese WordNet
(Bond et al., 2008), as an upper ontology for the
proposed method.
One of the problems with the proposed method
is that it only uses about half of the knowledge
(categories and articles) in Wikipedia. This is be-
cause we restricted the alignment points in Goi-
Taikei category hierarchy to its leaves. In Ponzetto
and Navigli (2009), they present a method for
aligning WordNet and Wikipedia fully at many
levels with both of them retaining a hierarchal
structure. However, their method does not inte-
grate the two hierarchies into a single taxonomy.
We think that developing a method for merging
the two hierarchies into one taxonomy is the key
to extracting more information from Wikipedia.
