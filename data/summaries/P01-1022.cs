Recursion Elimination We have used two left-recursion elimination techniques, the traditional one based on Paullâ€™s algorithm, as reported by Hopcroft and Ullman (1979), and one described by Moore (2000)5, based on a technique described by Johnson (1998).

This approach has been used in several systems, CommandTalk (Moore et al.1997), RIALIST PSA simulator (Rayner et al.2000), WITAS (Lemon et al.2001), and SETHIVoice (Gauthron and Colineau 1999).

The existence of the ATIS database (Dahl et al.1994) is no doubt a factor in the popularity of the travel domain among the research community for exactly this reason.

We can use the technique of restriction (Shieber 1985) to remove these features from our feature structures.

While we conceed that alternative techniques that are not sound (Black 1989, (Johnson 1998, Rayner and Carter 1996) may still be useful for many purposes, we prefer sound approximations because there is no chance that the correct hypothesis will be eliminated.

The statistical approach is unworkable in such cases for both the commercial developers and for some research systems (Moore et al.1997, Rayner et al.2000, Lemon et al.2001, Gauthron and Colineau 1999).

Unification Grammars Typed Unification Grammars (TUG), like HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) and Gemini (Dowding et al.1993) are a more expressive formalism in which to write formal grammars1.
P93-1008
We will be interested in this paper in sound approximations (Pereira and Wright 1991) in which the language accepted by the approximation is a superset of language accepted by the original grammar.
