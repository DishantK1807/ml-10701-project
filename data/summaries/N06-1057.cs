Phrase pairs are extracted by following the method described in (Och and Ney, 2004) where all contiguous phrase pairs having consistent alignments are extraction candidates.

ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) has gained popularity due to its simplicity and high correlation with human judgments.

This paraphrase matching process is observed in the Pyramid annotation procedure shown in (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) over three summary sets (10 summaries each).
N04-1019
Even though validated by high correlations with human judgments gathered from previous Document Understanding Conference (DUC) experiments, current automatic procedures (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hovy et al., 2005) only employ lexical n-gram matching.

Unfortunately, we have yet to incorporate into the evaluation framework previous findings in paraphrase identification and extraction (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005).

Three most noticeable efforts in manual evaluation are SEE (Lin and Hovy, 2001), Factoid (Van Halteren and Teufel, 2003), and the Pyramid method (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).
N03-1020 N04-1019
Pang et al.(2003) use word lattices as paraphrase representations from semantically equivalent translations sets.
N03-1024
We wish to incorporate the probabilistic paraphrase extraction model from (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) to better approximate the relations between paraphrases.
P05-1074
To facilitate fast summarization system designevaluation cycles, ROUGE was created (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

Using parallel corpora, Barzilay and McKeown (2001) identify paraphrases from multiple translations of classical novels, where as Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) develop a probabilistic representation for paraphrases extracted from large Machine Translation (MT) data sets.
P01-1008 P05-1074
From an in-depth analysis on the manually created SCUs of the DUC2003 summary set D30042 (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), we find that 54.48% of 1746 cases where a non-stop word from one SCU did not match with its supposedly human-aligned pairing SCUs are in need of some level of paraphrase matching support.

Phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (Och and Ney, 2004).
J04-4002
While evaluating automatically extracted paraphrases via WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), Barzilay and McKeown (2001) quantitatively validated that synonymy is not the only source of paraphrasing.
P01-1008
Both ROUGE and BE have been shown to correlate well with past DUC human summary judgments, despite incorporating only lexical matching on summary units (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hovy et al., 2005).
N03-1020
The collection of human judgments on systems and their summaries has provided a test-bed for developing and validating automated summary grading methods (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Hovy et al., 2005).

We ran the alignment algorithm from (Och and Ney, 2003) on a Chinese-English parallel corpus of 218 million English words.

of ParaEval To evaluate and validate the effectiveness of an automatic evaluation metric, it is necessary to show that automatic evaluations correlate with human assessments highly, positively, and consistently (Lin and Hovy, 2003).
