Phrase-based statistical translation systems are currently providing excellent results in real machine translation tasks (Zens et al., 2002; Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn, 2004).

In this work, we focus on learning bilingual word phrases by using Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars (SITGs) (Wu, 1997).
J97-3002
Inversion Transduction Grammars Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars (SITGs) (Wu, 1997) can be viewed as a restricted subset of Stochastic Syntax-Directed Transduction Grammars.
J97-3002
Different methods have been defined to obtain bilingual translations phrases, mainly from word-based alignments and from syntax-based models (Yamada and Knight, 2001).
P01-1067
1A Normal Form for SITGs can be defined (Wu, 1997) by analogy to the Chomsky Normal Form for Stochastic ContextFree Grammars.
J97-3002
Several methods have been defined for dealing with this problem (Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
An efficient Viterbi-like parsing algorithm that is based on a Dynamic Programing Scheme is proposed in (Wu, 1997).
J97-3002
The modifications are similar to those proposed in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) for the inside algorithm.
P92-1017
Following the notation that is presented in (Pereira and Schabes, 1992), we can define a partially bracketed corpus as a set of sentence pairs that are annotated with parentheses that mark constituent frontiers.
P92-1017
In this work, we study a method for obtaining word phrases that is based on Stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars that was proposed in (Wu, 1997).
