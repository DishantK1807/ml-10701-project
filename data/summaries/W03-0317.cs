In the first experiment, we analyze the convergence characteristics of this model training based on a similarity-based framework (Chen et al., 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002).

As noted in Tsuji (2002), many previous methods (Dagan et al., 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; Melamed, 1996; Smadja et al., 1996) deal with this problem based on frequency of words appearing in the corpora, which can not be effectively applied to lowfrequency words, such as transliterated words.

Recently, much research has been done on machine transliteration for many language pairs, such as English/Arabic (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), English/Chinese (Chen et al., 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002; Wan and Verspoor, 1998), English/Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998), and English/Korean (Lee and Choi, 1997; Oh and Choi, 2002).
