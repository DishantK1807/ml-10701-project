The presented dependency parser is based on our preceding work (Cheng, 2005a) for Chinese.

Description The main part of our dependency parser is based on Nivre’s algorithm (Nivre, 2004), in which the dependency relations are constructed by a bottomup deterministic schema.
W04-0308
In our preceding work (Cheng, 2005a), we not only adopted the Nivre algorithm with SVMs, but also tried some preprocessing methods.

2.3.1 Preceding work In our preceding work (Cheng, 2005a), we discussed three problems of our basic methods (adopt Nivre’s algorithm with SVMs) and proposed three preprocessing methods to resolve these problems.

The performance of SVMs is better than that of the maximum entropy method in our preceding work for Chinese dependency analysis (Cheng, 2005b).

Our bottom-up deterministic parser adopts Nivre’s algorithm (Nivre, 2004) with a preprocessor.
W04-0308
The parser is a bottom-up deterministic dependency parser based on the algorithm proposed by (Nivre, 2004).
