In fact our approach here provides a principled basis for Passonneau and Litman (1993)'s notion of majority opinion through the kappa statistic.

After some ex~mlnation, we have settled on the following set of attributes, some of which are variations of those typically found in the summarization literature (Kupiec et al., 1995; Paice and Jones, 1993; Edmundson, 1969; Zechner, 1996).

2.2. Measurement of B.eliability The Kappa Statistic Following Jean Carletta (1996), we use the kappa statistic (Sidney Siegel and N.

We will do this by examining how humans perform on summary extraction and evaluating the reliability of their performance, using the kappa statistic, a metric standardly used in the behavioral sciences (Jean Carletta, 1996; Sidney Siegel and N.

3For the reasons mentioned earlier, we dismiss a negative agreement among the majority altogether, which is in contrast with Passonneau and Litman (1993)'s approach where agreement among the majority, either positive or negative, counts as a majority opinion.
P93-1020
The reason for choosing the kappa over other measures of agreement (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) derives from our interest in discovering a relationship between the reliability or quality of data (as quantified by some metric) and the performance of automatic abstracting.

We follow Passonneau and Litman (1993) in assuming that the majority opinion is correct and drop decisions not in agreement with the majority.
P93-1020
As aptly pointed out in Jean Carletta (1996), agreement measures proposed so far in the computational linguistics literature has failed to ask an important question of whether results obtained using agreement data are in any way different from random data.
