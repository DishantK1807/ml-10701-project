This is limited to 'reifying' the relations and labeling them with 'instance variables' as commonly done in input expressions for generation systems (Kasper, 1989).

Dalianis and Hovy (1996) and Shaw (1998)); however Bateman et al.(1998) provide a more rigorous and generic foundation for aggregation by applying results from data-summarization originally developed for multimedia information presentation (Kamps, 1997).

A number of broadly related referring expression algorithms have been developed over the past decade based on the natural metaphor of 'ruling out distractors' (Reiter, 1990; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Horacek, 1995).

Finally, since the use of aggregation lattices has been argued for other generation tasks (Bateman et al., 1998), some of the 'cost' of deployment may in fact turn out to be shared, making a direct comparison solely with the RE-task in any case inappropriate.

The first variant they consider relies on a 'Greedy Heuristic' (Dale, 1989; Johnson, 1974); they illustrate that this algorithm sacrifices minimality by constructing an RE for object ol in the context of the following properties concerning a set of seven cups of varying size (large, small), color (red, green, blue) and material (paper, plastic): (oi (size large)(color red)(material plastic)) (02 (size small)(color red)(material plastic)) (03 (size small)(color red)(material paper)) (04 (size medium)(color red)(material paper)) (05 (size large)(color green)(material paper)) (06 (size large)(color blue)(material paper)) (07 (size large)(color blue)(material plastic)) The greedy algorithm produces 'the large red plastic cup' although the true minimum description is 'the large red cup'.

descriptions: restricting recursion One early extension of the original REalgorithms was the treatment of data sets involving relations (Dale and Haddock, 1991).
