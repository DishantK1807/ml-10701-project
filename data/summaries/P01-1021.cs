More recent versions of dependency grammars (see e.g.(Kahane et al., 1998; Lombardo and Lesmo, 1998; Br¨oker, 1998)) impose on nonprojective D-trees some constraints weaker than projectivity (cf.
P98-1106 P98-2130
One of such properties, projectivity, requires that any word occurring between a word a9 and a word a10 dependent on a9 be dominated by a9a12a11 In first dependency grammars (Gaifman, 1961) and in some more recent proposals: link grammars (Sleator and Temperly, 1993), projective dependency grammars (Lombardo and Lesmo, 1996) the projectivity is implied by definition.

times non adjacent) words are determined in terms of their local neighborhood, which leads to non-tractable parsing (the NP-hardness argument of (Neuhaus and Br¨oker, 1997) applies to them).
P97-1043
e.g. a method in (Lecomte, 1992) for Lambek calculus).
C92-1061
meta-projectivity (Nasr, 1995) or pseudo-projectivity (Kahane et al., 1998)), sufficient for existence of a polynomial time parsing algorithm.
