Kittredge et al.1994). In the case of D2S, the basic generation algorithm and such functions as ApplyTemplate and ExpressObject have been used for different application domains (music, soccer games, route descriptions, and public transport) and different languages (English, Dutch, and German); D2S has been used for the generation of both monologues and dialogue contributions (van Deemter and Odijk 1997; Theune et al.2001). When a template-based system is applied to a new domain or language, many of the templates will have to be written anew (much as new grammar fragments need to be developed for standard NLG systems), but the underlying generation mechanisms generally require little or no modification.

Template-Based NLG Systems in Practice In recent years, a number of new template-based systems have seen the light, including TG/2 (Busemann and Horacek 1998), D2S (van Deemter and Odijk 1997; Theune et al.2001), EXEMPLARS (White and Caldwell 1998), YAG (McRoy, Channarukul, and Ali 2003), and XTRAGEN (Stenzhorn 2002).

This is not only because some systems combine standard NLG with templates and canned text (Piwek 2003), but also because modern template-based systems tend to use syntactically structured templates and allow the gaps in them to be filled recursively (i.e., by filling a gap, a new gap may result).

One should not, however, let one’s judgment depend on accidental properties of one or two systems: Nothing keeps the designer of a template-based system from adding morphological rules; witness systems like YAG (McRoy, Channarukul, and Ali 2003) and XTRAGEN (Stenzhorn 2002).

The most crucial question, in our view, is whether a template-based NLG system can be linguistically well-founded (or ‘‘deep’’ in terms of Busemann and Horacek [1998]), in the sense that the choices inherent in its mapping from input to output are based on sound linguistic principles.

Busemann and Horacek (1998) go even further by suggesting that template-based systems do not embody generic linguistic insights (page 238).
