Although the clustering results with the best settings for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering were very close with regard to F-score (combining purity and inverse purity, see (Artiles et al., 2007) for a more detailed description), manual inspection of the content of the clusters has revealed big differences between the two approaches.

We took the idea of distinctive personal attributes as a criterion for disambiguation from the work of Bollegala et al.(2006). They propose an unsupervised learning approach to extract phrases that uniquely identify a person from the web and use these discriminative features for clustering.

105 2 Data sets and feature construction The data we have used for training our system were made available in the framework of the SemEval (task 13: Web People Search) competition (Artiles et al., 2007).

Our system was not built specifically for the web people search task WePS (Artiles et al., 2007), but is an early version of an IE system that has the more general goal to discover relations between NEs.

Work Our system was inspired by the preemptive and ondemand IE approaches by Sekine and Shinyama (Sekine, 2006; Shinyama, 2006) that cluster newspaper articles into classes of articles that talk about the same type of event.
