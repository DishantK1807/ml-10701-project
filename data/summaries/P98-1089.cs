While the Autolexical model may not now be correct for applications in which speed is of primary concern, it has only begun to be implemented computationally, and any serious attempt at inferencing from natural language input will have to produce similar, graded output (Moran, 1988).
P88-1005
It will be shown that this model is both categorical enough to handle standard generalizations about quantifier scope, such as bans on extraction from certain domains, and fuzzy enough to present reasonable preference rankings among scopings and account for lexical differences in quantifier strength (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988).
J87-1005 P88-1005
The last takes account of the scope preferences of individual quantifiers, such as the fact that each tends to have wider scope than all other quantifiers (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988).

The function-argument hierarchy expresses that (formal) semantic information about a sentence which does not involve scope resolution, e.g., semantic valency and association of referential terms with argument positions, as in Park (1995).
P95-1028
As an example of the sort of syntacticallybased restrictions on quantifier ordering which this model can implement, consider the generalization listed in Moran (1988), that "a quantifier cannot be raised across more than one major clause boundary".

It has long been recognized that the possibility and preference rankings of scope readings depend to a great degree on the position of scopetaking elements in the surface string (Chomsky, 1975; Hobbs and Shieber, 1987).
