One is the 1011 questions of NTCIR-QAC11, which were gathered from ’dry-run’, ’formal-run’ and ’additional-run.’ The second is the 2000 questions described in (Suzuki et al., 2002b).

This framework is useful for question classification because the works of (Li and Roth, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2002a) showed that richer information, such as structural and semantical information inside a given question, improves the question classification performance over using the information of just simple key terms.

The efficient calculation of inner products between HDAGs, the return value of HDAG Kernel, was defined in a recursive formulation (Suzuki et al., 2003).

Additionally, we evaluated the performance using SNoW3 to compare our method to indirectly the SNoW-based question classifier (Li and Roth, 2002).

We use the Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) Kernel (Suzuki et al., 2003), which is suited to handle structured natural language data.

However, question classification requires much more complicated features than text categorization, as shown by (Li and Roth, 2002).

Moreover, the previous work of (Suzuki et al., 2002a) showed that the sequential patterns constructed by different levels of attributes, such as words, part-ofspeech (POS) and semantical information, improve the performance of question classification.

Words, chunks and their relations in the texts were analyzed by CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), and named entities were analyzed by the SVM-based NE tagger (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).

(Harabagiu et al., 2000) also defined a large hierarchical question taxonomy, and (Hovy et al., 2001) defined 141 question types of a hierarchical question taxonomy.

First, we could increase the performance by using the information on named entities and semantic information compared to only using the words, which is the same result given in (Li and Roth, 2002).

This work develops a machine learning approach to question classification (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Hermjakob, 2001; Li and Roth, 2002).
