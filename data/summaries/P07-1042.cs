A Feature-based TAG (FTAG, (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988)) consists of a set of (auxiliary or initial) elementary trees and of two tree composition operations: substitution and adjunction.

This does not seem to be the case in (Velldal and Oepen, 2006)â€™s approach where the count seems to include all sentences associated by the grammar with the input semantics.

surface realiser, GenI The basic surface realisation algorithm used is a bottom up, tabular realisation algorithm (Kay, 1996) optimised for TAGs.

It could be used for instance, in combination with the parser and the semantic construction module described in (Gardent and Parmentier, 2005), to support textual entailment recognition or answer detection in question answering.

We refer the reader to (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) for more details.

The proposal draws on ideas from (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002; Gardent and Kow, 2005) and aims to determine whether for a given input (a set of TAG elementary trees whose semantics equate the input semantics), syntactic requirements and resources cancel out.
P02-1003 W05-1605
To associate semantic representations with natural language expressions, the FTAG is modified as proposed in (Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003).

Admittedly, the French grammar we are using has a much more limited coverage than the ERG (the grammar used by (Velldal and Oepen, 2006)) and it is possible that its paraphrastic power is lower.
W06-1661
First, the paraphrase figures might seem low wrt to e.g., work by (Velldal and Oepen, 2006) which mentions several thousand outputs for one given input and an average number of realisations per input varying between 85.7 and 102.2.
