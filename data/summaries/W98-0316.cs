\[Hirschberg and Litman, 1987\] state that they "may, instead of making a 'semantic' contribution to art utterance (i.e., affecting its truth conditions), be used to convey explicit information about the structure of a discourse".

The inability to handle these features would limit the capacity of an expert system \[Pollack et al., 1982\], \[Whittaker and Stenton, 1988\].

Such finer-grained distinctions could only be made with a help of context; one has to take into account what type of expression or speech act precedes the discourse marker, and in what position of a phrase the marker occurs \[Walker and Whittaker, 1990\].
P90-1010
Such a 'syntax' of discourse markers naturally has an important bearing on constructing a grammar of natural, spoken discourse \[Nakano et al., 1994\].

This suggests that the discourse structure of dialogue cannot be understood in terms of the traditional grammar based on sentence, or well-formed bunsetsu, \[Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996\].
C96-1052
But such a rule will be useful in devising a 'grammar' of the spontaneously spoken language taken in its totality, an attempt made by, for example, \[Nakano et al., 1994\].
