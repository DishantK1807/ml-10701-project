Aspectual classification is necessary for interpreting temporal modifiers and assessing temporal entailments (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994), and is therefore a necessary component for applications that perform certain language interpretation, summarization, information retrieval, and machine translation tasks.

in Natural Language Aspectual classification is a key component of models that assess temporal constraints between clauses (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1991; Dorr, 1992; Hitzeman et al., 1994).

However, previous work that numerically evaluates aspectual classification has looked at verbs in isolation (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Siegel, 1997).

Finally, disambiguating the direct object according to WordNet categories, e.g., Resnik (1995), would improve the accuracy of using these categories to disambiguate verbs.

For example, a verb that appears more frequently in the progressive is more likely to describe an event than a state (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992).
C92-4177
For example, Sue played the piano is nonc,lminated, while Sue played the sonata signifies a c-lminated event (this example comes from Moens and Steedman (1988)).

This ambiguity presents a di~culty for automatically classifying a verb because the aspectual class of a clause is a function of several clausal constituents in addition to the main verb (Dowry, 1979; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Pustejovsky, 1991).

As shown in Table 7, an event recall of 67.7% was achieved by the classification rule, as compared to speech tagging (Church, 1988; Alien, 1995).
