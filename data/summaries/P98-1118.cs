The format of the declarative lexicon and of the grammar rules is that of the REALPRO realizer, which we discussed in (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).

The core generator has a pipeline architecture which is similar to many existing systems (Reiter, 1994): an incoming request is received by the generator interface triggering sequentially the macroplanning, micro-planning, realization and fi718 Presentation Core Generator Domain Data, Manager Macro-Planner ~ i Y \[Micro-Planner ~.~1 I _ Realizer (Realpro) i " i Configurable Knowledge Request Figure 1: Architecture of PRESENTOR nally the formatting of a presentation which is then returned by the system.

CoGenTex has developed a complementary alternative to PRESENTOR, EXEMPLARS (White and Caldwell, 1998) which gives a better programmatic control to the processing of the representations that PRESENTOR does.

Linguistic representations found in the conceptual dictionary are deep-syntactic structures (DSyntSs) which are conform to those that REALPRO (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), PRESENTOR'S sentence realizer, takes as input.

Library An exemplar (Rambow et al., 1998; White and Caldwell, 1998) is a type of schema (McKeown, 1985; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) whose purpose is to determine, for a given presentation request, the general specification of the presentation regarding its macro-structure, its content and its format.

PRESENTOR has been used with success in different domains including object model description (Lavoie et al., 1997), weather forecasting (Kittredge and Lavoie, 1998) and system requirements summarization (Ehrhart et al., 1998; Barzilay et al., 1998).

â€¢ Exemplars: a library of schema-like structures (McKeown, 1985; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992) specifying the presentation to be generated at different levels of abstraction (rhetorical, conceptual, syntactic, surface form).
