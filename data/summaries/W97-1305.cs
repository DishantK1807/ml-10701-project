Among the most promising practical work are approaches relying on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing restrictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Stuckardt, 1996b).

The practical contribution of n, however, is reduced: in a reasonable implementation, the conjunction or disjunction of w bits (w = processor word length) ZÂ°The optimal choice of preference factors and weights remains to be investigated; at least some of the criteria which have been investigated by (Lappin and Leass, 1994) do not immediately generalize to deficient syntax.

Implementation The above technique for achieving robustness according to the deficient description model has been integrated into an anaphor resolution system for German text (Stuckardt, 1996b).

(Stuckardt, 1996a)) may get lost.

This information deficiency is partially overcome by the application of a regular filter which heuristically reconstructs constituent structure (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996).

This architecture, however, tacitly ignores evidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributed by strong expectations at the referential layer (Stuckardt, 1996a).

By generalizing a technique for unambiguous syntax (Correa, 1988), the reading-qualified dominance information may be precomputed as follows, s The tree traversal process starts at the preterminal nodes which are assumed to be shared among all readings.
