Models based on Grosz and Sidner’s 1986 work, especially those which form the basis of spoken language systems, define segments in terms of the intentions of the speaker: when the speaker’s intention shifts, the segment associated with that intention ends and immediately following talk is included in new (or resumed) segments.

(Polanyi, 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Webber, 1991) The LDM posits three structural relations between discourse units: 1.

Classical Linguistic Discourse Model (C-LDM) Unlike the Discourse Structures Model (DSM) of Grosz and Sidner (1986), a pragmatic and psychological theory that aims to clarify the relationship between speakers’ intentions and their focus of attention in discourse, or the rhetorical model of Rhetorical Structures Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) that is designed to identify the coherence relations between segments of text, the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) (Polanyi and Scha, 1984; Polanyi, 1988; Polanyi and van den Berg, 1996) is a syntactically informed, semantically driven model developed to provide proper semantic interpretation for every utterance in a discourse despite the apparent discontinuities that are present even in well structured written texts.

Soricut and Marcu (2003) also build up RST sentential trees to use in discourse parsing.
