Several computational methods for OT have been produced within the short amount of time since Prince and Smolensky's paper (Ellison, 1994; Tesar, 1995; Hammond, 1995).

In this work-in-progress, we build on the work of Ellison (1994) to investigate the possibility of using OT as a parsing tool that derives underlying forms from surface forms.
