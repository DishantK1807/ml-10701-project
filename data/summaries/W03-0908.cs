For question analysis, parsing serves two goals: to identify the finest answer focus (Moldovan et al., 2000; Hermjakob, 2001), and to produce a grammatical analysis (f-structure) for questions.

Although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (Ittycheriah et al., 2002), have been successful in answering factoid questions, more complex tasks require a consideration of text meaning.

For the lexical processing step, we have integrated several external resources: the Brill part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995), BBN IdentiFinder (BBN, 2000) (to tag named entities such as proper names, time expressions, numbers, etc.), WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) (for semantic categorization), and the KANTOO Lexifier (Nyberg and Mitamura, 2000) (to access a syntactic lexicon for verb valence information).
