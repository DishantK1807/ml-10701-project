Work The DTSC model is different from previous work based on dependency grammars by Eisner (2003), Lin (2004), Quirk et al.(2005), Ding et al.(2005) since they all deduce dependency structures on the target side.

Morpho-syntactic annotation of the English references and hypotheses is performed using the constraint grammar parser ENGCG (Voutilainen, 1995), and the Spanish texts are annotated using the FreeLing analyser (Carreras et al., 2004).

It is widely agreed upon among researchers that a good evalutation metric should rank reference translation as higher than machine translation (Lin et al., 2004).

In contrast to the work by Lin (2004) and by Quirk et al.(2005), the DTSC model does not need to generate target language dependency structures using source structures and word alignments.

Some authors have already designed similar matching techniques, such as the onedescribed in(Snow etal., 2006).

(Lins and Goncalves, 2004) look up words in dictionaries to discriminate among languages, and (Oakes, 2003) runs stochastic tests on token frequencies, like the chi-square test, in order to dierentiate between European and American English.

Human Likeness Metrics are evaluated in terms of descriptive power, i.e., their ability to distinguish between human and automatic translations (Lin and Och, 2004b; Amigo et al., 2005).

For evaluation we use ROUGE (Lin, 2004) SU4 recall metric1, which was among the official automatic evaluation metrics for DUC.

Following the growing awareness of the deciency of n-gram based automatic MT evaluation, many studies attempted to improve upon n-gram based metrics (Zhou et al., 2006; Liu, et al., 2005,2006) as well as propose ways to evaluate MT evaluation metrics (Lin, et al.2004). Previous studies, however, have focused on MT evaluation at the document level in order to ght n-gram sparseness problem.

Over the last several years, various statistical syntaxbased models were proposed to extend traditional word/phrase based models in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Lin, 2004; Chiang, 2005; Ding et al., 2005; Quirk et al., 2005; Marcu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).
