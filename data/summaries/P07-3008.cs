As an attempt to ameliorate this, and as an attempt to confirm Klein and Manning’s (2002) and Bod’s (2006) thesis that good enough unsupervised POS-taggers exist to justify using POS-tags instead of words in evaluating GI systems, I pre43 sented the algorithms with both POS-tags that were induced from Biemann’s unsupervised POS-tagging algorithm and hand-corrected POS-tags.

Evaluation of the algorithm is done according to PARSEVAL, except for a few changes that are also proposed by Klein and Manning (2002).

Recently, several word-based grammar induction algorithms have been developed: Alignment-Based Learning (van Zaanen, 2002), Adios (Solan et al., 2005), Emile (Adriaans, 1992; Adriaans and Vervoort, 2002) and GraSp1 (Henrichsen, 2002).

Still, Klein and Manning (2002) and Bod (2006) stick to tag-based models.

In order to test the argument above, and as an attempt to improve the results from the previous experiment, POS-tags were induced using Biemann’s unsupervised POS-tagger (Biemann, 2006).

Transitions to the normal and pivotal stage occur when an estimator of the relative frequency is high enough, for example by taking the lower bound of the confidence interval (Mikheev, 1997).

One of them is visual inspection (Henrichsen, 2002).
