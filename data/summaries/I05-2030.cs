This approach, as exemplified by (Soon et al., 2001; Iida et al., 2003; Ng, 2004), is cost effective, while achieving a better performance than the best-performing rule-based systems for the test sets of MUC-6 and MUC-7 2. As suggested by Figure 1, anaphora resolution can be decomposed into two subtasks: anaphoricity determination and antecedent identification.

Recent research advances have provided several important findings as follows: • Learning-based methods for antecedent identification can also benefit from the use of linguistic clues inspired by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995).

In Proc.1, since pair identification is conducted before finding the best candidate attribute, we used Soon et al.’s model (Soon et al., 2001) for pairedness determination.

Taking the semantic parsing-based approach, Kanayama and Nasukawa (2004) apply the idea of transfer-based machine translation to the extraction of attribute-value pairs.
