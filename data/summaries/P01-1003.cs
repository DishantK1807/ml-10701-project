Recently (Amaya and Bened´ı, 2000), the PS was successfully used to estimate the parameters of a WSME language model . In that work, a comparison was made between the performance of WSME models trained using MCMC and WSME models trained using PS.

Using the ME principle, we can combine information from a variety of sources into the same language model (Berger et al., 1996; Rosenfeld, 1996).
J96-1002
Statistical language models have gained considerable acceptance due to the efficiency demonstrated in the fields in which they have been applied (Bahal et al., 1983; Jelinek et al., 1991; Ratnapharkhi, 1998; Borthwick, 1999).
H91-1057
Over the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) for use in different tasks (K., 1979; Jelinek, 1991; Ney, 1992; Sakakibara, 1990).
H91-1057
Work A part of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) which had been processed in the Penn Treebanck Project (Marcus et al., 1993) was used in the experiments.
