The resulting parse forests would then be optimally compact, contrary to some other LR-based tabular algorithms, as pointed out by Rekers (1992), Nederhof (1993) and Nederhof (1994b).

Another example, on which our presentation is based, was first suggested by Leermakers (1989): a grammar is first transformed and then a standard tabular algorithm along with some filtering condition is applied using the transformed grammar.

An interesting fact is that the automaton .A2LR is very similar to the automaton .ALR constructed for a grammar transformed by the transformation rtwo given by Nederhof and Satta (1994).

The best-known example is generalized LR parsing, also known as Tomita's algorithm, described by Tomita (1986) and further investigated by, for example, Tomita (1991) and Nederhof (1994a).

The entries in the table represent single stack elements, as opposed to pairs of stack elements following Lang (1974) and Leermakers (1989).

This is reminiscent of techniques of state minimization for finite automata (Booth, 1967), as they have been applied before to LR parsing, e.g., by Pager (1970) and Nederhof and Sarbo (1993).

Following the general approach presented by Leermakers (1989), we simulate computations of 2For the earliest mention of this transformation, we have encountered pointers to Schauerte (1973).

considerations (Leermakers, 1989; Schabes, 1991; Nederhof, 1994b) have suggested that for natural language parsing, LR-based techniques may not necessarily be superior to other parsing techniques, although convincing empirical data to this effect has never been shown.

The conceptual simplicity of our formulation of tabular LR parsing allows comparison with other tabular parsing techniques, such as Earley's algorithm (Earley, 1970) and tabular left-corner parsing (Nederhof, 1993), based on implementationindependent criteria.

3As remarked before by Nederhof (1993), the algorithms by Schabes (1991) and Leermakers (1989) are not really related to LR parsing, although some notation used in these papers suggests otherwise.
