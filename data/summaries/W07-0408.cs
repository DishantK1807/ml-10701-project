Synchronous parsing models have been explored with moderate success (Wu, 1997; Quirk et al., 2005).

Syntactic models for language are being reintroduced into language and speech processing systems thanks to the success of sophisticated statistical models of parsing (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Collins, 2003).

Both the model of Amalgam and that presented here differ considerably from the n-gram models of Langkilde and Knight (1998), the TAG models of Bangalore and Rambow (2000), and the stochastic generation from semantic representation approach of Soricut and Marcu (2006).

The Hiero model has been the most successful to date by incorporating syntactic structure amounting to simple tree structures (Chiang, 2005).
