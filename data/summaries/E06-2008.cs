In current sentence generators, the coordinative ellipsis rules are often inextricably intertwined with the rules for generating nonelliptical coordinate structures, so that they cannot easily be ported to other grammar formalisms — e.g., Sarkar & Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory Categorial Grammar; Bateman, Matthiessen & Zeng (1999) for Functional Grammar.
