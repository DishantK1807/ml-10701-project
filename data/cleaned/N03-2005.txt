Story Link Detection and New Event Detection are Asymmetric Francine Chen PARC 3333 Coyote Hill Rd Palo Alto, CA 94304 fchen@parc.com Ayman Farahat PARC 3333 Coyote Hill Rd Palo Alto, CA 94304 farahat@parc.com Thorsten Brants PARC 3333 Coyote Hill Rd Palo Alto, CA 94304 thorsten@brants.net Abstract Story link detection has been regarded as a core technology for other Topic Detection and Tracking tasks such as new event detection.
In this paper we analyze story link detection and new event detection in a retrieval framework and examine the effect of a number of techniques, including part of speech tagging, new similarity measures, and an expanded stop list, on the performance of the two detection tasks.
We present experimental results that show that the utility of the techniques on the two tasks differs, as is consistent with our analysis.
1 Introduction
Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research is sponsored by the DARPA TIDES program.
The research has five tasks related to organizing streams of data such as newswire and broadcast news (Wayne, 2000).
A link detection (LNK) system detects whether two stories are “linked”, or discuss the same event.
A story about a plane crash and another story about the funeral of the crash victims are considered to be linked.
In contrast, a story about hurricane Andrew and a story about hurricane Agnes are not linked because they are two different events.
A new event detection (NED) system detects when a story discusses a previously unseen event.
Link detection is considered to be a core technology for new event detection and the other tasks.
Several groups are performing research on the TDT tasks of link detection and new event detection (e.g., (Carbonell et al., 2001) (Allan et al., 2000)).
In this paper, we compare the link detection and new event detection tasks in an information retrieval framework, examining the criteria for improving a NED system based on a LNK system, and give specific directions for improving each system separately.
We also investigate the utility of a number of techniques for improving the systems.
2 Common
Processing and Models The Link Detection and New Event Detection systems that we developed for TDT2002 share many processing steps in common.
This includes preprocessing to tokenize the data, recognize abbreviations, normalize abbreviations, remove stop-words, replace spelledout numbers by digits, add part-of-speech tags, replace the tokens by their stems, and then generating termfrequency vectors.
Document frequency counts are incrementally updated as new sources of stories are presented to the system.
Additionally, separate sourcespecific counts are used, so that, for example, the term frequencies for the New York Times are computed separately from stories from CNN.
The sourcespecific, incremental, document frequency counts are used to compute a TF-IDF term vector for each story.
Stories are compared using either the cosine distance a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a13a7a15a14a17a16a19a18 a20a22a21a17a23a25a24a27a26a4a28a29a31a30a33a32a4a34a23a25a24a27a26a4a28a29a36a35a33a32 a37 a20a38a21a39a23a25a24a27a26a4a28a29a31a30a33a32 a35 a34a20a22a21a39a23a40a24a41a26a4a28a29a36a35a42a32 a35 or Hellinger distance a0a2a1a43a3a44a5a45a7 a9 a11a13a7 a14 a16a46a18 a20 a26 a47 a23a25a24a48a29a31a30a49a28a26a50a32 a20a22a21a12a23a25a24a48a29a31a30a49a28a26a50a32a52a51 a23a25a24a48a29a36a35a53a28a26a50a32 a20a22a21a12a23a40a24a54a29a36a35a36a28a26a50a32 for terms a55 in documents a7 a9 and a7 a14. To help compensate for stylistic differences between various sources, e.g., news paper vs.
broadcast news, translation errors, and automatic speech recognition errors (Allan et al., 1999), we subtract the average observed similarity values, in similar spirit to the use of thresholds conditioned on the sources (Carbonell et al., 2001) 3 New Event Detection In order to decide whether a new document a7 describes a new event, it is compared to all previous documents and the document a7a57a56 with highest similarity is identified.
If the score a0a17a58a31a59a39a60a12a61a10a5a45a7a10a16a62a18a64a63a66a65a67a0a2a1a4a3a44a5a45a7a57a11a13a7a68a56a2a16 exceeds a threshold a69a25a70, then there is no sufficiently similar previous document, and a7 is classified as a new event.
4 Link
Detection In order to decide whether a pair of stories a7a71a9 and a7a10a14 are linked, we compute the similarity between the two documents using the cosine and Hellinger metrics.
The similarity metrics are combined using a support vector machine and the margin is used as a confidence measure that is thresholded.
5 Evaluation
Metric TDT system evaluation is based on the number of false alarms and misses produced by a system.
In link detection, the system should detect linked story pairs; in new event detection, the system should detect new stories.
A detection cost a72a52a73a75a74 a26 a18 a72a77a76a79a78 a70a33a70 a51a43a80 a76a79a78 a70a33a70 a51a8a80 a26a45a81a53a82a84a83 a72a52a85a87a86 a51a8a80 a85a87a86 a51a8a80a89a88a25a90a13a88 a26a45a81a53a82a92a91 (1) is computed where the costs a72a93a76a52a78 a70a33a70 and a72a79a85a87a86 are set to 1 and 0.1, respectively.
a80 a76a79a78 a70a33a70 and a80 a85a94a86 are the computed miss and false alarm probabilities.
a80 a26a45a81a53a82 and a80 a88a92a90a42a88 a26a45a81a31a82 are the a priori target and non-target probabilities, set to 0.02 and 0.98, respectively.
The detection cost is normalized by dividing by mina5 a72 a76a79a78 a70a33a70 a51a8a80 a26a45a81a53a82 a11 a72 a85a87a86 a51a8a80 a88a25a90a13a88 a26a45a81a53a82 a16 so that a perfect system scores 0, and a random baseline scores 1.
Equal weight is given to each topic by accumulating error probabilities separately for each topic and then averaged.
The minimum detection cost is the decision cost when the decision threshold is set to the optimal confidence score.
6 Differences
between LNK and NED The conditions for false alarms and misses are reversed for the LNK and NED tasks.
In the LNK task, incorrectly flagging two stories as being on the same event is considered a false alarm.
In contrast, in the NED task, incorrectly flagging two stories as being on the same event will cause a true first story to be missed.
Conversely, incorrectly labeling two stories that are on the same event as not linked is a miss, but for the NED task, incorrectly labeling two stories on the same event as not linked may result in a false alarm.
In this section, we analyze the utility of a number of techniques for the LNK and NED tasks in an information retrieval framework.
The detection cost in Eqn.
1 assigns a higher cost to false alarms since a72a95a76a79a78 a70a33a70 a51a25a80 a26a45a81a31a82 a18a97a96 a91 a96a15a98 and a72 a85a87a86 a51a99a80 a88a92a90a42a88 a26a45a81a31a82 a18a100a96 a91 a96a92a101a25a102 . A LNK system should minimize false alarms by identifying only linked stories, which results in high precision for LNK.
In contrast, a NED system will minimize false alarms by identifying all stories that are linked, which translates to high recall for LNK.

We also investigated the use of different similarity measures.
6.1 Similarity
Measures The systems developed for TDT primarily use cosine similarity as the similarity measure.
In work on text segmentation (Brants et al., 2002), better performance was observed with the Hellinger measure.
Table 1 shows that for LNK, the system based on cosine similarity performed better; in contrast, for NED, the system based on Hellinger similarity performed better.
The LNK task requires high precision, which corresponds to a large separation between the on-topic and off-topic distributions, as shown for the cosine metric in Figure 1.
The NED task requires high recall (low CDF Table 1: Effect of different similarity measures on topicweighted minimum normalized detection costs on the TDT 2002 dry run data.

Figure 2, which is based on pairs that contain the current story and its most similar story in the story history, shows a greater separation in this region with the Hellinger metric.
For example, at 10% recall, the Hellinger metric has 71% false alarm rate as compared to 75% for the cosine metric.
6.2 Part-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging To reduce confusion among some word senses, we tagged the terms as one of five categories: adjective, noun, proper nouns, verb, or other, and then combined the stem and part-of-speech to create a “tagged term”.
For example, ‘N train’ represents the term ‘train’ when used as a noun.
The LNK and NED systems were tested using the tagged terms.
Table 2 shows the opposite effect PoS tagging has on LNK and NED.
6.3 Stop
Words The broadcast news documents in the TDT collection have been transcribed using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
There are systematic differences between ASR and manually transcribed text.
For example “30” will be spelled out as “thirty” and ‘CNN” is represented as three separate tokens “C”, “N”, and “N”.
To handle these differences, an “ASR stoplist” was created by identifying terms with statistically different distributions in a parallel corpus of manually and automatically transcribed documents, the TDT2 corpus.
Table 3 shows that use of an ASR stoplist on the topic-weighted minimum detection costs improves results for LNK but not for NED.
We also performed “enhanced preprocessing” to normalize abbreviations and transform spelled-out numbers into numerals, which improves both precision and recall.
Table 3 shows that enhanced preprocessing exhibits worse performance than the ASR stoplist for Link Detection, but yields best results for New Event Detection.

We performed experiments comparing the effect of several techniques on the performance of LNK and NED systems.
Although many of the processing techniques used by our systems are the same, the results of our experiments indicate that some techniques affect the performance of LNK and NED systems differently.
These differences may be due in part to the asymmetry in the tasks and the corresponding differences in whether improving precision or recall for the link task is more important.
