Approaches Much attention has been paid to the ellipsis problem in linguistics (e.g., \[Dahl, 1972; Dahl, 1974; Fiengo and May, 1990; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Ha'lk, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Klein, 1987; Lappin, 1992; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977\]), as well as in natural language processing (e.g., \[Dalrymple et al., 1991; Hardt, 1992; Lappin and McCord, 1990; Priist et al., 1991\]).

.Syntactic accounts of ellipsis (e.g., \[Fiengo and May, 1990; Ha'/k, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Lappin, 1992; 203 Lappin and McCord, 1990\]) posit the copying of syntactic structure from the source clause representation to the target clause representation.
