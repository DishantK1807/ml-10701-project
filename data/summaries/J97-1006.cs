163 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 6.6 The Impact of Miscommunication One important phenomenon of interactive dialogue that has recently begun to receive attention in the computational linguistics community is the handling of miscommunication (e.g., McRoy and Hirst \[1995\], Brennan and Hulteen \[1995\], and Lambert and Carberry \[1992\]).

Guinn (1996) reports on the utility of computer-computer dialogue simulations of the Collaborative Algorithm, an extension of our Missing Axiom Theory (Section 3.1) for modeling dialogue processing.
P96-1037
These results show that there is a relationship between our notion of task control and the Whittaker and Stenton (1988) notion of linguistic control evaluated by Walker and Whittaker (1990)--namely, that as users exploit their task expertise, linguistic control shifts occur much more frequently.

• Finally, integration of theorems, the utterances relevant to these theorems, and the expectations for responses that supply missing axioms yields a constructive method for creating and using a discourse model first proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986), but for which they did not offer a method of dynamic construction during the course of a dialogue.

As other researchers have noted (Whittaker and Stenton 1989; Dahlback, J6nsson, and Ahrenberg 1993; Fraser and Gilbert 1991), when the WOZ simulations are convincing, they obtain data that are a more accurate predictor of actual human-computer interaction than human-human dialogues because speakers adapt to the perceived characteristics of their conversational partners.

Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991) extend the plan recognition model of Litman and Allen (1987) to consider mixed-initiative dialogue.
P91-1004
The interested reader is referred to Smith, Hipp, and Biermann (1995) for further details about the overall model.

Walker and Whittaker (1990) apply these dialogue control rules to analyze how initiative affects discourse structure.
P90-1010
For example, much analysis of human-human interactions has been done, such as Walker and Whittaker's (1990) analysis of mixed initiative in dialogue, or Oviatt and Cohen's (1991) comparison of interactive and non-interactive spoken modalities.

In some simulations (e.g., Whittaker and Stenton \[1989\]), the Wizard simulates the entire system while in other cases (e.g., Dahlb~ick, J6nsson, and Ahrenberg \[1993\]), the Wizard makes use of partially implemented systems to assist in responding.
E89-1016
Walker and Whittaker's (1990) study of mixed-initiative dialogue used a notion of control based on linguistic goals as specified in the control rules first presented in Section 2.3 and repeated below.
P90-1010
Theoretical Work on Mixed-Initiative Whittaker and Stenton (1988) propose a definition for dialogue control based on the utterance type of the speaker (question, assertion, command, or prompt) as follows: • Question: The speaker has control unless the question directly followed a question or command by the other conversant.
P88-1015
Examples of such dialogue systems are described in Allen, Frisch, and Litman (1982), Bobrow et al.(1977), Carberry (1988), Frederking (1988), Hafner and Godden (1985), Hendrix et al.(1978), Hoeppner et al.(1983), Jullien and Marty (1989), Kaplan (1982), Levine (1990), Peckham (1991), Seneff (1992), Waltz (1978), Wilensky et al.(1988), Young et al.(1989), and Young and Proctor (1989).

In particular, the restrictive 125-word vocabulary meant that speech repairs and disfluencies that are prevalent in human-human spoken interaction and an important area of study (Oviatt 1995; Heeman and Allen 1994) could not be processed by the system.
