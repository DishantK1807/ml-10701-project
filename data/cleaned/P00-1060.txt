1 Introduction
In the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman, 1992] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996].
How to evaluate the different feature types’ effects for syntactic parsing?
The paper proposes an information-theory-based feature types analysis model, which uses the measures of predictive information quantity, predictive information gain, predictive information redundancy and predictive information summation to quantitatively analyse the different contextual feature types’ or feature types combination’s predictive power for syntactic structure.
In the following, Section 2 describes the probabilistic evaluation model for syntactic trees; Section 3 proposes an information-theory-based feature type analysis model; Section 4 introduces several experimental issues; Section 5 quantitatively analyses the different contextual feature types or feature types combination in the view of information theory and draws a series of conclusion on their predictive powers for syntactic structures.
2 The
probabilistic evaluation model for statistical syntactic parsing Given a sentence, the task of statistical syntactic parsing is to assign a probability to each candidate parsing tree that conforms to the grammar and select the one with highest probability as the final analysis result.
That is: )|(maxarg STPT T best = (1) where S denotes the given sentence, T denotes the set of all the candidate parsing trees that conform to the grammar, P(T|S) denotes the probability of parsing tree T for the given sentence S.
The task of probabilistic evaluation model in syntactic parsing is the estimation of P(T|S).
In the syntactic parsing model which uses rulebased grammar, the probability of a parsing tree can be defined as the probability of the derivation which generates the current parsing tree for the given sentence.

In order to accurately estimate the parameters, we need to select some feature types m FFF,,, 21 G16, depending on which we can divide the contextual condition Sh i, for predicting rule r i into some equivalence classes, that is, ],[,,,, 21 ShSh i FFF i m → G16, so that ∏∏ == ≈ n i ii n i ii ShrPShrP 11 ]),[|(),|( (3) According to the equation of (2) and (3), we have the following equation: ∏ = ≈ n i ii ShrPSTP 1 ]),[|()|( (4) In this way, we can get a unite expression of probabilistic evaluation model for statistical syntactic parsing.
The difference among the different parsing models lies mainly in that they use different feature types or feature type combination to divide the contextual condition into equivalent classes.
Our ultimate aim is to determine which combination of feature types is optimal for the probabilistic evaluation model of statistical syntactic parsing.
Unfortunately, the state of knowledge in this regard is very limited.
Many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively.
In the paper, we propose an information-theory-based feature type analysis model by which we can quantitatively analyse the predictive power of different feature types or feature type combinations for syntactic structure in a systematic way.
The conclusion is expected to provide reliable reference for feature type selection in the probabilistic evaluation modelling for statistical syntactic parsing.
3 The
information-theory-based feature type analysis model for statistical syntactic parsing In the prediction of stochastic events, entropy and conditional entropy can be used to evaluate the predictive power of different feature types.
To predict a stochastic event, if the entropy of the event is much larger than its conditional entropy on condition that a feature type is known, it indicates that the feature type grasps some of the important information for the predicted event.
According to the above idea, we build the information-theory-based feature type analysis model, which is composed of four concepts: predictive information quantity, predictive information gain, predictive information redundancy and predictive information summation.
G7A Predictive Information Quantity (PIQ) );( RFPIQ, the predictive information quantity of feature type F to predict derivation rule R, is defined as the difference between the entropy of R and the conditional entropy of R on condition that the feature type F is known.
∑ ∈∈ ⋅ = −= RrFf rPfP rfP rfP FRHRHRFPIQ, )()( ),( log),( )|()();( (5) Predictive information quantity can be used to measure the predictive power of a feature type in feature type analysis.
G7A Predictive Information Gain (PIG) For the prediction of rule R, PIG(F x ;R|F 1,F 2,...,F i ), the predictive information gain of taking F x as a variant model on top of a baseline model employing F 1,F 2,...,F i as feature type combination, is defined as the difference between the conditional entropy of predicting R based on feature type combination F 1,F 2,...,F i and the conditional entropy of predicting R based on feature type combination F 1,F 2,...,F i,F x . )6( ),,,( ),,( ),,,( ),,,,( log),,,,( ),,,|(),,|(),,|;( 1 1 1 1 1 111 11 rffP ffP fffP rfffP rfffP FFFRHFFRHFFRFPIG i i xi xi Rr Ff Ff Ff xi xiiix xx ii G16 G16 G16 G16 G16 G16G16G16 G16 ⋅= −= ∑ ∈ ∈ ∈ ∈ If ),,,|;(),,,|;( 2121 iyix FFFRFPIGFFFRFPIG G16G16 >, then F x is deemed to be more informative than F y for predicting R on top of F 1,F 2,...,F i, no matter whether PIQ(F x ;R) is larger than PIQ(F y ;R) or not.
G7A Predictive Information Redundancy(PIR) Based on the above two definitions, we can further draw the definition of predictive information redundancy as follows.
PIR(F x,{F 1,F 2,...,F i };R) denotes the redundant information between feature type F x and feature type combination {F 1,F 2,...,F i } in predicting R, which is defined as the difference between PIQ(F x ;R) and PIG(F x ;R|F 1,F 2,...,F i ).
That is, ),,,|;();( )};,,,{,( 21 21 ixx ix FFFRFPIGRFPIQ RFFFFPIR G16 G16 −= (7) Predictive information redundancy can be used as a measure of the redundancy between the predictive information of a feature type and that of a feature type combination.
G7A Predictive Information Summation (PIS) PIS(F 1,F 2,...,F m ;R), the predictive information summation of feature type combination F 1,F 2,...,F m, is defined as the total information that F 1,F 2,...,F m can provide for the prediction of a derivation rule.

The feature types for prediction can be classified into two classes, history feature types and objective feature types.
In the following, we will take the parsing tree shown in Figure-1 as the example to explain the classification of the feature types.
In Figure-1, the current predicted event is the derivation rule to extend the framed nonterminal node VP, the part connected by the solid line belongs to history feature types, which is the already derived partial parsing tree, representing the structural environment of the current non-terminal node.
The part framed by the larger rectangle belongs to the objective feature types, which is the word sequence containing the leaf nodes of the partial parsing tree rooted by the current node, representing the final objectives to be derived from the current node.
4.2 The
corpus used in the experiment The experimental corpus is derived from Penn TreeBank[Marcus,1993].
We semiautomatically assign a headword and a POS tag to each non-terminal node.
80% of the corpus (979,767 words) is taken as the training set, used for estimating the various co-occurrence probabilities, 10% of the corpus (133,814 words) is taken as the testing set, used to calculate predictive information quantity, predictive information gain, predictive information redundancy and predictive information summation.
The other 10% of the corpus (133,814 words) is taken as the held-out set.
The grammar rule set is composed of 8,126 CFG rules extracted from Penn TreeBank.

5.1 The
analysis to the predictive information quantities of lexical feature types, part-of-speech feature types and constituent label feature types G7A Goal One of the most important variation in statistical parsing over the last few years is that statistical lexical information is incorporated into the probabilistic evaluation model.
Some statistical parsing systems show that the performance is improved after the lexical information is added.
Our research aims at a quantitative analysis of the differences among the predictive information quantities provided by the lexical feature types, part-of-speech feature types and constituent label feature types from the view of information theory.
G7A Data The experiment is conducted on the history feature types of the nodes whose structural distance to the current node is within 2.
In Table-1, “Y” in PIQ(X of Y; R) represents the node, “X” represents the constitute label, the headword or POS of the headword of the node.
In the following, the units of PIQ are bits.
G7A Conclusion Among the feature types in the same structural position of the parsing tree, the predictive information quantity of lexical feature type is larger than that of part-of-speech feature type, and the predictive information quantity of partof-speech feature type is larger than that of the constituent label feature type.

G7A Data: In Table-2, SR represents the structural relation between the current node and the node that the given feature type related to.
SD represents the structural distance between the current node and the node that the given feature type related to.
Table-2: The predictive information quantity of the selected history feature types PIQ(constituent label of Y; R) SR= parent relation SR= brother relation SR= mixed parent and brother relation 0.5832 (Y= the first left brother) SD=1 1.1598 (Y= the parent) 0.4730 (Y= the first right brother) 0.2505 (Y= the first left brother of the parent) 0.0949 (Y= the second left brother) SD=2 0.6483 (Y= the grandpa) 0.1066 (Y= the second right brother) 0.1068 (Y= the first right brother of the parent) G7A Conclusion Among the history feature types which have the same structural relation with the current node (the relations are both parent-child relation, or both brother relation, etc), the one which has closer structural distance to the current node will provide larger predictive information quantity; Among the history feature types which have the same structural distance to the current node, the one which has parent relation with the current node will provide larger predictive information quantity than the one that has brother relation or mixed parent and brother relation to the current node (such as the parent's brother node).
5.3 The
analysis to the predictive information quantities of the history feature types and the objective feature types G7A Goal Many of the existing probabilistic evaluation models prefer to use history feature types other than objective feature types.
We select some of history feature types and objective feature types, and quantitatively compare their predictive information quantities.
G7A Data The history feature type we use here is the headword of the parent, which has the largest predictive information quantity among all the history feature types.
The objective feature types are selected stochastically, which are the first word and the second word in the objective word sequence of the current node (Please see 4.1 and Figure-1 for detailed descriptions on the selected feature types).
Table-3: The predictive information quantity of the selected history and objective feature types Class Feature type PIQ(Y;R) History feature type Y= headword of the parent 2.3253 Y= the first word in the objective word sequence 3.2398Objective feature type Y= the second word in the objective word sequence 3.0071 G7A Conclusion Either of the predictive information quantity of the first word and the second word in the objective word sequence is larger than that of the headword of the parent node which has the largest predictive information quantity among all of the history feature type candidates.
That is to say, objective feature types may have larger predictive power than that of the history feature type.
5.4 The
analysis to the predictive information quantities of the objective features types selected respectively on the physical position information, the heuristic information of headword and modifier, and the exact headword information G7A Goal Not alike the structural history feature types, the objective feature types are sequential.
Generally, the candidates of the objective feature types are selected according to the physical position.
However, from the linguistic viewpoint, the physical position information can hardly grasp the relations between the linguistic structures.
Therefore, besides the physical position information, our research try to select the objective feature types respectively according to the exact headword information and the heuristic information of headword and modifier.
Through the experiment, we hope to find out what influence the exact headword information, the heuristic information of headword and modifier, and the physical position information have respectively to the predictive information quantities of the feature types.
G7A Data: Table-4 gives the evidence for the claim.
Table-4: the predictive information quantity of the selected objective feature types the information used to select the objective feature types PIQ(Y;R) the physical position information 3.2398 (Y= the first word in the objective word sequence) Heuristic information 1: determine whether a word has the possibility to act as the headword of the current constitute according to its POS 3.1401 (Y= the first word in the objective word sequence which has the possibility to act as the headword of the current constitute) Heuristic information 2: determine whether a word has the possibility to act as the modifier of the current constitute according to its POS 3.1374 (Y= the first word in the objective word sequence which has the possibility to act as the modifier of the current constitute) Heuristic information 3: given the current headword, determine whether a word has the possibility to modify the headword 2.8757 (Y= the first word in the objective word sequence which has the possibility to modify the headword) the exact headword information 3.7333 (Y= the headword of the current constitute) G7A Conclusion The predictive information quantity of the headword of the current node is larger than that of a feature type selected according to the selected heuristic information of headword or modifier, and larger than that of a feature type selected according to the physical positions; The predictive information quantity of a feature type selected according to the physical positions is larger than that of a feature types selected according to the selected heuristic information of headword or modifier.
5.5 The
selection of the feature type combination which has the optimal predictive information summation G7A Goal: We aim at proposing a method to select the feature types combination that has the optimal predictive information summation for prediction.
G7A Approach We use the following greedy algorithm to select the optimal feature type combination.
In building a model, the first feature type to be selected is the feature type which has the largest predictive information quantity for the prediction of the derivation rule among all of the feature type candidates, that is, );( maxarg 1 RFPIQF i F i Ω∈ = (15) Where Ω is the set of candidate feature types.
Given that the model has selected feature type combination j FFF,,, 21 G16, the next feature type to be added into the model is the feature type which has the largest predictive information gain in all of the feature type candidate except j FFF,,, 21 G16, on condition that j FFF,,, 21 G16 is known.
That is, )16(),,,|;( 21 },, 2, 1 { 1 maxarg ji j FFF i F i F j FFFRFPIGF G16 G16∉ Ω∈ + = G7A Data: Among the feature types mentioned above, the optimal feature type combination (i.e.
the feature type combination with the largest predictive information summation) which is composed of 6 feature types is, the headword of the current node (type1), the headword of the parent node (type2), the headword of the grandpa node (type3), the first word in the objective word sequence(type4), the first word in the objective word sequence which have the possibility to act as the headword of the current constitute(type5), the headword of the right brother node(type6).
The cumulative predictive information summation is showed in Figure-2 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 type1 type2 type3 type4 type5 type6 feature type cummulative predicting information summation Figure-2: The cumulative predictive information summation of the feature type combinations 6 Conclusion The paper proposes an information-theory-based feature type analysis method, which not only presents a series of heuristic conclusion on the predictive power of the different feature types and feature type combination for syntactic parsing, but also provides a guide for the modeling of syntactic parsing in the view of methodology, that is, we can quantitatively analyse the different contextual feature types or feature types combination's effect for syntactic structure prediction in advance.
Based on these analysis, we can select the feature type or feature types combination that has the optimal predictive information summation to build the probabilistic parsing model.
However, there are still some questions to be answered in this paper.
For example, what is the beneficial improvement in the performance after using this method in a real parser?
Whether the improvements in PIQ will lead to the improvement of parsing accuracy or not?
In the following research, we will incorporate these conclusions into a real parser to see whether the parsing accuracy can be improved or not.
Another work we will do is to do some experimental analysis to find the impact of data sparseness on feature type analysis, which is critical to the performance of real systems.
The proposed feature type analysis method can be used in not only the probabilistic modelling for statistical syntactic parsing, but also language modelling in more general fields [WU, 1999a] [WU, 1999b].
