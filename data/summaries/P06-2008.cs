Tremendous amounts of work has focused on this aspect (Stolcke et al., 2000).

Recently, an architecture for interactive question answering has been proposed based on a notion of predictive questioning (Harabagiu et al., 2005).

However, as discussed in earlier work (Small et al., 2003), sometimes it is very hard to judge the truthfulness of an answer, especially for analytical questions.

Clarification dialogues can be applied to negotiate with users about the intent of their questions (Small et al., 2003).
W03-1206
However, except for a few systems that use dialog to address complex questions (Small et al., 2003; Harabagiu et al., 2005), the general dialog capabilities have been lacking in most quesâˆ— This work was partially supported by IIS-0347548 from the National Science Foundation.

To better facilitate user information needs, recent trends in QA research have shifted towards complex, context-based, and interactive question answering (Voorhees, 2001; Small et al., 2003; Harabagiu et al., 2005).

The empirical results have shown the system with predictive questioning is more efficient and effective for users to accomplish information seeking tasks in a particular domain (Harabagiu et al., 2005).

It has shown that during human machine dialog, there are sufficient cues for machines to automatically identify error conditions (Levow, 1998; Litman et al., 1999; Hirschberg et al., 2001; Walker et al., 2002).
