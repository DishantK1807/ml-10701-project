Probabilistic Models for Korean Morphological Analysis Do-Gil Lee and Hae-Chang Rim Dept.
of Computer Science & Engineering Korea University 1, 5-ka, Anam-dong, Seongbuk-gu Seoul 136-701, Korea CUdglee, rimCV@nlp.korea.ac.kr Abstract This paper discusses Korean morphological analysis and presents three probabilistic models for morphological analysis.
Each model exploits a distinct linguistic unit as a processing unit.
The three models can compensate for each other’s weaknesses.
Contrary to the previous systems that depend on manually constructed linguistic knowledge, the proposed system can fully automatically acquire the linguistic knowledge from annotated corpora (e.g.
part-ofspeech tagged corpora).
Besides, without any modification of the system, it can be applied to other corpora having different tagsets and annotation guidelines.
We describe the models and present evaluation results on three corpora with a wide range of conditions.
1 Introduction
This paper discusses Korean morphological analysis.
Morphological analysis is to break down an Eojeol 1 into morphemes, which is the smallest meaningful unit.
The jobs to do in morphological analysis are as follows: AF Separating an Eojeol into morphemes AF Assigning the morpho-syntactic category to each morpheme 1 Eojeol is the surface level form of Korean and is the spacing unit delimited by a whitespace.
AF Restoring the morphological changes to the original form We have to consider some difficult points in Korean morphology: there are two kinds of ambiguities (segmentation ambiguity and part-of-speech ambiguity).
Moreover, morphological changes to be restored are very frequent.
In contrast to partof-speech (POS) tagging, morphological analysis is characterized by producing all the (grammatically) regal interpretations.
Table 1 gives examples of morphological analysis for Eojeols “naneun” and “gam-gi-neun”.
Previous works on morphological analysis depends on manually constructed linguistic knowledge such as morpheme dictionary, morphosyntactic rules, and morphological rules.
There are two major disadvantages in this approach: AF Construction of the knowledge base is timeconsuming and labor-intensive.
In addition, storing every word in a lexicon is impossible so the previous approch suffers from the unknown word problem.
AF There is a lack of portability.
Because the results produced by a morphological analyzer are limited to the given tagset and the annotation guidelines, it is very difficult to apply the system to other tagsets and guidelines.
The proposed morphological analyzer, ProKOMA, tries to overcome these limitations: Firstly, it uses only POS tagged corpora as an information source and can automatically acquire a knowledge base from these corpora.
Hence, there is no necessity for the manual labor in constructing and maintaining such a knowledge base.
197 Table 1: Examples of morphological analysis na-neun gam-gi-neun na/np+neun/jx ‘I am’ gam-gi/pv+neun/etm ‘be wound’ na/pv+neun/etm ‘to sprout’ gam-gi/nc+neun/jx ‘a cold is’ nal/pv+neun/etm ‘to fly’ gam/pv+gi/etn+neun/jx ‘to wash is’ Although constructing such corpora also requires a lot of efforts, the amount of annotated corpora is increasing every year.
Secondly, regardless of tagsets and annotation guidelines, it can be applied to any training data without modification.
Finally, it can provide not only analyzed results but also their probabilities by the probabilistic models.
In Korean, no attempt has been made at probabilistic approach to morphological analysis.
Probabilities enable the system to rank the results and to provide the probabilities to the next module such as POS tagger.

works Over the past few decades, a considerable number of studies have been made on Korean morphological analysis.
The early studies concentrated on the algorithmic research.
The following approaches belong to this group: longest matching algorithm, tabular parsing method using CYK algorithm (Kim, 1986), dictionary based approach (Kwon, 1991), two-level morphology(Lee, 1992), and syllable-based approach (Kang and Kim, 1994).
Next, many studies have been made on improving the efficiency of the morphological analyzers.
There have been studies to reduce the search space and implausible interpretations by using characteristics of Korean syllables (Kang, 1995; Lim et al., 1995).
There have been no standard tagset and annotation guideline, so researchers have developed methods with their own tagsets and guidelines.
The Morphological Analysis and Tagger Evaluation Contest (MATEC) took place in 1999.
This is the first trial about the objective and relative evaluation of morphological analysis.
Among the participants, some newly implemented the systems and others converted the existing systems’ results through postprocessing steps.
In both cases, they reported that they spent much effort and argued the necessity of tuning the linguistic knowledge.
All the systems described so far can be considered as the so called dictionary and rule based approach.
In this approach, the quality of the dictionary and the rules govern the system’s performance.
The proposed approach is the first attempt to probabilistic morphological analysis.
The aim of the paper is to show that this approach can achieve comparable performances with the previous approaches.
3 Probabilistic
morphological analysis model Probabilistic morphological analysis generates all the possible interpretations and their probabilities for a given Eojeol DB.
The probability that a given Eojeol DB is analyzed to a certain interpretation CA is represented as C8B4CACYDBB5.
The interpretation CA is made up of a morpheme sequence C5 and its corresponding POS sequence CC as given in Equation 1.
C8B4CACYDBB5BPC8B4C5BNCCCYDBB5 (1) In the following subsections, we describe the three morphological analysis models based on three different linguistic units (Eojeol, morpheme, and syllable 2 ).
3.1 Eojeol-unit model For the Eojeol-unit model, it is sufficient to store the frequencies of each Eojeol (surface level form) and its interpretation acquired from the POS tagged corpus 3. The probabilities of Equation 1 are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) using relative frequencies in the training data.
2 In
Korean written text, each character has one syllable.
We do not distinguish between character and syllable in this paper.
3 ProKOMA
extracts only Eojeols occurred five times or more in training data.
198 The most prominent advantage of the Eojeolunit analysis is its simplicity.
As mentioned before, morphological analysis of Korean is very complex.
The Eojeol-unit analysis can avoid such complex process so that it is very efficient and fast.
Besides, it can reduce unnecessary results by only producing the interpretations that really appeared in the corpus.
So, we also expect an improvement in accuracy.
Due to the high productivity of Korean Eojeol, the number of possible Eojeols is very large so storing all kinds of Eojeols is impossible.
Therefore, using the Eojeol-unit analysis alone is undesirable, but a small number of Eojeols with high frequency can cover a significant portion of the entire ones, thus this model will be helpful.
3.2 Morpheme-unit model As discussed, not all Eojeols can be covered by the Eojeol-unit analysis.
The ultimate goal of morphological analysis is to recognize every morpheme within an Eojeol.
For these reasons, most previous systems have used morpheme as a processing unit for morphological analysis.
The morpheme-unit morphological analysis model is derived as follows by introducing lexical form D0: C8B4CACYDBB5 BP C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4CACYD0BNDBB5 (2) where D0 should satisfy the following condition: D0 BE C4 DB CKC8B4D0CYCAB5BPBD where C4 DB is a set of lexical forms that can be derived from the surface form DB.
This condition means that among all possible lexical forms for agivenDB (C4 DB ), the only lexical form D0 is deterministically derived from the interpretation CA.
C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4CACYD0BNDBB5 AP C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4CACYD0B5 (3) AP C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4CAB5 (4) BP C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4C5BNCCB5 (5) Equation 3 assumes the interpretation CA and the surface form DB are conditionally independent given the lexical form D0.
Since the lexical form D0 is underlying in the morpheme sequence C5 4, 4 A lexical form is just the concatenation of morphemes.
the lexical form D0 can be omitted as in equation 4.
In Equation 5, the left term C8B4D0CYDBB5 denotes “the morphological restoration model”, and the right C8B4C5BNCCB5 “the morpheme segmentation and POS assignment model”.
We describe the morphological restoration model first.
The model is the probability of the lexical form given a surface form and is to encode the probability that the CZ substrings between the surface form and its lexical form correspond to each other.
The equation of the model is as follows: C8B4D0CYDBB5 AP CZ CH CYBPBD C8B4CMD7 CY CYD7 CY B5 (6) where, D7 CY and CMD7 CY denote the CYth substrings of the surface form and the lexical form, respectively.
We call such pairs of substrings “morphological information”.
This information can be acquired by the following steps: If a surface form (Eojeol) and its lexical form are the same, each syllable pair of them is mapped one-to-one and extracted.
Otherwise, it means that a morphological change occurs.
In this case, the pair of two substrings from the beginning to the end of the mismatch is extracted.
The morphological information is also automatically extracted from training data.
Table 2 shows some examples of applying the morphological restoration model.
Now we turn to the morpheme segmentation and POS assignment model.
It is the joint probability of the morpheme sequence and the tag sequence.
C8B4C5BNCCB5 BP C8B4D1 BDBND2 BND8 BDBND2 B5 AP D2 CH CXBPBD C8B4D1 CX CYD8 CX B5C8B4D8 CX CYD8 CXA0BD B5 A2C8B4D8 BXC7CF CYD8 D2 B5 (7) In equation 7, D8 BC and D8 BXC7CF are pseudo tags to indicate the beginning and the end of Eojeol, respectively.
We introduce the D8 BXC7CF symbol to reflect the preference for well-formed structure of a given Eojeol.
The model is represented as the well-known bigram hidden Markov model (HMM), which is widely used in POS tagging.
The morpheme dictionary and the morphosyntactic rules that have been used in the previous 199 Table 2: Examples of applying the morphological restoration model Surface form Lexical form Probability Description na-neun na-neun C8B4naCYnaB5C8B4neunCYneunB5 No phonological change na-neun nal-neun C8B4nalCYnaB5C8B4neunCYneunB5 ‘l’ irregular conjugation go-ma-wo go-mab-eo C8B4goCYgoB5C8B4mab-eoCYma-woB5 ‘b’ irregular conjugation beo-lyeo beo-li-eo C8B4beoCYbeoB5C8B4li-eoCYlyeoB5 Contraction ga-seo ga-a-seo C8B4gaCYgaB5C8B4a-seoCYseoB5 Ellipsis approaches are included in the lexical probability C8B4D1 CX CYD8 CX B5 and the transition probability C8B4D8 CX CY D8 CXA0BD B5.
3.3 Syllable-unit model One of the most difficult problems in morphological analysis is the unknown word problem, which is caused by the fact that we cannot register every possible morpheme in the dictionary.
In English, contextual information and suffix information is helpful to estimate the POS tag of an unknown word.
In Korean, the syllable characteristics can be utilized.
For instance, a syllable “eoss” can only be a pre-final ending.
The syllable-unit model is derived from Equation 4 as follows: C8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4CAB5BPC8B4D0CYDBB5C8B4BVBNCDB5 (8) where BV BP CR BDBND1 is the syllable sequence of the lexical form, and CD BP D9 BDBND1 is its corresponding syllable tag sequence.
In the above equation, C8B4D0 CY DBB5 is the same as that of the morpheme-unit model (Equation 6), we use the morpheme-unit model’s result as it is.
The right term C8B4BVBNCDB5 is referred to as “the POS assignment model”.
The POS assignment model is to assign the D1 syllables to the D1 syllable tags: C8B4BVBNCDB5 BP C8B4CR BDBND1 BND9 BDBND1 B5 (9) AP D1 CH CXBPBD AW C8B4CR CX CYCR CXA0BEBNCXA0BD BND9 CXA0BEBNCXA0BD B5 C8B4D9 CX CYCR CXA0BDBNCX BND9 CXA0BEBNCXA0BD B5 AX A2C8B4CR BXC7CF CYCR D1A0BDBND1 BND9 D1A0BDBND1 B5 A2C8B4D9 BXC7CF CYCR D1 BNCR BXC7CF BND9 D1A0BDBND1 B5(10) In Equation 10, when CX is less than or equal to zero, CR CX s and D9 CX s denote the pseudo syllables and the pseudo tags, respectively.
They indicate the beginning of Eojeol.
Analogously, CR BXC7CF and D9 BXC7CF denote the pseudo syllables and the pseudo tags to indicate the end of Eojeol, respectively.
Two Markov assumptions are applied in Equation 10.
One is that the probability of the current syllable CR CX conditionally depends only on the previous two syllables and two syllable tags.
The other is that the probability of the current syllable tag D9 CX conditionally depends only on the previous syllable, the current syllable, and the previous two syllable tags.
This model can consider broader context by introducing the less strict independent assumption than the HMM.
In order to convert the syllable sequence BV and the syllable tag sequence CD to the morpheme sequence C5 and the morpheme tag sequence CC,we can use two additional symbols (“B” and “I”) to indicate the boundary of morphemes: a “B” denotes the first syllable of a morpheme and an “I” any non-initial syllable.
Examples of syllableunit tagging with BI symbols are given in Table 3.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental environment For evaluation, three data sets having different tag sets and annotation guidelines are used: ETRI POS tagged corpus, KAIST POS tagged corpus, and Sejong POS tagged corpus.
All experiments were performed by the 10-fold cross-validation.
Table 4 shows the summary of the corpora.
Table 4: Summary of the data Corpus ETRI KAIST Sejong # of Eojeols 288,291 175,468 2,015,860 # of tags 27 54 41 In this paper, we use the following measures in order to evaluate the system: 200 Table 3: Examples of syllable tagging with BI symbols Eojeol na-neun ‘I’ hag-gyo-e ‘to school’ gan-da ‘go’ Tagged Eojeol na/np+neun/jx hag-gyo/nc+e/jc ga/pv+n-da/ef Morpheme na neun hag-gyo e ga n-da Morpheme tag np jx nc jc pv ef Syllable na neun hag gyo e ga n da Syllable tag B-np B-jx B-nc I-nc B-jc B-pv B-ef I-ef Answer inclusion rate (AIR) is defined as the number of Eojeols among whose results contain the gold standard over the entire Eojeols in the test data.
Average ambiguity (AA) is defined as the average number of returned results per Eojeol by the system.
Failure rate (FR) is defined as the number of Eojeols whose outputs are not produced over the number of Eojeols in the test data.
1-best tagging accuracy (1A) is defined as the number of Eojeols of which only one interpretation with highest probability per Eojeol is matched to the gold standard over the entire Eojeols in the test data.
There is a trade-off between AIR and AA.
If a system outputs many results, it is likely to include the correct answer in them, but this leads to an increase of the ambiguity, and vice versa.
The higher AIR is, the better the system.
The AIR can be an upper bound on the accuracy of POS taggers.
On the contrary to AIR, the lower AA is, the better the system.
A low AA can reduce the burden of the disambiguation process of the POS tagger.
Although the 1A is not used as a common evaluation measure for morphological analysis because previous systems do not rank the results, ProKOMA can be evaluated by this measure because it provides the probabilities for the results.
This measure can also be served as a baseline for POS tagging.
4.2 Experimental
results To investigate the performance and the effectiveness of the three models, we conducted several tests according to the combinations of the models.
For each test, we also performed the experiments on the three corpora.
The results of the experiments are listed in Table 5.
In the table, “E”, “M”, and “S” mean the Eojeol-unit analysis, the morpheme-unit analysis, and the syllable-unit analysis, respectively.
The columns having more than one symbol mean that each model performs sequentially.
According to the results, when applying a single model, each model shows the significant differences, especially between “E” and “S”.
Because of low coverage of the Eojeol-unit analysis, “E” shows the lowest AIR and the highest FR.
However, it shows the lowest AA because it produces the small number of results.
On the contrary, “S” shows the highest AA but the best performances on AIR and FR, which is caused by producing many results.
Most previous systems use morpheme as a processing unit for morphological analysis.
We would like to examine the effectiveness of the proposed models based on Eojeol and syllable.
First, compare the models that use the Eojeolunit analysis with others (“M” vs.
“EM”, “S” vs.
“ES”, and “MS” vs.
“EMS”). When applying the Eojeol-unit analysis, AA is decreased, and AIS and 1A are increased.
Then, compare the models that use the syllable-unit analysis with others (“E” vs.
“ES”, “M” vs.
“MS”, and “EM” vs.
“EMS”). When applying the syllable-unit analysis, AIR and 1A are increased, and FR is decreased.
Therefore, both models are very useful when compared the morpheme-unit model only.
Compared with the performances of two systems that participated in MATEC 99, we listed the results in Table 6.
In this evaluation, the ETRI corpus was used and the number of Eojeols included in the test data is 33,855.
The evaluation data used in MATEC 99 and ours are not the same, but are close.

5 Conclusion
We have presented and described the new probabilistic models used in our Korean morphological analyzer ProKOMA.
The previous systems depend on manually constructed linguistic knowledge such as morpheme dictionary, morphosyntactic rules, and morphological rules.
The system, however, requires no manual labor because all the information can be automatically acquired by the POS tagged corpora.
We also showed that the system is portable and flexible by the experiments on three different corpora.
The previous systems take morpheme as a processing unit, but we take three kinds of processing units (e.g.
Eojeol, morpheme, and syllable).
According to the experiments, we can know that the Eojeol-unit analysis contributes efficiency and accuracy, and the syllable-unit analysis is robust in the unknown word problem and also contributes accuracy.
Finally, the system achieved comparable performances with the previous systems.
