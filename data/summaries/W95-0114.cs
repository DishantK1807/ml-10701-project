Because it was divided into two parts to form a non-parallel corpus, it is also half in size to the parallel corpus used for word alignment (Wu 181 & Xia 1994).

We have previously shown an algorithm which extracts a bilingual lexicon from noisy parallel corpus without sentence alignment (Fung & McKeown 1994; Fung 1995).

In parallel corpora, this feature could be the positional co-occurrence of a word and its translation in the other language in the same sentences (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al.1993; Wu & Xia 1994) or in the same segments (Fung & Church 1994; Fung 1995).

Non-parallel Corpus of Chinese and English We use parts of the HKUST English-Chinese Bilingual Corpora for our experiments (Wu 1994), consisting of transcriptions of the Hong Kong Legislative Council debates in both English and Chinese.

Most previous automatic lexicon compilation techniques require a sentence-aligned clean parallel bilingual corpus (Kupiec 1993; Smadja & McKeown 1994; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Dagan et al.1993; Wu & Xia 1994).

We obtained a cluster of Chinese words centered around ~-~ by applying the Kvec segment cooccurrence score (Fung & Church 1994) on the Chinese text with itself.

In Fung & McKeown (1994); Fung (1995), the word feature used was the positional difference vector.
