However, research in centering theory (Sidner, 1981; Grosz et al., 1983; Grosz et al., 1995; Tetreault, 2001) has revealed that the local focusing (or centering) also has a great efiect on the processing of pronominal expressions.

The coreferential chain length of a candidate, or its variants such as occurrence frequency and TFIDF, has been used as a salience factor in some learning-based reference resolution systems (Iida et al., 2003; Mitkov, 1998; Paul et al., 1999; Strube and Muller, 2003).

In recent years, supervised machine learning approaches have been widely explored in reference resolution and achieved considerable success (Ge et al., 1998; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube and Muller, 2003; Yang et al., 2003).

In the algorithms based on the centering theory (Brennan et al., 1987; Grosz et al., 1995), if acandidateanditsantecedentarethebackwardlooking centers of two subsequent utterances respectively, the candidate would be the most preferred since the CONTINUE transition is always ranked higher than SHIFT or RETAIN.
