-Wall Street Journal, 10/27/89 -Boston Globe, 4/5/91 Reporting verbs are pervasive in newspaper articles \[Bergler, 1991\] . The sense of an utterance verb as a reporting verb is sometimes slightly different from its literal sense.

\[Pustejovsky 1991\] distinguishes between "logical metonymy", whose resolution falls naturally out of operations on information contained directly in lexical entries, and "pragmatic metonymy", whose resolution depends on interpretation with respect to the proper pragmatic context.

In this paper, we present a richer representational framework for lexical knowledge, based on Generative Lexicon theory \[Pustejovsky, 1991\], and describe a methodology for exploring the interplay between word senses and the metonymic processes they enter into.

Lexicon Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon theory \[Pustejovsky, 1991\] rejects the characterization of a lexicon as a static listing of word senses and focuses instead on elucidating the set of generative devices which give rise to word senses and allow for the flexible and creative use of language.

As reported in Bergler \[1991\], we find that reporting verbs frequently occur with different kinds of metonymy.

Pustejovsky \[1989, 1991\], has proposed a system of type coercion to explain how verbs like want and believe can accept arguments of type S, VP, and NP without requiring multiple verb entries in the lexicon.

This in fact, is the structural semantic characterization of a packaging coercion: taking a lexical structure with no formal role, and specifying the formal role (Pustejovsky \[1991\] for details).
