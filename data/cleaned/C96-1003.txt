1 Introduction
Recently various methods for automatically constructing a thesaurus (hierarchically clustering words) based on corpus data.
have been proposed (Hindle, 1990; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Tokunaga et al., 1995).
The realization of such an automatic construction method would make it possible to a) save the cost of constructing a thesaurus by hand, b) do away with subjectivity inherent in a hand made thesaurus, and c) make it easier to adapt a natural language processing system to a new domain.
In this paper, we propose a new method for automatic construction of thesauri.
Specifically, we view the problem of automatically clustering words as that of estimating a joint distributiofl over the Cartesian product of a partition of a set of nouns (in general, any set of words) and a partition of a set of w:rbs (in general, any set of words), and propose an est.imation *Real World Computing Partership algorithm using simulated annealing with an energy function based on the blinimum Description Length (MDL) Principle.
The MDL Principle is a well-motivated and theoretically sound principle for data compression and estimation in information theory and statistics.
As a method of statisticM estimation MDL is guaranteed to be near optimal.
We empiricMly evMuated the effectiveness of our method.
In particular, we compared the performance of an MDL-based sinm\]ated anuealilag Mgorithm in hierarchical word clustering against.
that of one based on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE, for short).
We found that the MDL-based method performs better than the MLE-based method.
We also evaluated our method by conducting pp-attachment disambiguation experiments using a thesaurus automatically constructed by it and found that disambiguation results can be improved.
Since some words never occur in a corpus, and thus cannot be reliably classified by a method solely based on corpus data, we propose to combine the use of an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus in disambiguation.
We conducted some experiments in order to test the effectiveness of this strategy.
Our experimental results indicate that combining an automatically constructed thesaurus and a hand made thesaurus widens the coverage 1 of our disambiguation method, while maintaining high accuracy e.
2 The
Problem Setting A method of constructing a thesaurus based on corpus data usually consists of the following three steps: (i) Extract co-occurrence data (e.g.
case frame data, adjacency data) fl'om a corpus, (ii) Starting from a single class (or each word composing its own class), divide (or merge) word classes 1 ~Cover~tge' refers to the proportion (in percentage) of test data for which the disambiguat.ion method can make a decision.
2'Accuracy' refers to the success rate, given that the disambiguation method makes a decision.
based Oll the co-occurrence data using 8Ollle Sill> ilarity (distance) measure.
(The former apl)roach is called 'divisive', the latter 'agglomerative').
(iii) Repeat step (ii) until some stopping condition is met, to construct a thesaurus (tree).
The method we propose here consists of the same three st.eps.
Suppose available to us are frequency data (cooccurrence data).
between verbs and their case slot.
values extracted from a corpus (step (i)).
We then view the problem of clustering words as that of estimating a probabilistic model (representing a.
probability distribution) tllat generates such data We assume that the target model can be defined in the following way.
First, we define a noun partition "PA.
~ over a given set of nouns..'V" and a verb partioll "Pv over a given set.
of verbs 12.
A noun partition is any set T'-~ satisfying "P,~ C 2 H, Wc~e'&v('i = A/ and VCi, ()..
E 7)A.', Ci 0 (/j = O.
A verb partition 7)v is defined analogously.
In this paper, we call a member of a noun partition 'a, llOUll cluster', and a nlenlbe, r of a verb partition a ~verb cluster'.
We refer to a member of the Cartesian product of a noun partition and a verb partition ( C "P:v x "Pv ) simply as 'a cluster'.
We then define a probabilistic model (a joint distribution), written I'(C,, (:v), where random variable C,, assumes a value fl'om a fizcd nouu partition ~PX, and C~.
a va.lue from a fixed verb partition 7)v.
Within a given cluster, we assume thai each element is generated with equal probability, i.e., P(c,,,c~,) v., E c,,,v,,, E c,,, P(,,,,,,) IC.
x <,1 (t) In this paper, we assume that the observed data are generaied by a model belonging to the class of models just de.scribed, and select a model which best explains the data..
As a result of this, we obtain both noun clusters and verb clusters.
This problem setting is based on the intuit.lye assumption that similar words occur in the sa.me context with roughly equal likelihood, as is made explicit in equation (l).
Thus selecting a model which best explains the given data is equivalent to finding the most appropriate classification of words base(t on their co-occurrence.
3 Clustering
with MDL We now turn to the question of what.
strategy (or criterion) we should employ for estimating the best model.
Our choice is the MDL (Minimum Description I,ength) principle (tlissanen, 1989), a well-known principle of data compression and statistical estimation from inforlnation theory.
MDI, stipulates that the best probability model for given data is that model which requires the least cod(: length \['or encoding of the model itself, as well as the giwql data relative to it a.
We refer to the code length for the model aWe refer /.he interested reader to eli aml Abe, 1!195) for explana.tion of ra.tionals behind using the as 'the model description h'ngth' and that for tile data 'the data description length".
We apply MDI, to the problem of estimating a model consisting of a pair of partitions as described above.
In this context, a model with less clusters tends to be simpler (in t.erms of the number of parameters), but also tends to have a poorer fit.
to the data.
In contrast, a model with more clusters is more complex, but tends to have a better fit to the data.
Thus, there is a trade-off relationship between the simplicity of a model and the goodness of fit to the data.
The model description length quantifies the simplicity (complexity) of a model, and the data description length quantifies the tlt.
to the data.
According to MDL, the model which minimizes the sum total of the two types of description lengths should be selected.
In what follows, we will describe in detail how the description length is to be calculated in our current context, as well as our silnulated annealing algorithm based on MI)L.
3.1 Calculating
Description Length We will now describe how the description length for a model is calculated, lh'call that each model is specified by the Cartesian product of a partition of nouns and a partition of verbs, and a number of parameters for them.
Here we let /,', denote the size of the noun partition, and /q, the size of the verb partition.
Tiien, there are k,.
k~,1 free parameters in a model.
Given a model M and data k', its total description length L(J/) 4 is COlnputed as the suni of the model description length L .... d('lt), the description length of its parameters I;~,,,,.(M), and data description length Ld,~t(M).
(We often refer to Lm.od(.'l.\]) qLpar (:'~l) as the model description length).
Namely, L(:~'I) = L,,~o(~(:~I) + L>.,,.(:~I) + L~,(M) (2) We employ the %inary noun clustering method', in which k,, is fixed at IVt and we are to dechle whether k,~ -1 or k,,.
= 2, which is then to be applied recursiw~ly to the clusters thus obtained.
This is as if we view the noutls as entities a.nd the verbs as features and cluster the entities based on their feat.ures.
Since there are 2Pv'I subsets of the set of llottns .~, and for each 'binary' noun partition we have two different subsets (a special case of which is when one subset is A 'r and the other the empty set 0), the number of possible binary noml partitions is 2tAq/2 = 21~'l-J.
Thus for each I)inary noun partition we need log 21a"l-t = i3jI _ 1 bit.s 5 to describe it.

~L(M) depends on .';, but we will leave,5' implicit.

as 7 L,,~o<+~,s) = I~rl1 (3) Lpar(k~/), often referred to as the parallleter description length, is calculated by, L,,~,.(M) = 2 . log I,~'t (4) where ISl denotes the input data size, and/¢,.
\]c,,1 is the nnnlber of (free) parauleters ill tlle nlodel.
It is known that using log ~ = ~ bits to describe each of the parameters will (approximately) minimize the description length (1Rissanen, 1.989).
FinMly, Ld,t(M) is calculated by Ldat(M)=E f(n,v).logP(n,v) (5) (n,v)ES where f(n,,v) denotes the observed frequency of the noun verb pair (n,v), and P(n,v) the estimated probability of (n, v), which is calculated as follows.

With tile description length of a model defined in the above manner, we wish to select a model having the minimum description length and output it as the result of clustering.
Since the model description length Lmod is the same for each model, in practice we only need to calculate and compare L'(M) = L,,<,,.(M) + \];d<~,(M).
3.2 A
Sinllllated Annealing-based Algorithm We could ill principle calculate the description length for each model and select, a model with the nfininmm description length, if COlnputation time were of no concern.
However, since the number of probal)ilistic models under consideration is super exponential, this is not feasible in practice.
We employ the 'simulated a.m~ealing technique' to deal with this problem.
Figure 1 shows our (divisive) clustering algorithm s . 4 Advantages of Our Method In this section, we elaborate on the merits of our method.
In. statistical natural language processing, usually the number of parameters in a probabilistic 7The exact formulation of L,~od(M) is subjective, and it depends on the exact coding scheme used for the description of the models.
SAs we noted earlier, an Mternative would be to employ an agglomerative Mgorithm.
model to be estimated is very large, and therefore such a model is difficult to estimate with a reasonable data size that is available in practice.
(This problem is usually referred to as the 'data sparseness problem').
We could smooth the estimated probabilities using an existing smoothing technique (e.g., (Dagan el, al., 1992; Gale and Church, 1990)), then calculate some similarity measure using the smoothed probabilities, and then cluster words according to it.
There is no guarantee, however, that the employed smoothing method is in any way consistent with the clustering method used subsequently.
Our method based on MDL resolves this issue in a unified fashion.
By employing models that embody the assumption that words belonging to a same class occur in the same context with equal likelihood, our method achieves the smoothing effect as a side effect of the clustering process, where the domains of smoothing coincide with the classes obtained by clustering.
Thus, the coarseness or fineness of clustering also determines the degree of smoothing.
All of these effects fall out naturally as a corollary of the imperatiw? of 'best possible estimation', the original motivation behind the MDL principle.
in our simulated annealing algorithm, we could alternatively employ the Maxinmm Likelihood Estimator (MLE) as criterion for the best probabilistic model, instead of MDL.
MLE, as its name suggests, selects a model which maximizes the likelihood of the data, that is, /5 = a.rg maxp I-\[~¢s P(x).
This is equivalent to mininfizing the 'data description length' as defined in Section 3, i.e. i 5 = arg minp ~,~-~s log P(x).
We can see easily that MDL genet:al\[zes MLE, in that it also takes into account the complexity of the model itself.
In the presence of models with varying complexity, MLE tends to overfit the data, and output; a model that is too complex and tailored to fit the specifics of the input data.
If we employ MLE as criterion in our simulated annealing algorithm, it.
will result in selecting a very fine model with many small clusters, most of which will have probabilities estimated as zero.
Thus, in contrast to employing MDL, it will not have the effect of smoothing a.t all.
Purely as a method of estimation as well, the superiority of MI)L over MLE is supported by convincing theoretical findings (c.f.
(Barton and Cover, 1991; Yamanishi, 1992)).
For instance, the speed of convergence of the models selected by MDL to the true model is known to be near optiinal.
(The models selected by MDL converge to the true model approximately at the rate of 1/s where s is the nmnber of parameters in the true model, whereas for MLE the rate is l/t, where t is the size of the domain, or in our context, the total number of elements of N" x V).
'Consistency' is another desirable property of MDL, which is not shared by MLE.
That is, the number of parameAlgorithm: Clustering 1.

This is because in our disambiguation test we only need a.
thesaurus consisting of these 150 words.
We then applied the learning method proposed in (Li and Abe, 1995) to learn case fl'ame patterns with the constructed thesaurus as input using the same training data.
That is, we used it to learn the conditional distributions P( Classlll,erb, prep), P(Classe \[n, ounl, prep), where Class1 and Classe vary over the internal nodes in a certain 'cut' in the thesaurus tree l0 We then compare Table 1: PP-attachment disaml)iguation results Base Line Word-Based MI) L-Thesaurus MLE-Thesaurus WordNet Cowerage(%,) Accuracy(%) 100 70.:2 19.7 95.1 33.1 93.0 33.7 89.7 49.4 88.2 which are estimated based on the case fl'ame patterns, to determine the a.ttachment site of (prep, not*he).

Table 1 shows the results of our pp-attachment disambiguation experiment in terms of 'coverage' and 'accuracy'.

'WordBased', 'MLE-Thesaurus', and 'MDL-Thesaurus' respectively stand tbr using word-based estimates, using a thesaurus constructed by employing MLE, and using a thesaurus constructed by our method.
Note that the coverage of ~MDL-Thesaurus' signifiea.ntly outperformed that of 'Word-Based', while basically maintaining high accuracy (though it drops somewhat), indicating that using an automatically constructed thesaurus can improve disambiguation results in terms of coverage.
We also tested the method proposed in (Li and Abe, 1995) of learning case frames patterns using all existing thesaurus.
In particular, we used this method with WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) and using the same training data., and then conducted pp-attachment disambiguation experiment using the obtained case frame patterns.
We show the result of this experiment as 'WordNet' in Table 1.
We can see that in terms of 'coverage', ~WordNet' outperforms 'MDL-Thesaurus', but in terms of "accuracy', 'MDL-Thesaurus' outperforms 'WordNet.'.
These results can be interpreted as follows.
An automa.tically constructed thesaurus is more domaiu dependent and captures the domain dependent features better, and thus using it achieves high accuracy.
On the other hand, since training data.
we had available is insufficient, its coverage is smaller than that of a hand made thesaurus.
In practice, it makes sense to combine both types of thesauri.
More specifically, an atttomatically constructed thesaurus can be used within its coverage, and outside its coverage, a hand made thesaurus can be used.
Given the current state of the word clustering technique (namely, it requires data size that is usually not available, and it tends to be computationally demanding), this strategy is practical.
