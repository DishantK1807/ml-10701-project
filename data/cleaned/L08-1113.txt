<context>ntroduction In the recent years, the field of Question Answering (QA) has evolved considerably, bringing forth a number of highly interesting systems and methods such as (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001), (Dumais et al., 2002), (Hartrumpf, 2006), (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006), (Moldovan et al., 2007).

<context>rictedness and web-based search on German data, but it differs in that it is an adaptation of an original corpus-based system and uses a sophisticated semantic component. The widely known systems of (Dumais et al., 2002) and (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001) (both built for processing English) provided the basic motivation for the system presented here – (Dumais et al., 2002) in terms of mining data from the web, and (Pas</context>
<context> known by the system. 3.3. Search Engine As a search engine we use the Yahoo search engine and its API. This API allows us to restrict the number of answer snippets that are returned. As the work of (Dumais et al., 2002) shows, it is not advisable to use too many answer snippets – 200 was the optimal value for their system. Similarly, in our system, for every query, we currently use x = 200number of queries snippets</context>
<context>he words and phrases eligible as answer candidates as shown in Table 1. This strategy is more suitable for taking into account the greater syntactic variability of German, whereas the English AskMSR (Dumais et al., 2002) system relies mainly on the position of the answer candidate in the answer snippet. 3.5. Processing of Answer Candidates The answer candidates retrieved from the snippets are first filtered and then</context>
