Most research on single document summarization, particularly for domain independent tasks, uses sentence extraction to produce a summary (Lin and Hovy, 1997; Marcu, 1997; Salton et al., 1991).

We preprocess the similar sentences using an existing shallow parser (Collins, 1996) and a mapping to predicateargument structure.

A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text: statistical techniques based on word distribution (Salton et al., 1991), symbolic techniques based on discourse structure (Marcu, 1997), and semantic relations between words (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).

Ordering A property that is unique to multi-document summarization is the effect of time perspective (Radev and McKeown, 1998).
J98-3005
In order to construct a DSYNT we first run our sentences through Collin's robust, statistical parser (Collins, 1996).
P96-1025
(Jacquemin et al., 1997) investigated morphology-based paraphrasing in the context of a term recognition task.
