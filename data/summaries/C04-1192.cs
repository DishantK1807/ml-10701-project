We have addressed these questions in experiments involving sense clustering based on translation equivalents extracted from parallel corpora (Ide, 199; Ide et al., 2002).

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is wellknown as one of the more difficult problems in the field of natural language processing, as noted in (Gale et al, 1992; Kilgarriff, 1997; Ide and Véronis, 1998), and others.

In cases where we cannot fulfill these requirements, we rely on a “backoff” method involving sense clustering based on translation equivalents, as discussed in (Ide, et al., 2002).

To address the last problem, (Gale et al, 1992) argue for upper and lower bounds of precision when comparing automatically assigned sense labels with those assigned by human judges.
