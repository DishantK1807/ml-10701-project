As noted below, this representational ambiguity is of interest because we perform inference and data extraction directly upon propositionalized versions of these interpretations, with no need to scope quantifiers . Inference The inference module is a completely new addition to Alembic . It is built on top of a propositional database that stores propositionalized versions of the semantics of sentences . The database itself is coupled to a tractable inference mechanism (Vilain 1991, 1993) and to an equality reasoner based on congruence closure (McAllester 1989) . With respect to data extraction, the inference module performs two chief functions.

This phrase engenders the following propositions in the database : (business-venture bv2) "The joint venture" (has-name (IA2 c2)) apposition (company c2) "Bridgestone Sports Taiwan Co." 143 The definite reference is resolved to the phrase "a joint venture" from sentence 1, which corresponds to th e individual bv1 . The individuals bvl and bv2 are then equated, and the following is automatically inferred : (has-name (bvl c2)) Other facts known about le/2 are automatically propagated to bvl as well . Event and entity merging Event and entity merging approaches to discourse processing have gained significant visibility recently in ligh t of the success of systems with very fragmentary parsing, e.g., CIRCUS (Lehnert eb al 1992) or FASTUS (Appelt cr al 1993).

Complex argument attachment phenomena are thus encoded through complex syntactic categories, e .g., V/N/N (for ditransitive verbs such as "give") or V/S/N (for "tell" and simila r sentential complement verbs) . In contrast, modifier attachment is handled by providing rules specific to the particular modification phenomenon, as in standard phrase structure grammar . The temporal modifiers of a verb, for example, are handled through the following rule (not a schema) . V DATE V There are a number of advantages to this approach with respect to linguistic modeling . Beyond handling modifiers, Wittenburg (1987) used related strategies to project gapped constituents . From a computational perspective, however, the most important is that it makes the grammar entirely unaryor binary-branching . This is so because the syntactic phenomena that must traditionally be treated through greater-than-binary rules are typicall y complex argument structures—in our framework, these phenomena are handled through "stacked" functor categories, such as V/N/N .2 By relying on the binary-branching property of the grammar, we can thus simplify many aspects of our parser; we don't need to construct dotted rules, for example.

• System integration, through SGML (the Standard Generalized Markup Language), both at the leve l of meaning analysis and at the overall application level . ARCHITECTURE The system's underlying architecture, shown in Figure 1 overleaf, follows a by-now familiar task breakdown . Processing occurs in two main phases : preprocessing (in the elementizer module), which covers processes rangin g from document destructuring to simple parsing, and natural language analysis per se, including application-specifi c output generation . As with several other MUC systems, our use of an explicit pre-processing phase is directl y borrowed from work by Jacobs oral (1991).

That is, it builds a chart over which the parser will operate, and populates the chart with categories corresponding to either (1) ordinary lexical items in th e input stream, or (2) SGML elements identified by the elementizer (geographic terms, dates, and so forth) . The latter are handled by specializing the document manager's text processing protocol . <GEO> elements, for example, instantiate a prototypical geographical NP category into the chart (our categories are structured attribute valu e vectors with variables, i.e., standard unification-style DAGs (Shieber 1986 ; Pareschi &Steedman 1987)): [[syn :N] [bar-level 2] [scm [[head geo-region]]]] Non-SGML items are handled through a three-level lexicon . Our primary lexicon contains lexical items t o which is associated fine-grained information.

The proxy slot denotes a semantic individual which serves the role of an event instance in a partially Davidsonian scheme, as in (Hobbs 1985) or (Bayer d-Vilai n 1991).

Definite reference The definite reference mechanism incorporated into the MUC-5 version of the system is a drastic simplificatio n of the probabilistic mechanism we used in MUC-4 (Aberdeen 6-al 1992).

We use semantic structures derived from those in the King Kong NL interface (Bayer d Vilain 1991) ; these are in turn related to the "interpretation level" of Alshawi erVan Eijck (1989).

These modules perform all but one o f the functions described by Hobbs (1993) for his generic information extraction system—we omit the text filterin g phase.
