Our experience suggests that disjunctive LFs are an important capability, especially as one seeks to make grammars reusable across applications, and to employ domain-specific, sentence-level paraphrases (Barzilay and Lee, 2003).

The algorithm has been implemented as an extension to the OpenCCG hybrid symbolic/statistical realizer, and has recently been employed to generate n-best realization lists for reranking according to their predicted synthesis quality (Nakatsu and White, 2006), as well as to generate dialogues exhibiting individuality and alignment(Brockmann et al., 2005; Isard et al., 2005).

Prominent examples of surface realizers in the generate-and-select paradigm include Nitrogen/Halogen (Langkilde, 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002) and Fergus (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).

In anticipation of the present work, Foster and White (2004) generated disjunctive logical forms during sentence planning, then (as a stopgap measure) multiplied out the disjunctions and sequentially realized the top-level alternatives until an overall time limit was reached.

HLDS is a dependency-based approach to representing linguistic meaning developed by Baldridge and Kruijff (2002).

More recently, generate-and-select realizers in the chart realization tradition (Kay, 1996) have appeared, including the OpenCCG (White, 2004) and LinGO (Carroll and Oepen, 2005) realizers.
