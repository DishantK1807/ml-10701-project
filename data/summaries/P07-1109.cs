Unlike other algorithms presented here, the ALINE algorithm (Kondrak, 2000) operates in the phonetic, rather than the orthographic, domain.

In order to overcome this problem, we look to the bootstrapping method outlined in (Yarowsky, 1995).

Freeman et al.(2006) take the approach of manually encoding a great deal of language knowledge directly into their Arabic-English fuzzy matching algorithm.

3 Arabic-English Fuzzy String Matching In this section, we outline the fuzzy string matching algorithm proposed by Freeman et al.(2006). The algorithm is based on the standard Levenshtein distance approach, but encodes a great deal of knowledge about the relationships between English and Arabic letters.

This is meant to be a loose approximation of the “comparable” corpora used in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006).

Klementiev and Roth (2006) bootstrap with a perceptron and use temporal analysis to detect transliterations in comparable Russian-English news corpora.

Lee and Chang (2003) detect transliterations with a generative noisy channel transliteration model similar to the transducer presented in (Knight and Graehl, 1998).

Thus, we propose a bootstrapping approach (Yarowsky, 1995) to train the stochastic transducer iteratively as it extracts transliterations from a bitext.

It is structured as a cross-language named entity recognition task similar to those outlined in (Lee and Chang, 2003) and (Klementiev and Roth, 2006).

Models of machine transliteration such as those presented in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) or (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003) require a large set of sample transliterations to use for training.
