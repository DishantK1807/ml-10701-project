1 Introduction
In develot)ing a syst'em to find answers in text to user questions, we mmovered a major obstacle: Doemnent sentences t'hat contained answers dkl not of_ ten use the same expressions as the question.
While an:;wers in documents and questiolts llse terms that' are relat'e(l to each other, a system that sear(:hes for answers based on the quesl:ion wording will often fail.
3.b address t'his probleln, we develol)ed techniques to al,tomatically build a lexicon of associated terms t'hat can be used to hell) lind al)lIrol/riate bext' seglllent,s.
The mismatch })et'ween (tuestion an(l doctlttlent wording was I)rought home to us in an analysis of a testbed of question/answer l/airs.
\~Ze had a collection of newswire articles about the Clinton impeachment t'() use as a small-scale corl)uS fin' development of ;_t system.
V~Ze asked several l)eol)le to 1)ose questions about this well-known t'opic, but we (lid not make the corpus availal)le to our cont'ril)utors.
\~Ze wanted to avoid quest'ions that tracked t'he terminology in t'he corlms too (:losely to sinnllate quest'ions t'o a real-world syst'em.
The result was a set of questions that used language that' rarely nmtched t'he phrasing in the.
corl)us. \,Ve had expected t'hat' we would be able to make most of these lexical connections with the hel l) of V~rordnet (Miller, 1990).
For example, consider a simple quest'ion al)out testimony: "Did Secret Service agents give testimony about' Bill Clinton"?
There is no reason t'o expect that' the answer would appear 1)aldly st'ated as "Secret Service.
agents dkl testi(y "...
What we need to know is what' testimony is about', where it: occurs, who gives it.
The answer would lie likely to be found in a passage ment'ioning juries, or 1)roseeut'ors, like these tbund in our Clinton corl)uS: Starr immediately brought Secret Service employees before tim grand jury for questioning.
Prosecutors repeat'edly asked Secret Serviee 1)ersonnel to rel)eat' gossil) they may have heard.
Yet, tile V~ordnet synsets fbr "testinlony" offer: "evidence, assertion, averment alia asseveration," not a very hell)tiff selection here.
-Wordnet hypernyms become general quickly: "declarat'ion," "indicat'ion" and "inforlnation" are only one st, eli u 1) in t'lle hierarehy.
Following these does not lead us into a courtroom.
We asked our cont'ril)ut'ors for a second round of questions, but this time made the corpus available to them, exl)laining t'hat we wanted to be sure the answers were contained in t'he collection of articles.
'J'he result was a set of questions that' mueh more closely matched t'he wording in the corpus.
This was~ in t'aet, what' the 1999 DARPA question-answering (:oml)et'ition did in order t'o ensure that their questions couhl be answered (Singhal, 1!199).
The sectrod question-answering conference adopted a new approach to gathering questions and verifying separately that' they a.re answerable.
Our intuition is t'hat if we can lind the tyl)ical lexical neighborhoods of concept's, we can efficiently locate a concept described in a query or a question without needing to know the precise way the answer is phrased and without relying on a cost'ly, handbuilt concept' hierarchy.
The example above illustrat'es the 1)oint.
Testimony is given 1) 3, wit'nesses, defendant's, eyewitnesses.
It is solicited by 1)rosecutors, counsels, lawyers.
It is heard by judges, juries at trials, hearings, and recorded in depositions and transcripts.
What' we wanted was a complete description of t'he world of testimony the who, what, when and where of the word.
Or, in other words, the "metaaboutness" of terms.
To this end, we exl)erimented /tSitlg shallow linguist.k: techniques t'o gat'her and analyze word cooccurrence data in various configurat'ions.
Unlike previous collocation research, we were int'erested in an expansive set' of relationships between words 719 rather than a specific relationship.
More important, we felt that the information we needed could be derived from an analysis that crossed clause and sentence boundaries.
We hyl)othesized that news articles would be coherent so that the sequences of sentences and clauses would be linked conceptually.
We exanfined the nouns in a number of configurations paragraphs, sentences, clauses and sequences of clauses and obtained tile strongest results from configurations that count co-occurrences across the surface subjects of sequences of two to six clauses.
Exl)eriments with multi-clause configurations were generally more accurate in a variety of experiments.
In the next section, we briefly review related research.
In section 3 we describe our experiments.
In section 4, we discuss the problem of evaluation, and look ahead to future directions in the concluding sections.
2 Related
Work There has been a large body of work ill the collection of co-occurrence data from a broad spectrum of perspectives, fi'om information retrieval to the developnlent of statistical methods for investigating word similarity and classification.
Our efforts fall somewhere in tile middle.
Compared with document retrieval tasks, we are more closely focused on the words themselves and on specific concepts than on document "aboutness".
Jing and Croft (1994) exanfined words and phrases in paragraph units, and found that the association data improves retrieval performance.
Callan (1994) compared paragraph units and fixed windows of text in examining passage-level retrieval.
In the question-answering context, Morton (1999) collected document co-occurrence statistics to uncover 1)art-whole and synonymy relationships to use in a question-answering system.
The key difference here was that co-occurrence was considered on a whole-docmnent basis.
Harabagiu and Maiorano (1999) argued that indexing in question answering should be based on 1)aragraphs.
One recent al)proach to automatic lexicon building has used seed words to lmild up larger sets of semmltically similar words in one or nlore categories (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997).
In addition, Strzalkowski and Wang (1996) used a bootstrapping technique to identify types of references, and Riloff and Jones (1999) adapted bootstrapping techniques to lexicon building targeted to information extraction.
In the same vein, researchers at Brown University (Caraballo and Charniak, 1999)~ (Berland and Charniak, 1999), (Caraballo, 1999) and (Roark and Charniak, 1998) focused on target constructions, in particular complex noun t)hrases, and searched for information not only on identifying classes of nouns, lint also hypernyms, noun specificity and meronymy.
We have a diflbrent perspective than these lines of inquiry.
They were specifying various semantic relationships and seeking ways to collect similar pairs.
We. have a less restrictive focus and are relying on surface syntactic information about clauses.
For more than a decade, a variety of statistical techniques have been developed and refilled.
Tile focus of much of this work was to develop the methods themselves.
Church and Hanks (1989) explored tile use of mutual information statistics in ranking co-occurrences within five-word windows.
Smadja (1992) gathered co-occurrences within fiveword windows to find collocations, particularly in specific domains.
Hindle (1990) classified nouns on the basis of co-occurring patterns of subjectverb and verb-object pairs.
Hatzivassiloglou and MeKeown (1993) clustered adjectives into semantic classes, and Pereira et al.(1993) clustered nouns on their appearance ill verb-object pairs.
We are trying to be less restrictive in learning multiple salient relationshil)s between words rather than seeldng a particular relationship.
Ill a way, our idea is the mirror image of Barzilay and Elhadad (1997), who used Wordnet to identify lexical chains that would coincide with cohesive text segments.
We assunmd that documents are cohesive and that co-occurrence l)atterns call uncover word relationships.
3 Experiments
Tile focus of onr experiment was on units of text in which the constituents must fit together in order for the discourse to be coherent.
We made the assumption that the documents in our corpus were coherent and reasoned that if we had enough text, covering a broad range of topics, we could pick out domainindependent associations.
For example, testimony can be about virtually anything, since anything can wind up in a court dispute.
But over a large enough collection of text, the terms that directly relate to tile "who," "what" and "where" of testimony per se should appear in segments with testimony more frequently than chance.
These associations do not necessarily appear in a dictionary or thesaurus.
When huntans explain all unfamiliar word, they often use scenarios and analogies.
We divided the experiments in two groups: one group that looks at co-occurrences within a single unit, and another that looks at a sequence of units.
In the first group of experinmnts, we considered paragraphs, sentences and clauses, each with and without prepositional phrases.
• Single paragraphs with/without PP • Single sentences with/without PP • Single clauses with/without PP 720 \]in the second group, we considered two clauses and sequences of subject 110un phrases from two to six chmses.
Ill this group, we had:,, Two clauses with/without Pl),, A sequence of subject NPs fl'onl 2 clauses A sequence of subject NPs Dora 3 clauses,, A sequence of subject NPs from 4 clauses • A sequence of subject NPs fi'om 5 clauses,, A sequence of subject NPs from 6 clauses The intuition for the second groul) is that a topic flows from one granmm.tical unit to another so that the salient nouns, l)articularly the surface subjects, in successive clauses should reveal the associations we are seeldng.
'\[lo illustrate the method, consider the three-clause configuration: Say that ~vordi apl)ears in clausc,~.
We maintain a table of all word pairs and increment the entries for O,,o,'(h, ',,,o,'d~ ), where,,0,% is a subject noun in cla'usc,~, clauscn+~, or ell'use,+2.
No effort was made to resolve pronomial references, and these were skipped.
We used nollnS Olfly' because l)reliminary tests showed that pairings between nouns seemed to stand out.
V~Te included tokens that were tagged as 1)roper nallleS when they also have have conlnlon nleanings.
For example, consider the Linguistic Data Consorl;ium at the University of Pennsylvania.
Data, Consortium and University wouM be on tile list used to build the table of nmtchul)s with other nouns, \])lit l)emlsylvania would not.
V~To also collected noun modifiers as well as head nouns as they can carry more information than the surface heads, such as "business group", '".science class" or "crinm scene".
The corpus consisted of all tile general-interest articles from the New York Tinms newswire in 1996 in the North American News Corlms, and (lid not include either st)orts or l)usiness news.
We tirst removed dul)licate articles.
The data fl'om 1996 was too slmrse for the sequence-of-subjects contiguralions.
'\]'o l)alance the expcrinmnts better, we added another year's worth of newswire articles, from 1995, tbr the sequence-of subject configurations so that we had more than one million matchups for each configuration (Table 1).
The I)roeess is flflly automatic, requiring no su1)ervision or training examples.
The corpus was tagged with a decision-tree tagger (Schmid, 1994) and parsed with a finite-state parser (Abney, 1996) using a specially written context-fi'ee-grannnar that focused on locating clause boundaries.
The grammar also identified extended noun l)hrases in tile subject position, verb l)hrases and other noun l)hrases and prepositional 1)hrases.
The nouns in the tagged, parsed corl)uS were reduced to their syntactic roots (removing l)lurals from nouns) with a lookup table created t'rom Wordnet (Miller, 1990) and CELEX (1995).
We. performed this last step mainly to address the sparse data problem.
There were a substantial nunfl)er of paMngs that occurred only once.
We elinfinated from considerat;ion all such singletons, although it did not al)peal to have much etfect on the overall outcome.

The total number of words was 57 million.
Table 2 shows the nmnl)er of distinct nouns.

44,400 53,900 30,800 Td)le 2: Distinct Nouns, 1996 Data To score the nmtchups in our initial exlmriments, we used the Dice Coeliicient, which l)roduces values i'ronl 0 to 1, to measure the association between pairs of words and then produced an ordered association list fl'om the co-occurrence table, ranked according to the scores of the entries.
2 • f,'~q(wo,.,h n,oo,%) score,, = frcq(wordi) + frcq(wordj) One 1)roblem was immediately a l)parent: The quality of tile association lists wxried greatly.
Tile scoring was doing an acceptable job in ranking the words within each list, but tile scores varied greatly from one list to another.
Our initial strategy was to choose a cutoff, which we set at 21 tbr each list, and we tried several alternatives to weed out weak associations.
721 In one method, we filtered the association lists by cross-referencing, removing from the association list for wordi any wordj that failed to reciprocate and to give a high rank to wordi on its association list.
Another similar approach was to try to con> bine evidence fl'om different experiments by taking the results fl'om two configurations into consideration.
A third strategy was to calculate the mutual information between the target word and the other words on its association list.
scorc,,i = p(xy) * log \p(z)p(y) (p(xy) ) Using the mutual information computation provided an way of using a single measure that was able to compare matchups across lists.
We set a threshold of lxl.0 -6 for all matchups.
Thus these association lists vary in length, depending on the distributions for the words, allowing them to grow up to 40, while some ended up with only one or two words.
4 Evaluation
The evaluation of a system like ours is problematic.
The judgments we made to determine correctness were not only highly subjective but time-consunfing.
We had 12 large lexicons fl'om the different configurations.
We had chosen a random sample of 10 percent of the 2,700 words that occurred at least 100 times in tile corpus, and manually constructed an answer key, which ended up with ahnost 30,000 entries.
From the resulting 270 words, we discarded 15 of those that coincided with common names of people, such as "carter," which could refer to the former American president, Chris Carter (creator of tile television show "X-Files"), among others.
We thought it better to delay making decisions on how to handle such cases, especially since it would require distinguishing one Carter fl'om another.
Such words presented several difficulties.
Unless the individuals involved were well-known, it was often impossible to distinguish whether the system was making errors or whether the resulting descriptive terms were intbrmative.
Tables 3 and 4 show an example from the answer key tbr the word "faculty".
The overall results from the first stage of the process, before the cross-referencing filter are shown in Table 5, ranging from 73% to 80% correct.
The configurations that included prepositional phrases and those that used sequences of subject noun phrases outperformed the configurations that relied on suhjects and objects in a single grammatical unit.
These differences were statistically significant, with p < 0.01 in all eases.
The overall results after cross-referencing, in Table 6, showed improvements of 5 to 10 percentage enrollment hiring adnfinistrator journalism alumnus student school union math engineering curriculum trustee group seminar thesis tenure stair department mathematician educator member ivy arts college chancellor report senate activism university el,airman professor teaching law regent doctorate mtministration academic committee semester board camI)us undergraduate salary council research president adviser mathematics course advisor sociology dean study science teacher cannon provost vote Table 3: Answer Key for Faculty: OK load tratllcway unrest architecture diversity hurdle shield minority revision disburse percent woman clement Table 4: Answer Key ff)r Faculty: Wrong points, while the effect of the number of matchups was diminished.
Here, the subject-sequence configurations showed a distinct advantage.
While more noise might be expected when a large segment of text; is considered, these results support the notion that the nnderlying coherence of a discourse can be recovered with the prol)er selection of linguistic features.
The improvements in each configuration over the corresponding configuration in the first stage were all statistically significant, with p < 0.01.
Likewise, the edge the sequence-of subjects configurations had over tile other configurations, was also statistically significant.
The results fl'om combining the evidence from different configurations, in Table 7, showed a much higher accnrae> but a sharp drop in the total nnmber of associated words found.
The most fl'uitful pairs of experiments were those that combined distinct approaches, for example, tile five-subject configuration with either fifll paragraphs or with sentences with prepositional phrases.
It will remain unclear until we conduct a task-based evaluation whether the smaller number of associations will be harnfful.
The final experiment, computing the mutual information statistic tbr the matchul)s of a key word with co-occurring words was perhaps the most illteresting because it gave us the ability to apply a 722 (Jontig OK Wrong l)ct OK Para +l/l) 3832 1054 78,qent 3773 1270 75 Sent +Pl) 3973 1070 79 \] Clause 3652 1371 73 \] Clauses q-l)l) 3935 1108 78 "!

While the accuracies in most of the configurations were close to one another, those that used only sing\]e units tended to be weaker than the multi-clause units.
Note that the paragraI)h contiguration was tested with far more data than any of the others.
Our system maD~s no eth)rt to aeCOllnt for lexical aml)iguil;y.
The uses we intend for our lexicon should provide some insulation from the ett'ects of polysemy, since searches will be conducted on a nun> l)er of terms, which should converge to one meaning.
It is clear that in lists for key words with multiple senses, the donfinant sense where there is one, al)pears much lnore frequently, such as "faculty," where the meaning of "teacher" is more t:'re(tuent than the meaning of "al)ility".

5 Conclusion
Our results are encouraging.
We were able to decipher a broad type of word association, and showed that our method of searching sequences of subjects outperformed the snore traditional approaches in finding collocations.
We believe we can use tiffs technique to build a large-scale lexicon to help in difficult information retrieval and information extraction tasks like question answering.
The most interesting aspect of" this work lies in the system's ability to look across several clauses and strengthen tile connections between associated words.
We are able to deal with input that contains numerous errors from the tagging and shallow parsing processes.
Local context has been studied extensively in recent years with sophisticated statistical tools and the availability of enormous amounts of text in digital form.
Perhaps we can expand this perspective to look at a window of perhaps several sentences by extracting the correct linguistic units in order to explore a large range of language processing problems.

6 Future
Work • We will have the scoring key itself evaluated by people who are not involved in tile research.
• ~re are planning to conduct task-based evaluation in question answering.
• We are considering deploying a named entity module to provide sonic classification of which proper nouns should be counted and which should not.
• We 1)lan to experiment with ways to incorporate using examining verbs and making use of surface objects in the configurations with sequences of clauses, as well as strengthen the finite state grammar.
• We will explore using tile system to extract biographic information.
