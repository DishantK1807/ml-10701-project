Such charts can be computed efficiently (Koller and Thater, 2005b) from a dominance graph, and can also be used to compute the configurations of a graph efficiently.

Fuchss et al.(2004) have presented a corpus study that strongly suggests that all dominance graphs that are generated by current largescale grammars are (or should be) hnc.

Rather, we will use dominance charts (Koller and Thater, 2005b) as our USRs: they are more explicit USRs, which support a more finegrained deletion of reading sets than graphs.
P05-3003
Hnc graphs are equivalent to chain-connected dominance constraints (Koller et al., 2003), and areclosely relatedto dominance nets (Niehrenand Thater, 2003).

It is an improvement over earlier algorithms for enumerating irredundant readings (Vestre, 1991; Chaves, 2003) in that it maintains underspecifiedness; note that these earlier papersnevermadeanyclaimswithrespectto,orevaluated, completeness.

Resources. The experiments are based on the Rondane corpus, a Redwoods (Oepen et al., 2002) style corpus which is distributed with the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2002).

The particular USRs we workwithareunderspecifiedchartrepresentations, which can be computed from dominance graphs (or USRs in some other underspecification formalisms) efficiently (Koller and Thater, 2005b).
P05-3003
There has been previous research on enumerating only some representatives of each equivalence class (Vestre, 1991; Chaves, 2003), but these approaches donâ€™t maintain underspecification: After running their algorithms, they are left with a set of readings rather than an underspecified representation, i.e. we could no longer run other algorithms on an USR.

The MRS representations are translated into dominance graphs using the open-source utool tool (Koller and Thater, 2005a), which is restricted to MRS representations whose translations are hnc.

and are small in practice (see (Koller and Thater, 2005b) for an analysis).

This simplifies semantics construction, and current algorithms support the efficient enumeration of the individual semantic representations from an USR (Koller and Thater, 2005b).
