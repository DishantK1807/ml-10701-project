Pereira and Warren (1983) showed that the steps of the Earley Deduction proof procedure proving the well-formedness of a string S from the standard 'top-down' definite clause grammar (DCG) axiomatization of a contextfree grammar (CFG) G correspond directly to those of Earley's algorithm recognizing S using G.

Memoization is a standard technique for avoiding redundant computation, and as Norvig (1991) noted, it can be applied to top-down recognizers to convert exponentialtime recognizers into polynomial-time recognizers.

Thus given a CPS formalization of the parsing problem and an appropriate memoization technique, it is in fact the case that "the maintenance of well-formed substring tables or charts can be seen as a special case of a more general technique: memoization" (Norvig 1991), even if the grammar contains left recursion.

Introduction In a paper published in this journal, Norvig (1991) pointed out that memoization of a top-down recognizer program produces a program that behaves similiarly to a chart parser.
