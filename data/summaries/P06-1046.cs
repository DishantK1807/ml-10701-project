The frequency statistics were weighted using mutual information, as in Ravichandran et al.(2005): log( p(w,r,w prime) p(w,, )p(,r,wprime)) (10) PLEB used the values q = 500 and B = 100.

It was used by Ravichandran et al.(2005) to improve the efficiency of distributional similarity calculations.
P05-1077
Gorman and Curran (2005a; 2005b) found the performance of SASH for distributional similarity could be improved by replacing the initial random ordering with a frequency based ordering.
W05-1011
Curran and Moens (2002) introduces a vector of canonical attributes (of bounded length k m), selected from the full vector, to represent the term.
W02-0908
For SASH we take optimal values of p = 4 and c = 16 and use the folded ordering taking M = 1000 from Gorman and Curran (2005b).
W05-1011
When the cut-off was increased to 100, as used by Ravichandran et al.(2005), the results improved significantly.
P05-1077
Curran and Moens (2002) show that synonymy extraction for lexical semantic resources using distributional similarity produces continuing gains in accuracy as the volume of input data increases.

Comparisons made with these low frequency terms are unreliable (Curran and Moens, 2002).

Charikar (2002) proposed an approximation of the cosine measure using random hyperplanes Ravichandran et al.(2005) used this cosine variant and showed it to produce over 70% accuracy in extracting synonyms when compared against Pantel and Lin (2002).
