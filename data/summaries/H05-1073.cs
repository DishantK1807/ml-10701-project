(Wiebe et al, 2004), measuring strength of subjective clauses (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004), determining word polarity (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) or textsâ€™ attitudinal valence, e.g.

We explore two cases of flat classification, using a variation of the Winnow update rule implemented in the SNoW learning architecture (Carlson et al., 1999),1 which learns a linear classifier in feature space, and has been successful in several NLP applications, e.g. semantic role labeling (Koomen, Punyakanok, Roth and Yih, 2005).

Finally, as further discussed in section 6, the hierarchical case of label assignment requires a sequen580 tial model that further defines levels of coarse versus fine-grained classifiers, as done by (Li and Roth, 2002) for the question classification problem.

Thus, we are planning on exploring degrees of emotional intensity in a learning scenario, i.e. a problem similar to measuring strength of opinion clauses (Wilson, Wiebe and Hwa, 2004).

(Scherer, 2003), (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), this appears not to be the case for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS).

Sequential modeling of simple classifiers has been successfully employed to question classification, for example by (Li and Roth, 2002).
