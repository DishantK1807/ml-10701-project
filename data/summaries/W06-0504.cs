A similar task has been approached in a variety of perspectives, including term clustering (Lin, 1998 and Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004) and term categorization (Avancini et al.2003). A rather different task is Ontology Learning, where new concepts and relations are supposed to be acquired, with the consequence of changing the definition of the Ontology itself (Velardi et al.2005). However, since mentions have been introduced as an evolution of the traditional Named Entity Recognition task (see Tanev and Magnini, 2006), they guarantee a reasonable level of difficulty, which makes OPTM challenging both for the Computational Linguistic side and the Knowledge Representation community.
