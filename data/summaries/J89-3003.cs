The local references can be accounted for by singular translation rules, which we discuss in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).
C86-1086
The context variable is introduced into the translation of a definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such as "the," by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).
C86-1086
In Strzalkowski (1986) and Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) we introduced a rigorous method for handling certain cases of extrasentential dependencies in discourse, within a general framework, which we call the Stratified Model.
C86-1086
These rules, and perhaps some others yet to be developed, create a natural expansion of tlhe system for computing intersentential anaphoric references described in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).
C86-1086
A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).
C86-1086
In addition, the enormous complexity of any non-trivial system of possible worlds has proven to be disadvantageous for developing a computationally oriented application of Montague's theory (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).

10. Before a translation rule like one of these presented in this paper can be used, a sentence must undergo numerous transformations within the Stratified Model (Strzalkowski 1986).
C86-1086
In any practical application, this transformation must be accompanied by a pragmatic process, as described in Strzalkowski (1986).
C86-1086
In this case, the second sentence of the fragment obtains the full translation with the following formula: must(3x \[gir/(x) & princess(x) & marries(J,x) & rich(x) & pretty(x) & Vy \[{girl(y) & princess(y) & marries(J,y)} D (x=y)\]\]) Other studied cases of intersentential anaphora (see Strzalkowski 1986a-c, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986) include non-referential interpretation of discourse fragments involving attitude report verbs (believe, know, disagree).
C86-1086
13. This approach to representing non-singular concepts contributes to the transformation Fn_ 1 of the Stratified Model; see Strzalkowski (1986).
C86-1086
The more general theory of stratified meaning representation (Strzalkowski 1986) addresses all of these concerns, as well as the problems of discourse coherence, selecting proper cohesive links in discourse, and building a discourse model.
C86-1086
The problem is discussed at a great length in Strzalkowski (1986).
C86-1086
This intersentential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2, which operates on the literal translations of both sentences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).
C86-1086
8. A detailed discussion on how to produce such translations can be found in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) and Strzalkowski (1986).
