Several promising methods are proposed by previous researchers, in which Maximum Entropy (ME) model has turned out to be a successful way for this task (Hwee Tou Ng et al., 2004; Jin Kiat Low et al., 2005).

In ME model, the following features (Jin Kiat Low et al., 2005) are selected: a) cn (n = −2,−1,0,1,2) b) cncn+1 (n = −2,−1,0,1) c) c−1c+1 where cn indicates the character in the left or right position n relative to the current character c0.

Entropy Model The ME model used in our system is based on the previous works (Jin Kiat Low et al., 2005; Hwee Tou Ng et al., 2004).
