Some examples of language reuse include collocation analysis (Smadja, 1993), the use of entire factual sentences extracted from corpora (e.g., "'Toy Story' is the Academy Award winning animated film developed by Pixar~'), and summarization using sentence extraction (Paice, 1990; Kupiec et al., 1995).
J93-1007
Profiles for a large number of entities were compiled using our earlier system, PROFILE (Radev and McKeown, 1997).
A97-1033
We intend to use PROFILE to improve lexical choice in the summary generation component, especially when producing user-centered summaries or summary updates (Radev and McKeown, 1998 to appear).
