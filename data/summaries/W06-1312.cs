A third criterion is that they should have some (theoretical) relation to the particular discourse structure we work with (Teufel, 1999).

This is comparable to aggreement on other discourse annotation tasks such as dialogue act parsing and Argumentative Zoning (Teufel et al., 1999).

7Following Carletta (1996), we measure agreement in Kappa, which follows the formula K = P(A)−P(E)1−P(E) where P(A) is observed, and P(E) expected agreement.

Work on applying machine learning techniques for automatic citation classi cation is currently underway (Teufel et al., 2006); the agreement of one annotator and the system is currently K=.57, leaving plenty of room for improvement in comparison with the human annotation results presented here.

In fact, studies from our annotated corpus (Teufel, 1999), show that 69% of the 600 sentences stating contrast with other work and 21% of the 246 sentences stating research continuation with other work do not contain the corresponding citation; the citation is found in preceding 1CiteSeer automatically citation-indexes all scienti c articles reached by a web-crawler, making them available to searchers via authors or keywords in the title.
E99-1015
The citation processor developped in our group (Ritchie et al., 2006) achieves high accuracy for this task (96% of citations recognized, provided the reference list was error-free).
