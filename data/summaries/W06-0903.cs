Past and ongoing related research work has largely focused on the identification and tagging of temporal expressions, with the creation of tagging methodologies such as TimeML/TIMEX (Gaizauskas and Setzer, 2002; Pustejovsky et al., 2003; Ferro et al., 2004), TDRL (Aramburu and Berlanga, 1998) and their associated evaluations such as the ACE TERN competition (Sundheim et al.2004). Temporal analysis has also been applied in Question-Answering systems (Pustejovsky et al., 2004; Schilder and Habel, 2003; Prager et al., 2003), email classification (Kiritchenko et al., 2004), aiding the precision of Information Retrieval results (Berlanga et al., 2001), document summarisation (Mani and Wilson, 2000), time stamping of event clauses (Filatova and Hovy, 2001), temporal ordering of events (Mani et al., 2003) and temporal reasoning from text (Boguraev and Ando, 2005; Moldovan et al., 2005).

Similar applications have so far been largely confined to authorship identification, such as (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Fung, 2003) and the identification of association rules (Yarowsky, 1994; Silverstein et al., 1997).
