Third, Cahill 1990 posed the critical question, viz., how is one to link the work in lexical inheritance (on morphotactics) with that in finitestate morphology (on allomorphy).
C90-3009
Cahill 1993 goes on to experiment with assuming all of the allomorphic specification into the lexicon, in just the spirit proposed here.

144 are restricted in nonphonological ways, applying only to certain word classes, so that some stems admit idiosyncratic exceptions with respect to the applicability of rules (see Bear 1988, Emele 1988, Trost 1991)• To overcome the first difficulty, a number of researchers have suggested augmenting FA with "word grammars", expressed in terms of feature formalisms like PATR II (Bear 1986) or HPSG (Trost 1990).

One symptom of the problem is seen in the treatment of nonphonologically conditioned allomorphy, such as German umlaut, which (Trost 1990) correctly criticizes as ad hoc in finite-state morphology because the latter deals only in phonological (or graphemic) categories.

The different forms of the suffix in 2nd person singular in (1) are predictable given the phonological shape of the stem, and the alternations can be described by the following (simplified) two-level rules (we have abstracted away from inessential restrictions here, e.g., that (strong) verbs with i/e-umlaut do not show epenthesis): rTzoukermann and Libermann 1990 show that multiplying paradigms need not degrade performance, however.

Second, researchers at Edinburgh (Calder 1988, Bird 1992) first suggested using FDLs in phonological and morphological description, and Bird 1992 suggests describing FA in FDL (without showing how they might be so characterized, however--in particular, providing no FDL definition of what it means for an FA to accept a string).

Reinhard and Gibbon 1991 for another sort of DATR-based allomorphy Gerdemann 1993) and phonology (Bird 1992) have been taken.
