In this section we consider two existing grammars: the XTAG grammar, a widecoverage LTAG, and the LEXSYS grammar, a widecoverage D-Tree Substitution Grammar (Rambow et al., 1995).

Therefore, various 'quasi-destructive' algorithms (Karttunen, 1986; Kogure, 1990; Tomabechi, 1991) and algorithms using 'skeletal' DACS with updates (Pereira, 1985; Emele, 1991) have been proposed, which attempt to minimize copying.

One of the most basic properties of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGS) is that they have an extended domain of locality (EDOL) (Joshi, 1994).

However, the problem of grammar size in TAG has to some extent been addressed both with respect to grammar encoding (Evans et al., 1995; Candito, 1996) and parsing (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994; Evans and Weir, 1998).

But even with good implementations of the best of these improved algorithms, parsers designed for wide-coverage unification-based phrase-structure grammars using large HPSG-style feature graphs spend around 85-90% of their time unifying and copying feature structures (Tomabechi, 1991), and may allocate in the region of 1-2 Mbytes memory while parsing sentences of only eight words or so (Flickinger, p.c.).
