There are several variations of this method that produce the same effect (Beesley, 1998d), with different penalties in the size of the resulting transducer or in the performance; but in the end the constraint of discontiguous dependencies is easily accomplished using finite-state techniques.

Johnson (1972) demonstrated that rewrite-rules, as used by linguists, had only finite-state power and could be implemented as finite-state transducers; this important result, unfortunately overlooked at the time and later rediscovered by Kaplan and Kay (1981) (see also Kaplan and Kay (1994)) is a key mathematical foundation for finite-state morphology and phonology.

If such generalization of vocalization appears tenuous, the alternative is simply to keep the vowels in the patterns, resulting in a two-way intersection of roots and patterns (Harris, 1941; Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988).
C88-1064
patterns are allowed to contain non-radical consonants, as in the analyses of Harris (1941) and Hudson (1986), then the definitions must be complicated slightly to prevent radicals from intersecting with the nonradical consonants (Beesley, 1998b).

For a different formalization of this and other models proposed by McCarthy, but using techniques that go beyond finite-state power, see Kiraz (1996).

Kataja and Koskenniemi (1988) were apparently the first to understand that concatenating languages were just a special case; they showed that by generalizing lexicography to allow regular expressions, Semitic (specifically Akkadian) roots and patterns could denote regular languages, and that stems could be computed as the intersection of these regular languages.

Consonant spreading, as in Form IX and Form XII, and biliteral roots also use the morphophonemic X symbol (Beesley, 1998c).

plus higherlevel shorthand languages such as lexc (Karttunen, 1993), twolc (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) and Replace Rules (Karttunen, 1995; Karttunen and Kempe, 1995; Karttunen, 1996).

The key insight and claim of the finite-state approach to morphology (Karttunen, 1991; Karttunen et al., 1992; Karttunen, 1994)is that both morphotactics and variation grammars can be written as regular expressions, which are compiled and implemented on computers as finite-state automata.

In 1989, Lauri Karttunen (personal communication) also proposed and demonstrated in an Interlisp script the intersection of roots, patterns and vocalizations as an alternative to the finite-state solution of (Kay, 1987), which used a four-tape finite-state transducer transducer.

Other vocalizations are defined similarly: 53 define PerfActive \[a*\]/\V ; define PerfPassive \[u* i\]/\V ; define ImperfPassive \[u a*\]/\V ; Given the definitions above, xfst will evaluate the expressions on the left below, indicating the intersection of a root, a pattern and a vocalization, and return a language consisting of the single string on the right, an interdigitated but still morphophonemic stem (Beesley, 1998a).
