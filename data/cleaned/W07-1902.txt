c©2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Aiduti in Japanese Multi-party Design Conversations Yasuhiro Katagiri Future University Hakodate 116-2 Kameda-Nakano Hakodate Hokkaido, Japan katagiri@fun.ac.jp Abstract Japanese backchannel utterances, aizuti, in a multi-party design conversation were examined, and aizuti functions were analyzed in comparison with its functions in twoparty dialogues.
In addition to the two major functions, signaling acknowledgment and turn-management, it was argued that aizuti in multi-party conversations are involved in joint construction of design plans through management of the ﬂoor structure, and display of participants’ readiness to engage in collaborative elaboration of jointly constructed proposals.
1 Introduction
Backchannel utterances are one of the representative phenomena characterizing conversational interactions.
We can ﬁnd backchannel utterances in every natural conversation in every culture.
Different languages have different repertoire of expressions that work as backchannels.
In terms of what functions they serve in conversations, it has widely been acknowledged that backchannels, by conveying the hearer feedback to the speaker, serve to contribute to informational coordination between conversational participants, through conversational ﬂow management in terms of both common grounding and smooth turn-taking.
It has also been acknowledged, perhaps less explicitly, that backchannels serve to contribute to affective coordination by promoting rapport between conversational participants.
It is still unclear how these two contrasting views on backchannels can be integrated.
How are the informational and the affective coordination functions of backchannels inter-related?
What factors determine relative salience of these two functions in certain usage of backchannels?
Are there any categories of conversational interactions that promote one or the other functions?
Are there cultural differences in backchannel usages?
We focus, in this paper, on the use of Japanese backchannels, aiduti, in multi-party conversations.
Based on the analysis of how aiduti utterances are employed in experimentally captured multi-party design conversation data, we argue that aiduti utterances in Japanese have, on top of the informational coordination functions of common-grounding andturn-management,thefunctionofexpressingthe readiness, a positive attitude, on the part of a participant to engage in the joint construction of an ongoing proposal currently under discussion, which then leads to affective coordination.
2 Backchannels
in Dialogues Backchannel utterances were conceived initially in two-party dialogues with one speaker and one hearer.
Schegloff (1982) picked up hearer’s short utterances such as ’uh, huh’ produced in response to the speaker’s main utterances, and characterized them as backchannels, whose functions are to convey backward messages from the hearer to the speaker indicating that the hearer is attending to, listening to, understanding, and expecting to continue the production of the speaker’s main message.
Heritage (2006) provides a broader conception of backchannels and lists the following four functions 9 Figure 1: Meeting archiver equipment MARC used in data collection for backchannel utterances.
• Provide Acknowledgments to prior locutions by the speaker • Projection of further talk in turn taking • Recipient epistemic states triggered by the speaker’s message • Recipient afﬁliative attitude, how the recipient is aligned with speaker’s message Maynard (1986) compared Japanese and American dialogues, and observed that Japanese dialogues have almost twice as much aizuti as American backchannel utterances.
This observation suggests that signiﬁcance of backchannels and their functions in conversational interactions may depend on social groups, types of activities and other social or task related parameters.
3 Multi-party Conversation 3.1 Varieties of multi-party conversations WewillfocusonaidutiutterancesinJapanesemultiparty design conversations.
In order to locate the type of activity we’ve been working on within the broad range of interaction activities collectively categorized as multi-party conversations, we ﬁrst try to list up potential parameters that might inﬂuence the Figure2: Settingformulti-partydesignconversation capture structure and organization of conversational interactions.
Number of participants We call a conversation between more than two people a multi-party conversation.
A conversation between three people and a conversation between 10 people are not the same in their conversational organization.
It has been observed (Fay et al., 2000) that conversations with a small number of participants tend to be homogeneous that contain a number of equal status pairwise interactions, whereas conversations with a large number of participants tend to be more hierarchical with a central control person working as a chairperson.
Types of activities Conversationalinteractionsareoftenembeddedin largeractivities,andthetypeofembeddingactivities makes a difference in the organization of conversations.
(a) Purpose One-way information transfer in lectures and joint problem solving in a group of people have both ﬁxed but different types of goals.
When people chat for socialization, having a conversation itself becomes its own purpose.
These different types of goals could produce different organizational structures in conversations.
(b) Rigidity of purpose Even within joint problem solving activities, 10 Sp Utterance Sp Utterance D: �� B: O� (un) D: fw3q�!QsMt`o��loo C: oMOTS �/�qMOT (D � ) {w D: �������U :fw�O x�oh� C: (laugh) (I often think that even when you keep using the same mobile carrier, if you could have one more mail address,) C: sgqpbv������ �`�Oqb�q E: O�O�O� (un-un-un) (when I try to correspond by mail with elderly, eh, with my parents) D: MMsKqT E: O�O� (un-un) (it would be nice) B: O� (un) D: ����ilh�MX�p� E: O� (un) (with PC, any number of addresses) C: �K x :'osM�pb :�v F: O�O� (un-un) (parents cannot type) E: KK :KxMxMxMxM (aa-aa,hai-hai-hai-hai) B: O� (un) D: �o�a�sMpbT E: O� (un) (you can have) C: p���xpV� F: (D �� ) (but, they can talk on the phone) B: O� (un): B: O� (un) C: O� (un) E: O�O� (un-un) D: KfOMOwx C: p�Kw :�� �pV�y���p��hMq E: O� (un) (but, when you’d rather want to use mails, if possible) D: I`Msq�M�b� E: O�O�O� (un-un-un) (I would deﬁnitely want one) B: O� (un) B: O� (un): C: MO �� E: (D ��� ) F: O� (un) E: ����� � :lo\qpb�v C: �Qy : (You mean, multiple mail addresses, right)?

In one extreme lies a pursuit of a ﬁxed goal such as mathematical problem solving, in which a problem with a clearly determined answer is given to the group.
In other extreme lies a problem solving under a loosely stated goal such as ﬂoor planning of an apartment for the group, in which the only requirement is to reach an agreement, and factors to consider must be made explicit in the course of conversation.
The design conversation we’ve looked at belong to the latter category.
(c) Reality Every experimental data collection has to face this problem.
Whether or not and how much the outcome of the conversation has real import in participants’ life makes a big difference in conversational organization.
(d) Use of objects Use of physical objects, particularly informational artifact such as whiteboard and projectors, changes the use pattern of multi-modal signals: gaze, gestures and body postures, and needs to be taken into account in experimental data collection.
Characteristics of participants (a) Participant properties Differences in capabilities such as in knowledge and in expertise, and dispositional properties, such as preferences, beliefs, and personalities of participants greatly contribute to shape the interaction.
(b) Participant roles 11 Start -End Sp Utterances 243.1950-243.7450 F: are-wo (that) 244.2075-246.1200 F: tatoeba keitai-wo nakusita toki-no sono (when you lose your mobile phone) 246.6300-247.9800 F: timei-tekina doai-wa (how fatal it will be) 248.2725-248.8850 F: nn daibu (big) 248.7550-249.7350 B: un: 249.3000-250.0200 E: un: 249.5150-249.8225 D: un: 250.1250-254.8225 F: un:are ikko otosityattara ironna houmen-no raihu-rainga soredakede tataretyautte iunoga atte (if you lose one, your life line will be cut out in a lot of ways) Figure 4: Aiduti overlap Conversation setting often dictates certain role assignment to each participant, which in turn determines the shape of interactions that takes place between people under those participant roles.
Instructorandfollowerininstructiongiving tasks, and clerk and customer in commercial transactions are typical examples.
The role ofchairpersonalsoissigniﬁcantindetermining the structure of conversations.
(c) Participant relationships Age and social status often provide a ﬁxed base for dominance relationship among conversational participants.
Afﬁliative familiarity between participants are less ﬁxed but still stable relationships.
Sharing of opinions is temporary and can change quite quickly during the course of a conversation.
3.2 Multi-party design conversation We have been collecting data on multi-party design conversation in Japanese.
Multi-party design conversationisatypeofjointproblemsolvingconversation, in which participants engage in a discussion to come up with an agreement on the ﬁnal design plan.
Thedesigngoal, however, isonlypartiallyspeciﬁed, and participants need to jointly decide on evaluative criteria for the design goal during the course of the discussion.

1. MARC is equipped with an array of 6 cameras together with an array of 8 microphones, and it captures panoramic video with up to 15 frames/sec.
and speaker-separated speech streams with 16kHz sampling rate.
A meeting capture scene is shown in Fig.
2. The data we examine in this paper consists of one 30 minutes conversation conducted by 5 males and 1 female.
Even though we did not assign any roles, a chairperson and a clerk were spontaneously elected by the participants at the beginning of the session.
4 Aizuti
in multi-party design conversation 4.1 Aiduti types and amounts We ﬁrst looked at how frequent people produce aidutiintheconversation.
Table1showsthenumber of utterances and aiduti utterances for each of the six speakers, bothintermsofthenumberofinter-pausal units(IPUs).
Table2indicatesexpressionsidentiﬁed as aiduti utterances.
Positive responses to questions and requests are not included in aiduti, even if they share the surface forms of Table 2.
Reduplicated forms of each of the aiduti expressions in Table 2 are also frequently observed, and they were counted as one aiduti occurences.
We can see that a sizable portion of utterances, about 30% to 40%, were actually aiduti utterances in our data.
An example excerpt demonstrating the abundance of aiduti is shown in Fig.
3, where aiduti utterances are marked by bold characters.
4.2 Conversation
ﬂow management Overlapping aiduti One reason why multi-party conversation contains a lot of aiduti is that there are more hearers, potential backchannel producers.
Fig. 4 shows an exampleinwhichthreehearersB,E,andDproduced aiduti almost simultaneously to the speaker F’s utterance.
The fact that these three aiduti were overlapping shows that they are independently directed to the speaker F’s preceding utterance.
This type of aiduti response is expected to increase in numbers as the number of conversation participants increases.
Aiduti for turn-holding In the same example in Fig.
4, the speaker F produced aiduti ‘un’ after all aiduti utterances by hearers B, E, and D, and immediately before he continued his turn.
This type of speaker aiduti can be taken to serve the turn-holding function.
It gives an acknowledgment to all the acknowledgments from hearers collectively and signals that the speaker is going on producing his own message.
Aiduti for ﬂoor transition A relatively clear structure was observed in the conversation we analyzed.
The conversation consisted of a sequence of idea proposals produced by 13 Aiduti→Floor Num Aiduti speaker becomes the next ﬂoor main speaker 53 non-Aiduti speaker becomes next ﬂoor main speaker 17 Total 70 Table 3: Aiduti and ﬂoor transition different speakers.
We identiﬁed a stretch of conversation as a ﬂoor in which one main speaker makes a proposal on his or her ideas.
As long as the speciﬁc proposal is being discussed as the conversation topic, other participants may contribute clariﬁcation or elaboration utterances within the same ﬂoor.
An example of a sequence of ﬂoors is shown in Fig.
5. Cﬁrsttalksaboutthedifferenceinpeople’sexpected response between mobile mails and PC mails in the ﬁrst ﬂoor.
B then brings about in the second ﬂoor a suggestion on some functionality similar to drive mode which indicates to the original sender that the recipient is not available at the moment.
D in the third ﬂoor follows on by mentioning Yahoo messenger.
We extracted 71 ﬂoors total from the 30 minute conversation data.
Table3indicatestherelationshipbetweentheproduction of aiduti in one ﬂoor and the claiming of the main speaker-hood in the next ﬂoor.
The table shows that many of the main speaker of a ﬂoor had producedaidutiasanon-mainspeakerinthepreceding ﬂoor.
This suggests that aiduti utterances from non-main speakers indicate their readiness to make a positive contribution to the joint task, by taking the next ﬂoor and by contributing a proposal for the task when they ﬁnd a suitable opportunity.
4.3 Collaborative
elaboration of proposals When we take a closer look into ﬂoors, we ﬁnd positive collaborative behaviors from non-main speaker participants.
Typical behaviors of non-main speaker participants of a ﬂoor include giving aiduti, providing (positive) evaluations to the idea proposed, and inserting clariﬁcation questions.
On top of these behaviors, it was often observed in a ﬂoor that non-main speaker participants try to make positive contributions to the idea currently on the table, by adding new elements of ideas or providing concrete ideastopartoftheproposalthatheretoforeremained vague at the time.

4: Aiduti in Collaborative elaboration part of non-main speaker participants ‘collaborative elaboration.’ Collaborative elaboration can be a success or a failure.
Figures 6 and 7 show two contrasting examples.
In the example in Fig.
6, nonmain speaker participants C and B successfully contribute to the idea proposal by the main speaker D on combining PC and Skype functionalities, by explicitly pointing out the concrete merit, e.g., free phone call, as a support of the proposal.
In the example in Fig.
7, on the other hand, a non-main speaker participant B ﬁrst tried to make a contribution, the idea of local data backup, to the proposal produced by the main speaker C, storage of data in the network, but gave up after a non-positive response from C and retracted his additional proposal.
Table 4 shows the relationship between collaborative evaluation and aiduti utterances in a ﬂoor.
Aiduti utterances were observed in almost every ﬂoor.
Collaborative elaboration is also rather frequent.
It takes place in about 40% of all ﬂoors.
Finally, the table shows that participants who perform collaborative evaluation in a ﬂoor are likely to produce aiduti utterances in the same ﬂoor.
This suggests, again, that aiduti utterances from non-main speaker participants of a ﬂoor indicate their readiness to make a positive contribution to the joint task, by improving on the proposal currently being discussed.

Frequency of aiduti utterances We observed that multi-party conversations contain a high rate (30∼40%) of aiduti utterances.
a great number of aiduti utterances were produced by the chairperson among all the participants.
Saft (2006), based on the analysis of Japanese TV discussion programs, pointed out that chairperson pro15 duces a large portion of aiduti among all the discussion participants.
These ﬁndings appear to conﬁrm theideathataidutiutteranceshavefunctionstomanage the ﬂow of conversations, and chairpersons exploit these functions in discussion sessions.
But, exact conversation ﬂow management function of aiduti may not be unique.
According to Saft (2006), the chairperson in the particular TV discussion program uses aiduti to claim their addressee-hood in order to prevent the discussion from free-ﬂoating and out of control.
In our design conversation data, it appears that the chairperson frequently inserts aiduti in order to encourage other participants to engage in the discussion and to make the session more lively.
Floor structure It may not always be a good strategy for everybody to produce aiduti as acknowledgment in a multi-party conversation, since with a lot of hearers it can be a nuisance for the speaker to get too many aiduti in every possible grounding point.
It follows that the fact that a certain participant produces aiduti at a certain timing in a multi-party conversation can have signiﬁcance other than the grounding of the message just produced.
It is interesting to note that even though at the level of turn-taking, an aiduti utterance works as a continuer, a turn-yielding signal, at the level of ﬂoor, aiduti utterances seem to indicate positive involvement attitude of the participant toward the joint problem solving activity.
Collaborative elaboration We observed a number of instances of joint construction of proposals through collaborative elaboration in our design conversation data.
It was also observed that in most of the cases of collaborative elaboration, aiduti utterances were accompanied by participants engaging in collaborative elaboration.
These facts seem to imply that aiduti utterances both signal and produce among conversation participants an afﬁliative awareness toward joint construction of the proposal for the problem at hand, through the exchange of readiness signal, among all the group members, toward making positive contributions to the ongoing joint problem solving activity.
We believe that these contribution readiness and afﬁliative awareness are the basis of affective functions of aiduti in Japanese conversations.
6 Conclusions
An analysis of aiduti utterances, Japanese backchannels, in a Japanese multi-party design conversation was conducted.
It was argued, based on the analysis, that, in addition to the two major functions, signaling acknowledgment and turn-management, aiduti utterances in multi-party conversations are involved in joint construction of design plans through management of the ﬂoor structure, and display of participants’ readiness to engage in collaborative elaboration of jointly constructed proposals.
It was also suggested that these additional functions eventually lead to affective functions of aiduti.
