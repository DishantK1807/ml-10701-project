Samuelsson (Samuelsson, 1994) is the first to depart from manual specification of chunking criteria in NLP; the chunking of the tree-bank trees employs the information theoretic measure of entropy.

Speech Understanding), probabilistic evaluation of the full parse-space using such models is NPhard (Sima'an, 1996b), and even when it is deterministic polynomial-time, then grammar size is prohibitive.

The partial-parser is implemented as a parser for TSGs (Sima'an, 1996a), based on an extension to the CYK algorithm (Younger, 1967)).

(Sima'an, 1996a)): for each projected partial-tree, a maximum was set on its depth (D), number of substitution-sites (N) on its frontier, number of words (W) and number of consecutive words (C) on its frontier.

In (Rayner and Samuelsson, 1994, Rayner and Carter, 1996) grammar specialization is conducted by chunking the trees of a tree-bank according to "chunking criteria" which are manually specified e.g. chunks correspond to trees with roots which correspond to full utterances, NPs, PPs or non-recursive NPs.
