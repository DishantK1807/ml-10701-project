The average performance of the SVD-based representations of 83% to 91% is satisfactory, although inferior by about 5% to 10%, to disambiguation with minimal manual intervention (e.g., Yarowsky \[1995\]).

At current state two linguistic resources have been analyzed and adapted in order to be incorporated into the ADVICE project: Brill tagger, Brill (1992), and EuroWordNet, Vossen et al.(1998). The paper is structured as follows: next section focuses on a brief description of the NL module of ADVICE project; section 3 is devoted to explain how the corpus study has influenced the customization of the lexical resources; sections 4 and 5 outline the Brill tagger and EuroWordnet extension to cover specific domain peculiarities and, finally, in section 6 some conclusions and future work are presented.
