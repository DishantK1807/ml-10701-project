Introduction One of the issues to emerge from recent evaluations of information extraction systems (Sundheim, 1992) is the importance of discourse processing (Iwafiska et al., 1991) and, in particular, the ability to recognise multiple events in a text.

Although the need to recognise events has been widely acknowledged, most approaches to information extraction (IE) perform this task either as a part of template merging late in the IE process (Grishman and Sterling, 1993) or, in a few cases, as an integral part of some deeper reasoning mechanism (e.g.

A closely related (though not identical) problem is found in recognising boundaries in discourse, and there seems to be little agreement in the literature as to the properties and functions they possess (Morris and Hirst, 1991), (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

Although more exotic forms of event recognition exist at varying levels of analysis (such as within the abductive reasoning mechanism of SRI's TACITUS system (Hobbs et al., 1991), in a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and in a semantic network (Kozima, 1993)), template merging is the most used method.

Current approaches As an IE system processes a document, it typically creates a template for each sentence (Hobbs, 1993), a framelike data structure that contains a maximally explicit and regularised representation of the information the system is designed to extract.

Our system is aimed at documents typified by those in the MUC-4 corpus (Sundheim, 1992).
