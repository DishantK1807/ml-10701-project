It also has much in common with dtree substitution grammar (Rambow et al., 1995).

The extension of tree adjoining grammar (TAG) to tree-local multicomponent TAG (Joshi, 1987), or the extension of context free grammar (CFG) to tree insertion grammar (Schabes and Waters, 1993) or regular form TAG (Rogers, 1994) can be seen as steps toward answering this question.
P93-1017 P94-1022
multifoot TAG 4.1 Definitions MMTAG resembles a cross between set-local multicomponent TAG (Joshi, 1987) and ranked node rewriting grammar (Abe, 1988), a variant of TAG in which auxiliary trees may have multiple foot nodes.

We can generalize this result using the notion of a meta-level grammar (Dras, 1999).
P99-1011
The approach that Vijay-Shanker et al.(1987) and Weir (1988) take, elaborated on by Becker et al.(1992), is to identify a very general class of formalisms, which they call linear contextfree rewriting systems (CFRSs), and define for this class a large space of structural descriptions which serves as a common ground in which the strong generative capacities of these formalisms can be compared.
