The slot and particle features are calculated using a modified version of the ExtractVerb software provided by Joanis and Stevenson (2003), which runs over the BNC pre-processed using Abneyâ€™s (1991) Cass chunker.

While our long-term goal is token classification (disambiguation) of a VPC in context, following other work on VPCs (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003), we begin here with the task of type classification.

Predominant sense identification is a useful component of sense disambiguation of word tokens (McCarthy et al., 2004), and we presume our VPC type classification work will form the basis for later token disambiguation.

This will almost certainly require semantic classification of the verb token (Lapata and Brew, 2004), similar to our approach here of using the semantic class of a verb type as indicative of the meaning of a particle type.

McCarthy et al.(2003) use several measures to automatically rate the overall compositionality of a VPC.
W03-1810
Because of this variation, researchers have explored automatic methods for learning whether, or the degree to which, an MWE is compositional (e.g., Lin, 1999; Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Fazly et al., 2005).

Bannard (2005), extending work by Bannard et al.(2003), instead considers the extent to which the verb and particle each contribute semantically to the VPC.
