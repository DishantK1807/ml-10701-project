These rules can be either extracted automatically from a corpus (Brill, 1992) or written manually (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995).

The training of the HMM can be done on either a tagged or untagged corpus, and is not a topic of this paper since it is exhaustively described in the literature (Bahl and Mercer, 1976; Church, 1988).

Among others, it can be composed with transducers that encode: • correction rules for the most frequent tagging errors which are automatically generated (Brill, 1992; Roche and Schabes, 1995) or manually written (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995), in order to significantly improve tagging accuracy 2.

These rules may include long-distance dependencies not handled by HMM taggers, and can conveniently be expressed by the replace operator (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Karttunen, 1995; Kempe and Karttunen, 1996).
