Recently more techniques for answer extraction, answer selection, and answer validation have been proposed (Lita et al., 2004; Soricut and Brill, 2004; Clark et al., 2004).

Most research efforts in the Question Answering community have focused on factoid questions and successful Question Answering systems tend to have similar underlying pipelines structures (Prager et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2003; Hovy et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000).

Question Answering has emerged as a key area in natural language processing (NLP) to apply question parsing, information extraction, summarization, and language generation techniques (Clark et al., 2004; Fleischman et al., 2003; Echihabi et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Hermjakob et al., 2002; Dumais et al., 2002).

Work Question Answering has attracted much attention from the areas of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval and Data Mining (Fleischman et al., 2003; Echihabi et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2003; Hermjakob et al., 2002; Dumais et al., 2002; Hermjakob et al., 2000).

For biographical fact extraction and generation, Zhou et al.(2004) and Schiffman et al.(2001) use summarization techniques to generate human biographies.

Suppose p represents the person and the classes for classifications are {} 21,ccC =, we have M feature functions Mmpch m,...,1),,( =. For each feature function, we have a model parameter Mm m,...,1, =λ . The classification with 599 maximum likelihood estimation can be defined as follows (Och and Ney, 2002): ∑∑ ∑ = = = = ' 1 ]),(exp[ ]),(exp[ )|()|( 1 ' 1 c M m mm M m mm pch pch pcppcP M λ λ λ (7) The decision rule to choose the most probable class is (Och and Ney, 2002): {} ⎭ ⎬ ⎫ ⎩ ⎨ ⎧ = = ∑ = M m mm c c pch pcPc 1 ),(maxarg )|(maxargˆ λ (8) We use the published package YASMET 1 to conduct parameters training and classification.
