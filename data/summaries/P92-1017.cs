One might instead look into versions of the current algorithm for more lexically-oriented formalisms such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992).
C92-2066
This criterion is closely related to the "crossing parentheses" score of Black et al.(1991). 1 In describing the experiments, we use the notation GR for the grammar estimated by the original inside-outside algorithm, and GB for the grammar estimated by the bracketed algorithm.

4.2. Experiments on the ATIS Corpus For our main experiment, we used part-of-speech sequences of spoken-language transcriptions in the Texas Instruments subset of the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill et el., 1990), and a bracketing of those sequences derived from the parse trees for that subset in the Penn Treebank.
H90-1021
The second experiment uses a naturally occurring corpus and its partially bracketed version provided by the Penn Treebank (Brill et al., 1990).
