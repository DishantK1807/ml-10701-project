Mann and Yarowsky (2003) have proposed a Web based clustering technique relying on a feature space combining biographic facts and associated names, whereas Bagga and Baldwin (1998) have looked for coreference chains within each document, take the context of these chains for creating summaries about each entity and convert these summaries into a bag of words.

Unlexicalized parsers, on the other hand, achieved accuracies almost equivalent to those of lexicalized parsers (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

Here, we adopt the policy of ?one person per document??(all mentions of the ambiguous personal name in one web page are assumed to refer to the same personal entity in reality) as in Bagga & Baldwin (1998), Mann & Yarowsky (2003) and Gooi & Allan (2004).

Collins parser for Chinese The Collins parser is a state-of-the-art statistical parser that has high performance on English (Collins, 1999) and Czech(Collins et al.1999). There have been attempts in applying other algorithms in Chinese parsing (Bikel and Chiang, 2000; Chiang and Bikel 2002; Levy and Manning 2003), but there has been no report on applying the Collins parser on Chinese.

Much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003).

A strictly statistically, corpus-based approach that only contemplates strings of words in view to produce lexicon entries (Manning and Schtze 2003) cannot but fail to put in relation such formal variants of equivalent expressions.

Given an English sentence, we parse it with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and then generate paraphrases using the following syntactic transformations: 1.

First, we seek to go beyond the kind of bag-ofwords features employed in earlier systems (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998; Gooi & Allan, 2004; Pedersen et al., 2005), and attempt to exploit deep semantic features beyond the work of Mann & Yarowsky (2003).
