In the FTAG used by the surface realisation algorithm, linguistic expressions are associated with semantic representations as advocated in [Gardent and Kallmeyer, 2003].

It is a bottom up, tabular algorithm [Kay, 1996] optimised for TAGs.

In generation however, tabulation increases efficiency by avoiding duplicate computations but the complexity remains exponential because in particular of multiple modifiers [Brew, 1992].

spurious derivations Categorical grammars often allow so called spurious derivations in that one and the same syntactic structure can be derived in several different ways [Hepple, 1991].

The semantic representations used are flat semantic representations in the sense of [Copestake et al., 2001] and the semantic parameters (that is, the semantic indices representing the missing arguments of the semantic functors) are represented by unification variables.

The syntactic properties supported by the selection constraints are automatically associated during grammar compilation to the elementary trees of the grammar by means of so-called hypertags [Kinyon, 2000].

et al.â€™s constraint-based approach Finally, our approach has interesting connections to the constraint-based approach proposed by [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002].

In this section, we relate our approach to the HPSG based approach presented in [Carroll et al., 1999], to the statistical and semi-statistical strategies used in [Bangalore and Rambow, 2000] and in [White, 2004] and to the constraint based approach described in [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002].

Surface realisation is NP complete [Brew, 1992].

effect of polarity filtering To get an estimate of how our realiser compares with existing published results, we revisited the test cases discussed in [Carroll et al., 1999] and [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002] by producing similar sentences in French namely (7a) and (7b).

This comparison is not all that meaningful, however, since we are using different grammars and significantly faster computers, a 3 Ghz Pentium IV to the 700 Mhz Pentium III in [Koller and Striegnitz, 2002].

On the other hand, it is also well known that surface realisation (the task of producing the set of sentences associated by a grammar with a given semantic representation) is NPcomplete [Brew, 1992].
