One of the algorithms tested (Melamed, 1996) gave worse performance when we used a notation called ITRANS for the Hindi text, instead of the WX-notation.1 4 Evaluation in Previous Work There have been attempts to systematically evaluate and compare word alignment algorithms (Och and Ney, 2003) but, surprisingly, there has been a lack of such evaluation for sentence alignment algorithms.

One reason for this is that there are more of characters than words (Gale and Church, 1991).

Wu (Wu, 1994) also used lexical cues from corpus-speci c bilingual lexicon for better alignment.

Word correspondence was used by Kay (Kay, 1991; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993).

Word correspondence was further developed in IBM Model-1 (Brown et al., 1993) for statistical machine translation.

Brown, Lai and Mercer (Brown et al., 1991) used word count as the sentence length, whereas Gale and Church (Gale and Church, 1991) used character count.

Using this search method meant that no prior segmentation of the corpora was needed (Moore, 2002), either in terms of aligned paragraphs (Gale and Church, 1991), or some aligned sentences as anchors (Brown et al., 1991).

Simard and Plamondon (Simard and Plamondon, 1998) used a composite method in which the rst pass does alignment at the level of characters as in (Church, 1993) (itself based on cognate matching) and the second pass uses IBM Model-1, following Chen (Chen, 1993).
