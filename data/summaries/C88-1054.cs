In generation, a lexical entry that lists a word stem and a corresponding set of linguistic and semantic features is not enough; what is needed is a relationship between the lexlcal item and a knowledge representation structure \[Jacobs, 1986\] and a means of selecting the lexical item from among the other possible words \[Mathiessen, 1981\].
