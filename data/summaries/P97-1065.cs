(Justeson and Katz, 1995) and (Dagan and Church, 1994) use the frequency of occurrence of the candidate string as a measure of its likelihood to be a term.

(Dagan and Church, 1994), accept sequencies of nouns, which give them high precision, but not such a good recall as that of (Justeson and Katz, 1995), which allow some prepositions (i.e.

From the above, only (Bourigault, 1992) does not use any statistical information.

Multi-word ATR usually uses linguistic information in the form of a grammar that mainly allows noun phrases or compounds to be extracted as candidate terms: (Bourigault, 1992) extracts maximal-length noun phrases and their subgroups (depending on their grammatical structure and position) as candidate terms.

(Daille et al., 1994) agree that frequency of occurrence "presents the best histogram", but also suggest the likelihood ratio for the extraction of two-word English terms.
C94-1084
The choice of the linguistic filter affects the precision and recall of the results: having a 'closed' filter, that is, a strict one regarding the part-of-speech sequencies it accepts, like the N + that (Dagan and Church, 1994) use, wilt improve the precision but have bad effect on the recall.

(Daille et al., 1994) also allow adjectives to be part of the twoword English terms they extract.
