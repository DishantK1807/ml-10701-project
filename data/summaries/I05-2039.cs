It has a lower bound of 0, no upper bound, better scores indicate better translations, and it tends to be highly correlated with the adequacy of outputs ; • mWER (Och 2003) or Multiple Word Error Rate is the edit distance in words between the system output and the closest reference translation in a set.

Measuring homogeneity by counting word / lexeme frequencies introduces additional difficulties as it assumes that the word is an obvious, well-defined unit, which is not the case in the Chinese (Sproat and Emerson 2003) or Japanese language (Matsumoto et al., 2002), for instance, where word segmentation is not trivial.

Because it is not feasible here to have humans judge the quality of many sets of translated data, we rely on an array of well known automatic evaluation measures to estimate translation quality : • BLEU (Papineni et al.2002) is the geometric mean of the n-gram precisions in the output with respect to a set of reference translations.
