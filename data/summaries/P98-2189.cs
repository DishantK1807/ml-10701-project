Such an extension may improve on the assessment of textual saliency and connectivity thus providing better generic summaries, as argued in Barzilay and Elhadad (1997).

Secondly, the use of thesauri envisaged in both Hirst and St-Onge (1997) and Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) does not address the question of topical aptness.

This estimate may get worse as conditions such as synonymy and hyponymy are checked for each word pair to extend the notion of lexical cohesion, e.g. using WordNet as in Barzilay and E1hadad (1997).

Possible improvements of this approach can be implemented taking into account additional ways of assessing lexical cohesion such as: • the presence of synonyms or hyponyms across text units (Hoey, 1991; Hirst and StOnge, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad 1997); 1162 • the presence of lexical cohesion established with reference to lexical databases offering a semantic classification of words other than synonyms, hyponyms and subject domain codes; • the presence of near-synonymous words across text units established by using a method for estimating the degree of semantic similarity between word pairs such as the one proposed by Resnik (1995); • the presence of anaphoric links across text units (Hoey, 1991; Boguraev & Kennedy, 1997), and • the presence of formatting commands as indicators of the relevance of particular types of text fragments.

A typical example is the use of thesaurus functions such as synonymy and hyponymy to extend the notion of word sharing across text units, as exemplified in Hirst and StOnge (1997) and Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) with reference to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).
