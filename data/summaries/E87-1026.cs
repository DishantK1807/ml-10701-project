Advantages of CCRs are discussed in Kilbury (1986): The metarules of GPSG can be eliminated as an extra device of the formalism.
C86-1010
GPSG chooses to represent the items and restrictions as different kinds of object, whereas FUG has only one kind of object, the functional description (FD), which Kay (1984: 76) defines as "a Boolean expression over features" \[i.e.

For example, Shieber (1986) describes a compilation from Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; cf Gazdar et alii 1985, henceforth GKPS) to PATR-II.
C86-1050
Karttunen (1984), however, argues for the use of both disjunction and negation in unification-grammar formalisms.
P84-1008
A series of changes in the formalism of GPSG will be proposed that make it look more like the "tool oriented" formalism of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG; cf Kay 1984 and Shieber 1985).
P84-1018
FUG as described in Kay (1984) provides for conjunction and disjunction but not for negation in FDs.
P84-1018
In regard to his own proposals for unification, Karttunen (1984: 31) remarks that "the problems that arise in this connection are very similar to those that come up in logic programming".
P84-1008
While presented in Kilbury (1986) as a new descriptive device, such Category Cooccurrence Restrictions (CCRs) are in fact simply a generalization of principles fundamental to GKPS.
C86-1010
Some of the particular FSDs formulated in GKPS for English appear questionable under different analyses (cf Kilbury 1986).
