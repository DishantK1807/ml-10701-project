<context> As a platform-independent system, Hydra has been successfully tested under Linux and Windows. The RDBMS used in the implementation is MySQL (¿5.0). Almost all of the design patterns proposed by GoF (Gamma et al., 1995) are used in the implementation. The resulting system is a robust and extendable one. Hydra’s data retrieval engine is used in several other applications. UTF8 database encoding makes Hydra language-</context>

Hydra’s language is based on the language presented in (Koeva et al., 2004)3. Hydra supports a synchronized view of and access to different wordnets through synsets encoding equivalent word senses. This provides exploitation of wordnet as a multilingual multipurpose lexicon</context>

A similar language was axiomatised and its completeness and soundness was proved(Koeva et al., 2004). First, we present the syntax of the language, and then proceed with a definition of a WordNet structure and the semantics of the language. 3.1.

Introduction Concurrently with wordnets’ development for a great variety of languages, several tools for WordNet have been designed such as Princeton viewer(Miller et al., 1990), WordNet viewer/editor VisDic1, and lately DebVisDic. At the same time, with the development of the Bulgarian wordnet BulNet 2, the need for a more powerful application for wordnet development ena</context>

WordNet WordNet is a lexical database that organises lexical information in terms of word meanings (Miller et al., 1990) grouped into sets of strong synonyms, called synsets. Thus, a synset encodes a lexicalized concept and each lexeme denoting the concept (called a literal) is a member of the synset. Each synset is s</context>

Modal Language for WordNet The principal purpose of the modal WordNet language introduced here is to provide a clean and uniform formalism for expressing complex queries with sufficient expres3W</context>
