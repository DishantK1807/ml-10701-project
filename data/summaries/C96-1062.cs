We are currently experimenting the way techniques of computer-aided acquisition for learning conceptual relations fi'om syntactic collocates (Velardi et al.1991) can be applied to N N associations.

Such systems are very efficient but are limited to the domain they are built for: interpretation rules are inferred from the observation of specific semantic patterns (Marsh, 1984) or from a fine-grained conceptual representation (Ter Stal, 1996).

Such com-pounds illustrate the notion of co-compositionality (Pustejovsky 1991).

Pustejovsky et al.(1993) show how statistical techniques, such as mutual information measures can contribute to automatically acquire lexical information regarding the link between a noun and a predicate.
J93-2005
This semantic framework demonstrates that the association between nominal constituents and underlying predicative relation in root compounds is not arbitrary: it involves conceptual mechanisms that are triggered in other linguistic phenomena such as type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991), anaphora (Fradin, 1984) or adjectival constructions (Bouillon and Viegas, 1993).
