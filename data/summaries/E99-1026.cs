Comparison with Fujio's work (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998) and Haruno's work (Haruno et al., 1998) Fujio used the Maximum Likelihood model with similar features to our model in his parser.

The list is expanded from tIaruno's list (Haruno et al., 1998).

This approach is taken by some other systems (Collins, 1996; Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Haruno et ah, 1998).
P96-1025 P98-1083
Other methods that have been proposed are one based on using the gain (Berger et al., 1996) and an approximate method for selecting informative features (Shirai et al., 1998a), and several criteria for feature selection were proposed and compared with other criteria (Berger and Printz, 1998).

The parser proposed by Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) is considered to be one of the most accurate parsers in English.

This allows us to compute the conditional probability as follows (Berger et al., 1996): P(flh) YIia\[ '(n'l) z~(h) (2) ~,i â€¢ (3) I i The maximum entropy estimation technique guarantees that for every feature gi, the expected value of gi according to the M.E. model will equal the empirical expectation of gi in the training corpus.
