This estimate could be used as a starting point for a more detailed alignment algorithm such as word_align (Dagan et al, 1993).

Using a scatter plot technique developed by Church and Helfman (1993) called dotplot, we can visulize the alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1.

These tables were computed from a small fragment of the Canadian Hansards that has been used in a number of other studies: Church (1993) and Simard et al (1992).

1. Motivation There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al (1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al (1993), Dagan et al (1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and Rgsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al (1992), WarwickArmstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear).

Currently, word_align depends on charalign (Church, 1993) to generate a starting point, which limits its applicability to European languages since char_align was designed for language pairs that share a common alphabet.

In previous work (Church et al, 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using charalign (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target.
