As mentioned previously (following Li and Abe (1998)) we used the MDL principle as our clustering criterion.

The second type has clear interpretation as a probability model, but no criteria to determine the number of clusters (Brown et al., 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993).

The idea of ‘word class’ (Brown et al., 1992) gives a general solution to this problem.

This top-down strategy can drastically decrease the amount of computation time compared to the bottom-up approaches used by Brown et al.(1992) and Li and Abe (1998).

Li & Abe’s model (1998) is an instance of this joint probability model, where D2 BPBE.

model 2.1 Class-based language modeling Our probability model is a class-based model and it is an extension of the model proposed by Li and Abe (1998).
P98-2124
The algorithm is applicable to more general tasks than existing studies (Li and Abe, 1998; Berkhin and Becher, 2002), and computational costs are significantly small, which allows its application to very large corpora.

Examples have been class-based D2-gram models (Brown et al., 1992; Kneser and Ney, 1993), smoothing techniques for structural disambiguation (Li and Abe, 1998) and word sense disambiguation (Sh¨utze, 1998).
