One of the main problems with using frequency counts or statistical methods for structural ambiguity resolution is the sparseness of data; however, (Resnik and Hearst, 1993) used conceptual associations (associations between groups of terms deemed to form conceptual units) in order to alleviate this problem.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) found that common nouns missing from WORDNET 1.6 occurred every 8 sentences in the BLLIP corpus.

52 The first classical text segmentation algorithm of this type is TextTiling described in (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993).

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) present a tagger which uses synonym set glosses as annotated training examples.
W03-1022
The WORDNET 1.6 test set consists of several cross-validation sets of 755 nouns randomly selected from the BLLIP training set used by Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

One type of structural ambiguity that has received much attention has to do with nominal compounds as seen in the work of (Resnik, 1993), (Resnik and Hearst, 1993), (Pustejovsky et al., 1993), and (Lauer, 1995).

This technique is similar to Hearst and Sch tze (1993) and Widdows (2003).

Conclusion Our application of semantic similarity to supersense tagging follows earlier work by Hearst and Sch tze (1993) u and Widdows (2003).

Results We have used the WORDNET 1.6 test set to experiment with different parameter settings and have kept the WORDNET 1.7.1 test set as a final comparison of best results with Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) implement a supersense tagger based on the multi-class perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2001), which uses the standard collocation, spelling and syntactic features common in WSD and named entity recognition systems.

Ciaramita et al.(2003) describe how the lex-files can be used as root nodes in a two level hierarchy with the WORDNET synsets appearA considerable amount of research addresses structurally and statistically manipulating the hierarchy of WORDNET and the construction of new wordnets using the concept structure from English.
W03-1022
Our evaluation will use exactly the same test sets as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).
W03-1022
This result is particularly interesting as a supersense tagger can easily provide a satisfactory accuracy (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).

Thus, some research has been focused on deriving different sense groupings to overcome the fine?? grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and Schutze, 1993) (Peters et al., 1998) (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001) (Agirre et al., 2003) and on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al., 1997) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003) (Villarejo et al., 2005) (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).

We intend to extend our experiments beyond the Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) set to include previous and more recent versions of WORDNET to compare their difficulty, and also perform experiments over a range of corpus sizes to determine the impact of corpus size on the quality of results.
W03-1022
Using this approach we have significantly outperformed the supervised multi-class perceptron Ciaramita and Johnson (2003).
W03-1022
SENTS. WORDS Evaluation Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) propose a very natural evaluation for supersense tagging: inserting the extra common nouns that have been added to a new version of WORDNET.
W03-1022
Hearst and Sch tze (1993) flatten WORDNET into 726 u categories using an algorithm which attempts to minimise the variance in category size.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call the noun lex-file classes supersenses.

metrics A number of different measurement methods were applied to topical texts segmentation including recall-precision pair (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997), edit distance (Ponte and Croft, 1997), P (Beeferman et al., 1997), Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002).
W93-0106
Our results significantly outperform Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) on both test sets even though our system is unsupervised.
W03-1022
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) believe that the key sense distinctions are still maintained by supersenses.

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.

Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

This limits significantly size of text to be processed by IE methods (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993) and thus influences significantly overall IE performance.
W93-0106
Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) call this supersense tagging and describe a multi-class perceptron tagger, which uses WORDNET's hierarchical structure to create many annotated training instances from the synset glosses.

One popular approach is to use a log-linear parsing model and maximise the conditional likelihood function (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004b; Malouf and van Noord, 2004; Miyao and Tsujii, 2005).
P05-1004
Such an approach based on first-order co-occurrence is used, for example, by Hearst and Plaunt (1993) for the representation of tiles or document subunits that are similar to our notion of context.
