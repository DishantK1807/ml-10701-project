I, br the purposes of the present paper we will introduce a DATR notation that slightly differs fi'om the standard notation given in Evans & Gazdar \[1989\] in the following respects: • the usual DATR abbreviation conventions are spelled out * the global environment of a DATR descriptor is explicitly represented (even if it is uninstantiated) • each node-path pair N:P is associated with the set of extensional suffixes of N:P that are defined within the DATR theory In standard DATR notation, what one might call a non-terminal symbol, is a node-path pair (or an abbreviation for a node-path pair).

These theoretical results may a priori outrule DATR as an implementation language for large scale real time applications, but not as a develot)ment environment for prototype lexica which can be transformed into efficient task-specific on-line lexica (Andry et al.1992). With a finite bound on path length our algorithm works, in practice 5, fast enough to be regarded as a usefifl tool for the development of small and medium scale lexica in DATR.
