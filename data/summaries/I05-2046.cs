From (Berger et al., 1996), we can compute the conditional probability as: p(o|h) = 1Z(h)productdisplay i αfi(h,o)i (2) Z(h) =summationdisplay o productdisplay i αfi(h,o)i (3) The probability is given by multiplying the weights of active features (i.e., those fi(h,o) = 1).

However, according to (Pakhomov, 2002), they typically perform quite poorly, with average recall rates in the range of only 10-30%.

The MBT POS tagger (Daelemans et al., 1996) is used to provide POS information.

ME-based tagger, in particular, excel at solving sequence tagging problems such as POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), general English NER (Borthwick, 1999), and Chunking (Koeling, 2000).
W00-0729
In general, biomedical NEs do not follow any nomenclature (Shatkay and Feldman, 2003) and can comprise long compound words and short abbreviations (Pakhomov, 2002).
P02-1021
Various machine learning approaches such as ME (Kazama et al., 2002), SVM (Kazama et al., 2002; Song et al., 2004), HMM (Zhao, 2004) are applied to NER.
