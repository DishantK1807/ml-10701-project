Several authors (Schiitze, 1993; Dagan et al., 1995; Ide and Veronis, 1998) have suggested that clustering methods, by reducing data to a small set of representatives, might perform less well than nearest-neighbors averaging-type methods.

Many distributional similarity measures can be considered (Lee, 1999).
P99-1004
Distributional clustering (Pereira et al., 1993) assigns to each word a probability distribution over clusters to which it may belong, and characterizes each cluster by a centroid, which is an average of cooccurrence distributions of words weighted according to cluster membership probabilities.

The distributional clustering model that we evaluate in this paper is a refinement of our earlier model (Pereira et al., 1993).

Furthermore, early work on class-based language models was inconclusive (Brown et al., 1992).

Furthermore, each method has generated some discussion in the literature (Hofmann et al., 1999; Baker and McCallum, 1998; Ide and Veronis, 1998).
