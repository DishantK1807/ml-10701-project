Next, we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web (Szpektor et al., 2004), the Minipar dependency parser (Lin, 1998) and a syntactic matching module.

A phenomenon which deserves a few words of explanation is the “transparent head noun” (Grishman et al., 1986; Fillmore et al., 2002).

Taking a stepfurther, theTEASEalgorithm(Szpektoretal., 2004) provides a completely unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the Web for a given input relation (see Section 5.1).

Yangarber et al.(2000) and Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) define methods for automatic acquisition of predicate-argument structures that are similar to a set of seed relations, which represent a specific scenario.

Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) evaluated their method through document and sentence filtering at the scenario level.

Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) evaluated the performance of a QA system that is based solely on paraphrases, an approach resembling ours.
