Therefore, we were less concerned with improving efficiency, and more with the properties of this algorithm, which we consider a baseline method upon which more sophisticated techniques such as best-first parsing (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) or Aa0 search (Klein and Manning, 2003) may well be able to improve.
