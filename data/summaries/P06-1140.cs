In COMIC, the sentence planner uses XSLT to generate disjunctive logical forms (LFs), which specify a range of possible paraphrases in a nested free-choice form (Foster and White, 2004).

Such disjunctive LFs can be efficiently realized using the OpenCCG realizer (White, 2004; White, 2006b; White, 2006a).

(Davis and Hirschberg, 1988; Prevost and Steedman, 1994; Hitzeman et al., 1998; Pan et al., 2002), has focused on how to use the information present in the language generation component in order to specify contextually appropriate intonation for the speech synthesizer to target.

While Collins (2000) and Walker et al.(2002) develop their rankers using the RankBoost algorithm (Freund et al., 1998), we have instead chosen to use Joachims’ (2002) method of formulating ranking tasks as Support Vector Machine (SVM) constraint optimization problems.8 This choice has been motivated primarily by convenience, as Joachims’ SVMa108a105a103a104a116 package is easy to 7http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/web exp/ 8See (Barzilay and Lapata, 2005) for another application of SVM ranking in generation, namely to the task of ranking alternative text orderings for local coherence.
