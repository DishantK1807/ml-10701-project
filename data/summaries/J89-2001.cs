Focusing techniques (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1981; Robinson 1981; McKeown 1985; Carberry 1988) are necessary in order to identify that portion of the underlying plan to which a fragmentary utterance refers.

Allen and Perrault (Perrault et al.1980) used mutual beliefs in their work on indirect speech acts and suggested their use in clarification and correction dialogs.

At other times, IP will be uncertain whether the description is sufficiently detailed; she could go to the extreme and include every detail at her disposal, but this may confuse the listener and hamper identification (Goodman 1986).
J86-4002
Sidner (1981) employs a similar strategy in her work on anaphora resolution.

Grosz and Sidner (Grosz et al.1986) and Reichman (1984) have investigated discourse structure and have shown that a coherent discourse can be segmented into units that have well-defined relationships to one another.
J86-3001
This is an issue that requires further study and must take into account indirect speech acts (Perrault et al.1980). The discourse stack accessed by our ellipsis processor (steps 2 and 14 in Figure l) represents the system's current beliefs about discourse expectations, but our implementation does not include actually constructing it from the dialog preceding the elliptical fragment.
J80-3003
The context tree is inferred and constructed from the preceding dialog using the incremental plan recognition algorithm implemented in the TRACK system and described in Carberry (1988).

McKeown (1985) expanded on focus rules proposed by Sidner (1981) to explain how speakers should organize their utterances when faced with a choice of topic.

a context tree (Carberry 1988) representing IS's inferred underlying task-related plan; 2.

Previous research on understanding intersentential ellipsis has emphasized syntactic and semantic strategies (Hendrix et al.1978; Waltz 1978; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1982; Carbonell 1983), but the contributions of the speaker's plans and goals to the interpretation of ellipsis has hitherto been inadequately explored.

It appears that our plan-based framework can be extended to handle many such dialogs, by reasoning about how IS is constructing his task-related plan (Ramshaw 1989).

Grosz (1977) and Robinson (1981) used models of the speaker's task in apprentice-expert dialogs to determine the referents of definite noun phrases and verb phrases.

In constructing a description, IP uses knowledge about the listener (Appelt 1985, Goodman 1986) to produce a concise reference that she believes will be acceptable.
J86-4002
A related problem, that of understanding pragmatically ill-formed utterances (utterances that violate the system's model of the world), is addressed in Carberry (1988).
J88-3003
A cooperative listener will have assimilated the preceding dialog, inferred much of the underlying task-related plan motivating the speaker's queries, and be focused on that aspect of the task on which the information-seeker's attention was centered (Grosz 1977; Carberry 1983; Carberry 1988) immediately prior to the new utterance.
J88-3003
The structuring relations have been given many names, including rhetorical predicates (Grimes 1975, McKeown 1985), coherence relations (Hobbs 1979), discourse segment purposes (Grosz 1986), and conversational moves (Reichman 1984).
J86-3001
Syntactic strategies are exemplified by the work in Hendrix et al.(1978) and Weischedel et al.(1982). Howe, ver, many examples of ellipsis cannot be handled by syntactic strategies.
P82-1016
Our hypotheses and strategies were motivated by an analysis of naturally occurring dialogs from several domains, including a radio call-in show 4 providing advice on investments, interactions with the REL (Thompson 1980) natural language interface to a ship data base, and student advisement sessions.
C80-1027
Perrault and Allen (Perrault et al.1980) used expectations of speaker goals, and inference of their plans for achieving these goals, in the interpretation of indirect speech acts.
J80-3003
Carberry (1983, 1988) describes how the context model is dynamically constructed from an ongoing dialog.
J88-3003
The focus of attention in this dialog is on considering the job applicants and evaluating them; therefore IS is most expected to continue with this subtask before considering other aspects of his overall task (Carberry 1983, 1988).
J88-3003
This structure has led to the development of focusing rules that predict how a speaker may shift his focus of attention within the underlying task-related plan (Carberry 1983, 1988).
