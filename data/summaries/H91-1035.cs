In this paper, we show how a CCG-like account for coordination can be constructed in the framework of lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (TAGs) (Joshi, 1987; Schabes et al., 1988; Schabes, 1990).
C88-2121
Thus CCG assigns the following two groupings to John likes apples: (2) (John (likes apples)) (3) ((John likes) apples) The work on CCG was presented by Mark Steedman in an earlier DARPA SLS Workshop (Steedman, 1989).

In an expanded version of this paper, we will describe several details concerning (1) how this approach extends to coordination with cross-serial dependencies (as in Dutch) as well as as to languages with constituent orders different from English, (2) some processing implications and (3) the computation of the semantic interpretation using the machinery of synchronous TAG (Shieber and Schabes, 1990).
