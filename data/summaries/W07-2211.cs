One extrapolation is to a very fast stochastic parser by Sagae and Lavie (2005).

The features used are those identified by Roark (2001) for a topdown stochastic parser.

Examples of this work include a system by Liu et al (1990), and experiments by Hindle and Rooth (1993), and Resnik and Hearst (1993).2 These efforts had mixed success, suggesting that while multi-level preference scores are problematic, integrating some corpus data does not solve the problems.

It is actually a full parser, whose per-sentence output consists of a single tree of basic chunks, together with identifications of (sometimes alternative) typed dependences among the chunk heads (AitMokhtar et al.2002, Gala 2004).

Hobbs and Bear (1990) provide a useful summary of the evolved principles.

For example, Hobbs and Bear (1990) say only that "When a 1 The idea has also been used directly in stochastic parsers that consider all possible attachments, for example, by McDonald et al.(2005). 84 non-terminal node of a parse tree is constructed, it is given an initial score which is the sum of the scores of its child nodes.

McCord (1993), however, carefully describes how the elements of TRS are computed in his slot grammar system.

This paper examines significant aspects of a purely symbolic alternative: the preference and pruning system of the RH (Retro-Hybrid) parser (Newman, 2007).

Methods for doing so, for stochastic parser output, are described by Johnson (2002) and Cahill et al (2004).

The second extrapolation is to the LFG XLE parser (Kaplan et al.2004) for English, consisting of a highly developed symbolic parser and grammar, an OT-based preference component, and a stochastic back end to select among remaining alternative parser outputs.

to "supervised" training To illustrate the relationship between the above symbolic training method for preference scoring and corpus-based methods, perhaps the easiest way is to compare it to an adaptation (Collins and Roark, 2004) of the perceptron training method to the problem of obtaining a best parse (either directly, or for parse reranking), because the two methods are analogous in a number of ways.

Both the LFG XLE parser (Kaplan et.al. 2004), and the HPSG LinGO ERG parser (Toutanova et al.2005) have such additions.
