This contrasts with recent semantic annotation projects such as PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

While I may disagree with the technical details, I believe that the approach taken by (Dang et al., 2000) is on the right path.

This paper explores fine-grained lexical semantic representations—approaches that view a verb as more than a simple predicate of its arguments (e.g., Dang et al., 2000).

This framework, where the “semantic load” is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to lexical categories not typically thought to bear semantic content, is essentially the model advocated by Pustejovsky (1991a), among others.

These event representations typically decompose seman1see (Dowty, 1991) and (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1996) tic roles in terms of primitive predicates representing concepts such as causality, agentivity, inchoativity, and stativity (Dowty, 1979; Jackendoff, 1983; Pustejovsky, 1991b; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 1998).

Furthermore, this process is syntactic in nature (Lin, 2004b), governed by well-known syntactic processes such as MERGE (Chomsky, 1995) and subjected to well-studied constraints such as selectional restrictions and the Head Movement Constraint (Travis, 1984).

The following shows but a small range of possible resultative verb compounds with the dao3 ‘fall’ result: (27) kan3 dao3 chop-fall to chop down zhuang4 dao3 crash-fall to knock over tui1 dao3 push-fall to push over la1 dao3 pull-fall to pull down In principle, verbal compound formation in Mandarin could be a lexical process, but I present elsewhere independent evidence for a non-lexicalist approach that captures these constraints in the theoretical framework of Distributed Morphology, an extension of Chomsky’s Minimalist Program (Lin, 2004a; Lin, 2004b).

In (Lin, 2004b), I argue that le is a reflex, rather than an overt realization of the underlying inchoative marker.
