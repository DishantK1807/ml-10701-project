The beginnings of discourse segments, in a sense, indicate shifts of intention in a discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

If the idea of context set were restricted to local focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), then the resulting descriptions would be to some extent sensitive to local aspects of discourse structure.
J86-3001
Grosz and Sidner (1986) claim that discourse segmentation is an important factor, though obviously not the only one, governing the use of referring expressions.
J86-3001
See Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Dale (1992) for some examples that illustrate this idea.

Descriptions within Segments Previous work on the generation of referring expressions focused on producing minimal distinguishing descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Dale 1992; Reiter and Dale 1992) or descriptions customized for different levels of hearers (Reiter 1990).

In practice, this criterion probably produces similar results to approaches considering verb subcategorization (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994).

A possible solution would be to employ the concept of stacked focus space in Grosz and Sidner's discourse structure theory (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Dale 1992).
J86-3001
Dale (1992) used the global focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), as the context set in his domain of small discourse.
J86-3001
For example, flower can be used as a lexical anaphor for rose (Tutin and Kittredge 1992).

3: Adding Discourse Structure Grosz and Sidner (1986) suggest that three structures can be identified within a discourse: linguistic structure, intentional structure, and attentional state.
J86-3001
Previous work suggests obtaining these rules from consulting the results of linguistic study, including general principles, such as the Gricean maxims (Grice 1975) used in (Dale and Haddock 1991; Reiter and Dale 1992; Dale 1992) and focus theory, as used in (Dale 1992).
