Some of the work done on data-oriented parsing (DOP) (Bod, 1993; Bod and Scha, 1996; Bod and Kaplan, 1998; Sima'an, 1999) can also be considered related to our work, as it can be seen as a way to specialize in an gBL-like way the (initially unknown) grammar implicitly underlying a treebank.

Work The work presented in the current article is related to previous work on corpus-based grammar specialization as presented in (Rayner, 1988; Salnuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996; Samuelsson, 1994; Srinivas a.nd Joshi, 1995; Neumann, 1997).

(Srinivas and aoshi, 1995) and (Neumann, 1997) apply EBL to speed up parsing with tree-adjoining grammars and sentence generation with HPSGs respectively, though they do so by introducing new components in their systems rather then by modifying the grammars they use.

The line of work described in (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996; Samuelsson, 1994) deals with unificationbased grammars that already have a purelyconcatenative context-fi'ee backbone, and is more concerned with a different t~orm of specialization, consisting in the application of explanation-based learning (EBL).

In (Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996) these criteria are handcoded: all subtrees satisfying some properties are selected, and a new grammar rule is created by flattening each such subtree, i.e., by taking the root as lefl.-hand side and the yield as right-hand side, and in the process performing all unifications corresponding to the thus removed internal nodes.

Samuelsson (Samuelsson, 1994) proposes a technique to automatically selects what subtrees to retain.

The initial, and much seminal work in this area was been carried out by Rayner and coworkers, see (Rayner 1988), (Samuelsson and Rayner 91) and (Rayner and Carter 1996).
