In the first step, the scores are initialized according to the G 2 statistic (Dunning, 1993).

Cognates have been employed for sentence and word alignment in bitexts (Simard et al., 1992; Melamed, 1999), improving statistical machine translation models (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999), and inducing translation lexicons (Koehn and Knight, 2001).

Melamed (2000) shows that the assumption of independence leads to invalid word associations, and proposes an algorithm for inducing models of translational equivalence that outperform the models that are based solely on co-occurrence counts.

Currently, I am working on the incorporation of complex correspondences into the cognate identification algorithm by employing Melamedâ€™s (1997) algorithm for discovering non-compositional compounds in parallel data.

The Reconstruction Engine (Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994), a set of programs designed to be an aid in language reconstruction, requires a set of correspondences to be provided beforehand.

The introduction of the no-crossing-links constraint on alignments not only leads to a dramatic reduction of the search space, but also makes it possible to replace the approximate competitive-linking algorithm of Melamed with a variant of the well-known dynamic programming algorithm (Wagner and Fischer, 1974; Kondrak, 2000), which computes the optimal alignment between two strings in polynomial time.

Some of the proposed cognate identification algorithms implicitly determine and employ correspondences (Tiedemann, 1999; Mann and Yarowsky, 2001).

work In a schematic description of the comparative method, the two steps that precede the determination of correspondences are the identification of cognate pairs (Kondrak, 2001), and their phonetic alignment (Kondrak, 2000).
