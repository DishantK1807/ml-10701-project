Unlike arbitrary regulm' n-relations, same-length regular relations m'e closed under intersection and complementation, be.cause a theorem tells us that they correspond to regular languages over (e-free) ntuplcs of symbols (Kaplan and Kay, 1994, p.

Two-level formalisins based on that introduced by (Koskenniemi, 1983) (see also (Ritchie et al., 1992) and (Kaplan and Kay, 1994)) are widely used in practical NLP systems, and are deservedly regarded as something of a standard.

Tile formalism was first introduced in (Black et al., 1987), was adapted by (Ruessink, 1989), and an extended version of it was proposed for use in the European Commission's ALEP language engineering platform (Pulman, 1991).

Earlier versions of the partition fbrmalism could not (in practice) cope with multiple lexical charactors in SC rules, see (Carter, 1995, ยง4.1).
