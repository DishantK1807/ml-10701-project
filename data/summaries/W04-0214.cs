There are many different schemes to choose from, for example Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson, 1986) or the stack model (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and manually annotating with these schemes has variable reliability.

Typically, the non-coreferential pronouns are difficult to annotate reliably since there are a myriad of different categories for bridging relations and for specifying Figure 4: CorpusTool Parse View Figure 5: Pronoun Tool demonstrative relations (Poesio and Viera, 1998).

There has been plenty of theoretical work such as (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), (Moser and Moore, 1996) which shows that just as sentences can be decomposed into smaller constituents, a discourse can be decomposed into smaller units called discourse segments.

For example, many leading pronoun resolution methods perform around 80% accuracy over a corpus of syntactically-parsed Wall Street Journal articles (e.g., (Tetreault, 2001) and (Ge et al., 1998)), but in spoken dialogue the performance of these algorithms drops significantly (Byron, 2002).

Since parsing is just an initial stage of natural language understanding, the project was focused not just on obtaining syntactic trees alone (as is done in many other parsed corpora, for example, Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Tiger (Brants and Plaehn, 2000)).
