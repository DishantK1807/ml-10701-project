Briscoe and Copestake (1996) argue that a differential estimation of the productivity of derivation processes allows an approximation of the probabilities of previously unseen derived uses.

We follow Johnston and Busa (1996) in using Pustejovsky's (1995) concept of telic role to encode the purpose of an artifact.

For derived forms, the applicable lexical rules or schemata determine possible senses (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996).

We use the following estimate for productivity (adapted from Briscoe and Copestake (1996)): M+I Prod(cmp-schema) N (where N is the number of pairs of senses which match the schema input and M is the number of attested two-noun output forms -we ignore compounds with more than two nouns for simplicity).
