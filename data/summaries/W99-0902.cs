Note that, unlike Dagan and Itai (1994), we give no consideration to statistical confidence as we are after 100% recall, whatever the cost to precision.

We further suggest that a large-scale database of maximally aligned G-P tuples has applications within the more conventional task of G-P translation (Klatt, 1987; Huang et al., 1994; Divay and Vitale, 1997).

(Dagan and Itai, 1994)) to accept only those translation pairs with sufficiently high statistical confidence, for example.

The first consists of the simple ratio dml -~ between the highest and sec82 ond highest ranking scores sl and s2 ("the odds ratio"), in the manner of (Dagan and Ital, 1994).

This suggests applications to the extraction of translation pairs from aligned bilingual corpora (Gale and Church, 1991; Kupiec, 1993; Smadja et al., 1996), where the system input would be made up of aligned strings (generally sentences) in the two languages.
