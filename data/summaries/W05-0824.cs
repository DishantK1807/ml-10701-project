For acquiring a PBM, we followed the approach described by Koehn et al.(2003). In brief, we relied on a bi-directional word alignment of the training corpus to acquire the parameters of the model.

We did try to use the alignment produced with IBM model 4, but did not notice significant differences over our experiments; an observation consistent with the findings of Koehn et al.(2003). Each parameter in a PBM can be scored in several ways.

We used the word alignment produced by Giza (Och and Ney, 2000) out of an IBM model 2.

German have been studied by Koehn and Knight (2003).
