Keynote Talk: Diamonds on my Windshield: the Use of Computer-based Instruction in Computational Linguistics Jo Calder (University of Edinburgh) Abstract Many disciplines currently have more or less organized activities concerned with developing resources to support Internetand computer-based instruction.
This talk will examine this area, with particular focus on the questions: • What is special about computational linguistics in terms of its subject matter, history and existing resonrces? • What is the current state of resources in our area? • Wheal is this kind of instruction justified? • What are the problems to be faced aald what solutions might there be?
We will see that in some cases computerbased intervention can lead to enhanced learning, and so provide a non-economic justification for the use of such techniques.
AJso, current technological developments offer part of the answer to the problem that such resources are of_ teal not reused.
