The "lexicalization" of contextfree grmnmars (Schabes, Waters 1993) points out many similarities between the two paradigms (Rainbow, Joshi 1992).

Less constrained dependency formalisms exist in the literature (Mel'cuk 1988) (Fraser, Hudson 1992), but no mathematical studies on their expressive power exist.

A number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Fraser 1989) (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al.1994) (Lai, Huang 1995): however, no result of algorithmic efficiency has been published as far as we know.
