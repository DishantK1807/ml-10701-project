Our central claim is that these sentences, which have often been classified in the literature with truly erroneous input such as misspellings (see, for example, the work discussed in ~wnsny1980, Thompson1980, Kwnsny1981, Sondheimer1983, Eustman1981, Jensen1983\]), are regular structures which can be processed by adding a small number of rules to the grammar and other components of the system.

The problem of processing fragmentary sentences has arisen in the context of a l•rge-scnle natural language processing research project conducted at UNIsYs over the past five years ~almer1986, Hirschman1986, Dowding1987, Dahl1987\].
