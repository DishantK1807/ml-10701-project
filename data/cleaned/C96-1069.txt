jp Abstract In this paper, we propose a statistical approach for clustering of artMes using on-line dictionary definitions.
One of the characteristics of our approach is that every sense of word in artMes is automatically disambiguated using dictionary definitions.
The other is that in order to cope with the problem of a phrasal lexicon, linking which links words with their semantically similar words in articles is introduced in our method.
The results of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
1 Introduction
There has been quite a lot of research concerned with automatic clustering of articles or autonmtic identification of selnantically similar articles(Walker, 1986), (Guthrie, 1994), (Yuasa, 1995).
Most of these works deal with entirely dif ferent articles.
In general, the 1)rot)l(m: that the same word ca:, be used differently in different sul)jeet domains is less problematic in entirely ditferent artMes, such as 'weather forecasts', 'medical rel)orts', and 'computer manuals'.
Because these articles are characterised by a larger number of different words than that of the same words.
However, in texts from a restricted domain such as financial artMes, e.g Wall Street Journal (WS,I in short) (Libernmn, 1990), one encounters quite a large number of pop ysemous words.
Therefore, polyseinous words of_ ten hamper the I)recise cla~ssification of artMes, each of which belongs to the restricted subject donlaiII.
In this paper, we report an experimental study for clustering of articles by using on-line dictionary definitions attd show how dictionarydefinition can use effectively to classify articles, each of which belongs to the restricted subject domain.
We first describe a method for disambiguating word-senses in articles based on dictionary definitions.
Then, we present a method for classifying articles and finally, we rel)ort some ext)eriments in order to show the effect of the method.

Work One of major approaches in automatic clustering of articles is based on statistical information of words in,~rticles.
Every article is characterised by a vector, each dimension of which is associated with a specific word in articles, and every coordinate of the artMe is represented by tern: weighting.
Tern1 weighting methods have been widely studied in iufornmtion retrieval research (Salton, 1983), (Jones, 1972) and some of then: are used in an automatic clustering of articles.
Guthrie and Yuasa used word frequencies for weighting (Guthrie, 1994), (Yuasa, 1995), and Tokunaga used weighted inverse document frequency which is a word frequency within the document divided by its fl'equency throughout the entire document collection (Tokunaga, 1994).
The results of these methods when al)plied to articles' cbussification task, seem to show its etfectiveness.
However, these works do not seriously deal with the 1)roblem of polysemy.
The alternative al)l)roach is based on dictionary's infl)rlnation as a thesaurus.
One of major problems using thesaurus ('ategories a.s sense represe::tation is a statistical sparseness for thesaurus words, since they are nmstly rather uncommon words (Niwa, 1995).
Yuasa reported the experimental results when using word frequencies for weighting within large documents were better resuits in clustering (lo('unmnts as those when EDR electronic dictionary as a thesaurus (Yuasa, 1995).
The technique developed by Walker also used (lietionary's infornmtion and seems to cope with the discrimination of polysemy (Walker, 1986).
He used the semantic codes of the Longmau Dictionary of Contemporary English in order to determine the subject donmin for a set of texts.
For a given text, each word is checked against the dictionary to determine the semantic codes associate(l with it.
By accumulating the frequencies for these senses and then ordering the list, of categories in terms of frequency, the subject matter of 406 the text can be identified.
However, ~us he admits, a phrasal lexicon, such as Atlantic Seaboard, New England gives a negative influence for clustering, since it can not be regarded ~us units, i.e. each word which is the element of a 1)hrasal lexicon is assigned to each semantic code.
The approach proposed in this paper focuses on these l)roblems, i.e. 1)olysemy and a phrasal lexicon.
Like Guthrie and Yuasa's methods, our approach adopts a vector representation, i.e. every article is characterised by a vector.
However~ while their ~pproaehes assign each (:oor(linate of a vector to each word in artMes, we use a word (noun) of wtfich sense is disambiguated.
Our disambiguation method of word-senses is based on Niwa's method whMt use(l the similarit;y 1)etween two sentences, i.e. a sentevee which contains a polysenmus noun and a sevtenee of dictionarydefinition.
In order to cope with Walker's l)rob lem, for the results of disand)iguation technique, semantic relativeness of words are cMeulated, and semantically related words are grout)ed together.
We used WSJ corpus as test artich,s in the experiments in order to see how our metho(l can effectively classify artMes, eacl, <)f whi<:h beh)ngs te the restricted subject domain, i.e.
WS.I. 3 Framework 3.1 Word-Sense Disambiguation Every sense of words in artMes which should be (:lustered is automatically disambiguated in advance.
Word-sense dismnl)iguation (WSD in short) is a serious problem for NLP, and a wlri('ty of al)l)roaches have been 1)roposed for solving it (Ih'own, 1991), (Yarowsky, 1992).
Our disalnbiguation method is based on Niwa's method which used the similarity 1)etween a sentenee containing a t)olysemous noun and a sen= tence of dictionary-definition.
Let x be a t)olysemous noun and a sentence X be X" • • • ~ 3:-n~ • • • ~ a'-i ~ ~1:~ ~1:1, • " " ~ ilYn~ " " ' The vector representation of X is V(X) = ~ V(xi) where V(xi) is V(xi) = (Mu(xi,o~),...,Mu(xi,om)) Here, Mu(x, y) is the v',due of mutual information proposed by (Church, 1991).
oj,...,om (We call them basic words) are selected the 1000th most frequent words in the reference Collins English Dictionary (Lil)erman, 1990).
Let word x have senses sl,s2,...,sp and the dictionary-definition of si be Ysi: "",Y-n,'",Y-I,Y, Yt," "',Yn," "" The similarity of X and }~i is measured t)y the imter l)roduct of their normalised vectors and is detined as follows: v(x) • vo; ) = Iv(x)II vo%dl (1) We infer that the sense of word x in X is si if Hi're(X, };i) is maximnm alnong t'~,...,}~p.
Giw:n ml article, the procedure for WSD is applied to each word (noun) in an article, i.e. the sense of each noun is estimated using formula (1) and the word is rel)laced 1)y its sense.

3.2 Linking
Nouns with their Semantically Similar Nouns Our method for classification of articles uses the results of dismnbiguation method.
The problems here are: 1.
The frequency of ewwy disambiguated noun in new articles is lower than that of every polysemous noun in oriqinal articles.
For exalnple, the frequency of 'nulnber5' in Table 1 is lower than that of 'number 't.
Furthermore, some nouns in articles may be semantically similar with each other.
For example, 'number5' in Table 2 and 'sum4' in Table 3 arc ahnost the saine sense.
2. A phr~sal lexicon which Walker suggested in his method gives a negatiw~ influence for classification.
1If all 'mlmber' are used ~s ~nunJ)er5' sense, the flequency of 'number' is the same as 'numl)erS'.

The procedm'es for linking are the following five stages.
Stage One: Calculating Mu The first stage for linking nouns with their semanticMly sinfilar nouns is to calculate Mu between noun pMr x and y in new articles.
In order to get a reliable statistical data, we merged every new article into one and used it to calculate Mu.
The results are used in the following stages.
Stage Two: Representing every noun as a vector The goal of this stage is to rel)resent every noun in a new article as a vector.
Using ~t term weighting method, nouns iI| a new article would be represented by vector of the form v = (2) where wl is the element of a new arti(:le and corresponds to the weight of the noun wl.
In our method, the weight of wi is the wdue of Mu between v and wi which is calculated in Stage One.
Stage Three: Measuring similarity between vectors Given a vector representation of nouns in new articles ~s ill forlnula (2), a dissimilarity between two words (noun) vl, v2 in an article would be obtMned by using formula (3).
A dissimilarity measure is the degree of deviation of the grout) in an n-dimensionM Euclidean space, where 'n is the number of nouns which co-occur with t~ 1 and 'U 2 . Dis(vl,v2) = E~=, Ej'~=,(vlj ffj)'2 (a) ~0 = (fh,"',.q;,) is the centre of gravity and I .q I is the length of it.
A group with a smMler value of (3) is considered semantically less deviant.
Stage Four: Clustering method For a set of nouns Wl~ 'W2~ "'', w,~ of a new article, we calculate the semantic devi~ttion value of all possible pairs of nouns.
Table 4 shows sample of the results of nouns with their semantic deviation values.
Iu Table 4, 'BBK' shows the topic of the article which is tagging in the WSJ, i.e.
'Buybacks'. The value of Table 4 shows the semantic deviation vMue of two nollnS 2.
The. clustering algorithm is applied to the sets shown in Table 4 and produced a set of semantic clusters, which are.
ordered in the as('ending order of their semantic deviation wdues.
We adopted non-overlal)ping, group average method in our clustering technique (Jardine, 1991).
The sample results of clustering is shown in Table 5.
Table 5: Chtstering results of 'BBK' 0.125 \[share1 company1\] 0.140 \[giorgio di\] 0.215 \[shares2 shm'e2\] 0.251 \[sharel comp~myl stmre2 shares2\] The wdue of TaMe 5 shows the selnantie deviation value of the cluster.
Stage Five: Linking nouns with their semantically similar nouns We selected different 49 artMes from 1988, 1989 WSJ, and applied to Stage One ~ Four.
From these results, we manuMly selected (:lusters which are judged to be semantically similar.
For the selected chtsters, if there is a noun which belongs to several clusters, these clusters are grouped together.
As a result, each cluster is added to a sequential number.
The sample of the results are shown in Tal)le 6.

new2 york2 eIn Table 4, there m'c some nouns which are not added to the number, '1' ~,, '5', e.g.
'giorgio', 'di'.
This shows that for these words, there is only one meaning in the dictionary.
408 'Seq.
hum' in Table 6 shows a sequential numt)er, 'wordl', ...,'word,,' whi(:h are added to the grou 1) of semantically similar nouns 3.
Tal)le 6 shows, for examl)le, 'new2' and 'york2' are xemanti('ally similar and form a phn~sal lexicon.
3.3 Clustering
of Articles According to Table 6, freqllen('y of every word in new artMes ix counted, i.e. if a word in a ne, w article t)ehmgs to the gron l) shown ill Tal)h' 6, the word is rel)laced t)y its rel)resentative mmfl)('r 'wordi' and th(' fre(luency of 'word/' is count('d.
For (,xalnlJe, 'l)ank3' and 'banks3' in a new ~Lrticle are rel)laced by 'wordi', aud the frequen('y of 'wordi' equals to the total nulnl)er of fr('quency of 'bank3' and q)anks3'.
Using a term weighting method, articles wouhl be represented 1)y vectors of the form A = (wt,w.,'",w).
(4) where Wi (:orresl)on(ls to the weight of the noun i.
The weight is used to the fr('(lu(mcy of noun.
Given the vector rel)resentations of articles as in formula (4), a similarity between Ai and Aj are caJculated using formula (1).
The greater the wtlue of Sim(Ai, Aj) is, the ntore xinfilar these two articles are.
The ('lustering Mgorithm whh:h is described in Stage Four is appticd to each 1)ah ' of articles, and t)roduces a set of ('lusters whh'h are ordered in the des(:ending order of ~heir semantic similarity wdues.
4 Experiments
We have conducted flmr ('xl)eriments, i.e. q!'req', 'Dis', 'Link', and 'Method' in order to exanline how WSD me, thod and linking words with their semantically similar words(linking method in short) atfect the clustering results.
'Fl'eq' is fl'equencyt)a~sed exlmriment, i.e. we use word frequency for weighting and do not use WSD and linking methods.
'Dis' is con(:erned with disambiguationd)ased experim(mt, i.e. the (:lustering algorithm is applied to new artMes.
'lAnk' ix con/:erned with linking-l)~used experiment, i.e. we applied linking method to original artMes.
'Method' shows our proposed method.
4.1 Data
The training tort)us we have used ix the 1988, 1!)89 WSJ ill ACL/DCI CD-IOM whi(.h ('onsists of al)out 280,000 1)art-of-spee('h tagged sentences (Brill, 1992).
From this eorlmx, we seh,cted at random 49 (lifferent articles for test data, each of which (-onsixts of 3,500 sentences and has different tel)it ilallle wlfich is tagging in the WS,I.
We classified 49 artMes into eight categories, e,g.
Sin our experiments, m equals to 238.
'market news', 'food.
restaurant', etc.
The di('tionary we have used is Collins English Dictionary in ACL/DCI CD-ROM.
in WSD nwthod, the (:o-occurrence of x and y f'or cah:ulating Mu is that the two words (x,y) al)pear in the training (:orl)uS in this order in a window of 100 words, i.e. a: is folh)wed by y within a 100-word distance.
This is because, the larger win(h)w sizes might be ('onsidered to be useful for extra('ting s(unanti(' relationshil)s between ltOltllS.
Basic words are sele('te(l the lO00th most fre(luent words in the reference Collins English, Dictionary.
'\['he length of a selltetl(:(, ~" which contains a 1)ol yxemons n(mn and the h'ngth of a sentence of di('tionary-defilfition are maximuln 20 words.
For ea('h t)olysemous nmm, we selected the tirst top 5 definitions in the (lictionary.
In linking m(,thod, a window size of the c(> o('('urren('e of .c and y for ('ah'ulating Mu is the same as that in WSD method, i.e.

WSD method According to Table 7, there, are 24 sets which could be (:lustered correctly in 'Dis', while 21 sets in 'Freq'.
Examining the results shown in Figure 3, 'BVG' and 'HRD' are correctly classified into 'food • restaurant' and 'market news', respectively.
However, the results of 'Freq' (Figure 1) shows that they are classified incorre<'tly.

In Table 9, for example, 'security' is high freqtlenties and used ill 'being secure' sense ill 'BVG' artMe, while 'security' is 'certificate of creditorshiI)' sense in 'HRD'.
One possible cause that the results of 'Freq' is worse than 'Dis' is that these polyselnous words which are high-frequencies are not recognised polysemy in 'Freq'.
2. Linking method As shown in Table 7, there are 23 sets which could be clustered correctly in 'Link', while 21 sets ill 'Freq'.
For example, 'ERN' and 'HRD' are both concerned with 'market news'.
In Figure 2, they are clustered with high similarity wflue(0.943), while in Figure 1, they are not(0.260).
Exalnilfing the results, there are 811 nouns in 'ERN' article, and 714 nouns in 'HRD', and 410 Table 9: Different word-senses in BVG and HRD security rate sale stock BVG the state of being secure a quantity in relation the exchange of goods total goods HRD certificate of creditorship l)rice of charge the alllOllltt of sold stock market of these, 'shares', 'stock', and 'share' which are semantically similar ~re included.
In linking method, there are 251 nmmn in 'ERN' and 492 nouns in 'HRD' whi('h ~tre repl~tccd for representative words.
However, in 'Freq', each noun corresponds different coordinate, and regards to different meaning.
As a result, these tol)ics are clustered with low similarity wdue.
3. Our method Tit('.
results of 'Method' show tha,t 31 out of 40 sets are cbLssified correctly, att(I the per('entage attained was 77.5%, while 'Freq', 'Link', and 'Din' ext)eriment att,~tined 52.5%, 57.5%, 6().0%, renl)e(:tively.
This shows the effe(-tivelmss of our method.
In Figure 4, the ~u'ticles,tre judged to ('l,tssify into eight categories.
Examining 'ERN', 'CEO' and 'CMD' in Figure 1, 'CE()' and 'CM1)' are grouped together, while they have (lifferent c~,tegories with each other.
On the other hand, in Figure 3, 'ERN' and 'CE()' ar(, groul)ed together corre('tly.
Examining the nouns which arc 1)elonging to 'ERN' mid 'CE()', 'plant'(factory and food senses), 'oil'(petrohmnl and food), 'order'(colmn~nd ;md dema.nd), and 'interent'(del)t and curiosity) whi(:h are high frequencies ~re correctly dismnbiguated.
Furthermore, in Figure 4, 'ERN' mM 'CEO' are classified into 'market news', and 'CMD' are cb~ssilied into 'fm:m', correctly.
For example, 'plant' which is used in 'factory' sense in linked with semanti('~lly silnib~r words, 'ntanuf;wturing', 'factory', 'production', or 'job' et('..
In a simibtr way, 'i)bmt' which in uned in flood' sense is linked with 'environmeltt', 'forest'.
As a result, the articles are classified correctly.
As shown in Table 7, there arc 9 nets which could not 1)e clustered correctly in our method.
A possible improwmmnt is that we use all definitions of words in the dictionary.
We s(qeeted the first top 5 definitions in the dictionary for each noun and used theln in the cxperilnent.
However, there are some words of which the memfings are not included these selected definitions.
Thin (:~mses the fact theft it is hard to get a higher percentage of correct clustering.
Another interesting t)ossibil ity in to use ml altermttive weighting policy, such a,s the widf ( weigh.te, d invcr.sc docwmcnt fre, qucncy) (Tokunaga, 1994).
The widf is reported to have a marked ~ulwmtage over the idf ( invers~ ~.
document frequency) for the text categoris~Ltion tank.
6 Conclusion
\Ve have rei)orted an exl)erimentad study for clustering of ~rticles by using on-line (lictiom~ry deftnitions mid showed how dictionary-definitiolt cam use effectively to classify articles, ea('h of which belongs to the restricted sul)ject domain.
In order to Col)e with the relnainiug i)rol)lems inentioned in section 5 and apply thin work to practical use, we will conduct further e×perilnents.
