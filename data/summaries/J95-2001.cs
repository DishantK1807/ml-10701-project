In the case where additionally raw untagged text is available, the Maximum Likelihood training can be used to reestimate the parameters of HMM taggers (Merialdo 1994).

Weischedel et al.(1993) have used four categories of word morphology, such as inflectional endings, derivational endings, hyphenation, and capitalization.

Connectionist models have been used successfully for lexical acquisition (Eineborg and Gamback 1993; Elenius 1990; Elenius and Carlson 1989; Nakamura et al.1990). Correct classification rates up to 96.4 percent have been achieved in the latter case by testing on the Teleman Swedish corpus.

Rule-based taggers (Brill 1992; Elenius 1990; Jacobs and Zernik 1988; Karlsson 1990; Karlsson et al.1991; Voutilainen, Heikkila, and Antitila 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen 1993) use POS-dependent constraints defined by experienced linguists.

Recently, several solutions to the problem of tagging unknown words have been presented (Charniak et al.1993; Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel 1991).
H91-1065
A small error rate has been achieved by such systems when a restricted, application-dependent POS set is used; e.g., an error rate of 2-6 percent has been reported by Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993) using the Penn Treebank corpus.

When the training text is adequate to estimate the tagger parameters, more efficient stochastic taggers (Dermatas and Kokkinakis 1994; Maltese and Mancini 1991; Weischedel et al.1993) and training methods can be implemented (Merialdo 1994).

Hypotheses for unknown words, both stochastic (Dermatas and Kokkinakis 1993, 1994; Maltese and Mancini 1991; Weischedel et al.1993), and connectionist (Eineborg and Gamback 1993; Elenius 1990) have been applied to unlimited vocabulary taggers.

These taggers are preferred when tagged texts are available for training, and large tagsets and multilingual applications are involved.

Stochastic taggers use both contextual and morphological information, and the model parameters are usually defined or updated automatically from tagged texts (Cerf-Danon and E1-Beze 1991; Church 1988; Cutting et al.1992; Dermatas and Kokkinakis 1988, 1990, 1993, 1994; Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987; Kupiec 1992; Maltese * Department of Electrical Engineering, Wire Communications Laboratory (WCL), University of Patras, 265 00 Patras, Greece.
