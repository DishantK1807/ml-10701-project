The problem of computing the MPP in the DOP framework was put forward in (Bod, 1995).

Abstract This paper studies the computational complexity of disambiguation under probabilistic tree-grammars as in (Bod, 1992; Schabes and Waters, 1993).

Due to this extension, the one to one mapping between a derivation and a parsetree, which holds in CFGs, does not hold any more; many derivations might generate the same parse-tree, rl'his seemingly spurious ambiguity turns out crucial for statistical disambiguation as defined in (Bod, 1992) and in (Schabes and Waters, 1993), where the derivations are considered different stochastic processes and their probabilities all contribute to the probability of the generated parse.
