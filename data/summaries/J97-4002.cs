This Preference Factor is extremely important in achieving success by the 15 This constraint is suggested in Hardt (1992).

TM A clausal relation is simply an explicit syntactic clue that there is a discourse relation between two clauses, while similarity of parallel elements is another, more indirect clue of a discourse relation, as discussed for example in Hobbs (1979) and Hobbs and Kehler (1997).

A prominent recent example is Lappin and Leass (1994), in which a pronoun resolution system is evaluated on 360 examples taken from computer manuals, with a success rate of 86%.

In Hardt (1992) a preference for VPE with coreferential subjects is suggested.

The availability of parsed corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) makes it possible to empirically investigate elliptical phenomena in a way not possible before.

Appendix A: Treebank Tags In this appendix we include a list of the Penn Treebank part-of-speech tags (Table 9) and syntactic category labels (Table 10), taken from Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz (1993).

1. Introduction Ellipsis is a pervasive phenomenon in natural language, and it has been a major topic of study in theoretical linguistics and computational linguistics in the past several decades (Ross 1967; Sag 1976; Williams 1997; Hankamer and Sag 1976; Webber 1978; Lappin 1984; Sag and Hankamer 1984; Chao 1987; Ristad 1990; Harper 1990; Kitagawa 1991; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira 1991; Lappin 1992; Hardt 1993; Kehler 1993; Fiengo and May 1994).

Lappin and Leass (1994) implemented and tested Hobbs's algorithm, and reported results that were about 4% less than that of Lappin and Leass (1994).

538 Hardt VP Ellipsis Previous work on pronoun resolution (Hobbs 1978, Walker 1989) reports higher success rates.

importance of similar parallel elements in discourse relations is emphasized in Hobbs (1979), and it is applied to VPE resolution in Hobbs and Kehler (1997), in a rather different context than that of this paper.
P97-1051
Such constraints on pronoun resolution have been incorporated into several computational approaches to pronoun resolution, such as Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Lappin and McCord (1990), and Lappin and Leass (1994).

This work builds on structural constraints and discourse heuristics first proposed in Hardt (1992) and further developed in Hardt (1995).

The implementation of the Syntactic Filter is complicated by two factors: first, there are certain cases in which a containing antecedent is possible, where the VPE is 5 This constraint is discussed in Hardt (1992) as a way of ruling out antecedents for VPE.
