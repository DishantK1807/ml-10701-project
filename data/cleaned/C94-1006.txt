1 Introduction
A critical issue in AI r(~sem'ch is to ov(.'r(:(ml(~ the knowh~(Ige acquisition bottleneck in knowl(!dge-tms(!d systems.
As a knowledge base is eXlmn(led, adding more kn((wl(~dg(-` and fixing previ(ms err(m(~(Tus kn()w1edge become increasingly c(Tstly.
Mor(~(Tv(w, maintaining the integrity of Ire'go knowledge bases has 17rovcn to be a very chall(mging task.

This not only sltves the tlser~s tiltl(}~ hilt idso lltakes it untle(:t!ssary for the user to be an expert of the AUI'-J/E system.
Mor(~ver, this approa(:h sigmticantly reduces the "subjectivity" of the rules since the interwmtion of hmnlm exI)erts is minimized.
This is tmrticularly important because tile iHllllense Illllllb(w of translation rules (currently over 10,000) requires employing a team of experts over an extended l)eriod of tim(!.
Two learning methods are investigated in this i ml)er.
Ext)eriments show that the rnles learned by these methods are very close to the rules mmmally COmliosed by hlllIt}tll experts.
Ill Hl(Ist cases~ givell a reasonabh~ mtmber of training examph~s, th(! employed methods are able to find rules that are more than 90% accurate when compared to the mamutlly COnlI)OSed miles.
The rest of this document is organized as ti)llows.
We begin in Section 2 by it brief overview of the AUI'J/E Japanese-l.nglish translation system.
In Section 3, we discuss some of the 1)rol)lems that arise when the translation rules of ALT-J/E are composed manually })y }roman experts.
Then, we t)ropose in Section 4 an alternative approach based on machine learning techniques.
In Section 5, we describe the inductive learning methods used, followed by an experimental ewfluation of these methods in Section 6.
Fimdly, conclusion remarks are stated in Section 7.
2 ALT-J/E: A Brief Overview ALT-.I/E, the Automatic Language Trlmslator: Japanese to English, is one of the most &dvitll(:(}d and well-recognized systems for translating,htpanese to English.
It is the largest such system in terms of the iunount of knowledge it compris(~s.
In this work, we are concerned with the li)llowing components o\[' the ALT-J/E system: 1.
The Semantic lliera.rchy, 2.
The Semantic Dictionary, and 3.
Tile Translation lules.
We briefly describe each of these COmln)nents below.
For more details al)out the AI,T-.I/E system, we refer the reader to \[lkehara et M.
1989, Ikehara et al.1990, ikehara et al.1991\]. As shown in l"igam~ 1, the Semantic ltierarchy is it SOFt of colt(:el)t t}l(?SltllrtlS represented its it l;l'(?e structure in which each node is called a .SC'IIta'tttiC categolw, or a (:atego'l~9 R)r siml)licity.
Edges in this structure represent "is-a" relations am(rag the categories.
For example, "Agents" and "P(!ople" (see Figure 1) are both categories.
Tile edge between these two (:ategories indicates that any instance of "l)eoph~ '' is also an instance of "Agents".
The current version of ALT.l/E's Semlmtic llierarchy is :12 levels (let, I) and has about 3000 nodes.
The Semantic Dictionary maps (~it(:h .\]~4pall('.sC IIOtlll to its aI)prol)riate SeItlalltic cRtcgories.
For example, the Selilalltic D!ctionary states that the noun )~!:~ (niwatori), which meahs "chicken" OF "h011" ill English, is an instance of the categories "Meat" and "Birds".
The Translation Rules in AUI?-J/E associate Japanese patterns with English patterns.
Currently, ALT-J/E uses roughly 10,000 of these rules'.
As Figure 2 shows, each translation rule has a .\]apanese fret tern its its left-hand side and all English pattern as its right-hand side.
For example, the first rule in this figure basically sltys that if the,Japanese verb in a sentence is ~J'~ < (yaku), its subj('(:t is an instance of "l)eople '', and its ol)ject is an instance of "lh'ead" or "Cake", then the following English pattern is to be llS(?d: Sub.jeer "l)ake" Obj(!ct.
Note that in this (:~e the Japan(!se verb ~y~ ((yaku) is transhtted into the English verb 'q)akc'".
This slune .\]aI)anes(! yet'l) cait also be translated into the English verbs "roast", "broil", "crenmte" or "burn", dependlug on the context.
These (:~Lses axe }landled by the fore" other rules given in Figure 2.
Translation rules are meant only to handle basic sentences that contain just a single .\]itl)a.ltt.'se ver}).
Such sentences are called "simple selitellCeS.
''2 '\[l'o translate a comlllex sentence, M;\]'-,I/E does various ldnds of preand post-proc(~ssing, l/oughly speaking, the given complex sentence is first broken into a collection of simple sentences in the we-processing phase.
Then, the English translations of these are combined together in the post-processing t)}u~se to give the final translation of the complex sentence.
To translate a simple sentence, AI:I'-J/E looks for tile most ai)I)roi)ria.te translation rule to use.
Based on the VOl'b of the sentence, the system considers ius candidates all those tra.nslation rules that have this verb on their left-hand side.
'l'he English pattern of the rule, whose JaI)imese pattern matches the s0Iitell(:(!
})est is th(!ii osod to generate the desired English translation.
As shown in Figm'e 2, the,Ial)anese patterns are exln'essed using th(, wu'iM)les NI, N~,..., etc., which r(!\]\[)H}s(}llt variollS COIllp()lleIltS of it Ja, pallese S(~Ilt(!llCe~ such as the subject, the ob.iect, et(:.

AUI-J/E has three dith'rel,t kinds of translation HI.s: (i) the senlauti(' pal teru transfer rules (ront~,hly 10,000 l'uh,s).

3 Shortcomings

â¢ One.
of the problems fitting the design('rs of A1;I'J/l~: is the refinement of the Smnantic lli(!rarchy.
Whenever this structure is altered, the translation rules mnst also t)e revised to r(qh*(:t the change.
Such revision is extr(~mely troubh~sonu., and error-prone if it is don(; mamlally.
4 A
Machine Learning Approach "\['lie problems we have just listed regarding the man-ual construction of A\[f.\['-,l/l'\]'s translation rules are largely solved if the process can be automated.
An attractive approa(:h to this l)robhmi is lto resort to inductive machine learning techniques to extract the desired translation rules fl'om examples of .laI)anesc sent(m(:(~s and their English translations.
At tit('.
on> rent stage, how(wet, learning translation rules fully automatically from eXaml)les alone seems to lm too chalhmging.
A more realistic goal is to minimize rathc'r than to totMly eliHlinat(~ the intervention of human exp('rts in the rifle aquisiti~m process.
Thus, OIll" Cllrl'(?Ilt o1)jectiv(~ is to ('OllCOIltl';itt(~ 011 ~Ult.Olll~tting l;he niost ditlicult and tinl(>(:onsnlning parts of the niallllal procedure.
The goal of the pr(!sent work is to learn what we call "partial translation rules".
A partial translation rule consisls ()l" the left-hand side along with the English verb of the right-hand side of a translation rule.
hi other words, the otlly diflin'en(:e between it transla.tion rul('.
and at partial translation ruh j is that the latter has only an I'\]nglish verl) rather than it full English patt0rn its its right-hand side.
Constructing a partial translation rule is the most ditllcult part of constructing a.
tl'anslati(m rule.

5 Learning
Task and Methods In this work, we investigate two dift'erent inductiw, l('arning algorithms.
Before talking about these algorithms, we will first IIiMc.e the learning task more precise, alid shed some light Oil the diftlculties that distinguish it from other previously studied learning tasks.
5.1 Tile
Learning Task The .iol) of a learning algorithm in our setting is to construct partial translation rules, l,'or a given,lapan(~s(! verb,l-vcr'b and a l)ossil)le English transhltion l,?-vcrbi of that verb, the MgorMlm has to llnd the npln'ol~riate condition(s) that should hoM in the ('i)litoxt ill Ol'dOr ti) Illlt 1),\]-'O,f~'l'l) to E-VC.'tq)i.
As an eexmnlfl(!, consider the,lapanese verb /!E 5 (tsukau).
This verb corresponds to the English verbs "use", "spend" and %ml)loy".
The c}loice aniong these IDn.t~lish verbs del)(mds mostly on tim o}@ct of the sentence, l,'or example, if the object is mi instance of "Asset" or "Time", then "spend" is itpl)ropriate.
Thus, it rough rule for mapping Â¢< 5 (tsukau) to "Slmnd" may look like 11:" \[.l-,t.:m, = t'~5 \] 'I'III'~N l\]-\'i~Rn = spend.
\VO S(!('I'7.
to \]Oitl'll this kind of l'lll(!s frolll exatl~ll)lt!s of,hil)anese senti.mces and their I:;nglish translations, such as the following pair: 60 { . I'i&':~:~= ~:{~L ' 5, Tim l}rincess sp(!n(Is mt)lmy ).
After parsing (which is carriel trot by AI,T-J/Iq's parser), the.
above exanq)le gives the ft}llowing l)ail': ( \[ J-\~:,u = ~5 . ~;tuuEc'r = mtj>,).
OBJECT = k;(Iw \], E-VERLI =~ Sl)eltd ).
lly looking np the Semantic l)icti)nary of AI/I'-.I/IQ the i}ossibh~ semanti: catep;ories ft}r (mjyo are "Noble Person", "Daughter" anti "Female", antt thosP for kane are "Asset", "Metal", "l)ay" and "M*'dal".
Thus, this example is tiredly giwm to the learning alp;tn'ithm in the folh}wing fl)rm: ( \[ .~UILII,:t'T ~ { Noble Person, l)an~ht,,r.
Fen.de }.
()llJE('q ~ { Ass01, iXl,'tal, l)ay.

In uther words, the above transformation can i}e seen as "cOral}fling" the information of the original ambignous training examph.'s along with the necessary parts of the Semantic llierarchy into a format that is ready to be proce~sscd 1}y ii)3 (or in fact, by many other feature-t}ased learning algorittmls).
Note that if we create a featme fur every semantic category c and every sentence COmllonent Ni, then the total number of features will become inti.'asiblv large (Inany thousands), llowe.ver, what we need is only to consider those categories that apl}eared in the training data, and their ancestors (the set A above).
In our experiments, this results in a reasomfl}le ram> ber of features (one to two hundred).
This is 1}ecause the numl}er of examples is limited and also t)ecause of the rather "tilted" distribution of what categories can naturMly at}I}ear as a certain (:OlIll}Otlellt of it Selltenee for a given verb.
(Eg. the object of the verl} f;2 ~3" (nomu), which roughly means to "drink", can not be just mlything)!
The most important a(lvmltage of the al}ove approach is that it cmt be applied to alnbiguous training examl}les as they are, without the need to remove the mnbiguity explicitly as wc did with Ilaussler's algorithm.
Another adwmtage of using ID3 is that we do not need to break our learning task into binary class learning problems since ID3 is caI}ablc of Mu'ning multi-class learning concepts.
6 Experimental
Work The goad of tile experiments reI}orted here is to evaluate the qmdity of the partiad translation rules learned by the two h.~m'ning methods we have just descril}ed.
The comi}arison includes the folh}wing three settings: 1.
Using llaussler's algorithm to learn fr}ill training examl}les ~ffter removing the mnl)igulty.
2. Using ID3 to h;arn from training examl)les after removing the ambiguity atnd performing the transformation given in the Subsection 5.3. 3.
Using ID3 to learn from tnfining examI}les after performing the transfi)rmation given ill tile Subsection 5.3, trot without removing the.
ambiguity. In a sense, the first setting rellresents the lmst we can do in the absence of the ambiguity since llmlssler's algoritl}m does at good job in exi)loiting the baekgTmnd knowledge fi-om the Selnanti: Ilierarchy.
Comparing Setting 2 with Setting 1 tells us how successfifl our transformatim of the training examl}les is in letting 1D3 make use of the available I}ackground knowledge.
Fimdly, comparing Setting 3 with Settir,g 2 tells ns how successful our transhn'mation is in letting 1133 learn directly froin amt)igalous training examl)les.
The experiments were done tbr six ditl'erent .lapanese ver/}s.
'.\['able 1 shows a list of these verbs, along with the II/lltl})er of training eKauli\])h!s llsed, and the a:cura:y levels obtained by each meth}d.
In the table, "tlausslcr", "ID3 NA" and "11)3 A" de.note Setting 1, Setting 2 and Setting 3, resl}e:tively.
The a(:curacy was esthnated using the leaLvt>olle-{}llt {:rosswflidation meth}d '|, m,d assuming that the rules {:{)mI)osed rnamutlly by human experts are t}erfect (that is, we are measuring how close tim learned rules are to those {:Omllosed mmmally).
The i)erti}rmanee levels of both lhmssler's alg()rithm and ID3 when learning from unambiguous examples are quite similar in Sl)ite of the fact that each algorithm implements a different bias and has a completely diftin'ent way {}f' exl}loiting the background knowledge.
Coml}aring tim l}erformance of ID3 in the two cases of leil.rIlillg froI\[l itIIl\]}ig/l(}llS &ll(\[ IllHlI\[lI)iguous examl}les, ambiguity is not harntful t(} ll)3's l}erforman(:e in most cases.
In fact, for some of the verbs, the t}erforlIl~tn:e is evelk \])etter when aml)iguity is present.
This suggests that the apl}roach we have chosen to de.al with ambiguity is effective for our task, and tl,at ext}licit retll}vitl o\[ ambiguity is not an attractive strategy sim:e it is not easy to {t(}, and since it does not greatly improve the a(:{:m'aey anyway.
The most important ll(}int here is that the ol}served a:cura:y of both the.
11)3 a.lgorithm aim llaussler's algorithm is satisfactorily high overa!.l in spite of the limited mmfl}er of the training examl}k's used.
Such a high level of at(:curat(:y strmgly indicates that the use of these algo,'ithms will provide significant aid in the c}l,struction of AI/.I'-J/E's trmMati}\]t rules.
7 Conclusion
This paper reported our work towaMs the acquisiti(m of,hqmnese-lCmglish translation rules through the use of inductive machine learning techniques.
Two approaches were investigated.
The first aplmmch ix based on a.
theoreticMly-f(mnded algorithm given by l lmlssler fl}r h~arning internal disjunctive eoncel)tS.
This algorithm haLs the advantage that it is tailored to utilize background knowledge, of the kind availabh~ in our domain.
We fnmd, howeww, no obvious way to make this algorithm learn directly t'mm ambignous training examples, and thus, anlbiguity wlm explic-.
itly removed from the training exmnph~s in order to use this algorithm.
Om' second apl)roach ix based on the IDa algorithm.
As it is, i1)3 is not Mile to utilize the background knowledge of our domain, nor is it capable of dealing with ambiguous training exam-I b'Xallll)h, s ill't' vxchldell frOlll the tl'aillillg st,t Ollt * ~l\[ il IilllO.
