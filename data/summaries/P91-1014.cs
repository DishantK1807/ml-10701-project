Approaches in this direction have been investigated (Earley, 1968; Lang, 1974; Tomita, 1985; Tomita, 1987), however none of them is satisfying, either because the worst case complexity is deteriorated (worse than Earley's parser) or because the technique is not general.

Several other methods (such as LR(k)-like, SLR(k)like) can also be used for constructing the parsing tables and are described in (Schabes, 1991).

The detailed proofs are given in (Schabes, 1991).

6Due to the lack of space, the details of the implementation are not given in this paper but they are given in (Schabes, 1991).

We have adapted the technique presented in this paper to other grammatical formalism such as treeadjoining grammars (Schabes, 1991).
P91-1014
It can also be extended to handle unification based grammars using a similar method as that employed by Shieber (1985) for extending Earley's algorithm.
