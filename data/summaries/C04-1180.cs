Clark and Curran (2004a) demonstrates that this relatively small set has high coverage on unseen data and can be used to create low.

And third, there exist highly accurate, efficient and robust CCG parsers which can be used directly for this task (Clark and Curran, 2004b; Hockenmaier, 2003).

Toutanova et al.(2002) and Kaplan et al.(2004) combine statistical methods with a linguistically motivated grammar formalism (HPSG and LFG respectively) in an attempt to achieve levels of robustness and accuracy comparable to the Penn Treebank parsers (which Kaplan et al.do achieve).

Parser A number of statistical parsers have recently been developed for CCG (Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b; Clark and Curran, 2004b).

In this paper we use the Clark and Curran (2004b) parser, which uses a loglinear model of normal-form derivations to select an analysis.
C04-1041 P04-1014
There is, however, an accepted way of evaluating the syntactic component of the system, namely to calculate precision and recall figures for labelled syntactic dependencies (Clark et al., 2002).

Clark and Curran (2004a) shows how dynamic use of the supertagger — starting off with a small number of categories assigned to each word and gradually increasing the number until an analysis is found — can lead to a highly efficient and robust parser.

Clark and Curran (2003) and Clark and Curran (2004b) describe how a packed chart can be used to efficiently represent the derivation space, and also efficient algorithms for finding the most probable derivation.

All of these parsers use a grammar derived from CCGbank (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a; Hockenmaier, 2003), a treebank of normalform CCG derivations derived semi-automatically from the Penn Treebank.

Collins (1999), Charniak (2000)) have led to their use in a number of NLP applications, such as question-answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001), machine translation (Charniak et al., 2003), sentence simplification (Carroll et al., 1999), and a linguist’s search engine (Resnik and Elkiss, 2003).

The accuracy of the parser is reported in Clark and Curran (2004b): 84.6% F-score over labelled dependencies for section 23.
C04-1041 P04-1014
The parser also uses a number of unary type-changing rules (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a) and punctuation rules taken from CCGbank.
P02-1043
Previous work, such as Liakata and Pulman (2002) and Cahill et al.(2003), has attempted to generate semantic representations from the Penn Treebank.
C02-1105
A CCG supertagger (Clark and Curran, 2004a) is used to assign the categories.
C04-1041 P04-1014
The only other deep parser we are aware of to achieve such levels of robustness for the WSJ is Kaplan et al.(2004). The use of the λ-calculus is integral to our method.
