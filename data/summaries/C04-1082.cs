In the HMM based taggers framework, our work bears a certain resemblance with (Brants, 2000) who distinguishes between reliable and unreliable tag assignments using probabilities computed by the tagger.

The second direction concerns experiments on supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) followed by a parsing stage the tagging stage associates to each word a supertag.

The tagger described in this paper is based on the standard Hidden Markov Model architecture (Charniak et al., 1993; Brants, 2000).

The same kind of idea is developed in (Brants, 1995).

The model described in section 2 has been tested on the Brown corpus (Francis and Kuâ€¢cera, 1982), tagged with the 45 tags of the Penn treebank tagset (Marcus et al., 1993), which constitute the initial tagset T0.
