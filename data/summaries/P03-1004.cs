In previous research, we presented a state-of-the-art SVMs-based Japanese dependency parser (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

This property is critical and some reports say that, in NLP, the polynomial kernel outperforms the simple linear kernel (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).

For example, an SVM-based NE-chunker runs at a rate of only 85 byte/sec, while previous rulebased system can process several kilobytes per second (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).

We use a standard data set (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) consisting of sections 15-19 of the WSJ corpus as training and section 20 as testing.

In our experiments, we used the same settings as (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

Isozaki et al.propose an XQK (eXpand the Quadratic Kernel) which can make their Named-Entity recognizer drastically fast (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002).

Examples include Part-of-Speech tagging (Nakagawa et al., 2002) Text Chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), Named Entity Recognition (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), and Japanese Dependency Parsing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).
