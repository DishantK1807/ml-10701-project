Over the last decade or so there has been
growing interest in research on computation-
ally analyzing opinions, feelings, and subjec-
tive evaluation in text. This burgeoning body
of work, variously called “sentiment anal-
ysis,” “opinion mining,” and “subjectivity
analysis,” addresses such problems as dis-
tinguishing objective from subjective propo-
sitions, characterizing positive and negative
evaluations, determining the sources of dif-
ferent opinions expressed in a document,
and summarizing writers’ judgments over a
large corpus of texts. Potential applications
include Web mining for consumer and po-
litical opinion summarization, business and
government intelligence analysis, and im-
proving text analysis applications such as in-
formation retrieval, question answering, and
textsummarization.
In this well-written book, Pang and Lee
survey the current state of the art in opinion
mining and sentiment analysis, broadly con-
strued,withthegoalofﬁttingthisdiversere-
search area into a uniﬁed framework. After
a brief introduction to the area (Chap-
ter 1) and survey of application areas (Chap-
ter 2), the authors present their view of the
central challenges that unify this research
area in Chapter 3, largely by contrasting it
with “traditional,” “fact-based” text analy-
sis. The book then surveys the full range
of extant approaches, dividing them into
sentimentclassiﬁcationandextraction(Chap-
ter 4), and opinion summarization (Chap-
ter 5). This survey is quite thorough as
regards computational work in the area,
though it lacks detailed reference to rel-
evant linguistics research such as in the
study of modality (Nuyts 2001; K¨arkk¨ainen
2003), cognitive linguistics (Stein and Wright
1995; Langacker 2002), and appraisal theory
(Martin and White 2005). This lacuna is justi-
ﬁed, however, by the (perhaps unfortunate)
fact that little computational work to date
relatestothisliterature.

A distinctive and valuable feature of the
book is the inclusion of material on the re-
lationship between subjective language and
its social and economic impact (Chapter 6).
This discussion helps to place the technical
work in its larger context, pointing towards
opportunities and risks in its application in
various situations. Also particularly valuable
is Chapter 7, on publicly available resources,
which includes much useful information
about available data sets, relevant competi-
tiveevaluations,andtutorials/bibliographies
in the area. Although much of this informa-
tion is likely to become outdated, the authors
also maintain a companion Web site
2
which
presumably will feature updates to this re-
sourcelist.
The book provides a useful resource for
application developers as well as for re-
searchers, though some readers might have
beneﬁted from a more extensive discussion
of real-world applications and how various
techniques can be used as components of
largersystems.
Overall, this slim and entertaining volume
is an excellent and timely survey of an
exciting and growing research area within
computational linguistics.—Shlomo Argamon,
