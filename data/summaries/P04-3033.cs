It develops on our previous work on a multimodal city guide on a mobile tablet (MATCH) (Johnston et al., 2001; Johnston et al., 2002b; Johnston et al., 2002a).

These are then combined and assigned a meaning representation using a multimodal language processing architecture based on finite-state techniques (MMFST) (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000; Johnston et al., 2002b).

This lattice is flattened to an N-best list and passed to a multimodal dialog manager (MDM) (Johnston et al., 2002b) which re-ranks them in accordance with the current dialogue state.
