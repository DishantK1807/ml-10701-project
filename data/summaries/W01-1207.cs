These terms are used by FASTR (Jacquemin 1999), a shallow transformational natural language analyzer that recognizes their occurrences and their variants.

Kwok et al (2000), for instance use an IR engine that retrieves the top 300 sub-documents of about 300-550 words and, on the other hand, the FALCON system (Harabagiu et all 2000) performs a paragraph retrieval stage after the application of a boolean retrieval engine.

Term variation may involve structural, morphological, and semantic transformations of single or multiwords terms (Fabre and Jacquemin, 2000).

The weighting scheme relies on a measure of quality of the different families of variations described by Jacqueminï¿½(1999): non-variant occurrences are weighted 3.0, morphological and morphosyntactic variants are weighted 2.0, and semantic and morpho-syntactico-semantic variants are weighted 1.0.
