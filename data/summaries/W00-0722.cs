As the underlying objective of the project is to retrieve documents, the main and most complete information is provided by the first-stage guesser, and the second-stage is only interesting for MS tagging, as in (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995).

We attempted to set a confidence threshold, so that for similarly weighted transitions, the system would keep the ambiguity, as in (Weischedel and al., 1993), but results were not satisfying.
J93-2006
Concerning the ambiguities, we found that 5 tokens were responsible for half of the ambiguities, while in unrestricted corpora this number seems around 16 (Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995).
