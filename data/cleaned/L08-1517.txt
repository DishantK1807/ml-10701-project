For automatic speech transcription, it is usual to partition broadcast news data as a sequence of individual speaker turns, setting aside overlapping segments with a precise temporal anchoring (Barras et al., 2001), as their processing remains beyond the scope of state-of-the-art systems. Our corpus of political interviews is less controlled than broadcast news, and a crude segmentation of overlapping segments</context>

However overlapping speech, i.e. speech portions simultaneously involving more than one speaker, is very common in natural communication (Delmonte, 2005). Overlaps in speech may entail disfluencies (hesitations, repetitons, restarts) and are likely to contribute to speaker turn regulation. They definitely cause problems for automatic processing (Shri</context>

Enriched and more accurate models are necessary for both talk-in-interaction analysis and speech recognition (Delmonte, 2005; Schegloff et al., 1977).
