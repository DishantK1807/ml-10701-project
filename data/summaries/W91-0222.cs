Recently, there has been much discussion in the literature regarding the interaction of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics (see, for example, \[Bennett et hi., 1990\], \[Hinrichs, 1988\], \[Maybury, 1990\], \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\], \[Nakhimovsky, 1988\], \[Passonneau, 1988\], \[Pustejovsky, 1988, 1989\], and \[Tenny, 1989\]).

Note that the system of features proposed by \[Bennett et al., 1990\] and \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\] provide the finest tuning given that five distinct categories of predicates are identified by the feature settings.

Among those who have studied lexical-semantic representations, many have taken the work of \[Jackendoff, 1983, 1990\] as a starting point (see, for example, \[Brent, 1988\], \[Dorr, 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c\], \[Levin and Rappaport, 1985\], and \[Siskind, 1989\]), while others have built on the work of \[Dowty, 1979\] and \[Vendler, 1967\] (see, for example, \[Bennett et hi., 1990\], \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\], \[Nakhimovsky, 1988\], and \[Passonneau, 1988\]), and still others have followed \[Mourelatos, 1981\] and \[Comrie, 1976\] (see, for example, \[Bach, 1986\] and \[Pustejovksy, 1989\]).

Among those who have studied the problem of tense and/or aspect, many have taken the work of \[Reichenbach, 1947\] as a starting point (see, for example, \[Brent, 1988\], \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\], \[Hornstein, 1990\], and \[Passonneau, 1988\]), while others have built on the work of \[Allen, 1983, 1984\] (see, for example, \[Vilain et hi., 1990\], and \[Williams, 1990\]), and still others have based their investigation on a combination of Allen and Reichenbach's work (see, for example, \[Yip, 1985\]).

According to \[Bennett et al., 1990\] (in the spirit of \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\]), predicates are allowed to undergo an atomicity "coercion" in which an inherently non-atomic predicate (such as dio) may become atomic under certain conditions.

(See \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\] and \[Yip, 1985\] among others).

Thus, there is an important distinction between \[Hornstein, 1990\], in which the asymmetrical property is fundamental to the theory, and \[Yip, 1985\], in which the asymmetrical property is entirely abandoned.
P85-1003
Such distinctions are omitted in \[Yip, 1985\], where all events are merged under the single heading dynamic, and a constraint on temporal interpretations is applied uniformly across all verbs in this category.

The subdivision is achieved by means of three features proposed by \[Bennett et al., 1990\] following the framework of \[Moens and Steedman, 1988\] (in the spirit of \[Dowty, 1979\] and \[Vendler, 1967\]): ~dynamic (i.e., events vs.

The lexical-semantic representation that is adopted as the interlingua for the UNITRAN machine translation system \[Dorr, 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c\] is an extended version of lezical conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see \[Jackendoff, 1983, 1990\]).

There are two important advantages to using the featural scheme of figure 4 over the less specific scheme of \[Yip, 1985\]: (1) it provides a more precise specification of states and events; and (2) it includes temporal/aspectual information that is important for the realization of other types of surface-structure constituents (besides temporal connectives) such as the number of a verbal object.

examples of when constructions (taken from \[Yip, 1985\]) are shown here: 1° (Note that the word when potentially maps to more than one temporal relation if we adopt Allen's framework).
