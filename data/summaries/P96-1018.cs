These two parameters permit more effective relaxation than the single parameter used in conventional methods(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993).

One of the major approaches is based on the statistics of simple features such as sentence length in words (Brown and others, 1991) or in characters (Gale and Church, 1993).

Our evaluation focuses on much smaller texts than those used in other study(Brown and others, 1993; Gale and Church, 1993; Wu, 1994; Fung, 1995; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) because our main targets are well-separated articles.

2We use in this phase the JUMAN morphological analyzing system (Kurohashi et al., 1994) for tagging Japanese texts and Brill's transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994) for tagging English texts (JUMAN: ftp://ftp.aist-nara.ac.jp/pub/nlp/tools/juman/ Brih ftp://ftp.cs.jhu.edu/pub/brill).

Corpus-based approaches based on bilingual texts are promising for various applications(i.e., lexical knowledge extraction (Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Dagan and Church, 1994; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Haruno et al., 1996), machine translation (Brown and others, 1993; Sato and Nagao, 1990; Kaji et al., 1992) and information retrieval (Sato, 1992)).

We construct the initial ASM using such a function that pairs sentences near the middle of the two anchors with as many as O(~/~) (L is the number of sentences existing between two anchors) sentences in the other text because the maximum deviation can be stochastically modeled as O(~rL) (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993).

Although their approaches are robust for noisy corpora and do not require any information source, aligned sentences are necessary for higher level applications such as well-grained translation template acquisition (Matsumoto et as., 1993; Smadja et al., 1996; Haruno et al., 1996) and example-based translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990).

This is identical to Kay's method (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) except for the statistics used.
J93-1006
(Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) proposed a relaxation method to iteratively align bilingual texts using the word correspondences acquired during the alignment process.

Other methods in the lexicon-based approach embed lexical knowledge into stochastic models (Wu, 1994; Chen, 1993), but these methods were tested using rigid translations.

(Fung and Church, 1994; Fung, 1995) proposed methods to find Chinese-English word correspondences without aligning parallel texts.
