This differs from typical generative settings for IR and MT (Ponte and croft, 1998; Brown et al., 1993), where all conditioned events are disjoint by construction.

Alternatively, one can view (2) as inducing an alignment between terms in the h to the terms in the t, somewhat similar to alignment models in statistical MT (Brown et al., 1993).
