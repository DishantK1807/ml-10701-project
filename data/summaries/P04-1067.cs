In appendix A we show how this method generalizes over the probabilistic approach presented in (Dejean et al., 2002).

P(wjC). Now, if we are looking for those ws closest to a given v, we rely on: S(wjv) / X C P(Cjv)P(wjC) which is the probabilistic model adopted in (Dejean et al., 2002).

approach Bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora has been studied by a number of researchers, (Rapp, 1995; Peters and Picchi, 1995; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Shahzad et al., 1999; Fung, 2000, among others).

Sections 3 to 4 then describe three new methods aiming at addressing the issues raised by synonymy and polysemy: in section 3 we introduce an extension of the standard approach, and show in appendix A how this approach relates to the probabilistic method proposed in (Dejean et al., 2002); in section 4, we present a bilingual extension to LSA, namely canonical correlation analysis and its kernel version; lastly, in section 5, we formulate the problem in terms of probabilistic LSA and review different associated similarities.

One way to circumvent this requirement consists in automatically building a seed lexicon based on spelling and cognates clues (Koehn and Knight, 2002).
