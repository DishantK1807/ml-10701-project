The proposed approach is also amenable to an efficient implementation by finite state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).

The preprocessor module also performs a number of additional functions such as grouping of lexicalizcd and non-lexicalized collocations, compound verbs, etc., (Ofiazer and Kurubz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996).

The convenience of adding new rules in without worrying about where exactly it goes in terms of rule ordering (something that hampered our progress in our earlier work on disambiguating Turkish morphology (Oflazer and KuruSz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996)), has also been a key positive point.

There has been a large number of studies in tagging and morphological disambiguation using various techniques such as statistical techniques, e.g., (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992; DeRose, 1988), constraint-based techniques (Karlsson et al., 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Voutilainen, Heikkil/i, and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993; Oflazer and KuruSz, 1994; Oflazer and Till 1996) and transformation-based techniques (Brilt, 1992; Brill, 1994; Brill, 1995).

We evaluate the resulting disambiguated text by a number of metrics defined as follows (Voutilainen, 1995a): #Parses Ambiguity#Tokens Recall = #Tokens Correctly Disambiguated #Tokens Precision = #Tokens Correctly Disambiguated #Parses In the ideal case where each token is uniquely and correctly disambiguated with the correct parse, both recall and precision will be 1.0.

This is very similar to Brill's use of contexts to induce transformation rules for his tagger (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1995), but instead of generating transformation rules from a training text, we gather statistics and apply them to parses in the text being disambiguated.

Furthermore, Turkish allows very productive derivational processes and the information about the derivational structure of a word form is usually crucial for disambiguation (Oflazer and Tiir, 1996).

However, the use of regular relations and finite state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1994) provide a very efficient implementation method.

This unknown word processor has a (nominal) root lexicon which recognizes S +, where S is the Turkish surface alphabet (in the two-level morphology sense), but then tries to interpret an arbitrary postfix string of the unknown word, as a sequence of Turkish suffixes subject to all morphographemic constraints (Oflazer and Tfir, 1996).

Rule ordering issue has been discussed by Voutilainen(1994), but he has recently indicated 1 that insensitivity to rule ordering is not a property of their system (although Voutilainen(1995a) states that it is a very desirable property) but rather is achieved by extensively testing and tuning the rules.
