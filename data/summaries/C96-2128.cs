2In this pape, r we follow (Shieber et al., 1990) and (Pollard add Sag, 1.994) in equating logical form with semmltic content.

Like the CLE generator, SGX follows the semantic head-driven (SHD) generation algoril;hm (Shieber et al., 1990) to ensure efficient ordering of the geImration process.

Our approach is therefore incremental description refinement (Mellish, 1988) rather than constraint relaxation.

This could be improved by using constraints to enable subcat-changing rules to be delayed (van Noord and Bouma, 1994; Meurers and Minnen, 1995).

Also like CLE, l'rol!Tl' uses the technique of (Mellish, 1988) tbr compiling finite domains such as index agreement into booh;an vectors for fast unification.

Describing the implementation of delayed lexical choice in the MiMo2 system, Shieber et al.(1990) pointed out that only monotonic rules (which tiltther instantiate the feature structure of a lcxical item but do not change it) can be delayed.
