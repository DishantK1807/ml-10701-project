Nearly all existing unification grammars of this kind use either term unification (the kind of unification used in resolution theorem provers, and hence provided as a primitive in PROLOG) or some version of the graph unification proposed by Kay {1985) and Shieber (1984).
P84-1075
It is well-known that disjunctive unification is NPcomplete (Kasper 1987).
P87-1033
It is not, unfortunately, possible to keep it close to both FUG and PATR (Shieber 1984), but it should be possible for readers familiar with PATR to see roughly what the relation between the two is.
P84-1075
Although categorial grammars have recently received considerable attention (Pareschi & Steedman (1987), Klein & van Benthem (1987), Oehrle, Bach & Wheeler (1987)), computational treatments have been hindered by the need to develop and manipulate large category descriptions.
