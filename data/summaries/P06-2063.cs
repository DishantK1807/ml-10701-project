This work differs in important ways from studies in (Hu and Liu, 2004) and (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

Maximum Entropy models implement the intuition that the best model is the one that is consistent with the set of constraints imposed by the evidence but otherwise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).

Beyond document level sentiment classification in online product reviews, (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) concentrated on mining and summarizing reviews by extracting opinion sentences regarding product features.

Sentiment of phrases and sentences has also been studied in (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005).

(Bethard et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006) identified the holder (source) of opinions expressed in sentences using various techniques.

Semantic orientation classification is a task of determining positive or negative sentiment of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).

In our previous work (Kim and Hovy, 2005), we demonstrated that the list of words produced by a combination of those two methods performed very well in detecting opinion bearing sentences.

These features test the intuition used in document summarization that important sentences that contain topics in a text have certain positional patterns in a paragraph (Lin and Hovy, 1997), which may apply because reasons like pros and cons in a review document are most important sentences that summarize the whole point of the review.
