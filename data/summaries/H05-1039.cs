Work in combining linguistic analysis with patterns include Weischedel et al.(2004) and Jijkoun et al.(2004) where manually constructed patterns are used to augment linguistic features.

We use Rouge, an automatic evaluation metric that was originally used for summarization evaluation (Lin and Hovy, 2003) and was recently found useful for evaluating definitional question answering (Xu et al., 2004).

Work Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) presents a method that learns patterns from online data using some seed questions and answer anchors.

Linguistic Analysis We use SERIF (Ramshaw et al., 2001), a linguistic analysis engine, to perform full parsing, name entity detection, relation detection, and co-reference resolution.

However, manual pattern construction critically depends on the domain knowledge of the pattern designer and often has low coverage (Jijkoun et al., 2004).

Coreference is determined using an information extraction engine, SERIF (Ramshaw et al., 2001).

Recently, researchers have started automatic question answering evaluation (Xu et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Soricut and Brill, 2004).

Hildebrandt et al.(2004) uses manual surface patterns for target extraction to augment database and dictionary lookup.

Deep linguistic analysis has been found useful in factoid question answering (Moldovan et al., 2002) and has been used for definitional questions (Xu et al., 2004; Harabagiu et al., 2003).

Automatic pattern derivation is more appealing (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

To answer these questions, we perform extensive experiments on Chinese TDT4 data (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2002-2003).
