(Brown et al., 1993) then extended their method and established a sound probabilistic model series, relying on different parameters describing how words within parallel sentences are aligned to each other.

Some more specific works describe methods to align noun phrases within parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993).

100 97 200 94 Table 2: Multiword notion results As a comparison, (Kupiec, 1993) obtained a precision of 90% for the first hundred associations between English and French noun phrases, using the EM algorithm.

On the other hand, (Dagan et al., 1993) proposed an algorithm, borrowed to the field of dynamic programming and based on the output of their previous work, to find the best alignment, subject to certain constraints, between words in parallel sentences.

Probabilities based on relative frequencies, or derived fl'om the measure defined in (Dunning, 1993), for example, allow to take this fact into account.

Early works, (Gale and Church, 1993; Brown et al., 1993), and to a certain extent (Kay and R6scheisen, 1993), presented methods to ex~.:'~.ct bi'_.'i~gua! le~cons of words from a parallel COl'p~s, relying on the distribution of the words in the set of parallel sentences (or other units).

Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and the above methodology suffers from the weaknesses pointed out by (Wu, 1997) concerning parse-parse-match procedures.

A similar algorithm was used by (Vogel et al., 1996).
