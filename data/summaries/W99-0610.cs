(Shimohata et al., 1997) employed entropy value to filter out fragments of the adjacent n-gram model.

According to Breidt, MI or T-score thresholds work satisfactory as a filter for extraction of collocations, but filtered out at least half of the actual collocations (Breidt, 1993).

Based on this assumption, (Smadja, 1993) stored all bigrams of words along with their relative position, p (-5 < p _~ 5).
