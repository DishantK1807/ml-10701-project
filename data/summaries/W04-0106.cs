In (Neuvel and Fulop, 2002), a morphological learner based on the theory of Whole Word Morphology is outlined.

In order to cope with a broader range of languages we would need the following: On the one hand, words should be allowed to consist of any number of alternating stems and affixes, making the model more flexible than, e.g., the model in (Goldsmith, 2001).

In (Goldsmith, 2001) a recursive structure is proposed, such that stems can consist of a sub-stem and a suffix.

Typically, generative models are used, either formulated in a Bayesian framework, e.g., (Brent, 1999; Creutz, 2003); or applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, e.g., (de Marcken, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2002).

Other algorithms (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz, 2003) have been developed for highly-inflecting languages, such as Finnish, where words can consist of lengthy sequences of alternating stems and affixes (see Fig.

Other algorithms combine information of both orthographic and semantic similarity of words (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; Baroni et al., 2002).

Experiments show that the new algorithm is able to obtain considerable improvements over the segmentation produced by the algorithm described in (Creutz, 2003).

segmentation A good initial morph segmentation is obtained by the baseline segmentation method (Creutz and Lagus, 2002).

The new category-learning algorithm is compared to two other algorithms, namely the baseline segmentation algorithm presented in (Creutz, 2003), which was also utilized for initializing the segmentation in the category-learning algorithm, and the Linguistica algorithm (Goldsmith, 2001).3 4.1 Data sets The Finnish corpus consists of mainly news texts from the CSC (The Finnish IT Center for Science)4 and the Finnish News Agency.

Often words are assumed to consist of one stem followed by one, possibly empty, suffix as in, e.g., (DÂ´ejean, 1998; Snover and Brent, 2001).

On the other hand, in contrast with (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz, 2003), sequential dependencies between morphs, i.e., morphotactics, should be taken into account in order to reduce the error rate.

Moreover, it performs better than a state-of-the-art morphologylearning algorithm, Linguistica (Goldsmith, 2001), when evaluated on Finnish data.

Further cues for morphological learning are presented in (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) and (Yarowsky and Wicentowsky, 2000).
