Recognition for such 'off-line parsable' grammars is decidable (Pereira and Warren, 1983).
P83-1021
Cycles might emerge to treat unknown sequences of words, i.e. sentences with unknown parts of unknown lengths (Lang, 1988).
C88-1075
Such an approach allows for the treatment of missing, extraneous, interchanged or misused words (Teitelbaum, 1973; Saito and Tomita, 1988; Nederhof and Bertsch, 1994).
C88-2118
But if we use existing techniques for parsing DCGs, then we are also confronted with an undecidability problem: the recognition problem for DCGs is undecidable (Pereira and Warren, 1983).
