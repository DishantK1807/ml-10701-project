In this paper, we use the eXtensible MetaGrammar (XMG) tool which was developed by Crabb´e 1But several attempts have been made to explicitly add functions to TAG, e.g. by Kameyama (1986) to retain the benefits of both TAG and LFG, or by Prolo (2006) to account for the coordination of constituents of different categories, yet sharing the same function.

In this paper, we extend some earlier work on multilingual MGs (Candito, 1998; Kinyon and Rambow, 2003) by proposing crosslinguistic and framework-neutral syntactic invariants, which we apply to TAG.
P98-1033
The notion of Metagrammar Metagrammars were first introduced by Candito (1996) to manually encode syntactic knowledge in a compact and abstract class hierarchy which supports multiple inheritance, and from which a TAG is automatically generated offline.

For instance, TAG does not have an explicit notion of syntactic function: although by convention node indices tend to reflect a function, it is not enforced by the framework’s machinery.1 Hypertags Based on such frameworkand language-neutral syntactic properties, Kinyon (2000) defined the notion of Hypertag (HT), a combination of Supertags (ST) Srinivas (1997) and of the MG.
