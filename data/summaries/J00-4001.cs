Many researchers, therefore, try to avoid the use of features related to syntactic annotation in order to avoid such problems (Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch~itze 1997).

Such counts are a reliable discriminating factor (Karlgreen and Cutting 1994; Kessler, Nunberg, and Schi~tze 1997) and have been applied to many works in text genre detection.
P97-1005
In general, the use of already existing corpora not built for text genre detection (e.g., the Brown corpus) raises several problems since such categories may not be stylistically homogeneous (Kessler, Nunberg, and Schiitze 1997).
P97-1005
The set we propose, therefore, can be compared to the ones used in similar studies of English (Karlgren and Cutting 1994; Biber 1995).

Discriminant analysis has been employed by researchers in automatic text genre detection (Biber 1993b; Karlgren and Cutting 1994) since it offers a simple and robust solution despite the fact that it presupposes normal distributions of the discriminating variables.

Biber (1990, 1993a) claims that it is possible to represent the distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category based on relatively few texts from each category (as few as 10 texts), but we were interested in exploring the way in which the identification error rate is affected by increasing the training data.

For example, some similar measures have been used in stylistic experiments in information retrieval on the basis of a robust parser built for information retrieval purposes (Strzalkowski 1994).
A94-1028
To this end, various sets of style markers have been proposed (Karlgren and Cutting 1994), all of which are, in essence, subsets of the set used by Biber (1995), who ranked registers along seven dimensions by applying factor analysis to a set of lexical and syntactic style markers that had been manually counted.
C94-2174
Note that according to Biber (1990, 1993a) a text length of 1,000 words is adequate for representing the distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category.
J93-2001
The most important computational approaches to text genre detection have focused on the use of simple measures that can be easily detected and reliably counted by a computational tool (Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch~itze 1997).
P97-1005
Typical classificatory tasks in computational stylistics are the following: â€¢ Text genre detection concerns the identification of the kind (or functional style) of the text (Karlgren and Cutting 1994; Michos et al.1996; Kessler, Nunberg, and Schi.itze 1997).
