Abstract 
This paper presents a system which automatically 
generates shallow semantic frame structures for con
versational speech in unrestricted domains. 
We argue that such shallow semantic representations 
can indeed be generated with a minimum amount of 
linguistic knowledge engineering and without having 
to explicitly construct a semantic knowledge base. 
The system is designed to be robust to deal with the 
problems of speech dysfluencies, ungrammaticalities, 
and imperfect speech recognition. 
Initial results on speech transcripts are promising 
in that correct mappings could be identified in 21% 
of the clauses of a test set (resp. 44% of this test 
set where ungrammatical or verb-less clauses were 
removed). 
1 Introduction

In syntactic and semantic analysis of spontaneous 
speech, little research has been done with regard 
to dealing with language in unrestricted domains. 
There are several reasons why so far an in-depth 
analysis of this type of language data has been con
sidered prohibitively hard: 
• inherent properties of spontaneous speech, such 
as dysfluencies and ungrammaticalities (Lavie, 
1996) 
• word accuracy being far from perfect (e.g., on a 
typical corpus such as SWITCHBOARD (SWBD) 
(Godfrey et al., 1992), current state-of-the-art 
recognizers have word error rates in the range 
of 30-40% (Finke et al., 1997)) 
• if the domain is unrestricted, manual construc
tion of a semantic knowledge base with reason
able coverage is very labor intensive 
In this paper we propose to combine methods of 
partial parsing ("chunking") with the mapping of 
the verb arguments onto subcategorization frames 
that can be extracted automatically, in this case, 
from WordNet (Miller et al., 1993). As prelimi
nary results indicate, this yields a way of generating 
shallow semantic representations efficiently and with 
minimal manual effort. 
Eventually, these semantic structures can serve as 
(additional) input to a variety of different tasks in 
NLP, such as text or dialogue summarization, in
formation gisting, information retrieval, or shallow 
machine translation. 
2 Shallow
Semantic Structures 
The two main representations we are building on are 
the following: 
• chunks: these correspond mostly to basic (i.e., 
non-attached) phrasal constituents 
• frames: these are built from the parsed chunks 
according to subcategorization constraints ex
tracted from the WordNet lexicon 
The chunks are defined in a similar way as in (Ab
ney, 1996), namely as "non-recursive phrasal units"; 
they roughly correspond to the standard linguistic 
notion of constituents, except that there are no at
tachments made (e.g., a PP to a NP) and that a ver
bal chunk does not include any of its arguments but 
just consists of the verbal complex (auxiliary/main 
verb), including possibly inserted adverbs and/or 
negation particles. 
All frames are being generated on the basis of 
"short clauses" which we define as minimal clausal 
units that contain at least one subject and an in
flected verbal form. 1 2 
To produce the list of all possible subcategoriza
tion frames, we first extracted all verbal tokens from 
the tagged SWITCHBOARD corpus and then retrieved 
the frames from WordNet. Table 1 provides a sum
mary of this pre-calculation. 
1This means in effect that relative clauses will get mapped 
separately. They will, however, have to be "linked" to the 
phrase they modify. 
2We are also considering to take even shorter units as basis 
for the mapping that would, e.g., include non-inflected clausal 
complements. The most convenient solution has yet to be 
determined.

3 Resources
and System 
Components 
We use the following resources to build our system: 
* the SWITCHBOAaD (SWBD) corpus (Godfrey 
et al., 1992) for speech data, transcripts, and 
annotations at various levels (e.g., for segment 
boundaries or parts of speech) 
* the JANUS speech recognizer (Waibel et al., 
1996) to provide us with input hypotheses 
* a part of speech (POS) tagger, derived from 
(Brill, 1994), adapted to and retrained for the 
SWITCHBOARD corpus 
* a preprocessing pipe which cleans up speech 
dysfluencies (e.g., repetitions, hesitations) and 
contains a segmentation module to split the 
speech recognizer turns into short clauses 
* a chart parser (Ward, 1991) with a POS based 
grammar to generate the chunks 3 (phrasal con
stituents) 
. WordNet 1.5 (Miller et al., 1993) for the extrac
tion of subcategorization (subcat) frames for all 
senses of a verb (including semantic features, 
such as "animacy") 
. a mapper which tries to find the "best match" 
between the chunks found within a short clause 
and the subcat frames for the main verb in that 
clause 
The major blocks of the system architecture are 
depicted in Figure 1. 
We want to stress here that except for the devel
opment of the small POS grammar and the frame
mapper, the other components and resources were 
already present or quite simple to implement. There 
has also been significant work on (semi-)autolnatic 
induction of subcategorization frames (Manning, 
1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997), such that even

(Zechner, 1997). ,nput uIier.nco

without the important knowledge source from Word
Net, a similar system could be built for other lan
guages as well. Also, the Euro-WordNet project 
(Vossen et al., 1997) is currently underway in build
ing WordNet resources for other European lan
guages. 
4 Preliminary
Experiments 
We performed some initial experiments using the 
SWBD transcripts as input to the system. These 
were POS tagged, preprocessed, segmented into 
short clauses, parsed in chunks using a POS 
based grammar, and finally, for each short clause, 
the frame-mapper matched all potential arguments 
of the verb against all possible subcategorization 
frames listed in the lemmata file we had precom
puted from WordNet (see section 2). 
In total we had over 600000 short clauses, con
taNning approximately 1.7 million chunks. Only 18 
different chunk patterns accounted for about half 
of these short clauses. Table 2 shows these chunk

patterns and their frequencies. 4 Most of these con
tain main verbs and hence can be sensibly used 
in a mapping procedure but some of them (e.g., 
aff, con j, advp) do not. These are typically back
channellings, adverbial comments, and colloquial 
forms (e.g., "yeah", "and...", "oh really"). They can 
be easily dealt with a preprocessing module that as
signs them to one of these categories and does not 
send them to the mapper. 
Another interesting observation we make here is 
that within these most common chunk patterns, 
there is only one pattern (np vb np pp) which could 
lead to a potential PP-attachment ambiguity. We 
conjecture that this is most probably due to the na
ture of conversational speech which, unlike for writ
ten (and more formal) language, does not make too 
frequent use of complex noun phrases that have one 
or multiple prepositional phrases attached to them. 
We selected 98 short clauses randomly from the 
output to perform a first error analysis. 
The results are summarized in Table 3. In over 
21% of the clauses, the mapper finds at least one 
mapping that is correct. Another 23.5% of the 
clauses do not contain any chunks that are worth 
to be mapped in the first place (noises, hesitations),

abbreviations: conjmconjunction, aft=affirmative, 
np=noun phrase, vb=verbal chunk, vbneg=negated ver
bal chunk, adjp=adjeetival phrase, advp=adverbiM phrase, 
pp=prepositional phrase. 
so these could be filtered out and dealt with entirely 
before the mapping process takes place, as we men
tioned earlier. 28.6% of the clauses are in some sense 
incomplete, mostly they are lacking a main verb 
which is the crucial element to get the mapping pro
cedure started. We regard these as "hard" residues, 
including well-known linguistic problems such as el
lipsis, in addition to some spoken language ungram
maticalities. The last two categories (26.6% com
bined) in the table are due to the incompleteness and 
inaccuracies of the system components themselves.

Since chunks like advp or conj are not part of the 
WordNet frames, we remove these from the parsed 
chunk sequence, before a mapping attempt is being 
made. 7 
In our example, WordNet yields 14 frames for 6 
senses of the main verb talk. The mapper already 
finds a "perfect match "s for the first, i.e., the most 
frequent sense 9 of the verb (mapping 4 can be es
timated to be more accurate than mapping 3 since 
also the preposition matches to the input string). 
This will be also the default sense to choose, unless 
there is a word sense disambiguating module avail
able that strongly favors a less frequent sense. 
Since WordNet 1.5 does not provide detailed 
semantic frame information but only general 
subcategorization with extensions such as "ani
mate/inanimate", we plan to extend this infor
ruation by processing machine-readable dictionaries 
which provide a richer set of semantic role informa
tion of verbal heads. 1° 
It is interesting to see that even at this early stage 
of our project the results of this shallow analysis are 
quite encouraging. If we remove those clauses from 
the test set which either should not or cannot be 
mapped in the first place (because they are either 
not containing any structure ("non-mappable") or 
are ungrammatical), the remainder of 47 clauses al
ready has a success-rate of 44.7%. Improvements of 
the system components bcfoT~e the mapping stage as 
well as to the mapper itself will further increase the 
mapping performance. 
"rThese chunks can be easily added to the mapper's output 
again, as shown in the example. 
8Partial matches, such as mappings 1 and 2 in this exam
pie, are allowed but disfavored to perfect matches. 
°In WordNet 1.5, the first sense is also supposed to be the 
most frequent one. 
l°The "agent" and "theme" assignments are currently just 
defaults for these types of subcat frames. 
5 Future
Work 
It is obvious from our evaluation, that most core 
components, specifically the mapper need to be im
proved and refined. As for the mapper, there are 
issues of constituent coordination, split verbs, infini
tival complements, that need to be addressed and 
properly handled. Also, the "linkage" between main 
and relative clauses has to be performed such that 
this information is maintained and not lost due to 
the segmentation into short clauses. 
Experiments with speech recognizer output in
stead of transcripts will show in how far we still get 
reasonable frame representations when we are faced 
with erroneous input in the first place. Specifically, 
since the mapper relies on the identification of the 
"head verb", it will be crucial that at least those 
words are correctly recognized and tagged most of 
the time. 
To further enhance our representation, we could 
use speech act tags, generated by all automatic 
speech act classifier (Finke et al., 1998) and attach 
these to the short clauses, n 
6 Summary

We have presented a system which is able to build 
shallow semantic representations for spontaneous 
speech in unrestricted domains, without the neces
sity of extensive knowledge engineering. 
Initial experiments demonstrate that this ap
proach is feasible in principle. However, more work 
to improve the major components is needed to reach 
a more reliable and valid output. 
The potentials of this approach for NLP applica
tions that use speech as their input are obvious: se
mantic representations can enhance almost all tasks 
that so far have either been restricted to narrow do
mains or were mainly using word-level representa
tions, such as text summarization, information re
trieval, or shallow machine translation. 
11 Sometimes, the speech acts will span more than one short 
clause but as long as the turn-boundaries are fixed for both 
our system and tile speech act classifier, the re-combination 
of short clauses can be done straightforwardly.
