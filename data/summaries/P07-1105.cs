Given a LWFG, a0, the ground syntagma derivation relation, a44 a6a45,2 is defined as: a46a48a47a50a49 a46a52a51 a53 a54 a49 (if a64 a3 a65 a0 a55 a0 a1 a66 a55 a0 a32 2The ground derivation (“reduction” in (Wintner, 1999)) can be viewed as the bottom-up counterpart of the usual derivation.

There is considerable interest in learning computational grammars.1 While much attention has focused on learning syntactic grammars either in a supervised or unsupervised manner, recently there is a growing interest toward learning grammars/parsers that capture semantics as well (Bos et al., 2004; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Ge and Mooney, 2005).
