In other papers (Swerts et al., 2000;; Hirschberg et al., 2001;; Litman et al., 2001), we have already given some descriptive statistics on corrections and aware sites and we have been looking at methods to automatically predict these two utterance categories.

These experiments show that corrections and aware sites can be classi ed as such automatically, with a considerable degree of accuracy (Litman et al., 2001;; Hirschberg et al., 2001).

That corrections are dicult for ASR systems is generally explained by the fact that they tend to be hyperarticulated | higher, louder, longer...than other turns (Wade et al., 1992;; Oviatt et al., 1996;; Levow, 1998;; Bell and Gustafson, 1999;; Shimojima et al., 1999), where ASR models are not well adapted to handle this special speaking style.

While this strategy is often suboptimal in correcting ASR errors (Levow, 1998), REPs (45% error) andOMITs (52% error) were better recognized than ADDs (90% error) and PARs (72% error).
P98-1122
We have previously discussed the prosodic and acoustic dierences between corrections and non-correction (Swerts et al., 2000;; Hirschberg et al., 2001).

In terms of distinguishing features which might explain or help to identify these turns, we have previously examined the acoustic and prosodic features of aware sites (Litman et al., 2001).
P01-1048
One of our major ndings is that prosody, which had already been shown to be a good predictor of misrecognitions (Litman et al., 2000;; Hirschberg et al., 2000), is also useful to correctly classify corrections and aware sites.
