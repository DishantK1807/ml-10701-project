2. Prolog UNDerstanding of Integrated Text: it is a modular system, implemented in Quintus Prolog, with distinct syntactic, semantic and pragmatic components (Dahl 1987a, Dahl 1986, Dowding 1987, Palmer 1986).

TO THE TEMPORAL COMPONENT PUNDIT's time component performs its analysis after the sentence has been parsed and recursively after the semantic decomposition of each predicating element in the sentence has been created (Palmer 1986).

5. Various types of tenseless predications are processed by PUNDIT's temporal component, including nominalizations, certain clausal modifiers of noun phrases (e.g., pressure decreasing below 60 psig caused the pump to fail), and sentence fragments (Linebarger 1988).
P88-1002
However, the implementation of the temporal semantic component described here lays the necessary groundwork for eventually computing intersentential relations along lines proposed in Webber 1987 and this volume.

The time component assigns present or past tense readings to fragments, depending on the aspectual class of the fragment (Linebarger 1988).

They define a nucleus as a structure comprising a culmination, an associated preparatory process, and a consequent state (Moens 1987).
