The model is contrasted with two alternative referent resolution models, namely, a simplistic one and the more sophisticated model proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).

Discourse intentions play a primary role in explaining discourse structure, defining discourse coherence, and providing a coherent conceptualization of the term "discourse" (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

Like XTRA, CUBRICON uses two models to interpret deictic expressions: an attentional discourse focus space representation (adapted from Grosz and Sidner 1986) and a display model.

Assessing the Quality of EDWARD's Referent Resolution Model To assess the quality of EDWARD's referent resolution model, we collected a series of referring expressions, which were processed by three different referent resolution models, namely that of EDWARD, as described above, a very simplistic model, and the sophisticated and often applied model proposed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).

Subsequently, in Section 5, we present some user interactions with EDWARD and we compare the results of EDWARD's referent resolution model with two other models including that of Grosz and Sidner (1986).

The second alternative referent resolution model is that of Grosz and Sidner (1986).
