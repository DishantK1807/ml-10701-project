The resulting word similarity database can then be used to smooth the probability distribution in statistical language models (Dagan et al, 1997); • A clustering algorithm that constructs Roget-like semantic categories in an unsupervised fashion (Lin and Pantel, 2001a); and • An unsupervised learner to identify similar expressions from a parsed corpus (Lin and Pantel, 2001b).

Like Principar (Lin, 1993), Minipar represents its grammar as a network where nodes represent grammatical categories and links represent types of syntactic (dependency) relationships.
