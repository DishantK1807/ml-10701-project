In the first of our methods we align manual transcripts and ASR sentences using the IBM translation model (Brown et al., 1993) to obtain a probabilistic dictionary.

There are five different IBM translation models (Brown et al., 1993).

To learn alignments, translation probabilities, etc in the first method we used work that has been done in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where the translation process is considered to be equivalent to a corruption of the source language text to the target language text due to a noisy channel.

Details We use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to train the machine translation system and the ISI ReWrite Decoder (ISI, 2001) to do the actual translations.

Further details are in the original paper (Brown et al., 1993).

The IBM models have shown good performance in machine translation, and especially so within certain families of languages, for example in translating between French and English or between Sinhalese and Tamil (Brown et al., 1993; Weerasinghe, 2004).

This is the approach taken by Raghavan and Allan (Raghavan and Allan, 2004) who showed that normalizing names using Soundex codes resulted in a 10% improvement on the TDT3 Story Link Detection Task.
W04-2905
This is a common technique in machine translation for which the IBM translation models are popular methods (Brown et al., 1993).
