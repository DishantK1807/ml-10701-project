For the maximum entropy classifier, we estimate the weights by maximizing the likelihood of a heldout set, using the standard IIS algorithm (Berger et al., 1996).

While it is unquestionable that certain algorithms are better suited to the WSD problem than others (for a comparison, see Mooney (1996)), it seems that, given similar input features, various algorithms exhibit roughly similar accuracies.1 This was supported by the SENSEVAL-2 results, where a This paper is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grants IIS-0085896 and IIS9982226, by an NSF Graduate Fellowship, and by the Research Collaboration between NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and CSLI, Stanford University.
