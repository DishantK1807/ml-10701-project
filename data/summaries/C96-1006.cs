Although a number of automatic sentence alignment methods have been proposed (Brown et al.1991 ; Gale & Church 1991 b; Kay & Roscheisen 1993; Chen 1993), they are not very reliable for real noisy bilingual texts.

These methods can be divided into those taking a statistical approach (Gale & Church 1991a; Kupiec 1993; Dagan et al.1993; Inoue & Nogaito 1993; Fung 1995) and those taking a linguistic approach (Yamamoto & Sakamoto 1993; Kum~mo & Hirakawa 1994; Ishimoto & Nagao 1994).
