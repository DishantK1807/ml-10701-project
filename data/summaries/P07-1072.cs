(Kim and Baldwin, 2006) and (Turney, 2006) focus on the lexical similarity of unseen noun compounds with those found in training.

More recently, (Lapata and Keller, 2004) showed that simple unsupervised models perform significantly better when the frequencies are obtained from the web, rather than from a large standard corpus.

The test dataset was randomly selected from each corpus and the test nouns (only for English) were tagged with the corresponding sense in context using a state of the art WSD tool (Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004).

Other researchers (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Snow et al., 2006) use clustering techniques coupled with syntactic dependency features to identify IS-A relations in large text collections.

Although (Lapata and Keller, 2004) used Altavista in their experiments, they showed there is almost no difference between the correlations achieved using Google and Altavista counts.

The results are compared against two state of the art approaches: a su568 pervised machine learning model, Semantic Scattering (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005), and a webbased probabilistic model (Lapata and Keller, 2004).

Models We have experimented with the support vector machines (SVM) model6 and compared the results against two state-of-the-art models: a supervised model, Semantic Scattering (SS), (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005), and a web-based unsupervised model (Lapata and Keller, 2004).

On the other hand, the majority of corpus statistics approaches to noun compound interpretation collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of the noun constituents and use them in a probabilistic model (Lauer, 1995).

B. (Lapata and Keller, 2004)’s web-based unsupervised model classifies noun noun instances based on Lauer’s list of 8 prepositions and uses the web as training corpus.

They can vary from a few prepositions (Lauer, 1995) to hundreds or thousands specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).

We also present empirical observations on the distribution of the syntax and meaning of noun phrases on two different corpora based on two state-of-the-art classification tag sets: Lauer’s set of 8 prepositions (Lauer, 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.
