For each [ISA] instance, the strings representing the {target} and the comparison set of the superlative are marked up (cf. Bos and Nissim, 2006). For example: [3] Sentence: Philadelphia Zoo is the oldest zoo in America. → Target: {Philadelphia Zoo} → Comparison set: the oldest zoo in America. Of special interest here is that both target and </context>

In theoretical linguistics, most studies of superlatives have focused on particular semantic ambiguities which may only rarely occur in everyday language (Szabolcsi, 1986; Heim, 1999). Two recent studies by Bos and Nissim (2006) and Jindal and Liu (2006) illustrate the usefulness of superlatives for language technology, but neither study exhaustively deals with the different cons</context>

So far, none of the studies in sentiment detection (e.g. Wilson et al., 2005) or opinion extraction (e.g. Hu and Liu, 2004) have specifically looked at the role of superlatives in these areas. ISA superlatives are labelled as fact if the ranking expressed by the superlative (of the target entity with respect to the other</context>

Around 19% (17 out of 89) of ISA-1 comparison sets contain a “fused head”, where the superlative and the NP head “merge” into one unit (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002). The NP head is implied in the context (usually, but not necessarily in the same sentence) but has not yet been considered in the annotation, as for example works in the following sentence: [15] He </context>

In particular, one needs to distinguish between NP-head complements and NP-head modifiers (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002). In [16], the “in” PP-phrase is a complement and an obligatory part of the NP. In [17], on the other hand, the “in” PP-phrase is a modifier of the NP head. It has the role of restricting the set in </context>
