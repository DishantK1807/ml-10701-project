E-maih sksuh@alliant.snu.ac.kr 1 The name PRINCITRAN is derived from the names of two systems, UNITRAN (Door 1993) and PRINCIPAR (Lin 1993).

Our approach is similar to that of Lin (1993) in that structure-building is deferred until the descriptions satisfy all principles; however, the current approach differs in that it provides a parameterization mechanism along the lines of Dorr (1994) that allows the system to be ported to languages other than English.

idea of constraint application through feature passing among nodes is analogous to techniques applied in the TINA spoken language system (Seneff 1992) except that, in our design, the grammar network is a static data structure; it is not dynamically modified during the parsing process.

See Lin (1993) for more details.
P93-1016
In order to capture this distinction, we incorporate the parameterization approach of Dorr (1994) into the message-passing framework so that grammar networks can be automatically generated on a per-language basis.
