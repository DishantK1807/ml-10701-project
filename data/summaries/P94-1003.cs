The operation is a kind of union where the information in the strict structure takes priority over that in the ~See, for example, Bouma (1990), Calder (1990), Carpenter (1994), Kaplan (1987).

Our central model of a discourse grammar is the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDM) most often associated with Scha, Polanyi, and their coworkers (Polanyi and Scha 1984, Scha and Polanyi 1988, Priist 1992, and most recently in Priist, Scha and van den Berg 1994).
