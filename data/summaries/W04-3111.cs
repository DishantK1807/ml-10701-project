While it is difficult to compare taggers that tag different types of entities (e.g., (Friedman et al., 2001; Gaizauskas et al., 2003)), CRFs have been utilized for state-of-the-art results in NP-chunking and gene and protein tagging (Sha and Pereira, 2003; McDonald and Pereira, 2004) Currently, we are beginning to investigate methods to identify relations over the variation components that are extracted using the entity tagger.

In this case, one component entity point mutations cor2An influential precursor to this integration is the system described in (Miller et al., 1996).

A Propbank has been built on top of the Penn Treebank, and has been used to train “semantic taggers”, for extracting argument roles for the predicates of interest, regardless of the particular syntactic context.1 Such semantic taggers have been developed by using machine learning techniques trained on the Penn Propbank (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).
