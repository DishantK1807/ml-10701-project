In this paper we demonstrate that using default unification, namely the order-independent and persistent version of default unification described in (Lascarides et al, 1996b) and (Lascarides and Copestake, 1999), to implement a default inheritance network results in a fully declarative specification of a lexical fragment based on Pollard and Sag's (1987), but that is both more succinct and able to express elegantly linguistic sub-regularities, such as the marked status of subject control of transitive subject-control verbs.

This default multiple inheritance network is im261 Proceedings of EACL '99 plemented using YADU (Lascarides and Copestake, 1999), which is an order independent default unification operation on typed feature structures (TFS).

Moreover, default specifications can be made to act as indefeasible information, using YADU's DefFill operation (Lascarides and Copestake, 1999), that has a TDFS as input and returns a TFS by incorporating all the default information into the indefeasible TFS, say at the interface between the lexicon and the rest of the system.

Furthermore, YADU supports the definition of inequalities, which are used to override default reentrancies when no conflicting values are defined in the types involved (Lascarides and Copestake, 1999).

Such an approach to representing the lexicon has some advantages, like its ability to capture linguistic generalisations, conciseness, uniformity, ease of maintenance and modification, and modularity (Daelemans et al, 1992).

Several authors have highlighted the importance of using defaults in the representation of linguistic knowledge, in order to get linguistically adequate descriptions for some natural language phenomena ((Gazdar, 1987), (Bouma, 1992), (Daelemans et al, 1992), (Briscoe, 1993)).
