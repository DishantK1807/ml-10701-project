Another problem of the supervised approach is that the inventory and distribution of senses changes dramatically from one domain to the other, requiring additional hand-tagging of corpora (Martnez and Agirre, 2000; Koeling et al., 2005).

The system is based on a single k-NN classifier using the features described in (Agirre et al., 2006) and made available at the task website (cf.

Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

More recently, the mapping has been used to test the system on publicly available benchmarks (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004; Niu et al., 2005).

Compared with WordNet (Miller et al., 1993)?? which has been used widely in QA?FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet are still relatively new, and therefore their usefulness for QA has still to be proven.
