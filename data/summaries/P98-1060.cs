The rest of this paper is concerned with the extension of a Shake-andBake like transfer approach (Whitelock, 1992; Beaven, 1992) or the kind of semantic-based transfer approach as described for example in Dorna and Emele (1996) to cope with local ambiguities.

Hence, information access for transformation processes like transfer is not as straightforward as it could be when using flat set representations (Beaven, 1992; Whitelock, 1992).

Work in the literature include the QLF representations (Alshawi, 1992), the work on Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRS) (Reyle, 1993; Bos et al., 1996), and the collection of papers in van Deemter and Peters (1996).

The key argument for using this linguistic workbench is the ability to produce packed representations for ambiguous utterances using techniques described in Maxwell III and Kaplan (1993) and the availability of a generator which generates utterances from f-structure descriptions.

For an application of using underspecified semantic representations within MT see Alshawi et al.(1991), Copestake et al.(1995) and Dorna and Emele (1996).

Since the particular treatment of syntactic ambiguities is orthogonal to the possiblity of using underspecifled semantic representations, the same extension could also be applied for a semantic-based transfer approach on flat representations as advocated for example in Copestake et al.(1995) and Dorna and Emele (1996).

The work in Kay (1996) and the extension to ambiguous input in Shemtov (1996) and Shemtov (1997) describes a chartbased generation process which takes packed representations as input and generates all paraphrases without expanding first into disjunctive normal form.

However, it could equally well be done on the level of underspecified semantic representations as shown in (Dorna et al., 1998).
