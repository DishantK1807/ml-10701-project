SWIZZLE is a multilingual enhancement of COCKTAIL (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999), a coreference resolution system that operates on a mixture of heuristics that combine semantic and textual cohesive information 2.

Section 5 summarizes the 2The name of COCKTAIL is a pun on CogNIAC because COCKTAIL combines a larger number of heuristics than those reported in (Baldwin, 1997).

For example, CogNIAC (Baldwin, 1997), a system based on seven ordered heuristics, generates high-precision resolution (over 90%) for some cases of pronominal reference.

For this research, we used a coreference resolution system ((Harabagiu and Malorano, 1999)) that implements different sets of heuristics corresponding to various forms of coreference.

Details of the top performing heuristics of COCKTAIL were reported in (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999).

For this purpose, we used a core Romanian WordNet (Harabagiu, 1999) which encoded, wherever possible, links between the English synsets and their Romanian counterparts.

The English texts were parsed with Brill's part-ofspeech tagger (Brill 1992) and the noun phrases were identified by the grammar rules implemented in the phrasal parser of FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1993).
