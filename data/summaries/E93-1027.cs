While minimal commitment to specific linguistic theories is possible for research on general algorithms of robust parsing (as in \[Mellish, 1989\]), it does not seem feasible for our paradigm, as our aim (learning linguistic knowledge) is directly related to the problems of what type of knowledge is to be learned and how it is properly represented.

We usually have to revise, add, and delete grammar rules and lexical entries in order to adapt them to the peculiarities of languages (sublanguages) of new application domains \[Sekine et al., 1992; Tsujii et al., 1992; Ananiadou, 1990\].

Parsing and Linguistic Knowledge Acquisition 2.1 Search Space of Possible Hypotheses When a parser fails to analyse an input sentence, a robust parser hypothesizes possible errors in the input in order to complete the analysis and correct errors \[Douglas and Dale, 1992\]: for example, deletion of necessary words (Ex.
