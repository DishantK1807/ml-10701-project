4 3A similar corespondence between f-structures and QLFs (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) has been shown in (Genabith and Crouch, 1996).
P92-1005
Structural misalignment is treated in semantics construction involving a restriction operator (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) where f-structures are related to (possibly sets of) disambiguated semantic representations.

Correspondence-based transfer on f-structures has been proposed in (Kaplan et al., 1989).

The representations (Bos et al., 1996) are UDRS variants (Reyle, 1993).

Co-description based approaches (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) require annotation of source and target lexica and grammars.
E93-1024
The original co-description based approach in (Kaplan et al., 1989) faced problems when it came to examples involving embedded head-switching and multiple adjuncts (Sadler and Thompson, 1991), which led to the introduction of a restriction operator, to enable transfer on partial f-structures or semantic structures (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993).

(Johnson, 1991)).
J91-2001
A closer look at translation problems involving structural mismatches between languages in particular head switching phenomena (Sadler and Thompson, 1991) led to the contention that transfer is facilitated at the level of semantic representation, where structural differences between languages are often neutralized.
E91-1051
Even more so when existing resources can be interfaced qua semantic representations: in our case the tested transfer methodology and resources developed in (Dorna and Emele, 1996a).

On closer inspection, though, the rewriting approach to syntactic f-structureterm translations presented above suffers from the very same problems that were met by the correspondence-based approach in (Kaplan et al., 1989).

Transfer This section presents a simple bidirectional translation between LFG f-structures and term representations which serve as input to and output of a transfer component developed within the Verbmobil project (Dorna and Emele, 1996a).

Transfer on packed representations is considered 341 in (Emele and Dorna, 1998).
P98-1060
Packed ambiguity representation techniques (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993) could be integrated with the approach in (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993).
E93-1024 J93-4001
In both cases, transfer is driven by the transfer module developed and implemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a).

We first show how the underlying machinery of the semantic-based transfer approach developed in Dorna and Emele (1996b) can be ported to syntactic f-structure representations.
C96-1054
Unlike the original restriction operator approach (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993) whenever possible they avoid the detour of multiple transfer on disambiguated representations.
