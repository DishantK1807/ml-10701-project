Bunescu and Mooney (2005) have also demonstrated that dependency graphs can be produced using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) and context-free grammar (CFG) parsers.

Previous work which has used this representation have used indirect evaluation: document and sentence filtering (Yangarber, 2003; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005).

Dependency Patterns Three dependency parsers were used for these experiments: MINIPAR3 (Lin, 1999), the Machinese Syntax4 parser from Connexor Oy (Tapanainen and JÂ¨arvinen, 1997) and the Stanford5 parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).

Sudo et al.(2003) compared three models in terms of their ability to identify event participants.

2The formalism used for representing dependency patterns is similar to the one introduced by Sudo et al.(2003). Each node in the tree is represented in the format a[b/c] (e.g.

Predicate-Argument Model (SVO): A simple approach, used by Yangarber (2003) and Stevenson and Greenwood (2005), is to use subject-verbobject tuples from the dependency parse as extraction patterns.

This has implications on the practical application for each approach, particularly when used for automatic acquisition of IE systems using learning methods (Yangarber et al., 2000; Sudo et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).

This model may be motivated by the assumption that many IE scenarios involve the extraction 1Yangarber et al.(2000) and Sudo et al.(2003) used a slightly extended version of this model in which the pattern also included certain phrases which referred to either the subject or object.

For example, the AutoSlog system (Riloff, 1993) uses patterns which match certain grammatical categories, mainly nouns and verbs, in phrase chunked text while Yangarber et al.(2000) use subject-verbobject tuples derived from a dependency parse.

Subtrees: The final model to be considered is the subtree model (Sudo et al., 2003).

Chains: A pattern is defined as a path between a verb node and any other node in the dependency tree passing through zero or more intermediate nodes (Sudo et al., 2001).

For example, Yangarber (2003) uses just subject-verb-object tuples while Sudo et al.(2003) allow any subpart of the tree to act as an extraction pattern.

Several recent approaches to IE have used patterns based on a dependency analysis of the input text (Yangarber, 2003; Sudo et al., 2001; Sudo et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005).

The results presented here suggest that the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) is capable of generating analyses for almost all sentences within corpora from two very different domains.
