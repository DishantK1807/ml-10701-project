The ability to explicitly identify these sections in unstructured text could play an important role in applications such as document summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2000), information retrieval (Tbahriti et al., 2005), information extraction (Mizuta et al., 2005), and question answering.

An interesting aspect of our generative approach is that we model HMM outputs as Gaussian vectors (log probabilities of observing entire sentences based on our language models), as opposed to sequences of terms, as done in (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).

Models of Content Following Ruch et al.(2003) and Barzilay and Lee (2004), we employed Hidden Markov Models to model the discourse structure of MEDLINE abstracts.

Our task is closer to the work of Teufel and Moens (2000), who looked at the problem of intellectual attribution in scientific texts.

70 5 Related Work Although not the first to employ a generative approach to directly model content, the seminal work of Barzilay and Lee (2004) is a noteworthy point of reference and comparison.

Although this study falls under the general topic of discourse modeling, our work differs from previous attempts to characterize text in terms of domainindependent rhetorical elements (McKeown, 1985; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).
