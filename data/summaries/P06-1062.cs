Signal processing techniques is also employed in sentence alignment by (Church 1993; Fung & McKeown 1994).

Based on such observations, some web mining systems have been developed to automatically obtain parallel corpora from the web (Nie et al 1999; Ma and Liberman 1999; Chen, Chau and Yeh 2004; Resnik and Smith 2003a0 Zhang et al 2006 ).

Following (Nie et al 1999) and (Resnik and Smith, 2003), three features are used: (i) file length ratio; (ii) HTML tag similarity; (iii) sentence alignment score.

Then for each pair of parallel text chunks, the sentence aligner described in (Zhao et al 2002), which combines IBM model I and the length model of (Gale & Church 1991) under a maximum likelihood criterion, is used to align parallel sentences.

However, current sentence alignment models, (Brown et al 1991; Gale & Church 1991; Wu 1994; Chen 489 1993; Zhao and Vogel, 2002; etc).

(Kay & Roscheisen 1993; and Chen 1993) used lexical information for sentence alignment.

(Shieber and Schabes 1990) presents a synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG) which is able to align two syn490 tactic trees at the linguistic minimal units.

Exemplary systems include PTMiner (Nie et al 1999), STRAND (Resnik and Smith, 2003), BITS (Ma and Liberman, 1999), and PTI (Chen, Chau and Yeh, 2004).

(Gale & Church 1991; Brown et al.1991; Wu 1994) used sentence length as the basic feature for alignment.

Additionally, parallel corpora have been exploited for various monolingual natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as wordsense disambiguation (Ng 2003) and paraphrase acquisition (Callison 2005).

Recently, much research attention has been paid to aligning sentences in comparable documents (Utiyama et al 2003, Munteanu et al 2004).

For example, (Wu 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001) have studied synchronous context free grammar.

Parallel bilingual corpora are critical resources for statistical machine translation (Brown 1993), and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie 1999).
