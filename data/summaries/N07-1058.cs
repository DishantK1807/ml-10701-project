The default training set of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.1993) was used for the parser because the domain and style of those texts actually matches fairly well with the domain and style of the texts on which a reading level predictor for second language learners might be used.

For first language (L1) learners (i.e., children learning their native tongue), reading level has been predicted using a variety of techniques, based on models of a studentâ€™s lexicon, grammatical surface features such as sentence length (Flesch, 1948), or combinations of such features (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).

Prior work on first language readability by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) incorporated grammatical surface features such as parse tree depth and average number of verb phrases.

Lee (2004), for example, showed that morphological analysis can improve the quality of statistical machine translation for Arabic.

First, a language modeling approach generally gives much better accuracy for Web documents and short passages (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).
