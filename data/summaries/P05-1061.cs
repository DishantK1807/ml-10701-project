Roth and Yih (2004) present a model in which entity types and relations are classified jointly using a set of global constraints over locally trained classifiers.
W04-2401
We use a standard maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) implemented as part of MALLET (McCallum, 2002).
J96-1002
As in predicate-argument extraction (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), each relation is 492 always associated with a verb in the sentence that specifies the relation type.
J02-3001
More recently, discriminatively-trained models have been shown to be more accurate than generative models (McCallum et al., 2000; Lafferty et al., 2001; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
N01-1025
One interesting system that does not belong to the above class is that of Miller et al.(2000), who take the view that relation extraction is just a form of probabilistic parsing where parse trees are augmented to identify all relations.

Rosario and Hearst (2004) compare both generative and discriminative models for extracting seven relationships between treatments and diseases.
P04-1055
However, the rapid development of bioinformatics has recently generated interest on the extraction of biological entities such as genes (Collier et al., 2000) and genomic variations (McDonald et al., 2004b) from biomedical literature.
C00-1030
We can see that the maximum entropy classifier performs reasonably well, although performance may be affected by the lack of rich syntactic features, which have been shown to help performance (Miller et al., 2000; Zelenko et al., 2003).
