Evaluation We use a parsing model similar to that described in (Hogan, 2005) which is based on (Collins, 1999) Model 1 and uses k-NN for parameter estimation.

In both the discriminative reranker of Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994) and that of Charniak and Johnson (2005) features are included to capture syntactic parallelism across conjuncts at various depths.
H94-1048 P05-1022
Insofar as we do not separate coordination disambiguation from the overall parsing task, our approach resembles the efforts to improve coordination disambiguation in (Kurohashi, 1994; Ratnaparkhi, 1994; Charniak and Johnson, 2005).
H94-1048 J94-4001 P05-1022
Both Resnik (1999) and Nakov and Hearst (2005) consider NP coordinations of the form n1 and n2 n3 where two structural analyses are possible: ((n1 and n2) n3) and ((n1) and (n2 n3)).
H05-1105
Nakov and Hearst (2005) disambiguate by combining Web-based statistics on head word co-occurrences with other mainly heuristic information sources.
H05-1105
A probabilistic approach is presented in (Goldberg, 1999), where an unsupervised maximum entropy statistical model is used to disambiguate coordinate noun phrases of the form n1 preposition n2 cc n3.
P99-1081
Symmetry Between Conjuncts There is often a considerable bias toward symmetry in the syntactic structure of two conjuncts, see for example (Dubey et al., 2005).
H05-1104
In (Kurohashi, 1994) coordination disambiguation is carried out as the first component of a Japanese dependency parser using a technique which calculates similarity between series of words from the left and right of a conjunction.
J94-4001
In (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992) the task is to identify pre-CC conjuncts which appear in text that has been part-of-speech (POS) tagged and semiparsed, as well as tagged with semantic labels specific to the domain.
