Evaluating the algorithm on the output of Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000) and the Penn treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) shows that the patternmatching algorithm does surprisingly well on the most frequently occuring types of empty nodes given its simplicity.

The parser output was produced by Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000).

It can also be regarded as a kind of tree transformation, so the overall system architecture (including the parser) is an instance of the transform-detransform approach advocated by Johnson (1998).

Then as is standard, the precision P, recall R and f-score f are calculated as follows: P = jG \ TjjTj R = jG \ TjjGj f = 2 P RP + R Table 3 provides these measures for two different test corpora: (i) a version of section 23 of the Penn Treebank from which empty nodes, indices and unary branching chains consisting of nodes of the same category were removed, and (ii) the trees produced by Charniak’s parser on the strings of section 23 (Charniak, 2000).

Broad coverage syntactic parsers with good performance have recently become available (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 2000), but these typically produce as output a parse tree that only encodes local syntactic information, i.e., a tree that does not include any empty nodes. (Collins (1997) discusses the recovery of one kind of empty node, viz., WH-traces).
