This paper will extend upon his discussion, and describe its role in ILEX, a text generation system which delivers descriptions of entities on-line from an underlying knowledgebase (see Mellish et al.1998). ILEX is at present generating descriptions in the museum domain, in particular, that of 20th Century jewellery.
