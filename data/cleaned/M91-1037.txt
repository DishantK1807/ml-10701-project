1:67	APPENDIX A: EVALUATION TASK DESCRIPTION 1.0 WHAT CONSTITUTES A "RELEVANT" INCIDENT ? Relevant incidents are, in general, violent acts perpetrated with political aim s and a motive of intimidation . These are acts of terrorism . Here is an official, "schoolbook" definition of terrorism : "a sudden, unexpected act of shocking, calculated, and unlawful violence, o r the plausible threat of such violence, by an illegal, subnational, clandestin e group -usually carried out in a peaceful, civilian environment, be i t urban, rural, in the air or on a body of water -against certai n noncombatants or targets that represent or symbolize a certain country, bu t sometimes indiscrimately against bystanders or passersby at a particula r location, with the intention of garnering publicity, propagandizing a cause, and intimating as many people as possible in order to attain social, political, or strategic objectives . " -Rex A . Hudson, "Dealing with Internationa l Hostage-Taking : Alternatives to Reactive Counterterrorist Assaults," Internationa l Terrorism, Vol . 12, 1990.
2:67	This has been turned into more of an operational definition by widening th e schoolbook definition somewhat and making some rather arbitrary distinctions . Your advice on how to improve on this operational definition is welcome . 1) Terrorist acts may be perpetrated by an "illegal, subnational, clandestin e group," which includes known guerrilla and drug-traffickin g organizations . Their targets may be just about anything/anybody except (a ) another such group or member of such a group or (b) a military/polic e installation or force (with the same nationality as the perpetrator), or a member of such a force, in which case the incident is presumed to be a purely guerrilla act and is not relevant to the MUC-3 terrorist inciden t database . Thus, killings of drug traffickers will not be included in th e database (by exception a, above), nor will "clashes" between guerrill a groups and the military (by exception b, above) . However, if a guerrilla warfare incident happens to affect civilia n personnel or property, whether intentionally or accidentally, the inciden t becomes relevant and should be included in the database . In these cases, th e database should contain information on both the military and the nonmilitary targets.
3:67	Similarly, the database will include incidents of sabotage on a nation' s infrastructure.
4:67	It will also include incidents perpetrated against individual s who are former members of the military, e .g ., a murder perpetrated against a retired general . A1 Sometimes an article gives mixed reports, e .g. , a "terrorist attack" on a bridge guarded by the national (military) police . In a case such as this, which could be interpreted as a case of terrorism (sabotage of the nation' s infrastructure) or of guerrilla warfare (attack on a physical target o f military importance), we will consider the physical target to be nonmilitar y and will include the incident in the database . 2) Under certain circumstances, the perpetrator may be a member of th e government, including the military . This is the case when the target i s civilian . 3) Sometimes the perpetrator is not identified and no language is used t o indicate that the act is *not* being attributed to "terrorists," "extremists, " "subversives," "guerrillas," etc . In these cases, as long as the act itself is o f one of the expected types and the target(s) is/are not exclusively military, the incident will be presumed to be a possible terrorist act and is to b e included in the database . 4) The articles in the MUC-3 corpus originate in many different parts of th e world, but they all emphasize something about one of the nine Lati n American countries of interest (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru) . However, only incident s whose perpetrator(s) or target(s) "belong to" one of the nine countries o f interest belong in the MUC-3 database . Thus, an incident perpetrated agains t a human target who is a citizen of one of those countries may belong in th e database even if that person is attacked while he's in a different country . Or an incident perpetrated against the embassy of one of those nine countrie s may belong in the database, no matter where that embassy is located . 5) Only terrorist acts (and attempted acts) that are reported as factual are to b e included in the database.
5:67	An incident is *not* to be recorded in the database if the article discredits the story or cites a source that discredits the story .
6:67	(However, if the article also cites a source that *supports* the story, tha t version of the story should go in the database ).
7:67	Rumors are to be excluded . 6) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if it is "recent ".
8:67	The intent is to include only information that is new or updated . We define "recent" t o mean that either (a) it occurred within two months of the date of the articl e or (b) new information is being provided in the article on an incident tha t occured more than two months prior, such as new suspects being brough t forth as the perpetrators of an old crime . However, there are a number of articles that fail to mention the date of the incidents, some of which are, i n fact, recent.
9:67	Therefore, if there is no indication that the information is no t recent or if there is no indication that the information is being given onl y to provide historical context (as indicated by phrases such as "Let us recal l that ."), the incident should go in the database . 7) An incident is to be recorded in the database only if the article's descriptio n of it is "specific ".
10:67	Generic descriptions of incidents like "terrorist attacks o n the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline" and summary descriptions like "th e total persons kidnapped in Colombia over the last 6 weeks was 85" are to b e excluded . A2 The articles sometimes give useful information about a specific incident bu t provide very few details . Therefore, as long as all the other criteria are met, w e will include any incident that at least indicates the nature of the target or th e nature of the attack . Thus, an article whose only reference to an incident is "a n attack perpetrated by a subversive group" or "the tragic incident at Uchiza" woul d be excluded, but an article that says "Last night there were fewer attacks on store s and electric towers in the capital" or "a UCR district headquarters in Buenos Aires province was completely destroyed by a bomb explosion" would be included . Here are two further examples of texts that do *not* warrant generation o f templates : "As of 0500 GMT today, the police had received reports of two othe r explosions in two La Paz neighborhoods" (the nature of the explosion isn' t mentioned, and the target isn't mentioned either) ; "the bombing on San Salvador' s neighborhoods" (the prepositional phrase may be interpreted as conveying the target as well as the location, but as a target, it's too general -any location name that is on the set list cannot serve as a target ID, with the exception of farm names) . 2.0 DEFINITIONS OF SLOT TYPE S 0 . MESSAGE ID -The first line of the message, e .g. , DEV-MUC3-0001 (NOSC).
11:67	This slot serves as an index and is not scored in its own right . 1.
12:67	TEMPLATE ID -A number that distinguishes the templates for a give n message . On the answer sheet, the word OPTIONAL in parentheses afte r the template number indicates that there is significant doubt whether th e incident belongs in the database . 2.

30:67	Text conversion : A canonical form extracted or derived from the text . The documentation provided to participants specifies the expected format . Text string : A string extracted from the text and placed inside double quote s in the slot .,Note that this string may contain misspellings, if found in the original text.
31:67	Null : A hyphen (-) indicating that the system has no response . 4.0 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FILLS 4.1 FORMAT FOR SYSTEM RESPONSES System responses should look like plain text, e .g. , they cannot be enclosed i n parentheses, multi-word fillers cannot be connected by underscore characters, etc . Systems are not permitted to use the slash notation that is used in the key t o separate alternative forms of a single filler.
32:67	When multiple fillers for a single slot are generated, each should appear on a separate line, arranged in a column, with space padding in front (no tabs) . Some slots require that their fillers be cross-referenced to the referent (i .e. , the filler of some other slot) . To match the answer sheet, this should be done b y appending the referent, separating the two data items with a colon . Example fill for the EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET slot, whose fillers must b e cross-referenced to the corresponding fillers in the HUMAN TARGET : ID(S) slot.
33:67	(Note that the persons' roles have been omitted from the cross-reference .): HUMAN TARGET ID(S) "HORACIO FERNANDEZ COTIELLO" ("LAWYER" ) "JORGE SAMUDIO" ("JUDGE" ) EFFECT ON HUMAN TARGET(S) DEATH : "HORACIO FERNANDEZ COTIELLO " INJURY : "JORGE SAMUDIO " One template form serves for all incident types . However, depending on th e incident type, one or more slots do not apply . These slots should appear with a n asterisk as the fill, and they will not figure in the scoring . For irrelevant articles, all slots except the MESSAGE ID slot should have an asterisk . A4 4.2 SPECIAL FORMATS FOR ANSWER KEY S All fills in the answer sheet will be in upper case . If there is more than on e "correct" answer for any given slot filler, the options will all appear on one line i n the answer sheet, separated by a slash . The word OPTIONAL may appear i n parentheses after the filler for the TEMPLATE ID, indicating that generation of thi s template is optional . A question mark preceding a filler indicates that generation of this filler is optional, i .e ., that null (hyphen) is also a correct system response . 5 .0 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR GENERATING MORE THAN ONE TEMPLAT E PER ARTICL E If an article discusses more than one relevant type of terrorist incident, eac h such incident should be captured in a separate template . If an article discusse s more than one instance of the same relevant type of terrorist incident, each suc h incident should be captured in a separate template . A "separate instance" is on e which has a different filler for the location, date, category, or perpetrator slot . If no distinctions of these kinds are made in the text, the instances should b e incorporated into a single template, e .g ., if the article describes "attacks" b y "rebels" on "ten power stations" and does not give varying information on th e location of those targets, etc . Note that the level of granularity is defined by wha t can go in a slot ; thus, an article that describes two bombings on targets on different streets in the same neighborhood should be captured in one templat e rather than two, since the location slot cannot have a filler that is at the level o f granularity of a street . 6.0 DATA TYPES FOR FILLER S 0 .

Note : If an article is irrelevant, this is the only slot that should be filled in . 7.2 SLOT 1 -TEMPLATE I D Number of fillers : Always one filler per templat e General method for filling : A number (in digits) generated by the system, starting with 1 and incremented for each new template . Notes : 1) Ordering need not match answer sheet -the scoring program will mak e best match.
51:67	2) On the answer sheet, the word OPTIONAL in parentheses after the templat e number indicates that there is significant doubt whether the incident belongs in the database . 7.3 SLOT 2 -DATE OF INCIDENT Number of fillers : Always one filler per template, unless NO DATE appears in th e message header and a date cannot be determined from the body of the article, i n which case NULL (hyphen) is appropriate . General method for filling : A form generated by the system from the text, expressed in one of the following forms (whichever is appropriate for the article) : 1) DD MMM YY (e .g. 21 JAN 89, meaning "on 21 JAN 89") 2).
52:67	DD MMM YY DD MMM YY (e .g. 15 JAN 89 21 JAN 89, meaning "on or between 15 JAN 89 and 21 JAN 89" ) 3).
53:67	DD MMM YY (e .g. 21 JAN 89, meaning "on or before 21 JAN 89" ) Notes : 1) If the article contains the name of a day of the week, e .g. "last Wednesday", rather than a reference to the date, use form 3, above, with the best know n absolute date as the anchor, e .g. , the date of the article.
54:67	2) If the article uses an easily calculable expression such as "yesterday," us e form 1, above, with the date calculated from the best known absolute date a s A6 the anchor, e.g., the date of the article . An "easily calculable" expression is one that indicates how many days to add or subtract from the anchor . 3) Whenever the date for an even t message header,' the answer key as the anchor.

Thus, a MURDER template should be generated *instead of* an ATTACK template if the onl y target is a person who dies as a result of the incident, even if the incident i s described as an "attack . " 3) If a bomb is planted (by possible terrorists) but is detonated intentionally b y authorities, an ATTEMPTED BOMBING template should be generated . 7.5 SLOT 4 -CATEGORY OF INCIDEN T Applicability : Applicable to all types of incident s Number of fillers : One filler per template, or NULL (hyphen) if nature o f perpetrator cannot be determined .

Set list: REPORTED AS FACT ACQUITTED CLAIMED OR ADMITTED SUSPECTED OR ACCUSE D SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES POSSIBLE Notes : 1) Use REPORTED AS FACT as a default if the identity of the perpetrator org an d its responsibility for the incident appear not to be in question . 2) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED if the article explicitly expresses some degree o f uncertainty about the identity of the perpetrator org, e .g ., by use of qualifying words.
56:67	This fill should also be used if the article's reporting rest s on suspicions or accusations expressed by some source cited by the article' s originator or by the article's originator himself . A8 3) Use SUSPECTED OR ACCUSED BY AUTHORITIES instead of SUSPECTED O R ACCUSED for cases where the article is conveying the information that th e government, military, police, or other authority figure is expressing th e suspicion/accusation or is accepting/admitting guilt on behalf of anothe r authority that has been identified as the perpetrator org .
57:67	(In the latter case, where the perpetrator is himself an authority figure, use CLAIMED O R ADMITTED if he admits/claims his own org's guilt .) 4) Use POSSIBLE if an article mentions an organization in the context of th e incident without actually accusing that organization of being responsibl e for it.
