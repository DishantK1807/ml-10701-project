Many researchers have attempted several techniques to deal with extragrammatical sentences such as Augmented Transition Network(ATN) (Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981), network-based semantic grammar (Hendrix, 1977), partial pattern matching (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981), conceptual case frame (Schank et al., 1980), and multiple cooperating methods (Hayes and Carbonell, 1981).
