A 5word window is the norm, while longer windows prove impractical (Dias, 2003).

Parsing has been also used after extraction (Smadja, 1993) for filtering out invalid results.

In accordance with (Evert and Kermes, 2003), we consider that the comparative evaluation of collocation extraction systems should not be done at the end of the extraction process, but separately for each stage: after the candidate selection stage, for evaluating the quality (in terms of grammaticality) of candidates proposed; and after the application of collocability measures, for evaluating the measures applied.

But a preceding study on noun-verb pairs (Breidt, 1993) came to the conclusion that good precision can only be achieved for German with parsing.

Finally, the loglikelihood ratios test (henceforth LLR) (Dunning, 1993) is applied on each set of pairs.

This fact is being seriously challenged by current research (...), and might not be true in the near future” (Smadja, 1993, 151).

in stage two, the candidates are scored and ranked using specific association measures (a review can be found in (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999; Evert, 2004; Pecina, 2005)).
