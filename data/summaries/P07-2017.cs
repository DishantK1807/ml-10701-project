They yielded very competitive and satisfactory performance in many classification tasks, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Gimenez and Marquez, 2003), shallow parsing (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001, 2004; Lee and Wu, 2007), named entity recognition (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), and parsing (Nivre et al., 2006).

For example, it took one day to train the CoNLL-2000 task with polynomial kernel SVM, while the testing speed is merely 20-30 words per second (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).

In particular to the use of polynomial kernel-based SVM, it was shown to be the most successful kernels for many natural language processing (NLP) problems (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Nivre et al., 2006).
