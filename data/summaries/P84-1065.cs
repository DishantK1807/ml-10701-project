KDS (Mann, 1981) uses heuristics that sometimes dictate that a complex sentence is appropriate, but the heuristics are not based on general linguistic principles.

It is not to be confused with the unification process used in resolution theorem proving, though a similarity has been noted by Pereira and Warren (1983).

Grammars Another formalism that has been used in previous.generation systems (McKeown, 1982; Appelt, 1983) is the functional grammar formalism (Kay, 1979) 4 . In a functional, grammar, functional information such as focus and protagonist are treated in the same manner as syntactic and grammatical information such as subject and NP.
P83-1011
Of the systems which make use of functional information, three (Kay, 1979; McKeown, 1982; Appelt, 1983) have already been mentioned.
P83-1011
We then review the functional grammar formalism (Kay, 1979) that has been used in other generation systems (e.g., McKeown, 1982; Appelt, 1983).
P83-1011
Straightforward implementations of the algorithm have proved too timeconsuming (McKeown, 1982) and efforts have been made to alter the algorithm to improve efficiency (Appelt, 1983).
P83-1011
A description of the algorithm is given in Appelt (1983).

Nigel (Mann, 1983) is a fourth system that makes use of functional information and is based on systemic grammar (Hudson, 1974).
P83-1012
Ana (Kukich, 1983) can also combine propositions, although, like Davey, the decision is based on rhetorical relations rather than functional information.
