Dependency-based statistical language modeling and analysis have also become quite popular in statistical natural language processing (Lafferty et al., 1992; Eisner, 1996; Chelba and et al., 1997).

J~irvinen and Tapananinen have demonstrated an efficient wide-coverage dependency parser for English (Tapanainen and J~irvinen, 1997; JÂ£rvinen and Tapanainen, 1998).

In the last several years, there have been a number of studies on developing finite state parsing systems, (Koskenniemi, 1990; Koskenniemi et al., 1992; Grefenstette, 1996; AitMokhtar and Chanod, 1997).
C90-2040 C92-1027
Recent advances in the development of sophisticated tools for building finite state systems (e.g., XRCE Finite State Tools (Karttunen et al., 1996), ATgzT Tools (Mohri et al., 1998)) have fostered the development of quite complex finite state systems for natural language processing.

Turkish is an agglutinative language where a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root (Oflazer, 1993).
E93-1066
Inspired by Lin's notion of structural complexity (Lin, 1996), measured by the total length of the links in a dependency parse, we ordered the parses of a sentence using this measure.

We assume that the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of finite state transducers (FST hereafter), finite state devices that map between two regular languages U and L (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).

This can be achieved by using the lenient composition operator (Karttunen, 1998).
