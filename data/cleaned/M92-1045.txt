ACCORDING TO REPORTS BY THE NATIONAL POLICE F-2 EXPERTS, THE AIRPLANE BROKE INTO SIX PIECES.
26:47	IT IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED, WHICH IS WHY THE 10 6 PASSENGERS ABOARD ARE STREWN ACROSS AN AREA 6-8 KM WIDE . ACCESS TO THE AIRPLANE 'S REMAINS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS IS A MOUNTAINOUS REGION.

28:47	SAMPLE OF MARGINALLY RELEVANT TEXT S TST2-MUC4-0008 CLANDESTINE, 17 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -[TEXT] WE HAVE STARTED A NEW DAY, THE SEVENTH, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATIO N FRONT [FMLN] IS STILL HOLDING ITS POSITIONS . WE HAVE NOT RETREATED A SINGLE STEP . IF WE MAKE ANY MOVE, IT WILL BE TO ADVANCE TOWARD THE ENEMY BARRACKS, BECAUSE WE WILL SEIZE POWER AND EXPEL THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THAT HAS INSTALLED ITSELF IN OUR HOMELAND . THE FMLN MAINTAINS FOR THE 7TH DAY ITS POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENTAL CAPITALS . WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IN SAN MIGUEL; WE HAVE MADE AN IMPORTAN T SEIZURE OF WEAPONS IN SAN MIGUEL . THE SITUATION COULD NOT BE BETTER IN SAN SALVADOR . LAST NIGHT W E REPORTED THAT THE ARCH OF LIBERTY EXISTS IN THE CAPITAL ; IT IS COMPRISED OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING PROJECTS WHERE TH E PROTAGONISTS OF THIS HISTORY ARE THE MASSES, WHICH ARE ORGANIZED FO R THE CONSTRUCTION OF TRENCHES AND BARRICADES . THE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTAGONISTS IN THIS HISTORIC ACTION . RADIO VENCEREMOS URGES THE PEOPLE TO MULTIPLY THEIR ORGANIZATION I N EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN.
29:47	POPULAR COMMITTEES MUST BE ORGANIZED ; THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVES ; BUT IF THE ENEMY IS NEAR, THIS MUST BE DONE CLANDESTINELY . ALL THE GROUPS I N EACH TOWN, MEANING THE RELIGIOUS GROUPS, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS, TEACHERS ORGANIZATIONS, AND COOPERATIVES, MUST ALL ORGANIZE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICAL BELIEFS . OUR UNITY MUST BECOME THE BES T TOOL TO EVICT, ONCE AND FOR ALL, THE MURDEROUS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP D-4 WHICH ASSASSINATES PRIESTS AND WHICH BOMBED THE CAPITAL AGAIN EARL Y THIS MORNING.
30:47	IT HAS AGAIN CAUSED MORE DEATHS AND WOUNDED IN SAN SALVADOR . IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD, RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND TOWN, AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY MUS T PARTICIPATE.
31:47	IF THE ARMED FORCES ARE NEAR, THEN CLANDESTINE ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONDUCTED IN SMALL TOWNS, VILLAGES, AN D NEIGHBORHOODS . THE PEOPLE MUST ORGANIZE THEMSELVE TO CONSPIRE AGAINS T DEATH, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE ASSASSINS, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST POVERTY, TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HUNGER, AND TO CONSPIRE AGAINST THE BOMBINGS . IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE PEOPLE; IT IS NECESSARY TO ORGANIZE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
32:47	EL SALVADOR MUST BECOME A BODY COMPRISED OF ORGANIZE D CELLS -EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM -REGARDLESS OF TH E PEOPLE'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR POLITICAL PARTY . WE ISSUE AN APPEAL TO THE DECEIVED ARENA [NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] RANK AND FILE, WHO VOTED BELIEVING THAT THIS GOVERNMEN T WOULD REPRESENT A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER . WE ALSO ISSUE AN APPEAL TO ALL THE PATRIOTIC CITIZENS OF THE HOMELAND, URGING THEM TO STOP TH E DESTRUCTION OF THE CAPITAL, TO STOP THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY .

34:47	I THEREFORE WANTED TO CONVEY A MESSAGE OF HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO EVERY CHILEAN, TO SHO W THEM MY FEELINGS AT THIS TIME OF DEEP REFLECTION . FROM THE VERY MOMENT I LEARNED ABOUT THIS TERRORIST ECONOMI C AGGRESSION, I ORDERED THE CREATION OF FOUR MINISTERIAL COMMISSIONS TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM . I ALSO SENT TWO MINISTERS TO THE UNITED STATES TO MEET WITH U.S . GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS . Al'1 ER TIRING SESSIONS OF TALKS, THESE MINISTERS MANAGED TO OVERCOME A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE GRAP E PROBLEM.
35:47	THE PROBLEM AFFECTING OTHER FRUITS REMAINS TO BE SOLVED.
36:47	THIS NEW ATTACK AGAINST THE CHILEAN NATION, AN ATTACK THAT DESTIN Y HAS PLACED IN THE NATION'S PATH OF FREEDOM, PROGRESS, AND WELL-BEING, COMPELS US TO CLOSE RANKS BEHIND THE GOVERNMENT, UNIFIED AND READY T O FIGHT -WITH COURAGE AND HIGH SPIRIT -THE PROBLEM THAT FACES US . ON THIS OCCASION THE COUNTRY HAS SEEN HOW THE COUNTLESS THREATS T O BOYCOTT THE NATIONAL ECONOMY HAVE WORKED . MOST OF THE TIME SUCH THREATS HAVE BEEN PROMOTED BY CERTAIN POLITICIANS, LABOR LEADERS, O R COMMUNIST LABOR UNIONS, BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD . THEY ARE THE ONES WH O D5 -DRIVEN BY PERSONAL OR IDEOLOGICAL INTEREST -HAVE CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED THE STABILITY OF WORKERS, OF FAMILIES, AND OF THOSE WHO M THEY DEMAGOGICALLY CALL THEIR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN . THEY DO NOT CARE IF THEY CAUSE UNEMPLOYMENT, POVERTY, AND HUNGER TO 500,000 FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WORK IN THIS AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY.
37:47	HOW SHAMELESSLY THEY MAKE CLAIMS AND DEMANDS, OFFERING THEIR SUPPORT AND THEIR SOLIDARITY WHEN CHILE IS SERIOUSLY THREATENED!
38:47	YET WHEN THE DANGER IS OVER, THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND AGAIN LEVEL CHARGES AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND CRITICIZE ITS ACTIONS . IN DOIN G THAT THEY FAIL TO RECALL THAT FROM ITS VERY BEGINNING THE CHILEAN NATION HAS BEEN BUILT UPON NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ESSENCE OF THE NATIONAL SOUL . GENTLEMEN : OUR WILL IS BASED ON OUR FEELING OF UNITY IN THE FACE O F ADVERSITY, WHETHER FROM THE ACTION OF NATURE OR FROM THE ACTION O F TREACHEROUS, DISTURBED MINDS THAT RECOGNIZE NO MORAL VALUES, FATHERLAND, OR LAW.
39:47	CHILEANS : A FEW DAYS AGO I REPORTED ON THE STEPS FORWARD IN TH E INSTITUTIONALIZATION PROCESS AND ON THE PROGRESS THAT OUR COUNTRY HA S MADE IN ALL FIELDS.
40:47	THE FACT THAT CYANIDE HAS BEEN INJECTED INTO TWO EXPORTED GRAPE S HAS CAUSED INCALCULABLE DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY ; IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT THE SHADOW OF ANGUISH AND UNCERTAINTY TO THOUSANDS OF HOMES OF FELLOW COUNTRYMEN WHOSE JOBS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEIR LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO A LIVELIHOOD HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY JEOPARDIZED.
41:47	IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT SOME OFFICIALS OF IMPORTING COUNTRIES, WITHOUT WEIGHING THE TRU E EFFECTS OF THIS TYPE OF MEASURE, HAVE RESTRICTED THE IMPORT OF CHILEA N FRUITS, THUS PROVOKING FEAR AND DISTRUST ON THE INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER MARKET.
42:47	GENTLEMEN, WE MUST REVERSE THIS SITUATION.
43:47	WE SHOULD ONCE AGAIN ACT IN A UNITED MANNER TO RECOVER INTERNATIONAL CONFIDENCE AND OUR UNDISPUTED LEADERSHIP AS EXPORTERS . I AM SURE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED WITH A NEW JOINT EFFORT .

45:47	AS A RESULT OF THE ATTACK, THERE WERE 20 CASUALTIES . AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS A LIEUTENANT WHO WAS THE UNIT CHIEF, AND TWO SERGEANTS . THE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WAS TOTALL Y DESTROYED.
46:47	THE SITUATION IS NOT AS THE FASCIST CRISTIANI REPORTED IT TO BE . HE SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE SOLDIER AT THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT . THAT IS TOTALLY FALSE . THE BUILDING HOUSED A GARRISON NOT A D-6 HOSPITAL, BECAUSE A DMIFA UNIT AND A COMMUNICATIONS RELAY CENTER WER E THERE . IT WAS A GARRISON . WE ARE GOING TO CORRECT OUR REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THE ATTACK ON THE DMIFA UNIT : 20 SOLDIERS WERE KILLED AND 10 WERE WOUNDED . IN ALL, THERE WERE 30 CASUALTIES, INCLUDING TWO SERGEANTS AND THE UNIT CHIEF . WE REPEAT: IN AN IMPRESSIVE ATTACK ON A MILITARY POSITION AT SANT A TERESA HOSPITAL--THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER A HOSPITAL BUT AN ARM Y COMMUNICATIONS CENTER--OUR FIGTHTERS ANNIHILATED AND DESTROYED THA T POSITION.
47:47	THE ARMY SUSTAINED 20 KILLED AND 10 WOUNDED . THE COMMUNICATIONS RELAY STATION WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED .
