This generalization process is close to the one imagined by Morin and Jacquemin (1999) for terminology analysis but, as we already said, we cover sequences that are not only nominal ones.
P99-1050
Different measures have been proposed, which are not easy to evaluate (see (Lin and Pantel, 2002) for proposals).
C02-1144
Collins and Singer (1999) demonstrate how two classifiers operating on disjoint features sets recognize named entities with very little supervision.
W99-0613
Among others, (Bikel et a., 1997) learns names by using a variant of hidden Markov models.
A97-1029
The method is close to the one of Morin and Jacquemin (1999), who first try to locate couples of relevant terms and then apply relevant patterns to analyse the nature of their relationship.
