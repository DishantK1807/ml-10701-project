Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) is of central relevance to this study.

The first to explore the idea were Yarowsky and Ngai (2001), who induced a part-of-speech tagger for French and base noun phrase detectors for French and Chinese via transfer from English resources.

via alignment Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) were the first to propose the use of parallel texts to bootstrap the creation of taggers.

This tech390 nique has since been used for other languages and tasks, e.g. morphological analysis (Yarowsky et al., 2001), fine-grained POS tagging for Czech (Dr´abek and Yarowsky, 2005), and tagging and inducing syntactic dependencies for Polish (Ozdowska, 2006).

In contrast, the C&C tagger, which is based on that of Ratnaparkhi (1996), utilizes a wide range of features and a larger contextual window including the previous two tags and the two previous and two following words.

3.1.2 GIZA++ alignments Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) was also used to derive 1-to-n word alignments between the NET Bible and the Wycliffe Bible.

The modern Bible is tagged using the C&C maximum entropy tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003), and these tags are transferred from source to target through high-confidence alignments aquired from two alignment approaches.

The C&C tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003) was trained on the Wall Street Journal texts in the Penn Treebank and then used to tag the NET Bible (the source text).

A near exhaustive list is Chew et al.(2006), Melamed(1998), Resnik et al.(1999), and Yarowsky et al.(2001).

alignments A dictionary file is built using the variation of the Dice Coefficient (Dice (1945)) used by Kay and R¨oscheisen (1993): D(v,w) = 2cN A(v) +NB(w) ≥ θ Here, c is the number of cooccurring positions and NT(x) is the number of occurrences of word x in corpus T.

For example, when producing part-of-speech tags for the Tycho Brahe corpus of Historical Portuguese (Britto et al., 2002), a set of seed sentences was manually tagged, and the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) was then trained on those and consequently used to tag other sentences.
