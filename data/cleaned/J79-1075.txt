3:657	The last formal level of representation in this system is called a logical form.
4:657	The bas~c method of evaluation of logical forms is the generate and test" paradigm, used, for q~&npls in the LUNAR system (Woods, Kaplan and Nash-Webber, 1972 1, althbugh that implementation must be fairly efficient in order te be j~actical on a moderate size data base.
5:657	The basic idea is to keep track of the equivalence.relationships botueen the variables in the logical fcrh and associated constants, and use this information to dexive from the data base the extensions of the predicates contained in the logical form.
6:657	A similar pxoposal has been made by Reitez(1976).
7:657	The logical fo~ms and the process hy which candidate sets are computed from these forms @re described in considesable detail* We believe it shoufd not be necessary for a computational linguistics project to describe operahions beyopd the last lev'el of f orma1 representation in ozdex 5~1 an outsider to understand exactly how a system operates sufficiently well that he.can paedict its behavior.

12:657	Input, from a display device or typewriter-like terminal, is fed to the preprocessox, which segments 5lle input character stsing anto words and performs lexical lookup.
13:657	The process of lookup is complicated somewhat by a provision for synonym and phrase, xeplacement.
14:657	Words like "car" and "automobilew are changed to "auto", an8 strings like "gas stationw are frozen into single lexical units, PAGE 5 Input I I r-----------1 l~repxocessorl <---------Lexicon L------------J I 1 List of lexical tree9 I ----,------1 ITransfozmatlonal parsark <---Strin~ transformations L------d----------------J I I List of trees I p-.-CI-L.T)-(L&LI--L-.LI 'l I Context free parser 1 <-----Contewt free phxa~e L-------------------J strulcruxe rules I 1 List of surface trees I r---.l.l-.IT------.)g-.IIIIL~g 1 1 Wansformational parse* I <---Invexse transformational L-,-,,,-,,-,,,-,-,,-----J grammar I I ueep st~ucture(s1 I r--------c--,-,,,-,----1 ITransformational paxserl <---Data base specific Lrl-lll.l)lll-L-~-~II.I)liIIJ trsnsformational rules I r Quexy structureCs) I r-------------*-----7 1 Semant~c, interpreter I <----Sernhntic rules -----------------,,J <-I 7 1 I Logical form(s) 1 I f --------1 I IEvaluatosl <-----------Data base L,,,,,,,,, J I 1 Answer Figure 1 ---------~--C-----------II~C~C~CIIIIL PAGE 6 The output from the lexical lookup is a l~st of tzansl each tree, contaznzng padrk of s~,er!ch in.brmatxorr, gyntactzc faaturcs and scrmantlc featut:es, RS requ~r~d A descz~~t~r~n~ of the, lexical cornpol>cetlt, now absul~t~ ln rts detarl but still valid 111 main outline AS glvan ln Rob~nsarr( 19733.

17:657	The effect of thls pnase is to reduce the nurnber of surface paxses and the amount of work clone in the transformational cycle.
18:657	The resulting list of trees 1s input to a context free paserr whlch produws a set of surface trees, each of which 1s fed to the trzinsf~rmatianal recognizer.
19:657	The recognizer attempts to find at1 yqd-~Xl~-ajjg ~-ru&t'l~r~q foq each surface tree, PlathClQ73).
20:657	Typically only one of a set of surface trees ill resultLn an underlying structure.
21:657	This structure itself 1s input once agaln to the tkansfoxmational recognize^:, uslng a (smalJ1 set of grammar rules tailored to a speciTic data base to produce a suerv structu~e, Query structu~es are similar to underlying structures In form, but re-flect the paticular rneanmg constraints resulting from the format and content of a given data base.
22:657	The query stxucture tree 1s processed by a Knuth-style semantic intexpreter, PeteLck t19771, producing a losical form.
23:657	A logical form can best be thought of, In PAGE 7 our* corntext, as a retrievaZ expressiwn.
24:657	which is to v be1 evaluated, producing an anwer to the English input query.
25:657	Since the major part 02 tlris paper is co.ncerned uith procefsing logical forms, discussion of their specifics vhll be deferzed until later The process of answer extraction from the data base is accr~aplished by a cotnbinatWn of LISP and FLII programs, described below, and an experimental relational data base manactenrent system called Relational Storage System (RSS) (Astrahan.
26:657	et al. 1976).
27:657	The RSS provides the capabiJiity to generate a data base of n-ary xelations, with indexes on any field of the relation, and low-level access commands lixe OPEN, NEXT?
28:657	CLQSE, wit11 appropriate paraneters, to retrieve information from such a data base.
29:657	All the proce.ssing modules are under the control of a driver mdule, which maintains cornmfinication with the user, calls the processors in the corzect sequence, and tests for errors.
30:657	An example of the procgssing of a question, with tHe intermediate outputs, is given in Figure 2.
31:657	In this example, *he numbers 2945, 6535, 6635, 6975 are the numbers of milliseconds .of computez time used up to the point shown, on an IBM S/370 Model 168 The strUctures printed are a bracketted terminal s.tting representation of structdres which are stored and manipulated as trees by the PAGE 8 what are the heights of the drug stores ? 2945 SURFACE STRUCTURES: (C(NH SOME) (THING XI)) BE (THE ((HETGHT X4) car c'~fi~ ((DRUG-STORE 591) X~))III ?.I 6535 UNDERLYING STRUCTURZS: 1.

37:657	Ffom this bzicd description, it should be apparent that the TQA system, considexed as a blach box, is sirn'ilar td many sthers:.
38:657	1.n particular, there is a desi9nated level of meaning representation, the logical Zoxrn, which is the lbsk formal construct in the system.
39:657	The remaining processing necessary ko derive an answer and to format it for presentation to a user is accomplished ny an unstructured se-1; of computer programs.
40:657	Two sepazate issues azise as a resu3 $: how efficzently can the logical form be evalu'aled against a real data base, and to what eztent do the processing functions eurther specify meaning, beyond that carried by the logical form?
41:657	FVALUATION OF LOGICAL FORM!$ Th.e basic method of evaluation of lpgical forms is the "generate and testv paradigm used, for example, i.n the LUECAR PAGE 10 system LJoads Kaplari and Nasli-Webbex, 1972 I. The simple version of this paradigm, used by Wooas and implemented in our eazly systems, in~olves checking pre-selected lists 05 objects or, in the worst case, all the objects hnonn to the system, to see, if they satisfy.
42:657	tile query pxed'icates.
43:657	It is computationally impractical except foq small data bases.
44:657	Our current* variant 05 this metllad js much more efficient.
45:657	The basic idea is to keep track of the equivalence relatibnships between the vaxiables in the logical form and associated conskants, and use this information to derive the extensions c# the pxedica~tes contained in the logieal form f%am tne aata base.
46:657	A similar-pxo~osal has been made by Reeiter(19761 We do not how.ever, m&Re such extensive use of quekp trgnsformations as Reiter outlined.
47:657	Logical farm$ Zn order to describe the eualfiation process, it is necessary to describe the 1olgicaL form in s~mewht more detail, referring fos example again to Figure 2.
48:657	In the fixst place, excepr +or the set-forming function satx, which takes as arguments a variable name and a proposition, all other weX.1,-fo2:med folimulqs are composed of predicates and their argu~~ients . Some of the predicates are perfectly ordinary like qreati!rthan.
49:657	Some are quantifiers, like fox:~tdeast, which Cakes a limit argument n, an argument PAGE 11 which is a set?
50:657	and a proposition e, and which is true just in case or more elements 05 the specifred set satisfy the proposition e. Others axe special application predricates like parceL, which is true just in ease its single ergurnen-t is a parcel identifier.
51:657	The hain data base related ptedicate is named testfct.
52:657	Referring to Figure ZI it is seen that Cestfot has three arguments, The first is w constant or a variabLe which will be replaced by a constant befaye evaluation, the second argument is a llst whose memtbers determine a particular: data base value, and the third is an operator specifying the relation which must hold between the iirst argumentsand the data base value detexmined by the 'second argument.
53:657	The data base oan be thought of as a collection Q+ binary relations, all shirring the same key.
54:657	In our applicq,tiob, this is thQ parcel identification gr: account number, by which any piece af pg~perty can be identified.
55:657	The list which is the second argument of testfct consists of the relation name and the* key which identifies a va1u.e in the relation.
56:657	The key actually has two parts.
57:657	The second part is a yeah now unused, although since the files in nhich we are currently intereded are changed on a yearly basis, we anticipate maintaining and accessing historical data.
58:657	The first part of the key is the account number mentioned above.
59:657	In gener a1, the second argument of testfct must be PAGE 12 sufficient to identify a unique binary rela*ion and value in that relation.
60:657	If the logical form is itsel5 a proposition the system will answer eithek "yes" or "no" . If the logical form has a tdp level setx, the system wi-13 print the membezs of the set satisfying the specisied proposition, pexhaps along with some identify3ng information: Simplifications A number of simulificatlom can be, and in part have been, carried out on logical iorms prior to eva~hation.
61:657	Some pxedicates, for example, are essentiazly empty for purposes 02 evaluation, in that they always evaluate to true,.
62:657	As an e'xample, the predlcate dollar, for information Sields referring to taxeg, is empty of meaning because the pxocessor assumes thAt the contents of the %axes field are always dollars.
63:657	A slightly less obvious example of a possible sfmpliSication can be seen in Figure 2.
64:657	The set argument of the foratleast pregicate cantains no free variables.
65:657	It is not necessary, therefore, to evaluate the inner setx funmtion for each evaluation of the predicate.
66:657	Instead, the setx function is evaluated as soon as the semanuc interpretex has discovered that it has no iree variables* using the standard evaluation mechanism, and the value, i.e., a set, is substituted for setx axpression.
67:657	Our system perFormk simpl-if ications 04' this Rind in its normal mede (although it can also delay ~11 evaluations qntil a comple%e form hasbeen built), so that the final logkcal foxm seen by the retrieval furlotions during p~oceSsiw is usually that shown ia Figure 3, where the innei set^ has been replaced hy the satisfy-iing set viz the parcel identifiers of the set of drug sto~es.~ L+ker all the applkc@le simp&ifirathons have been donel tht~ resulting form is passed to the evaluation function, E,V,ALU.
68:657	The Pre-evaluator It might seem that since the system has been written in LISP, it would 0nJ.y be necessary to define the appropziate functions and then call 'the regulax LISP evaluator, ~nstead of a special evaluator like EVALU.
69:657	WI~ile Chis would be possible, the aifficulty with such an a~proac~h can readily b~ seen by considering the embedded setx in Figure 2.
70:657	The desired set of X7s is that set of parcel identifiers fo which the associated land use code is "59 In.
71:657	testfct is a predicate which is true for the appropriate X7sr but wha$ 1s the candidate set of X75 which should be tested?
72:657	At wurst, the system might consider the set of all objects it knows about.
73:657	AS a better choice, the system cou3d infer from the syntax of testfct that +he candidates are all members of the set of parce'l identifiers, but still there are almost 10,000 PAGE 14 what axe the helgnts 02 the arug stores ? 2930 SURFACE S'TRUGTURES: 1.

77:657	Looking in tllc data base for that set of identifiers fox which the land use code is 591 If the data base is properly organized, such a search can be very zast Not all predicates are so simple however.
78:657	The remainder of this section will describe.
79:657	in some detail llbw caradidate sets for more complicated p%edicates are rived at.
80:657	Once can'di3ate sets hav.e been computei~ the EVALU function can invoke *he LISP evaluator od tlla logical form.
81:657	T~E! alternative of including a candidate generatow 'in the setx program and a12 the ~dtential top level predicates and then applying the LISP EVAL function directly seems much less attraative . As a pxeliminary, notice that we need only ipsuxe that candidate sets have been established fd'r all the setx variables in a logical for111.
82:657	This is so Because, while each quantifier has an associated variab-le, the domain of that quantifier is either given explicitly as a If st,o-f constarrts, or implicitly by absetx expxessioxi.
83:657	Secondly, since the object of pre-evaluation is merely to find efficient.
84:657	, not neCesr-~ily optimal, candidate set's far the setx variables, we need not keep track of the structure of a complex predic-ate.
85:657	As an example, consider Figt1r:e 4, whi~h is the logical 5orm foz the question, "What drug stores are located in wazd 8?v The prddicate of the s-e& is "andvT, but for pu~pposes o'f: PAGE 16 (setx 'X2 C and t testf ct ' 59 1 'CrLUC XZ '1976) C= ) (testfct l ' $ ?WARD X2 '19761 '= ) I ) detexmxning a candidate set we can consider each term of the "andw individually.
86:657	Evaluation of the farm with a given candidate set will ensure that a particular member satisfies both terms of the lVand1l.
87:657	Operation of the re-evaluation function.
88:657	Pre-evaluation is accomplished by a functioli EVALUA.
89:657	, which takes a logical formr it a setx expression or a proposition as its argument.
90:657	It determines the type of form with which it is dealing and calls an appropriate specialist roufihe If as in the case of the llandlr of Figure 4, the logical form being considered contains more than ohe component form, EVALUA caiLs i-bself fecursively.
91:657	Consequently, pre-evaluation is a depth-first, left-to-rimht process.
92:657	The function always zeturns nil, a woxk beilly a.cczliiipl~~~, hy changes to global vaxiables.
93:657	Among these are a LISP variable which PAGE 17 contains a list of all set* variables in the logical foxm, a LISP variable which lists each query variable for which a value has been founiir and its value, and a LISP vax,iable which keeps track 0% the equality relationships which have been discovered between query vaziables for which a value is yet to be found.
94:657	Operation of the aZgorithm can be better understood by considering somewhat more complicated examples than those seen pteviously.
95:657	When EVALUR is given the logical 9orm 03 What psrcels have an area exceeding 550000 square feet ? 7524 LOGICAL FORM: Csetx 'X2 (and C3oratleast 1 'X39 (setx 'X5 ' (tkstfct X5 ' ( 'PARAREA X2 ' 1976) '= 1 1 Vgreatexthan Y39 '5500001 1 (parcel ~21 1 1 Figure 5 Figure 5, it calls the setx specialist, which adds X2 to the (null) list of set variables and the (null) list of query vakiables, and calls EVALUA with the associated setx predicate, :'andvr.
96:657	As mentioned.
97:657	, t%is simply results in two PAGE 13 calls to EVALUA, the Sirst of which causes the quantifier Spedlali~t to be invoked.
98:657	(The second call, when made, will not cause any change to the global lists oE candidate values far variables, since a cand~date set of all parcel identifiexs is not useful for purposes of retrieval).
99:657	X39 is added to the list of query variables, and the domain argument of the quantifier is inspected.
100:657	When this is seen te be an instance of setx rather -t;han a list of constants, two actions are taken.
101:657	Notice that whatever the domain, of X39 19, it is a subset (perhaps not a proper subset,) 05 the domain of X5, e the candidate set for X5 must include at least a31 of the elements of X39.
102:657	Further, any restrictions which can be imposed on X39 can also 'be imposed on X5, since the proposition associated with the quantifier is the one to be satisfied, and any candidate not maeting this criterion would be super'il~uow.
103:657	Therefore, we ban 11 enter into the is of variable relationships the information that for purposes of the pre-evaluator, X39 and X5 are equivalen and 2,) call EVALUA once more with the setx associated with X5 as an axgument.
104:657	X5 is added to the lUlst of set vaxiables, and reinvocation of EVALUA with the setx predicate causes a call to the specialist fox testfct.
105:657	Since there axe two variables in testfct, X5 and X2, for whfch values are unknown, ascall to the data base cannot yet be made.
106:657	The instance of testfct is placed-on a list of pending lata base calls, PAGE 19 preceded by the variables which require values.
107:657	(Each time a value for a variable is found, that list is inspected, and any data base calls which can then bk made are executed).
108:657	Return is made to the quantifier specialist, which calls EVALUA with the predicate ovex: whose ax guments quantification is.made, viz.
109:657	, .crreaterthaq.
110:657	The specialist for numeric predicates, finding that one argument is a variable and the othet a constafbct, causes a hhanse in the variable list to show that X39 and consequehtly X5 are greater than 550,000.
111:657	A value like ~>550,000~~ can be used by the data base componen* Lo narrow its search just as well as a constant or list of constants, and is therefore acceptable as the value of a candidate list-.
112:657	These changes to the v.ariable iists cause the list of pending data base calls to be inspected and, since only one varsable is now unknown in the stacked testfct, a call to the data base is made for those pascels with an area greater than 550,000 square feet.
113:657	The specialist for testfct instructs the data base search routine to return as a value a list coxxesponding to the remaining varia-ble in the Zorm, i. X2.
114:657	In the present example, that is a llst of parcel numbeks, viz.
115:657	, those parcels which have an area exceeding 550,000 squaxe feet.
116:657	This list is then assigned as the value of the candidate set for X2.
117:657	PAGE 20 The stack of recursive calls to EVALUA will now unwind, until a return is made ta the eJaluation function EVALU.
118:657	This function de-kermines that candidate lists fox all the se.tx variables have been found?
119:657	and weates a hew list of variable-candidate 'get pairs for use by the setx functYon itself.
120:657	Finally, EVAIJJ &an call the LISP evaluator, with the original logical f oxm as an argtrment . The case of nesatives ., The predicate wnotwp denoted in our system by not* to distinguish it from the LISP not, presents spec=al problchs for the kind of system outlined above.

122:657	Figure 6, which corresponds to the question "What drug stores are not located In traffic zone 6"?
123:657	and variants thereof.
124:657	"When the testfct specialist is given the first half of the anq in this form, along with information that therq is a dominat3ng no**, it could in principle generate a data base call.
125:657	, since there is on1.y one unassigned vaylahle.
126:657	The effect would be the retrieval of all parcel identifiers of parcels nbt located in traffic zone 6.
127:657	This is a subsmt;a~.rtial fraction of the dadta' base, and would require in~rdknate amounts of time and storage space to handle Notice that the other half of the and dl1 also provide a candidate list for the variable L3, presumabfy much smaller in size.
128:657	It appeaxs to be the case?
129:657	from our so far lirni%ed experience, that questions containing only 9 single negated search clause hardJy ever occur.
130:657	The evaluator therefore puts a testfct cakl of trhis type on the stack mentioned earlier, indexe t by the variable( s 1 corresponding to the parcel id en ti fie^.
131:657	When the second half of the and of Figure 6 is ~XQG~SS~~, and a value found fox X3, the deferred testfct will be unstauked, resuFting in a data base call, and causihg a retrieval based on that list ok identifiers rather than on the negated value.
132:657	This data base search 1s necessary, since we must find the traffic zones for the parcels contained in the candidate list.
133:657	This example is also an illustration of why, as was mentioned above, the logical form as a whole must in general be evaluated by the LISP evaluator.

137:657	Firstly, notithat the negative must be passed inside the quanti4ie~ since the alternative of &inding all buildings greater than 5 stories in lreight and then getting the complement set with respect toc all buildings is extremely unattractive conbputationally.
138:657	In the sgcond placer a search qualifier of "(= 5" does not intuitively seem to ba much worse than '9 5".
139:657	at least in the absence of data base distribtttibnal statistlcs.
140:657	one might, fherefore, generate search with such a qualifier.
141:657	Oux pxesent eystem does thisl although experience hay show that all instances of t-estfc?
142:657	dominated by no= should be deferred, as a the cases of"v-=", for efficiency rea~ons.
143:657	Other specia~isbs Most of the important specialist routines in Ehe pre7evaluator have already been mentioned.
144:657	There are a few othezs which should be noted.
145:657	One is a generakoz function which, g'iv,en a pxedicate, will produce its extension, from a stored list This featyre was heavilk used in our early system, ahich had a small data base, but is currentLy hardly used at all, though it remains av-aildble.
146:657	In principle, one could, given a predicate XiHe "SCHOOL(X)tlr generate a list 05 schools.
147:657	Tn the pzesedt applioation, this would not be useful, but might in soqe other.
148:657	The sole uses at present a,re q generator for the predicate RANK, far which a list of numbers fxom 1 to 100 3s produced, and for the predicate YEAR, which produces a list of the numbers 1960 to 1985.
149:657	The proposition "[QUA~TITY x slvl is true if #is equal ko the cardinality of the set, 5: The associated specialist hhs the obvious functiorr; of determining when g is an instarsce PAGE 24 of setx.
150:657	Equality between variables can be inferred where the domain of a quantified variable 1s niuen by qn Lnstance of setx, as was illustrated above.
151:657	Certain predicates also allow this inferewe to be made.
152:657	1 is clear that predicates like "VQUAL'~, "SAMRREFt'-, C for ''same referencevr Is and "IDENTIC?AL" should belong to this class.
153:657	Sinco variables can only xefer to individuals, the predicate rvMEMBER'T arso is in this class e . g. , given (MEMB~R X3 (SCTX  11.
154:657	a candidate set 'for X3 can be derived by evaluat~ng the seCx expressioh.
155:657	Furtherefficiencv conside-rations.
156:657	Tt has already been noted that generation Srom instances 05 testfct with an operator of "-=" are deferred until enough information is available to execute the quesy using a list of parcel identifiers.
157:657	Some other steps have also been taken to reduce daka base access time and subsequent evaluation the For one thing, the semantic intesp~eter has a preferred order~ng for instances of the predicate testfct.
158:657	For example, the relation h~~~~w divides the parcels of the city into 6 classes, while the relation "XUC" [Land Use Code) divides the parcels inte several hundred classes.
159:657	If there is no intrinsic reason for ordering the instances of tes+fct differently, the one with lvLUC'q wi-11 occ~ ear lie^ in the logical formJ (cf.
160:657	Figure 41.
161:657	The pre-evaluation specialist PAGE 25 Sox testfat makes use of this ordering in two ways.
162:657	If a Gariable has been assigned a list of identifiers containing fewex membersthan some thxeskold x, is currently smt to 25, but can easily be changed), then a retrieval wlll alwa-ys be made using the list of identifiers rather than by a constant compared.
163:657	to data base values.
164:657	In Figure 4, the second call to the,.test-Ect specialist uill look up the ward of the foux drug stores instead of Einding the l~undreds of parcels in ward 2.
165:657	In some instances, varticularly far relations like Land Use Cde, this may result in mor& d9ta base accksses than retrieving a new set of keys depending on value, but the improvement cannot be large.
166:657	In many o%,ber instances, there is a big reduction in accesses.
167:657	If the caqdidate set is laxger than.25, retrieval will be made using the oonstant, but the length of the curtent candidate list is used to limit the number of accesses.
168:657	Thus?
169:657	if the curren-f;~ candidate list is 50, the data base access progEam will terminate if it finds mofe than 50 identifiess wPth the value being used.
170:657	A re-access is then made using the' list of identifiers.
171:657	Again, this may r;esuIt in.inefficiency in some cases where searches are ended just before normu termination, but it does provide a guarantee against excessively long zetrievals.
172:657	Any number of other efficiency measures could be adopted?
173:657	and more may be necessary than we now have.
174:657	For the moment, PAGE 26 these seem to pxovide acceptable retrievaf times.
175:657	The EvQluatox?
176:657	For the most part, evalua%ion of loQica1 forms is quite straightforward.
177:657	Hidden semantic effects are discussed in the next sectkon; here we are mainly concerned with computation.
178:657	Each instance of setx searchgs the l4st of variable-candidate set pairs to find the cand~date set associated with its own variable and substitutes the members of the set far the variable one by one into ~ts associated predicate.
179:657	Those members of the candidate set fox which the predicate evaluates to true are placed in the solutlon set.
180:657	Operation of the quantifier predicates is similar to that 03 setx, except that, as in Figure 5, ~t may be necessary to evaluate an instance of setx to find the domain of the qua'ntif ication variable Evaluation of the ~ther predicates consists simply of applying a coz~esponding LISP function to the arguments.
181:657	Sometimes the final fagical form to be evaluated bears no obvious relation to the input questi.on, as in Figure 8.
182:657	The usual reason is t11a.t: a large amaurP of evaluation was done PAGE 27' Are there inore than 25 phrcels in the Carhart neighborhood ? 36229 LOGICAL FORM: (greaterthah '176 '25) Figure 8 duxing interpretation.

186:657	PAGE 23 The evaluatign of the predicate test'fct is not as nbbious as that of the othGrs One of the design goals in the project has been to make it reIatiLo1y easy to move from one data base to another.
187:657	As past of that ef5brt, we have attempted to make the LISP programs, as c-ontsnsted tb the PL/I programs, insensitive to the stxuctuxe of the data base.
188:657	Oux approach to ti has been to define a list strdcture, essenthlly nested binary relatSanS, into which the zeal data st!zucture is mapped.
189:657	Restructuring is accomplished by the PL/I program which serves as the LISP RSS interface.
190:657	At the same tune.

193:657	0x11~ the sub-data base is used durlng evalugtion ofgloglcal forms, to find values corresponding to keys in the instances of testfct.
194:657	In addition to isolating the XISP programs from he zeal data structure, this +actlc makes it unnecessary for any programs called by the evaluator to re-access the full data base, with a consequent efficiency gain.

198:657	$EMANTIC EFFECTS EVALUATIOV In principle the processes which will bw used to compute the answer to a query should be obvious at the level of evher the query structuze or the logical form.
199:657	We have not, however, been zompletely successful in accomplishing this.
200:657	In some cases, we can see how it might be done and have n~t gotten around to doing it because of more urgent concexns.

261:657	This is not to impw that we regard modification 09 a table whose size is on the order of a grammar as trlvlal; quite the contrary.
262:657	Nonetheless, we believe it is easier to change-a grammax or PAGE 39 a semantic interpreter expressed in table form than it is to change a Special parser ox a special interpreter.

FINDLER AND SHU-HWA LEE Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Buffalo 4226 Ridge Lea Road Amherst, New Yokk 14226 ABSTRACT We describe the continuation of an earlier b70rk on the prbblm of lexical coverage.
272:657	The objective is to prove experimentally certain mathematical conjectures concerning the relationshi?
273:657	between the sizes of the covering and covered sets of words, an&-maximun lenqth of dictionary definitions.
274:657	The data base on which the experiments are cerried sut bas been also extended t6 the full contents -of an existinq dictionary of computer terminology.
275:657	The rwults of the previous and present work lay the foundqtions for quantitative studies on lexical valence and its relation to the frequency of usage and other principles ofb ditztionary selection.
276:657	Besides the inherent interest in t-hese investigations, the concepts dealt with and the methods of cgantifying dictionary variables may eventually lead to more' efficient dictionaries with respect to precision, compactness, and computer time andmemory needed for processing.
277:657	Supported by ASF Grant MCS 76-24278.
278:657	First, we shall introduce the problem define same basic terms and provide a brief historical account of pi(st results.
279:657	In order to rendter this paper fiairly self-sufficient, @ brief sunwry of th& previous work, Flndler Viil (1974), %"ill af so have to be giken.
280:657	A mono1 ingual dictionary may be considered economical and efficient if a mall set of words are used to define a relatively large set of entties.
281:657	Quantitative information as to what size vocabulary is needed to cover a given number of entries is very scarce and may be characterized by two "data points*: The New Method Enalish Dictionary published by N.P. Best and J.G. Endicott in 1961 uses 1,490 self-defined basic words to explain some 10,000 words and 6,000 idioms, i.e. about 24,000 expressions, Thus, the size ratio is 0.062.
282:657	Oqien's Basic English, published in 1933, involves 850 English words and 50 !!internationaly words to defihe 20,OOu EnglTsh words.
283:657	The ratio of the covering and covered set sizes is 0.045.
284:657	The basis of selection was the Wusefulness" of the words employed in the definitions, as opposed to the freouencg of their occurrence in some standard texts.
285:657	Howelvet, neither this concept nor other principles of selection suggested by other researchers have ever been quantitatively analyzes and made use of.
286:657	We hall discuss these issues later on.
287:657	In order to approach the problem in definite terns, Findler ( 1 970) considered three basic variables : (i) the c~verinp set, I Rt qf sfze vR, (ii) the covered set, S, of size us, (iii) the maximum fief inition leffpth, -I N such that each word in I) S can be defined hy at most N ordered words from R. The task was formulated to find (4 v, as a fpnction of vS at different parmetric values of N, and I (b) V~ as a function of P.r at different parametric Values Callinu AvR/AvS increment ratio and vR/vS size ratio, the following cbn) ectures vere made concernina the f Srst task : (al) he,increment ratio is, in general, less than one.
288:657	(a2) The increment ratio, in general, decreases as vs increases, (a3) For larue constant values or Nt vR approaches a limitin?
289:657	value asvmptotically as vs increasep.
290:657	(a4) The increme& ratio never exceeds the size ratio.
291:657	Two points need to benoted in this connection.
292:657	An exception co rules (al) and (a21 would occur in a dictionary system, whi'ch does not treat polysemous words or homonyms as individual entries, every time a new word with many meanings or homonyms~ i.s introduced into the covered set, Second, the cited case is an exception to ruie (al) but not to (a4) . When N=1, the covering and the covered sets are of the same size, i.e, botn the increment ra'tio and the size batio equal one, However, not every word is defined By itself only.
293:657	If a new word is introquced that.
294:657	already has a synbonm in the coverihg set, it will be defined by that synonym.
295:657	In this caser the increment ratio is 0 and the size ratio becomes less than 1.
296:657	(This will be clear with the description of the data base construction on page 11).
297:657	For the seoond general task, (b) the followinq conjectures were also mads: (bl) vR monotonically decreases aer I N rncreases.
298:657	(b2) For any fixed value of vS, vR asymptoticallv a~pfoaches a lower limit as N increases ahout bound.
299:657	~ft seems reasonable to state $n a nualitative sense that in the process of aenerating a dictionarJl ~maller vR values mean smaller storage remirements whereas smaler I N values td to reduce processinp time and output volume.
300:657	In order tp answer the question "What are the optirum Hlues of vR and N for a given vs for a certain (family of) conmuter applications on a machine with a given cost structure'?
301:657	one hlts to consider the interrelation of the above three basic variables and to compute three entitles: the semantic index (raughlv, the nwef of different meanings1 of the elements in the covered set, the lexical valence (roughly the capahilitv substituted for another the elements in the coverincr set, and the fwyency of dccurence of  the elements of bath aeta.
302:657	Quantitative invest2gations of the last three dictionary variables are planned to follou!
303:657	the present, second stage of our study, THE DATA BASE AND THE PRWRA' We have e~tended the data base used in our preaious work, Findler and Viil (1.974).
304:657	The whole contents of the alcwonary on computer technalooy, Chandar (1970), is now included in the presenr study.
305:657	Its structure, cathex simple and unif arm, is described below.
306:657	First, same ereneral principles of data hase constructiop are outlined.
307:657	Evew element of the covereg set is considered a single lexical item, regardless of the number of words the ori~inal dictionary entry consiats of.
308:657	Also.
309:657	each word J.s coded as a striha of at moat 10 characters (containable in one CDC Cyber computer word).
310:657	The abbrevhtians ere still easy to *ad with relatively short practice.
311:657	Only the dominant meanincj bf poJgsemous terms was dealt with.
312:657	Each entrv .\ has thus one meaning and one definition.
313:657	Termr in the definitions (elements of the coverfng set) are also qonsidored lexical items, Le.
314:657	even multiword entl.t~es appear as a sfnple unit and are represented by at most 10 characters, The basic vocabulary, that is the covering set, consist^ of elements tha.t also appeap in thq pvered set-.
315:657	In our particular case, they are non-technical words used to aefine the technical tens of t-he computer dictiwanfi.
316:657	definite distinction was made between content wbras and functiqn words (also called operators), The latter were not bnclud&d in the covefing set nor were they counted in determining the length of definitions.
317:657	Hence, eh* covaring Set conbists only of content words.
318:657	The function words indicate grammatical and loaical relationships between the words contributing to the content.
319:657	They belong to 17 categories: 1) prepositions, o.a. of, &, E: 2) conjulllctions, e.p. and, -r or if; 3) the relative pronoun which; preposition.
320:657	and relative ~ronoun, which, to which, bv whichm L' 5) prefiefit particlple~ equivalent to a areposition, e. g. usinq,I containiny, representinn: 6) comkinakiens of participle and preposition, e4b consisting of, opposed to, applied to; 7) combinations of ad j sctive and preposition, em q, capable af, ~xclusiva of, equal to; 8) combinatiohs of noun and nrevsitian, e.~.
321:657	part ofi set of, number of; 9) combinations of ~r'eposition, now, and preposition, e. a. in terms of, bv means of, in the form pf; 10) prepositional phrases associated with a f ollowiny inflnitfve, e.9, used to, necessary to, in order to: 1 1) other f requentlv used purely functional expressions, e. a. for example, namelv known as.
322:657	Y8 Actually, the E~ction words byere rc~laced hy code numbers in the dictionary.
323:657	The code numhers were assigned consecutively as the function wards-evere needed durincr the conqtructian of the eta base so that the order is puxelv random.
324:657	A complete list of the 121 FunctioR wards used, toaether with their code numbers, is qiven in Table I. "w-m----~-~-m---m-mmmmm-pm---* IN$FRT TABLE I ABOUT HERE he oriqinal definitions were oarnewhat silnplif ied and qtandazdized.
325:657	In this process, articles were omitted (many languaces do very well without them).
326:657	On tffe other hand, implicit relationships were made explicik, NOWS are represented in singular, thus avoid in^ another dictionary entrv far plural or, what would be worse, prourasmnina a mcrrammnr".
327:657	Likewise.

329:657	FNddinu the third person singular eliminates, another dietianary entry, and avoiding thg nassive voice eliminates a great manv participles, which otherwise ulould have had* to be entered.
330:657	Of course, present .and past participles (the former identical to gerund in farm) could not always be avoided and had to he entered in the dictionary where needed.
331:657	Auxiliary verbs vere automatically eliminated by avoiding gompound tenses and the passive voice.
332:657	Finally, *to don associated with neaationp was sim~ly omitted.

360:657	The data, base was constructed by selecting the first entry, then entering all the lexical items in its definition, subsequently enterinq all the lexical items in the definitions of these, etc. Words that were not defined in Zhe original dictionary were entered and defined hv themselves; they constitute the basic vocabulary.
361:657	This procedure was continued until everythhff was defined, i.e. until all the terms in the coverina set were also irr the covered set.
362:657	Then the next entry was selected from the dictionary, ah8 the above process was repeated.
363:657	The dictionary was arranged in the form pf a SLIP list, ~indler et al.364:657	(1 971) . Cvery entry (element of the covered set) occupies four cells in this list: (1) enkrv word (as character data, usina FORTWN format specif i&B'tIon A10), (2) def inition length (an inteqer), (3) type of entry (an integer), (4) sublist nahe.
365:657	Three types of entries were distinguished for programming convenience : I 1) code 0 indicates that the entry ikself is not used in any definition i,e, i;t occuxs only in the covered set and not in the covering set; 2) coda1 inaigates that the entry occurs in both Sets and is not an element of the basic vocabulary; 3) code 2 indicates that the entry is deiiined by iteelf, i.e. it belongs to tHe basic vocabulary.
366:657	54 The sublist the nahe of which is in the fourth cell for every entrv .,, in thq main list, contains the definition.
367:657	his arrangement convenient1,y separates the entry worda from those in the definitions.
368:657	A cell in this second level contains either a wbnd (in A10 tormat), i. e. an element of the coverinq set, or a sublist name.
369:657	The codes f,or fQnctian words (integers) are contkined in the cells in the third level, This arranaemen-t> is wntrenient for bypassinq the function words ih orocessino vhen they are not needed.
370:657	The aeneral dictionarv entrv and an example thereof are illustrated in Figure 1.
371:657	INSERT FIGURE 1 =OUT HEFE The fact that every dictionary entry ovns a sublist is aractical in another respect: useful information about the entry om be collected and deposited in a description list associated vrtth the sublist, Pot example, if it, were desired to evaluate the definition component of the lexical valence of each lexi-1 itm, a proaram could be developed that counts how manv times a paxtkular item occurs in the definition a.f ~ther items and stodes this information in the description list created for th~t item.

417:657	But, as computer casts continue to fall, and, as larse computing centers continue to be unresponsive to the needs of their new users, it will not be qneammon to find more and mbre departments purchasing their owh computing facilities and buying or developing their own software This is already happening today, both by externally funded individual researchers and by entire departments in need of specialized computing facilities What kinds of computing equipment are available4or a linguistics department crying to equip itself today?
418:657	My Bnswer is structured, to some extent, by the organization bf language It is widely understood, even by non-stratificational linguists, that the faculty of language is based on a stack of structured systems, each one building a large number of units above from a smaller number below, i,e a handful of phonetic features combine to form less than fifty phonemic segments which combine to form thousands of morphemes,tens or hundreds of thousands of words, an infinite number of sentences and texts expressing countless ideas and concepts It will not be surprising to find that as one climbs this &tack, from phonology upward, the amount of computing powet needed to perform useful tasks and research increases in proportion to the increasing number of units and the complexity of their structuring I will concernmyself, mostly, with the possibilities available for the study of the lower levels This PB because the type of linguistic work being done in the study of the semantic and cognitive levels is still primarily research and the people involved ere more likely to already know their needs and options as far as computing goes Also, since the cost of computing in these areas is somewhat higher, it is less likely that department& will be doing their own purchasing for these purposes HARDWARE FOR T)IE PHONOLOGIST The 8tudent of phonology, morphology and linguistic f feld analysis is concerned .,primarily with the manfpulation of linguist~c text, expressed as a series ot phonemic symbols or blokks of phonetic features.
419:657	fie task is to identify identical or similar subqttings, correlate their appearance with a particular meaning and segment the text into these identified substrings As new substrings aft fdentif ied, the text is ofttn rewritten with o new orgcx~izatlofi based on new understandings, so as to improve the chances oP f idding new ~ubsttings, field workers often use index cards for this purpose Problem after problem is solved in this way, with a pot insignificant amount of time being spent in the reorganizing and tecopying stages It is a tedidus business because it is t ery mechanical In fact, efficient computer algoritllms tor doing much of thq job already exist and have been implemented on nedrly all computers in the form of text editom The task 1$ relatively simple and even the smallest computer available can do an adequate job A linguistics department intcrested %n providing its students ~ith training in the use of computers for this kind of work (and they will become standard toola for the purpose very soon) would do well to purchase as many (one or more) identicdl, small (hobbyist size) computers aq it can afford For educational purposes, the very snalles t microcomputers, equipped dith qodest ~ss storage devices, such as tape cassettes or floppy discs, are jbst fine Assignments in classes can be distributed on departmentally owned or student owned tapes or discs (less that $10 each) These can be automatically duplioated just as assignments are nov mimeographed, they are reuseable and usually Contain enough room to store several assignments, including the partial results &tom day tp da and final solutions For larger, research sized projects, involving dot of telt, or more complicntcd analyses, suuh as automated analysis of phonof ogical tactics, the fasteat microcomputers, with larger mass storage devices, might be more appropriate (Imlicit in the discussion of these types of machines fa the fact thst student use of them is via Bh interactive terminal Microcamputers are not typically operated in 'batch mode', and no benefit could be derived from doing linguistic analysis in anv but an interactive mode of operation ) Whih nl~crocomputers and associated memories are relatively inexpensive, linguists have a genuine need for sophisticated input and output d~vfces which arq somewhat more expensive Standard coaputer terminals generally provlde all md only the characters available on a typewriter keyboard, some provide only upper case letters What is needed is a terminal with the sme capabilities 9s the selectric style typewriter one with changeable type fonts, including the standard phonetic symbol alphabet, yith diacritics CRT terminals' (cathode ray tuber terminals) can provide this type'of operation more cheapty, more relkably, and more flexibly than printing terminals (there is no need to stop and change type fonts) CRT terminals which support user designed type fonts are available, arid in fact, may be the only ones on which the standard phonetic alphabet can be cu~rently supplied These terminals at2 somewhat expensive (apveral thousand dollqrs each), but since they are very flexiblel and often I support some degree of computer gtaphics display as well ad haung che potential to display texts written in any language, they are vahuable educational taolc If all or most of the termint\le in a department are CRT type termlnala, it will be necessary to provide some means of producing 'hard copy' output on paper While most interactions with a computer can take place on a screen, some record of the results of a session will be needed for study and evaluation Printers which can handle the fhexible type fonts needed by linguists are available They are fast they operate in the dame way that copyillg wachines work and simply transfer the contents of the CRY screen to the paper (including graphic materials) They are expensive However, a small department mlght well find that only one of these printers is necessary to meet their n&ds, the results of ~ork done on any of the snall microcomputers could be moved (either over cormbunication lines or carried on a disc or tape) to the printer with little or no delay HNU)\JM FOR THE GWW.'IA,Y Syntax is, perhaps, the most widely studied sub J ect in linguistics today Given that this is so, there ig a real need for linguists, both profess$onal and student, to understand the extreme difficulty of the task of writing a grammar for a language That attempts are made to do this without the aid of a computer is perhaps all the evidence one needs to see that the difficulties are not well understood.
420:657	A formal granmar, particularly one written in the notations commonly used today, is very much like a computer progrm It is a list of instructions for generating a list of strings, a computer program is a list of instructions for performing some process (which might be generating a list of strings) Both need to be precise, both are very complex, both suffer from the fact that a change in one part of the ordered list may cause an unanticipated change in the effect of another part It would be very surprising to find that linguists were better at producing untested, yet correct, #formal charac'terizations of complex processes than computer programmers I eXpect that testing a newfy written gtammar will be as enlightening as experience far a lihguisaics student as debugging a new codolex program is for a gompuer science student, Furthennore, just as the computer is sf uae in studying phonology and morphology, it can also offer data organization servicestto aid in the study of syntax Automated tactic analysis of syntax is still a research project, the!
421:657	software neceqsary for it is not likely to bc produced by a aoftware house.
422:657	But the research ia probably best performed in a linguistics department Having established a need, we must now recall a warning made earlier Useful contributions to the study of syntax by computers requires more computing power than is needed for similar contribution% to the study of phonology and morpl~ology While the need for sophisticated type fonts and input/output devices is lorer (nor necessarily a good eductional svntax program \odd permit: the manipulatioh of syntactic trees on o graphics screen), there is a real need for foster processors and increased memorv capacity To purchase the necessary computing poler, a department would have to step up from the hobbvist microcomputer size machines to the scientific research minicomputer (e g the middle range PDP-11 series) These machines cost a6 order of magnitude more then the microcomputer and yet, when the subject is syntax, will probably only serve a feb students at a time An alternative, available to some departents, is to urie the university's central computing facility* Money could be spent on the best available terminals and the needed comunications equipment Grammar testers have been written by university researchers for typical university size computers (Friedman 1971, for transfbrmational grmars, Kehlen 1976, for ATN grammars) and are available at little or no cost As I mentioned in the beginwing, $he use of the computer in the study of semantics and cognition is still very much a research togxc and little, I any of the work being done currently can be performed on small computers I will not descrgbe the requirements of such work since they vary widely depending an the nature of the work, SOFTWARE FOR TFF LXECUf ST What is missing from the computing faciiities described so far Zs software, programs which are of use In sglving linguistics ptoblems The small coqputqrs are sold with a minimum of very tradittonal computer sdftware, none of it of any use to the nonprograming linguist In tact, at no level of computing powerlis there currently available comercial software which is of use to nonprograming linguists For large computers, as mentioned above some of the results of university research work is available for some purposes However, for the types of machines that departments are likely to purchase, there is essentially nothing This problem can be overcome in two ways The standard method is for a department to hjre a student programmer to design md write the needed software This has several advantages it is relatively cheap (especially when university assistantships are available for the purpose), it is personal the student can be instructed to wrxte exxtly the kind of program thqt is needed The disadvqntnges of this n~cthod Ire in thc quality and dur~bility of the systc~t~s produced Jn this wqy Student ylugronuncrs ?re, in fact, students learning to program Of ten the11 korfc is lwlcjng in the ' ease-oizuse' or 'hunnn engineeringf features found in well written, comme~cially produced programs, and, it is just theqe featu~cs which are very important to useos not Eamibiar with or comfort~ble with compyters Furthermore, programs produced by student progranuncls are not well known for their reliability, maintenance of them is difficrtlt and usually restricted to the period of time that the original programmer is still available Again, to the user unfamiliar with computers, reli3bilit.y is a very important feature It is very discouraging to try to do anything with semi-operational programs An alternative is to create sufficient demand for this type of educational software so tnat a commercial software house or a well funded university programming grqup would consider the investment of its time and money profitable' With linguists and linguistic educators providing input at the design level, very useful and reasonably priced software could he produced in this way The catch, however, lies in generating sufficient demand A final comment about one other potential use of computers within a linguistics departmeqt The search for language universals (cross linguistic research) requires very large collections of uformation A~collection of partial and complete grammars along with sample texts for a large representative sample of human languages 1s a formidable amount of informatio~ The kinds of questions posed by linguists using this information do not require immediate interactive response In fact, they traditionally require weeks or months of library research for answers It is therefore not unreasonable to consider the storage of this information on a small, even hobbyist size, computer equipped with large mass storage devices The task is a difficult one, but of potential value to both linguists and computer scientists Linguists need easier access to thie infolmation A computerized database, structured accoiding to the needs of linguists, would be a very valuable tool wl~ich could be distributed

444:657	"When the computing market was dominated by just a few big companies," Hays says, "it was fairly easy to decide how to handle a computing problem.
445:657	Once a buyer had settled on a computing budget, the market might offer only two or thtee main frames big enough and cheap enough to do the job.
446:657	Now the buyer can design a machine to fit a~purpose, and 'has to choose components out of lists that run up to dozens of alternatives.
447:657	The worst part is, no one publishes th@ list"!
448:657	THE PRESS intends to correct part of the problem by making useful information about the market available in easy language and inexpensive format.

552:657	In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ordered ATFT and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to implement the court's July, 1977, ruling which authorized the Exccunet service.
553:657	In May, the court refused to reconsider Ips earlier decision as requested by ATET and the FCC.
554:657	At press erne, ATGT is seeking s stay while it asks the Supqeme Court to consider the CLISC.
555:657	Despite the 1977 appeals court ruling (which the Supreme Court would not overrule last,January), thr Fcdcrnl C~mn~~lnicat ions Commiss'ion, in February rscc li,z;:~~;~i~~!cn 3t,;?~*t, 4/78, p. 31, held that ATGT was not required to make the additional local corlncctions required to implement Execunet.
556:657	At that time, only Commissioner Joseph Fogarty dissented from the FCC, filing, stating that the commission's action nullified the 1977 appeals court ruling.
557:657	In its April ruling the court agreed, arguing that "MCI is in effect no better off than it w3s during the entire course of the litigatiod in this court.
558:657	Notwithstandifig our favor3ble decisicfn, it is unable to expand Execunet ".
559:657	The appeals court contended that AT&T%nd tbFCC "twisted the issues we contemplated in this case beyond recognition, " ATET had argued that it would have to raise long-distance tekphone rates if competition was introduced by MCI into densely populated areas with Execunet.
560:657	The FCC held that the local connections should be denied, contingent on its study into the effects of competition on ATET.
561:657	The Execunet service, which provides voice 'and data communications, involves calling a local number, then giving a code number to be connected through MCI Is network with another telephone in one of 18 cities now served by Execunet.
562:657	Tlre appeals court decision is also expected to affect Southern Pacific Cnmunications Co.% plans to market a service similar to Exccunct, called Sprint.
563:657	AFIPS lJASIIINGTON REPORT FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 1 SSllES F lKAL APZ'KOVAL FOR NAT1ON\VIDE ACH IN'TERCONNEC'I'I ON _-------_ I --_ __ _ __ __ ---The Frdcral Rcscrve Roard has issued final approval for a nationwjde interconnect ion of nl~tomnted (check) clearing houses (ACIls) which, by the end of this year, could pelnit the Fed's corporate custbmcrs to debit or credit their private custon~ers' accounts using the Federal Reserva Cormnunj cations System (FRCS) (see Wnshington Report, 3/78, p. 8).
564:657	In the past, thc Fed has provided ACH check processing, check set t lcment, and check delivery services on a strictly regional basis.
565:657	Thc April dccision follows a 1976 pilot program undertaken by the Fed wllicll was criticized by a farmer Mite ljouse Office of Telecommunicat~ons Policy (O'TP) cjfficial as a "surreptitious development of an'on-line c;ipnbility".
566:657	In the interregional pilot pmgram, some of the Fed's corporate customers filed debit or credit instructions on magnetic tape with their local ACHs.
567:657	These instructions were then tra~~srnittcd with FCRS to other rcgi onal AClk and cvehtually to the corporate customers banks.
568:657	In January, sccking comment on the prop~scd nationwide program, the Fed's Board of Governors said that "the probable long-run efficiencies resulting from interconnection of all operating ACH facilities justify the ~oard's action at this time to provide these services . . .
569:657	Moreover, the Board rcgands its action to interconnect the current regional ACH facilities as a rcscarch and development program that will provide technicxl data and cxpcricnce in the operation of the nationwide ACH facilities.
570:657	The Federal Reserve System intends ta make this information available to those in the private sector interested in the development of alternati~e systcms.
571:657	" The Fed also cited recommcndati~ns of the National Commission on Electronic Fund Trahsfers [NCEFT) (see WasMngtm Report, 11/77, p. 2) which urged the Fed to continue development of "ACH-like services,"'while also encouraging private sector development in the same aha.
572:657	However, the Privacy Protect ion Study Commission (see Wgsllingtcm Report, 8/77.
573:657	p. 2) rccommendcd that "no Government entity be allomd to own, opcrrate, or otherwise manage any part of an qlectronic payments mechanism thht involves.
574:657	transact ions among private parties.
575:657	The Fed has recently implmented procedures which mandate removal of most all individual names held in a data base after 30 days.
576:657	According to the Fed, 95 out of 121 sets of comments received since last .January crldorsed the interregional ACH connccti-on . Among those critical of the program, the Dcpartment of Justice noted that Federal Reserve involvement would discourage the priyate sector from devkloping similar systcms because the Fed does not charge for its program.
577:657	In its January announcement, the Fed added that provision of the "interbank servicef1 slmuld a1 so "enhance the opportunities open to depository institutions for developing improved 'retail' payments services for the pikb,lic".
578:657	Although not provided for in this nationwide ACH interconnection, a point -of-sale (POS) switch could conceivably link consumers and retailers with ACHs and the Fed. I'he NCEFT urged the Federal government not to become involved "operationally" in POS switches "at present or jn the foreseeable future".
