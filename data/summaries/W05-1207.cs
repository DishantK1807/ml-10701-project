Anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (Morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (Szpektor et al., 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented.

The findings described in (Keller and Lapata, 2003) seem to suggest that count estimations we need in the present study over Subject-Verb bigrams are highly correlated to corpus counts.

entailment patterns As observed for the isa relations in (Hearst, 1992) local and simple inter-sentential patterns may carry relevant semantic relations.

Potentials of the method are still high as different kinds of textual 41 entailment patterns may be defined or discovered investigating relations between sentences and subsentences as done in (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004) for temporal relations or between near sentences as done in (Basili et al., 2003) for cause-effect relations between domain events.

Mutual information has been positively used in many NLP tasks such as collocation analysis (Church and Hanks, 1989), terminology extraction (Damerau, 1993), and word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991).

Some interesting and simple inter-sentential patters are defined in (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).
