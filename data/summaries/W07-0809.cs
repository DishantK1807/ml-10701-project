These tools have been developed to serve an Arabic Lexical Functional Grammar parser using XLE (Xerox Linguistics Environment) platform as part of the ParGram Project (Butt et al 2002).

These solutions include morphological analysis (Beesley 2001; Buckwalter 2002), diacritization (Nelken and Shieber 2005), Information Retrieval (Larkey and Connell 2002), and POS Tagging (Diab et al 2004; Habash and Rambow 2005).

This is also the most common form of implementation for Arabic tokenization (Habash and Rambow 2005).

With regard to syntactic and morphological flexibility, MWEs are classified into three types: fixed, semi-fixed and syntactically flexible expressions (Baldwin 2004; Oflazer et al 2004; Sag et al 2001).
