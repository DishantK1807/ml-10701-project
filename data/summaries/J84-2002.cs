Allen and Perrault's (1980) method of handling fragments involves unifying (in the technical sense of the term) the effects of the possible surface speech acts corresponding to the fragment with expected goals of the speaker.

LET'S REQUESTS \["Let's go to the little tiny blue cap"\] 5% Recent work of this type (Allen 1979, Appelt 1981, Bruce 1983, Bruce and Newman 1978, Bruce and Schmidt, Cohen 1978, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Cohen and Perrault 1979, Perrault and Allen 1980, Schmidt 1975, Sidner and Israel 1981) has resulted in formal and computational models of communication that have been applied in analyzing dialogues about tasks and stories.

Current theories propose that the speaker's intentions underlying the use of indirect speech acts can be recognized as a by-product of a more general, independently motivated process of inferring a speaker's plans (Bruce 1983, Cohen and Perrault 1979, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Perrault and Allen 1980, Schmidt 1975, Sidner and Israel 1981).

Details of this process can be found in (Allen and Perrault 1980, Perrault and Allen 1980).

This approach has led to formal and computational models of discourse processing (Allen 1979; Allen and Perrault 1980; Brachman et al.1979; Cohen and Levesque, in preparation; Sidner et al.1981). Although these provide a more comprehensive account of indirect speech act interpretation than previous linguistic or philosophical approaches, they have not been tested against a corpus other than the ones that supported their creation (e.g., Horrigan 1977).

Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the I~lodality of Communication 6.2 Analyzing indirect identification requests Perrault and Allen (1980) have proposed the following plan-recognition inferences: â€¢ Action-effect: If the observer thinks the agent wants to do an action, the observer can posit that the agent wants that action done in order to achieve its typical effect.

Finally, Thompson's (1980) extensive tabulation of utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison overlaps the analysis in this paper at the level of syntax.

Previous investigations have concentrated on syntactic differences between spoken and written language (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982, Thompson 1980), with the goal of adapting parsing techniques to handle the syntax of spoken language.

Russell Using the propositional act of referring, Searle argues against Russell's (1905) theory of descriptions, which holds that the uttering of an expression "the if" is equiv3, The analysis of referring in Cohen (1984) makes use of a theory of communication of Cohen and Levesque (1980, in preparation) that does not require the recognition of illocutionary acts.
