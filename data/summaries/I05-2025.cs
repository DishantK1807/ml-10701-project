The error rate of a tree obtained by using the whole dataset for training is then assumed to be the average error rate on the test set over the N runs (Eugenio and Moore and Paolucci, 1997).
P97-1011
This is better than that mentioned in (Moser and Moore, 1995b).
P95-1018
summary: summary, restatement Annotation includes two stages: first, we allowed two coders to choose “explanation” relations signaled by because using (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993)’s 3-way classification.
J93-3003
(Elhadad and McKeown, 1990) explored the problem of cue selection.
C90-3018
This conclusion is the same as (Quirk and Greenbaum and Leech and Svartvik, 1972) and (Moser and Moore, 1995b)’ opinion, i.e., because typically occurs in the second span.
P95-1018
This study follows (Eugenio and Moore and Paolucci, 1997) (Litman, 1996)’ s approach to identify the best learned models by comparing their error rates to the error rates of the other models.
P97-1011
(Moser and Moore, 1995a) put forward a method to identify the features that predict cue selection and placement.
P95-1018
(Eugenio and Moore and Paolucci, 1997) used C4.5 to predict cue occurrence and placement.
P97-1011
Example 4.1 [Global warming will be a major threat to the whole world over the next century.]–S– contrast –N–[But [because it will take many years for our actions to produce a significant effect,]– S–explanation –N–[the problem needs attention now.]] (From CNNSE) In order to assess reliability of annotation, we followed (Moser and Moore, 1995b)’s approach to compare the disagreements of results annotated by two independent coders from three aspects.
