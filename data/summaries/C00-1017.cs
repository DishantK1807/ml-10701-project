In related research, (Crocker and Brants, 19991 present evidence that an incremental stochastic parser based oll Cascaded Markov Models (Brants, 1999) can account tbr a range of experimentally observed local ambiguity preferences.

This increase in contextual information has t)(;(;11 shown 1;o improve t)erforlnance (.Johnson, 1998), and the model is also shown to be rolmst to the inerementality and memory constraints investigated here.

Additionally, (Chanfiak et al., 1998) and (Roark and Johnson, 1999) do not use the original Penntree encoding tbr the context-fl'ee structures.

Work Probably mostly related to the work reported here are (Charniak et al., 1998) and (Roark and Johnson, 1999).

This is in contrast to (Charniak et al., 1998) who rank all edges.

(Chanfiak et al., 1998) use a non-incremental procedure, (Roark and Johnson, 1999) use a look-ahead of one word.

(Collins, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 199711 might have been attributed to special properties of these models.

We do, however suggest that our result should apply to richer, more sophistacted probabilistic SComparison of results is not straight-forward since (Roark and Johnson, 1999) report accuracies only tbr those sentences for which a parse tree was generated (between 93 and 98% of the sentences), while our parser (except for very small Imams) generates parses for virtually all sentences, hence we report; accuracies for all sentences.
