Recently it has been shown that noun phrase analysis is effecrive for the improvement of the application of natural language processing such as information retrieval (Zhai, 1997).

One was called as the adjacency model which was inspired by (Pustejovsky et aal., 1993), and the other was referred to as the dependency model which was presented by Kobayasi ~t al.

Besides, the structure in each inside phrase can be determined by the word cooccurrence based method presented by Lauer (1995) and.

Re(:ent works have shown that the corpus-b;~sed approach for nominal compound analysis makes a good result to resolve the ambiguities (Fustcjovsky et aal., 1993; Kobayasi et aal., 1994; Lauer, 1995; Zhai, 1997).

Lauer (1995) has claimed that the ~h',lmndency model makes intuitive sense and i)r~)duces t)(,,tter results.

In the field of natural language processing, various computational models have been established for syntactic analysis and semantic interpretation of nominal compounds (Finin, 1980; McDonald, 1982; Arens ct aal., 1987; Pustejovsky et aal., 1993; Kobayasi et aal., 1994; Vanderwerde, 1994; Lauer, 1995).

Ma~W researchers have proposed conceptual asso(:iation to ba(:k off the lexical association on the assumption that words within a (;lass behave similarly (Resnik, 1993; Kobayasi et aal., 1994; Lauer, 1995).

In addition, we compared three different models to evaluate our system default model by the dominant pattern, dependency model presented by Kobayasi et al.(1994) and Lauer (1995), a.nd our model.
P95-1007
For the dependency model, we used the method presented by Lauer (1995).

Lauer (1995) has compared two diffbrent models of corpus-based approaches fbr nominal compound analysis.
