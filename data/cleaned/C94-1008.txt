Also drove he nevertheless to Munich Depending on the context,, different word orders are eii, her required or, at the very lcasi,, they are more natural l,han others.
Although in 3 and 4 the context is represented by quest;ions, it is not normally limited to I;hese.
3a, which is i;he most natural answer to 3, is very unnatural, if not ungrammatical, in 4.
Although not all contexts restrict the order of consti/;uents as drastically as 3 and 4, it is a general rule for German an<l similar languages that sentences are more natural if they are properly embedded in their contexts: 3 ~vVen erwartete (lie Frau wit, dew Nudelholz?
Whom wailed-for the woman with the rolliuq pin 3a Die I~au erwartete wit <lem Nudelholz ihren MANN.

The :factors comprise of t:he tendencies to order ele.ments according to the theme-rheme st, ructure and/or I,d the fimctional sentence perspective.
Furthermore, t;hcy concern verb ben<ling, animacy, heaviness, the importarl<:e of semantic roles for phrase ordering, and others.
A disl;inct feature of the ordering r<.'gularil, ies is that none of l, he feel,ors can be formulated as an absolute l,P rule, which makes word order description dimcull; to deal with in NI,P.
In receni; years several propositions were made to deal with this phenomenon in either analysis or general, ion, or both.
3 Recent
Suggestions on Treating Free Phrase Order Uszkoreit (1,087) suggests overcoming t;lle lack of absohg;e, rules by using disjuncl, iorts of I,P rules.
The idea is that if at least one IA ~ rule sanctions a sequence of constituenl;s, the sentence is grammatical.
The mode\[ thus expresses competence, ral;her than performance, as it either accepl.s or rejects a senl, ence, without maldng a judgement on accel%ability differences as in 1.
Anothe.r idea put forward by \]);rbach (1993) accoum;s h)r grades of acceptability.
Erbach assume, s thai; the order of verb complements ideally is according to an obliqueness hierarchy, and thai; each deviation from this of der decreases the acceptability of t.he sentence I:)y a factor of 0.8.
'l'wo divergences result in an a(:(:el)tabilii,y s(:orc of 0.64 (0.8 * 0.8), e(;c.
Problems we see linked to this approach are I, he use of l;hc obliqueness hierarchy, which limits l, he preference mechanism to complements, and the fact, that every diw~'rsion decreases the score invariably, without considering the varying effec(; of differen(, wn'iaI, ions.
A proposal which (;akes into account the different importance, or weight, of preference rules, is presenl;cd in .lacobs (71988).
Jacobs assigns each of his preference rules a specific numerical weight.
If a rule applies in a giwm sentence, its value is added to the acceptability score of the sentCfl(X',, if it i's violated, its value is subtracted.
The higher the final score, I;he more nal, ural, or the ~bettev' tim senl, ence is.
70 Idea.lly, air competing preference; rules are slttisficd.
'l.'hc coinplic;tl, ion we see wi(,h (;his al>proach is t, tl~U; some stricLly or(ic;red sequ(;llces inter\[ere wil, h the calculation of accc~ptal)ility.
Some of thorn concern the ordoring of (xmers (AbtSmmgspar(,ilwln; Thurma:r 1989) and other modifier subgroups (Stcinl:)ergc,r \] 99,t).
Some o:f (;ho criticism could be overcome by changing l;I'le different propositions slightly.
l%r instoan(:e, Erbach's (19.<)3) sugg(:si;ion to add prc'h:rence to fc;aturc'.-bascd h>ru:alisms could be combined with \[Jszl(orcit's prcfere)lc(: rules.

Nearly any element can take the one position preceding the verb in V'2,,-ailed the.
Vo~J'd~t ("p,'e-(verbal)field').
Normally a thematic element is placed into the Vorfeld.
According to IIoberg's (1.981) analysis of the Mannheimer l)'uden Korpus, in 63% of al\[ V2 sentences the nominative complement (sub jet6) takes this place.
A convenient way of seeing it is that all elements fol|ow the.
verb in V2 position according to tile CF, and that one (thematic) element is moved int;o the Vorfeld position.
We suggest that if the analysis of the source language fails to recognise the theme of the sentence, the subject takes this place.
In our model, most elements can cith(,r I)e thematic, rhematic, or neutral (i.e.
unnmrked with respect to theme and theme).
Sent(?nce variations as different as shown in the examples 5a to 5d can be generated using tim canonical form presented above, depending on t;he parameterisation of the features theme, rheme and focus for the different constituents.
The order of elements in 5a corresponds to the defaull, order.
Itowever, the same order would be general;ed if the personal pronoun was marked as being thematic, and/or if the adverb gest.ern was rhematic.
We put the information -t-theme in 5a to 5e in brackets to indicate that this feaLm'e is not a requirement to generate I,he respect;ire word orders.
The relaJ;ive order el' the adverb and the accusative NP in 51) difhn's fi'om the one in 5a, becaus(" I, he object den Mann is rhematic.
In 5c and 5(I, 9estcr'n and den Mam~ arc thematic, respectively, in ad-dition t;o this, the persorm.l pronoun in 5(l is marked as being stressed contrastiw'.ly.
We used eapii;al letters 1,o express the obligatory h~cus, ll; is easy to think of more phrase order' combinations caused by further parameterisalions.

The ma'll, have yesterday I seem Modi tiers shou l<l 1)e classified according to ltoberg's (71981) d4 modifier position classes, which partly coincide with the common semant, ic classi\[ications, and partly not.
Ilobcrg's modifier indexes are l;he r(.'sult of the stal;istical veril~cai,ion of lintel s intuitive classes (1970).
As modifiers do not alw~ys follow in l, he same order, ltoberg chose a classl fication which lead to least deviations between her cla.ssiflcation 72 and i;he order in the corpus used (Mannheimer Duden Korpus).
The following sentet~ces exemplify the order of Lhe CI ~ for modifiers: 6a~ Ich babe deshalb.,2 gestern.,a mit Wolf.v2 fin'nge.sehen.
I have therefore yester'day wilh Wolf watched-to 6b lch habe deshalb.22 ntit ~,~701f4.2 gest.ernu~+,.h~,,,e fern gesehen.

A basic fa(:l; l, hat can be used h)r the m~tomlttie recognition of these cal, egories is i;lt~L not only the conl, ext determines the orde.ring of constituents in m~ eml)edded seng(.'nc(', but; also ~ given se.ntence carries inforrn;tl,ion on Clte contexL to which it 1)elongs.

Our approach differs from tllkii~:ovA et a.l.'s, howe.ver, in theft we prohibit some ele.ments from 1)eing rho.m~tie.
In Germ~m, 1;hese inhere.rH, ly nou-rhemi~t,ic eleme.rM;s include personM pronouns, as we'll as a limited set of too(lifters such as 'wohl in 12.

Not('. I;h~l;' if inherently nonr\]lem&tic elemenLs occur seml;e~n(:e-ihmlly, it, is Z3 likely that either the verb in V2 position, or the Vorfeld element, carry heavy stress (12a vs.
12b). 12a Er LAS+/o~,,~ den Artikel iiber Worl.stelhmg (lann wohl-rheme â¢ He read the article on word-order then presumably 12t} ??
Er las den ArTlkel iiber Wortsl, elhmg (hmn wohl-,.heme â¢ Haji(:ov~ et el.
(1993) suggest that verbs are generally marked as rhemes, except if they have very general lexical meaning (su(:h as be, have, happen, carT'y oul, become).
As our main concern is word order, and German verb pie:(> ment is restricted by rules which do not allow variation, our algorithm does not allow the recognition of verbs as rhemes.
In 12, no constituent wou\[d be recognised as being thematic.
Not all languages express theme, rheme and focus as distinctly by word order variation as German does.
Either they rely on 1;he context to find out which constituents (have to) carry stress, or they use other \]Tleans such as clefting, pseudo-clefting, topicatisation, dislocat;ion, voice, impersonal construc{.ions, partMes, and morphological as well as lexical means (Foley/Van Valin 1988).
However, even in English, which is often r(.'h;rr(,(l to as a, fixed wor(\[ order language, irlforma,io,i on theme anl rheme can be extracted automatically (HajiaovÂ£ el;.
al. \]993; .qt(;i,~l)('rg.'r 1992a).
To which (tegr'c this information is conveyed in other languages, and 1\]y which means, must be subject to a language pairspecific investigation.
The extraction of information on theme, rheme an(t focus is more important when translating from one \[rce phrase order la.nguage int, o another, than when translating into a fixed-word order language.
}lowever, there are independent reasons for recognislng the sentence focus, namely the.
correb> {ion between stress on the one hand, and scope of negation (Payne 1985) and of degree moditiers (Steinberger 1992\[)) on the other.
7 Ambiguity
Resolution Findings on natural, less natural an(1 ungrammatical word order w~riations can also be used to iruprove sentence analysis with respect go some cases of ambiguity resolution.
In the case of Tl3, chef' can l)e recognised as denoting earlier (e.her2(;), as the homonymous adverb (ehers, "ra~her") must not \[)e negated.
Furflmrmore., some cases of unlikely PP attachment can he nearly excluded.
In ld, the I}P expressing local;ion (vor der \]lank) is unlikely to be a sentence modifier, as this would result in (:onrestive focussing of the personal pronoun ihn.
This can be seen in 15, where the PP car\]not 1)e an ad,iunct l,o the preceding NP, b(,(:mlse the Nil ) is realised as a pronoun.
The PP in 14 is thus more likely to be an adjunct to {,he nomi n al;i ve N P (ler M ann (TI 4 a) t h an a senten(:e modifier (1,tb).
The genera.l principle is that focussing constru(;t;ions a.re relatively unlil(ely to occur ill written text, and therefore one should avoid the an~dysis involving focus when another analysis is possible.
This is the case when the analysis of the PP as an adjunct results in a sentence without toni, restive stress.

The fact; thi~t most;, hut not all, constituent orders are possible, an(1 that some 74 orders are more n,~tura\[ than others poses a considerable problem for NI,P.
In this paper, we presented a method t,o deal with these problems from the analysis and l;he generation point of view.
Concerning analysis, the znMn idc~ is (.hat single sentences reflect the theme-rheme structure irnpos(,d l)y the context, so that thematic, rhcmatic and (contrastivcly) focussed constituents can often I)e recognised, in generation, wc can convey gills knowledge, by diN'.ring word order depending on the context.
This is achieved by using a c~monical form which includes l;he flea:ible cal,cgories l heine, theme and conZraslive focus.
A major a(twmtage ()vet: methods suggested in the past is that ~cceptz~bilit, y differences between sentences can be dealt with, and thai: even modifier sequences, which are traditionally left ou(; in word order descripLion, can be handled.
Wrong const,il;uent; or(lets are avoided, because the order of t,h<' major part; of the sentence is fiÃed, and only sir@c' constituents move to the theme and theme positions.
'Fhc difficulty arising from the unclear l)orderline between free and fixed phrase order, which is typical of most free phrase order htngua.qes, is dealt with successfully.
