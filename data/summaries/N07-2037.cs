Despite several new studies (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2004; Schwenk et al., 2006), language modeling for SMT has not been receiving much attention.

First, on a heldout development data all feature weights including the language model weight are optimized to maximize the BLEU score using the downhill simplex method (Och and Hey, 2002).
P02-1038
We measure translation performance by the BLEU score (Papineni et al, 2002) with one reference for each hypothesis.
P02-1040
By combining word alignments in two directions using heuristics (Och and Ney, 2003), a single set of static word alignments was then formed.

More recently, there is a significant effort focusing on integrating richer knowledge, such as syntactic parse trees (Huang and Knight, 2006) within the translation process to overcome the limitations of the phrase based models.
