First, it is amenable to the Inside-Outside re-estimation algorithm (the equations calculating the inside and outside probabilities for PLTIGs can be found in Hwa (1998b)).
P98-1091
In their study of parsing the WSJ, Schabes et al.(1993) have shown that a grammar trained on the InsideOutside re-estimation algorithm can perform quite well on short simple sentences but falters as the sentence length increases.

The inferred grammars are represented in the Probabilistic Lexicalized Tree Insertion Grammar (PLTIG) formalism (Schabes and Waters, 1993; Hwa, 1998a), which is lexicalized and context-free equivalent.

The study is conducted on both a simple Air Travel Information System (ATIS) corpus (Hemphill et al., 1990) and the more complex Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).
H90-1021 J93-2004
For even a moderately complex domain such as the ATIS corpus, a grammar trained on data with constituent bracketing information produces much better parses than one trained on completely unmarked raw data (Pereira and Schabes, 1992).

Strategies To induce a grammar from the sparsely bracketed training data previously described, we use a variant of the Inside-Outside re-estimation algorithm proposed by Pereira and Schabes (1992).
