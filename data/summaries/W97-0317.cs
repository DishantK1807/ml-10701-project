3 Back-off Estimation The PP attachment model presented by Collins and Brooks (1995) determines the most likely attachment for a particular prepositional phrase by estimating the probability of the attachment.

The same conclusion is reached by Brill and Resnik (1994).
C94-2195
In the case Of prepositional phrases, the expansion of the number of possible analysis is the Catalan number series, thus the number of possible analyses grows with a function that is exponential in the number of Prepositional Phrase (Church and Patil, 1982).

In one of the earliest attempts to resolve the problem of PP attachment ambiguity using lexical measures, Hindle and Pmoth (1993) show that a measure of mutual information limited to lexical association can correctly resolve 80% of the cases of PP attachment ambiguity, confirming the initial hypothesis that lexical information, in particular co-occurrence frequency, is central in determining the choice of attachment.

Collins and Brooks (1995) propose a 4-gram model for PP disambiguation which exploits backed-off estimation to smooth null events (see next section).

Generalized Backed-Off Algorithm The algorithm for attaching the first preposition is almost identical to that of Collins and Brooks (1995), and we follow them in including only tuples which contain the preposition.

Magerman and Marcus (1991) report 54/55 correct PP attachments for Pearl, a probabilistic chart parser, with Earley style prediction, that integrates lexical co-occurrence knowledge into a probabilistic context-free grammar.

As shown by many psycholinguistic and practical 149 studies (Ford et al., 1982; Taraban and McClelland, 1988; Whittemore et al., 1990), lexical information is one of the main cues to PP attachment disambiguation.

Historically, the shift from attempts to resolve the problem completely, by using heuristics developed using typical AI techniques (Jensen and Binot, 1987; Marcus, 1980; Crain and Steedman, 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988) has left the place for attempts to solve the problem by less expensive means, even if only approximately.
