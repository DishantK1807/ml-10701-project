Recent language models (Heeman and Allen, 1997), (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996), (Siu and Ostendorf, 1996) take into account the fact that word cooccurrences may be disrupted by editing terms 1 and speech repairs (take the tanker I mean the boxcar).
P97-1033
(Hindle, 1983) states that repairs are available for semantic analysis but provides no details on the representation to be used.
P83-1019
The repair metarule, when given the hypothetical start and end of a reparandum (say from a language model such as (Heeman and Allen, 1997)), extends copies of phrase hypotheses over the reparandum allowing the corrected utterance to be formed.
P97-1033
As a preliminary test of this assumption, we used an older version of Heeman's language model (the current version is described in (Heeman and Allen, 1997)) and connected it to the current dialog parser.
P97-1033
This approach is similar to an experiment in (Bear et al., 1992) except that Bear et al.were more interested in reducing false alarms.
P92-1008
(Hindle, 1983) and (Bear et al., 1992) performed speech repair identification in their parsers, and removed the corrected material (reparandum) from consideration.
