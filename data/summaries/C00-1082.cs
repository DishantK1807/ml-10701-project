a.2 Maximum-entropy method The maximum-entropy method is useful with sparse data conditions and has been used by many researchers (Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Borthwick el; al., 1998; Uchimoto et al., 1999).

To determine the priority order of the rules, we referred to Yarowsky's method (Yarowsky, 1994) and Nishiokwama's method (Nishiokaymna et al., 1998) and used the probability a.nd frequency of each rule as measures of this priority order.
