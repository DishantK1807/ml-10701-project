at Abstract We describe the development of a generator for (\]erman built by reusing and adapting existing linguistic data and software.
Reusability is crucial for the successful application of N I,P techniques to real-life problems since it helps to cut down on both development and adaptation effort.
Itowever, combining resources not designed to work together is not trivial.
We describe the problems arising when integrating three preexisting resources (FUF, a unificationbased generator, an HPS(~ (\]ramrnm' for (~errnan, and X2MorF, 7~ two-level morphology (;omponent) and the adaptat, ions necessary to come up with a wide coverage l;acticM generator for (\]erlnnn.
1 Introduction
A main obstacle for the successfifl application of N I,P is the necessary effort in terms of deve|opinent and adaptation time.
One possible answer to this problem is the use of generic and modula.r software.
An example fbr a software system develot)e.d with this goal in mind is the FUF generator (l~lhadnd, 1991), a well-documented public domain software written in IASI: ).
Still, it is no straightforward task to employ that, kind of software for new applications.
Another important step is the declarative definition of linguistic data (grammar and lexicon) which also fa(:ilit~tes reuse in another setting.
The reuse of existing resources does not only save efforts but, to a hopeflflly much minor extent, also creates new tasks to be solved, i.e. the integration of resources not having been *The work reported here h,~s been carried out within tit('.

l"inan(tim support for the Austrian Research Institute for ArtiticiM \[ntelligence is provided by the Austrian 13undesministerium fiir Wisscnschaft, Forschung und Kunst.
designed to work together, llow this can be done in an organized way is the topic of this paper.
The work being described here was done in t, he context of a multilinguM text generation system.
One Of the ohjectives of the project is to rouse ex-isting resources for those subtasks for which at> propriate resources exist, l,'or the German tactical generator 1 an irnph;mentation of an HPS(, '~ style gramrm~r of (\]erman (used for parsing and genre> ation, but on a different software platform) was available inhouse.
~l)he I"UI ? generator was chosen as the core component of t.he system.
However, two problems had to be solved before FUI" could be used for the planned purpose.
One was the Net that li'UF, dew, loped for English, has no suitM)le morphologicM conlponent for the rich inflection of German.
X2MorF (Trost, 1991), an avMlahle morphologicM component had go be iH tegrated with the FUI e generator for this purpose.
The other probh;m was that the existing HPS(L inspired gramrna.r of German could not be directly ported to the FUF formMisln.
Before we describe the integration task we will briefly sketch the mMn characteristics of these resources, emphasizing those aspects which either cause problems lbr integration or provide the means for perfi)rrning the integration task.

Resources 2,1 The FUF Generator li'UF (Elhadad, 1991) is a surface generator for naturM language based on the theory of flmctional unification grammar (Kay, 1979).
It employs both phrase structure rules and unification of feature descriptions.
Input to I"U F is a partially speciiied feature description which constrains the utterance to be generated.
Output is a flflly specified feature description subsumed by the input struel,ure, which is then linearized to yiehl a sentence.
1 Tit(: task of a tactical generator is to produce sententbd or subsentential phrases corresponding to a semantic input specitication and does not include text planning.

2.3 X2MorF
X2MorF (TrosC, 1991) is a morphoh)gical (-<tinI)<ment bas<;d on two level morphok)gy (Koskenniemi, 1983).
In l;wo-level m<)rphoh)gy mor 1)hol)honology is treated by means of rules (,hal, 753 "\['I\]()N SYNSEMILOC " geht" \[VFORM finit \]TENSE present IEAD \[PERS 3rd verb LNUM sg 2AT \[ F F \[CASE not,,.\] // /cxr/IIF'AD /PERS,'era / \] / ........

In Fig.
2 the htPS(\] representation of the German verb gem (walks) and it,s representation in t?UF is shown, exemplifying the following mappings of HPS(\] onto FUF: • The subtyl)ing of the IIEAI) iS represented I)y the cat feature of FUF.
• SYNSEM),OCICA'rlHEAD is mapped to head.
• SYNSEM\]LOCleONTbm, is mapped to concept.
• Instead of subcategorizing for synsem wdues a.s proposed in Pollard and Sag (1994) the convention of Pollard and Sag (1987) to subcategorize for signs is adopted.
• Instead of a list-valued SUBCAT feature the feature args is used.
The correspondence between (syntactic) arguments anti semantic roles is established by placing the constituent under a feature corresponding to its semantic role.
Thus list manipulation is avoided and the structure corresponds more closely to the input specification (given in a language based on SPL (Kasper, 1989)).
• The NONLocal feature is dropped.
Slash extraction is handled differently.
It should be noted that this entry does not col'respond exactly to the actual representation in the generator, it serves simply to illustrate the basic ideas underlying the transformation.
The actual implementation additionally allows for • the specification of arguments via external macros, accounting for a more principled treatment of case assignment, argument reduction and slash extraction; • a ditferentiation between lexemes and stems to account for a treatment of inflection by the morphology component.
The representation of phrasal signs in IIPSG parallels the one of lexical signs; an additional feature DTR, S carries the subconstituents o\[" the phrase.
One of the daughters is the head of the phrase (IIEAD-DTIt), its head features are identical to the head features of the phrase (llead Feature Principle).
The other daughter may be either a cornmap between the lexieal representation of a word arm its surface fl)rm.
Morphology proper on the other hand is viewed as a sirnpte concatenation process governed by a regular grammar.
X2MorF augmertts standard two-lewJ morphology in two ways.
First, it replaces the contimmtion class mechanism with a featurebased word grammar and lexicon.
This is an important prerequisite for its use in a \[hature-based sentence-level processing system (see Trost and Matiasek (1994)).
Second, it allows for interaction between two-level rules and word grammar facilitating the formulation of rules for non-concatenative morphol.actics like umlaut.
3 The
Integration Task Although the main components to be integrated fulfill reusability requirements (FU F being a fairly general and modular generation engine, the HPSG grammar being a declaratively written resource), integration of these resources into a unified system couhl only be achieved after suitable adaptation.
The morphological component of FUF is very restricted.
Thus it needed to be replaced by X2MorF.
The available German word level grammar of X2MorF was rewritten to conform to the feature structure notation employed by FUF.
The two-hwel part stayed unchanged.
More substan|ial changes were required to adapt the HPSG granLmar.
Not only syntactic adaptations to another feature formalism were needed, but also the olmrational characteristics of' FUF had to be accounted for.
Also some of the phrase structure information generalized in the form of principles could be "compiled" into phrase structure rules.
3.1 HPSG
in FUF First experiments to implement ItPSG in FUF rather directly showed inetficient runtime behavior.
Since most grammatical constraints in IIPSG are expressed via structure sharing, and FUF uses pointers to indicate coreferences, most of the processing time was spent in following pointer chains through deeply nested feature structures.
Thus the structures have considerably been fiattened and some aspects (most notably SUBCAT and CONTent) have beet, encoded differently.

Each argument must be checked during generation if it is unifiable with the slash specification, and, if so, it has to be made coref erential with slash.
Otherwise, an appropriate pattern feature has to be produced to ensure the realization of the argument at the args level.
3.1.5 V2
and a Generation Example (\]erman is commonly regarded as an SOV language.
However, the standard word order a sentence final verbal complex with the finite verb as the last dement is encountered only in subordinate clauses.
In declarative sentences and whquestions the finite element of the verbal complex occupies the second position in the sentence.
Sentence initial position of the finite verb is encountered in imperative clauses and yes-no questions.
In our grammar, the verbal complex is always generated in the standard order.
To account for VI and V2 phenomena, a mechanism resembling the GB notion of head movement is imple((cat s) (s-type declarative) (head-dtr((cat vk) (head ((vform fin))) (head-slash ((cat lex-verb))))) (v2 {^ head-dtr head-slash}) (subj ((head ((case hem) (num {^ ^ ^ head hum}) (pers {^ ^ ^ head pers}))))i (args ((subj {^ subj}))) ;; force extraction of one constituent (alt (((focus GIVEg) (focus {^ args slash})) ((focus {subj}) (subj {^ args slash})))) (cset (head-dtr)) (pattern (focus v2 args head-dtr))) Figure 8: Declarative Main Clause in FUF mented.
This mechanism flmctions analogously to the slash mechanism presented above.
If a feature head-slash is passed to the verbal temple:, the finite verb is extracted, allowing the governing phrase to realize it in first or second position.
The morphology component ensures that separable prefixes are left, in place.
The vert)al complex is generated top down.
'l'he arguments of the main verb are generated lexicon driven, once the lexical head of the phrase has been established.
Subject-verb agreement and nominative case assignment is handled via the subj slot which is coreferential with args: subj and after argument generation -contains the subject of the sentence (of.
Fig. 6).
Verb second position (:an only be ensltred, if the constituent in sentence initial l)osition is nonempty.
The slot focus is designed to hold that constituent.
The constituent to be topicalized or, if not specified in the input, the subj is extracte<t via the slash mechanism (cf.
Fig. 7).
The interaction between top down category driven and "bottom up" lexicon driven processing is illustrated in Fig.
9, showing also the effects of the two slash extraction mechanisms.

4 Conclusion
Wc have shown how existing resources can be adapted to new applications therel)y saving eon-siderably on develol>ment efforts.
We have demonsl.ral, ed integration tasks on two different levels: * integration of software sys/,elns: by c()mt)itJing FUF with X2Morl,' we have extended tin2 flmctionality of FUF.
While the original roof t)hoh/gy component of FUF ix geared towards F, nglish ordy, X2MorF can be used with a wide range of languages.
• Adaptation of linguistic resources to processing requirements: by adapting our existing Ill)S(\] grammar for (~mman to Fur we have shown t.hat a de<'laratively writ;ten linguistic l'eSO/ll;('(~ can I>e used in a new l>rocessing en vironnmnt with modest effort..
'l'his is an inq)orLant, st, e l) in bringing natalra\] language processing techniques closer to real-world al>plications, where the minimizing of adaptal, ion <:<>el; and the maximal use of existing resources is crucial for success.
