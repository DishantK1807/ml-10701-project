However, few papers in the field of computational linguistics have focused on this approach (Dagan and Engelson, 1995; Thompson et al., 1999; Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000; Hwa, 2000; Banko and Brill, 2001).

SVMs have been recently applied to several natural language tasks, including text classification (Joachims, 1998; Dumais et al., 1998), chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000b; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), and dependency analysis (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a).

In order to overcome this, some unsupervised learning methods and minimally-supervised methods, e.g., (Yarowsky, 1995; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), have been proposed.
