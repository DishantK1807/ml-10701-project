1. A discourse parser, such as those described by Sumita et al.(1992), Kurohashi (1994), and MarcH (1999), initially derives the discourse structure of the text given as input.

The texts were selected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994).

We computed the reliability of the annotation using Marcu et al.(1999)'s method for computing kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) over hierarchical structures.

For our corpus, in order to enable a discoursebased transfer module to derive any English discourse tree starting from any Japanese discourse tree, it is sufficient to implement: * one SHIFT operation; • 3 x 2 × 85 REDUCE operations; (For each of the three possible pairs of nuclearity assignments NUCLEUS-SATELLITE (NS), SATELLITE-NUCLEUS (SN), AND NUCLEUSNUCLEUS (NN), there are two possible ways to reduce two adjacent trees (one results in a binary tree, the other in a non-binary tree (Marcu, 1999)), and 85 relation names).
P99-1047 W99-0307
We developed a discourse annotation protocol for Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al.(1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts in the corpus.

In order to solve the problem in definition 3.1, we extend the shift-reduce parsing paradigm applied by Magerman (1995), Hermjakob and Mooney (1997), and MarcH (1999).

Yet, even between languages as close as English and French, there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences -what is said in two sentences in one language is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale and Church, 1993).
