Such analyses have been laid out elsewhere (Kataja and Koskenniemi, 1988; Beesley, 1998a; Beesley, 1998b) and cannot be repeated here.

The TWOLC rule (Karttunen and Beesley, 1992) that maps an X, coming either fl'om roots like tmX or from patterns like Form IX CCaCaX.

Kay's (1987) pattern notation uses a G symbol before the C slot that needs to be doubled.
E87-1002
McCarthy (1981) and others (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994; Bird and Blackburn, 1991) postulate an underlying Form IX stem for dhm that looks like dhamam, with a spreading of the final m radical; other writers like Beeston (1968) list the stem as dhamm, with a geminated or lengthened final radical.

Status The current morphological analyzer is based on dictionaries and rules licensed from an earlier project at ALPNET (Beesley, 1990), rebuilt completely using Xerox finite-state technology (Beesley, 1996; Beesley, 1998a).
C96-1017
as Intersection Finite-state morphology is based on the claim that both morphotactics and phonological/orthographical variation rules, i.e. the relation of underlying forms to surface forms, can be formalized using finite-state automata (Kaplan and Kay, 1981; Karttunen, 1991; Kaplan and Kay, 1994).
