In order to test whether good translations can be generated with rules learned by Galley et al.(2004), we created DerivTool as an environment for interactively using these rules as a decoder would.

Galley et al.(2004) describe how to learn hundreds of millions of treetransformation rules from a parsed, aligned Chinese/English corpus, and Galley et al.(submitted) describe probability estimators for those rules.

How does our framework compare to existing state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT systems such as Och and Ney (2004)?

For example, the syntactic system described in Yamada and Knight (2001) cannot translate n-to-m-word phrases and does not allow for multi-level syntactic transformations; both phenomena are frequently observed in real data.

It follows the decoding-as-parsing idea exemplified by Wu (1996) and Yamada and Knight (2002).
P02-1039 P96-1021
This phrase grid contains both phrases learned in our extracted rules (e.g., “the police” from earlier) and phrases learned by the phrasebased translation system (Och and Ney, 2004)1.
