Lastly, and most importantly, all of the reviewed techniques (Wicentowski, 2004; Wicentowski, 2002; Snover et al., 2002; Baroni et al., 2002; Andreev, 1965; ´Cavar et al., 2004; Snover and Brent, 2003; Snover and Brent, 2001; Snover, 2002; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Jacquemin, 1997; Goldsmith and Hu, 2004; Sharmaetal., 2002; Clark, 2001; KazakovandManandhar, 1998; D´ejean, 1998; Oliver, 2004; Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2003; Creutz and Lagus, 2004; Hirsim¨aki et al., 2003; Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Argamon et al., 2004; Gaussier, 1999; Lehmann, 1973; Langer, 1991; Flenner, 1995; Klenk and Langer, 1989; Goldsmith, 2001; Goldsmith, 2000; Hu et al., 2005b; Hu et al., 2005a; Brent et al., 1995), as they are described, have threshold-parameters of some sort, explicitly claim not to work well for an open set of languages, or require noise-free all-form input (Albright, 2002; Manning, 1998; Borin, 1991).

First, as e.g already Manning (1998) notes for sandhi phenomena, it is far from clear what the gold standard should be (even though we may agree or agree to disagree on some familiar European languages).

A different approach, sometimes used in complement of other sources of information, is to select aligned pairs (or sets) of strings that share a long character sequence (work includes (Jacquemin, 1997; Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000; Baroni et al., 2002; Clark, 2001)).

A slightly better method is to compile a set of words into a trie and predict boundaries at nodes with high actitivity (e.g (Johnson and Martin, 2003; Schone and Jurafsky, 2001; Kazakov and Manandhar, 2001) and earlier papers by the same authors), but this not sound either as non-morphemic short common character sequences also show significant branching.

In the absense of fully annotated annotated test sets for diverse languages, and since the author does not have access to the Hutmegs/CELEX gold standard sets for Finnish and English (Creutz and Lind´en, 2004), we can only give some guidelining experimental data.

Many publications (´Cavar et al., 2004; Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith et al., 2001; D´ejean, 1998; Snover et al., 2002; Argamon et al., 2004; Goldsmith, 2001; Creutz and Lagus, 2005; Neuvel and Fulop, 2002; Baroni, 2003; Gaussier, 1999; Sharma et al., 2002; Wicentowski, 2002; Oliver, 2004), and various other works by the same authors, describe strategies that use frequencies, probabilities, and optimization criteria, often Minimum Description Length (MDL), in various combinations.
