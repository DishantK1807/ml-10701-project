Intra-annotator agreement We measured pairwise agreement among annotators usingthekappacoefficient(K)whichiswidelyused in computational linguistics for measuring agreement in category judgments (Carletta, 1996).

However, the most important theoretical foundations in quantitative methods are related to strong probabilistic frameworks including Hidden Markov Models (Mulbregt et al., 1998) and Maximal Entropy Theory (Beeferman et al., 1997).

Similarly, in the literature on discourse segmentation and labeling, a variety of different agreement measures have been used, including precision and recall (Hearst 1997; Passonneau and Litman 1997), Krippendorff's (1980) (Passonneau and Litman 1997) and Cohen's (1960) (Carletta et al.1997). In this work, we use the two following metrics: (1) the -statistic in its extension for more than two coders (Davies and Fleiss 1982); and (2) precision, recall, and F1 -score.9 We will discuss the -statistic first.

Obtained percent agreement of 0.988 and  coefficient (Carletta, 1996) of 0.975 suggest high convergence of both annotations.

Two classes of such solution described in existing work are solutions using lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991; MinYen Kan, 1998) (which require to use some thesaurus) and based on spreading activation (Kozima, 1993) (which depend on weights-based semantic network constructed from thesaurus).

For these classications, we calculated a kappa statistic of 0.528 (Carletta, 1996).

metrics A number of different measurement methods were applied to topical texts segmentation including recall-precision pair (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, 1997), edit distance (Ponte and Croft, 1997), P (Beeferman et al., 1997), Pk (Beeferman et al., 1999) and WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002).

The methods in this group use probabilistic frameworks including maximal entropy (Beeferman et al., 1997), Hidden Markov Models (Mulbregt et al., 1998) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Blei and Moreno, 2001).

on measures for inter-rater reliability (Carletta, 1996), on frameworks for evaluating spoken dialogue agents (Walker et al., 1998) and on the use of different corpora in the development of a particular system (The Carnegie-Mellon Communicator, Eskenazi et al.(1999)). The question we are addressing in this paper is how to collect and analyse relevant corpora.

Improved version of DotPlotting algorithm called C99 (Choi, 2000) uses DotPlotting chart for visualization of similarity measurements at consecutive point of the text (thus resulting in point with different levels of intensity) instead of words cooccurences.
