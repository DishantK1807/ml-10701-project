Luk (1995) experiments with the same words we use except the word bank and reports that there are totally 616 instances of these words in the Brown corpus, (slightly less than the 749 instances we have experimented on).
P95-1025
Evidence have shown that by exploiting the constraint of so-called "one sense per discourse," (Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992b) and the strategy of bootstrapping (Yarowsky 1995), it is possible to boost coverage, while maintaining about the same level of precision.
H92-1045 P95-1026
Brown, et al.(1991) describe a statistical algorithm for partitioning word senses into two groups.
P91-1034
Conceptual Knowledge from MRD In this section we apply a so-called TopSense algorithm (Chen and Chang 1998) to acquire CR for MRD senses.
J98-1003
Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992a) experiment on acquiring topical context from substantial bilingual training corpus and report good results.
H92-1045
The adaptive approach is somehow similar to their idea of incremental learning and to the bootstrap approach proposed by Yarowsky (1995).
P95-1026
Dagan and Itai (1994) indicate that two languages are more informative than one; an English corpus is very helpful in disambiguating polysemous words in Hebrew text.
J94-4003
Gale, et al.(1992a) report that if one had obtained a set of training materials with errors no more than twenty to thirty percent, one could iterate training materials selection just once or twice and have training sets that had less than ten percent errors.
H92-1045
A concept-based model for WSD requires less parameter and has an element of generality built in (Liddy and Paik 1993).
