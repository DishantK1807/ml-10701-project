Vilain and Day (2000) approached the shared task in three different ways.

and Evaluation For the CoNLL shared task, we have chosen to work with the same sections of the Penn Treebank as the widely used data set for base noun phrase recognition (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995): WSJ sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank as training material and section 20 as test material 3.

Osborne (2000) trained Ratnaparkhi's maximum-entropy POS tagger to output chunk tags.
W00-0731
We have chosen to work with a corpus with parse information, the Wall Street Journal WSJ part of the Penn Treebank II corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), and to extract chunk information from the parse trees in this corpus.

Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) approached chunking by using a machine learning method.
W95-0107
Johansson (2000) uses context-sensitive and contextfree rules for transforming part-of-speech (POS) tag sequences to chunk tag sequences.
W00-0728
Our NP chunks are very similar to the ones of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995).
W95-0107
In contrast to Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), predicative adjectives of the verb are not part of the VP chunk, e.g. in "\[NP they \] \[vP are \] \[ADJP unhappy \]'.
W95-0107
B-X I-X 0 first word of a chunk of type X non-initial word in an X chunk word outside of any chunk This representation type is based on a representation proposed by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) for noun phrase chunks.

Tjong Kim Sang (2000) trained and tested five memory-based learning systems to produce different representations of the chunk tags.
W00-0733
Zhou, Tey and Su (2000) implemented a chunk tagger based on HMMs.
W00-0737
By then, Church (1988) had already reported on recognition of base noun phrases with statistical methods.
A88-1019
As Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) already noted: "While this automatic derivation process introduced a small percentage of errors on its own, it was the only practical way both to provide the amount of training data required and to allow for fully-automatic testing".
W95-0107
Kudoh and Matsumoto (2000) created 231 support vector machine classifiers to predict the unique pairs of chunk tags.
W00-0730
Veenstra and Van den Bosch (2000) examined different parameter settings of a memory-based learning algorithm.
W00-0735
Pla, Molina and Prieto (2000) use a finite-state version of Markov Models.
W00-0732
There has been a large interest in recognizing non-overlapping noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) and follow-up papers) but relatively little has been written about identifying phrases of other syntactic categories.

The most complete work is Buchholz et al.(1999), which presents results for NP, VP, PP, ADJP and ADVP chunks.
W99-0629
Koeling (2000) used a standard maximum-entropy learner for generating chunk tags from words and POS tags.
