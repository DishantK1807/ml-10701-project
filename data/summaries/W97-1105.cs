2 Additionally, it has been shown how a computational inheritance model can be used for structuring lexical information relevant for phonology (Reinhard & Gibbon, 1991).

One possibility is the notation of autosegmental phonology, which can be compiled into finite-state automata (Bird & Ellison, 1994).

And there is a body of work on the use of finite state devices closely related to regular expressions for modelling phonological phenomena (Kaplan & Kay, 1994) and for speech processing (cf.
