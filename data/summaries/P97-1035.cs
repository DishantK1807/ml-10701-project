Preliminary studies indicate that reliability for human tagging is higher for AVM attribute tagging than for other types of discourse segment tagging (Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).

Then using the performance equation above, predicted performance for RA is: Performance(Ra) = .40 • .71 -.78 • .72 = --0.28 For Agent B, using the appropriate subpart of Table 4 to calculate ~, assuming that the average number of depart-city repair utterances is 1.38, and using similar 12This assumption has a sound basis in theories of dialogue structure (Carberry, 1989; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1990), but should be tested empirically.

User satisfaction ratings (Kamm, 1995; Shriberg, Wade, and Price, 1992; Polifroni et al., 1992) have been frequently used in the literature as an external indicator of the usability of a dialogue agent.

Assessment (A)--establish the current behavior • Diagnosis (D)---establish the cause for the errant behavior • Repair (R)---establish that the correction for the errant behavior has been made • Test (T)---establish that the behavior is now correct Our informational analysis of this task results in the AVM shown in Table 7.

A wide range of cost measures have been used in previous work; these include pure efficiency measures such as the number of turns or elapsed time to complete the task (Abella, Brown, and Buntschuh, 1996; Hirschman et al., 1990; Smith and Gordon, 1997; Walker, 1996), as well as measures of qualitative phenomena such as inappropriate or repair utterances (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hirschman and Pao, 1993; Simpson and Fraser, 1993).

Since the structure of a dialogue reflects the structure of the task (Carberry, 1989; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1990), the tagging of a dialogue by the AVM attributes can be used to generate a hierarchical discourse structure such as that shown in Figure 4 for Dialogue 1 (Figure 2).

One widely used approach to evaluation is based on the notion of a reference answer (Hirschman et al., 1990).

In addition, while there are many proposals in the literature for algorithms for dialogue strategies that are cooperative, collaborative or helpful to the user (Webber and Joshi, 1982; Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber, 1982; Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel, 1984; Chu-Carrol and Carberry, 1995), very few of these strategies have been evaluated as to whether they improve any measurable aspect of a dialogue interaction.

The value of RT in the AVM instantiation for the dialogue would be "reserve" Second, consider the very different domain and task of diagnosing a fault and repairing a circuit (Smith and Gordon, 1997).

n is superior to other measures of success such as transaction success (Danieli and Gerbino, 1995), concept accuracy (Simpson and Fraser, 1993), and percent agreement (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992) because n takes into account the inherent complexity of the task by correcting for chance expected agreement.
