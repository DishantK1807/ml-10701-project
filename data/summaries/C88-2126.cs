There is a vast literature of these subjects including works by \[Vendler 1967, Mourelatos 1978, Dowty 1986, Hinrichs 1986, Moens et al.1987, Passonneau 1987\] to mention some.

4\[Hobbs 1985\] describes a similar approach by introducing what he calls a "nominalization" operator ' : p ~ p': Corresponding to every n-ary predicate p there will be an (n+ 1)ary predicate p' whose first argument can be thought of as the condition that holds when p is true of the subsequent arguments.

Many representations for events have been proposed to handle similar issues as we describe here \[Davidson 1967, Moore 1981, Neale 1987\].
