Tile idea of using unambiguous sequences is similar to Brill's work on unsupervised learning of disambiguation rules for POS tagging (199517).

We. can also note that the results presented by Ezeiza et al.(1998) for Basque are better titan ours.

Brill (1995a) has presented a transfl)rnmtioi>based lea.rning at)l)roach, whi(:h induces disanlbiguation rules from tagged corpora.

Previous ai)proaches to morphological dismnbiguation of Turkish text; had employed a constraintbased approach (Otlazer and KuruSz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996; Oflazer and Tiir, 1997).

Megyesi (1999) reports a 95.53% accuracy on Hungarian (a language whose features relevant to this task are very close to those of Turkish), with just the POS tags 1)eing correct.

We represent each word as a sequence of inflectional groups (IGs hereafter), separated by "DBs denoting derivation boundaries, as described by Oflazer (1999).
P99-1033
Ezeiza et al.(1998) have combined stochastic and rule-based disambiguation methods for Basque.
P98-1063
This is slightly 1)etter than the precision figures that is reported earlier on morphological disambiguation of Turkish using constraintbased techniques (Oflazer and T/Jr, 1997).

2. An interesting observation that we can make about q_hrkish is that when a word is considere(l as a sequence of IGs, syntactic relations are between the last IG of a (dependent) word and with some (including the last) IG of the (head) word on the right (with nfinor eXCel)tions) (Oflazer, 1999).

The tokens were analyzed using the morphological analyzer, developed by Oflazer (1994).

Megyesi (19991 has adapted Brill's POS tagger with extended lexical templates to Itungartan.
