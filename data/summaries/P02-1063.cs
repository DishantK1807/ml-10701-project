In POS tagging, some studies using the multi-expert method were conducted (van Halteren et al., 2001; M`arquez et al., 1999), and Brill and Wu (1998) combined maximum entropy models, TBL, unigram and trigram, and achieved higher accuracy than any of the four learners (97.2% for WSJ corpus).

Various learning models have been studied such as Hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Rabiner and Juang, 1993), decision trees (Breiman et al., 1984) and maximum entropy models (Berger et al., 1996).
J96-1002
Brill studiedtransformation-basederror-drivenlearning (TBL) (Brill, 1995), which conducts POS tagging by applying the transformation rules to the POS tags of a given sentence, and has a resemblance to revision learning in that the second model revises the output of the first model.

Regarding the multi-stage methods, cascading (Alpaydin and Kaynak, 1998) is well known, and Even-Zohar and Roth (2001) proposed the sequential learning model and applied it to POS tagging.

Most portions of POS tagging is not so difficult and a simple POS-based HMMs learning 1 achieves more than 95% accuracy simply using the POS context (Brants, 2000).

The results are compared with TnT (Brants, 2000) based on second order HMMs, and with POS tagger using SVMs with one-versus-rest (1v-r) (Nakagawa et al., 2001).

SVMs have good generalization performance and can handle a large number of features, and are applied to some tasks ‚ÅÑ Presently with Oki Electric Industry successfully (Joachims, 1998; Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2000).
