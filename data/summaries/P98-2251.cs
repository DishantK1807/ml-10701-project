To offer a more valid comparison between this work and Mikheev's latest work (Mikheev, 1997), the accuracies were tested again, ignoring mistags between NN and NNP (common and proper nouns) as Mikheev did.

Weischedel's group (Weischedel et al., 1993) examines unknown words in the context of part-of-speech tagging.

An example set of tags can be found in the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al., 1993).

Other methods include rule-based systems (Brill, 1995), maximum entropy models (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and memory-based models (Daelemans et al., 1996).

Mikheev (Mikheev, 1996; Mikheev, 1997) uses a general purpose lexicon to learn affix and word ending information to be used in tagging unknown words.
