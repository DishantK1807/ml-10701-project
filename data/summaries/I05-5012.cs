The probability of the dependency-based transition is estimated as follows: a5a7a6a9a8a34a44a39a45a19a46a21a10a32a11a48a12a32a14a40a15a29a17 a11a48a12a19a18a109a108 a5a60a10 a90 a24a57a5a36a110a68a111 a38 a10a32a11 a12a32a14a40a15 a41a34a112a59a24a39a22a2a113a29a114 a55 a22 a49a26a115 a10a32a11 a12 a18a19a18a19a18a21a20 a116a118a117a58a119 a73a7a120a7a73 a45 a37 a44a58a121 a6a9a37a53a122a68a123a53a124a126a125 a12a42a127 a5a59a10 a90 a24a57a5 a110a68a111 a38a128a10a32a11a48a12a32a14a40a15a27a41a34a112a47a18a19a18 where a61a69a92a42a129a130a97a29a61a63a131a58a132a7a133a134a92a34a135a137a136a19a138 a0a59a139a7a140 a107a29a107 is inspired by and closely resembles the probabilistic functions in (Collins, 1996).

We direct the interested reader to our technical paper (Wan et al., 2005) for full details.

As in (Barzilay et al., 1999), we assume that the sentences stem from the sameevent and thus, references can be fused together.
P99-1071
However, long distance relations are fewer in number than adjacent relations, which account for approximately 70% of dependency relations (Collins, 1996).
P96-1025
The precision metric is as follows: precision a20 count a10 matched-verb-relationsa18 count a10 generated-verb-relationsa18 The corresponding recall metric is defined as: recall a20 count a10 matched-verb-relationsa18 count a10 source-text-verb-relationsa18 The data for our evaluation cases is taken from the information fusion data collected by (Barzilay et al., 1999).

This marraige of models has been tested in other fields such as speech recognition (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998) with success.
P98-1035
Summarization researchers have also studied the problem of generating non-verbatim sentences: see (Jing and McKeown, 1999), (Barzilay et al., 1999) and more recently (DaumÂ´e III and Marcu, 2004).

Finally, we would like to compare our system to that described in (Barzilay et al., 1999).
P99-1071
Previous preliminary evaluations (Wan et al., 2005) indicate that the generated sequences contain less fragmented text as measured by an off-the-shelf dependency parser; more fragments would indicate a grammatically problematic sentence.

Work In recent years, there has been a steady stream of research in statistical text generation (see Langkilde and Knight (1998), and Bangalore and Rambow (2000)).

2Paraphrase here includes sentences generated in an Information Fusion task (Barzilay et al., 1999).
