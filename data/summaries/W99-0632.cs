We rely on Gsearch to provide moderately accurate information about verb frames in the same way that Hindle and Rooth (1993) relied on Fidditch to provide moderately accurate information about syntactic structure, and Ratnaparkhi (1998) relied on simple heuristics defined over part-of-speech tags to deliver information nearly as useful as that provided by Fidditch.

We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).

Following Hindle and Rooth (1993) we smooth the observed frequencies in the following way, where f(V,frame) = ~i.f(verbi,frame), f(V) = 270 ~i f (verbi), f (C,frame) : ~i f (classi,ft~me) and f(C) = ~i f(classi).

The acquisition and filtering process is detailed in Lapata (1999).

Techniques for the automatic acquisition of subcategofization dictionaries have been developed by Manning (1993), Bfiscoe and Carroll (1997) and Carroll and Rooth (1998).

Palmer (1999) and Dang et al.(1998) argue that the use of syntactic frames and verb classes can simplify the definition of different verb senses.
