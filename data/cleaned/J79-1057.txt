.The system utilizes a morph lexicon and a vocal tract model.
Although most of the 1i.nguist.i~ analysis is done by decomposing words into their constituent morphemes, such a system 1s not sufficient for unrestricted text.
In order to attain the competence of a comprehensive system, it was necessary to develop a scheme for dealing with unrecognizablq words.
Thfs is called the "letter-to-sound" system.
When a decomposition fails, that is, when a word cannot be decomposed into Its cons-tituent motphs or when it is too infrequent in the English laneuage to be included in the morph lexicon, the "letter-to-sound" system is invoked.
The letter string which it receives is converted into a stressed phoneme gtring using two sets of ordered phonological ruled.
The first set to be applied convects letters to phonemes, first stripping affdxes, then converting consonants and finally converting vowels and affues.
The second set applies an ordered set of rules which determine the stress contour of the phoneme string.
These rules were developed, by a process of extensive statistical analysis of English words.
The form of the rtiles rerlects the fact that pronunciation of vowels and vowel digraphs, consonants and consonant clusters, and prefixes and suffixes is hikhly dependent upon context.
The method of ordering rules allows converted strings which are highly dependable to be used as context for those requiring a more complex framework.
Detailed studies of allowable suffix combinations and the effect of .~iffixati,on on stress and vowel quality have also provided for more reliable rcsutlts.

The Text-to-Speech System A system to convert unregtricted printed text to speech has been under development for several years at M.I.T. 1,2,3 The approach has been to model the proces-s employed by a nat'ive speaker of English when reading aloud.
In order to develop correct computational algorithms for the pronunciation of English words, it has been necessary to reflect the basic nature of linguistic processes.
Consequently, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of morphological and phon~logical analysis, stress patterns, parsing systems and prosodic correlates.
It i$ possible, using the current system, to convert any English word or string df words in a textual representation to intelligible speech.
In order to effect this conversion, a number of subsystems are utilized including mo~phological analysis, letter-to-sound rules, stress rules and phonemic speech synthesis.
Prosodic studies are now in grogress; experimental parameters for fo contours and timing patterns will soon be included In %he system.
The letter-string which represents a word is usually converted to a phoneme string in preparation for speech synthesis by a process of morpholop,ical analysis.
Amorph lexicon c-ontnininq approximately 11,000 entries has been drv~l loped and is ilsed in ron jrinct ion with n rnorph dec*ompos it ion algorithm.
Included in the lexicon are two major classes oE rnorphs.
One I1 11 I I class is composed of roots such as trust" and snow, i .c.
words which cqlr occur alone, and bound roots such as -ceive perceive, receive, connive), rot(rotary, rotate, rotor) and -miss(dismiss, missive, permiqsiveness).
A£ fixes make up the second class and may be attached either to roots or tc bound morphemes.
Accompanying each lexical entry is its phonemic representation, its morph class and its part(s) of speech.
Algorithfnic decomposifion of letter-strings models the pr~cedure used by a native speaker when confronted by a word which he does not immediately recognize or has previously not encountered.
If the word is not immediately 1 I recognizable, i,e., if ~t is not in the le~icon" of the native speaker in its entirety, an attempt will be made to break it apart into its constitu'ent morphs.
Such a process is probably used when oAe reads a word skh as "antidisestablishmentarianism," earthrise" or "cranappley for the Tirst time The algorithm also models the ability to recognize mutations such 2s the dropping of a fLbal silent i el4 (observe observance), the doubling of a final consonant (red-reddest') and the substitution of ti1 for final [yl preceding vocalic suffixes (glory glorious).
Morphophonemic rules are also included, modeling the ability to give a correct pronunciation for any plural (horses, cats, dogs) or past tense (quieted, hushed, whispered), and to palatalize in appropriate contexts ( sculpt sculpture, confuse confusion) . Another feature of the algorithm is a set of selectional rules whit\, although very simple in form, choose the corpect morphemic analysis from all possibilities in a large number of cases.
A standard form for sequences of morphemes is compared with each possibiiity, and rules describing preferred composition are used in a pairwise comparison leading to an acceptable result.
The word "formally" provides an example in which the only rule needed is one stating that a root followed by a suffix is preferable to two concatenated roots.
Possible decompositionsof the word "formally" are 1 t detected as foklows (R represents root1' and $, tlsuf-fix") : form (R) + a1 (S) + ly (S) f om (R) + ally (R) for.
(R),+ mall (R) + y (S) form (R) + all (R) + y (S) It is clear that the correct decomposition is the only candidate having the form of a single root followed by suffixes.
When a complete morphemic analysis fails, that is, when a word encountered by a'native speaker cannot be se~arated into its constituent morphemes, or when it is so infrequent in the English language that he has previously not encountered it, a "letter-to-sound" system is invoked, i.e., an attempt is made to sound out the word letter by 'letter.
The competence of a native speaker which allows him to perform this convemsion is based on correspondence& between l'etters and sounds in English which have been internalized through experience.
(A native speaker will also apply the same correspondences to a foreign-word from any language of which he has nQ knowledge).
A scheme; to model this process,musE be made available, sequenced after the decomposition algorithm, in,order to be ablk to convert unrestricted text to speech.
The text-ro-speech system includes a phonological model having a two-phase structure: the first phase is 3 set of rules which converts letters to phonemes, and the second is an algorithm for placement of stress on the converted phonemes.
This system has been implemented ;In RCPI, on n DEC PDP-9 and on a PDP-10 inbMAC LISP.
Onp might ask why, with a set of letter-to-sound rules available, it is necessary to have a lexicon.
There hre three reasons; all are restrictions which must be imposed om any viabl'e letter-to-sound system.
-First, it has been observed that high-frequency wotds perhaps because of extensive use, do nbt always follow letter-to-sound rules.
For example, the only instance in which a final Lf] is pronounced as /v/ is in the word "of If The letter [w] 9 I following a consonant is generally pronounced like the [w] in sweett1 or "tw~ll," but in the word "two" it is not pronounced at all.
A study5 of the 200 most frequent words in English according to the Bl'own corpusb as made to determine their regularity of pronunciation.
It was found that although the regular case is that a final [el preceded by a single consonant (other than [rJ) lengfhhns the preceding vowel, four of the 200 words, i.e., "haveft (compare It "behave, " "shave"), one, 11 I1 I I some" and come," (compare "ldne," "ode") are exceptions.
The case of initial [th] is even more irregular among highI-frequencyword$.
I'n most English words, initial ;th j is unvoiced as in If Jf 11 "thistle, fKin," "thesis., However, twelve of the 200 words began with voiced [thl.
Secondly, it must be recognized that the fetter~to-sound rules which operate within a morpheme, do not, ~ecessarily apply across morph bounddries.
In particular, the pronunciatian of compounds tequires a lexicon.
Such-words as "hc&house" or "potherbff might etherwise appear to contain the consonant cluster lth], and the motph-final srlent e] in "houseboatf1 would certain1 y not be silent if the word were not recognized as a compound.
The application of letter-to-sound rules must therefore be restricted to words containing no more than a single root.
Thirdly, foreign words which retain their original prmunciation must be lexical entries.
The entries may be made in the same way a native speaker of English muld add a foreign word to his vocabulary, i.e., by pronouncing it as if 13 were an English word (using English letter-to-sound rules) until informed of its correct pronunciation, and then plaCing it in his mental lexico?.
It is apparent, then, that both morphnlogical and phonological systems are necessary and that together, in sequence, they can provide a phonemic representation for any English word presented for conversion to speech.
Although, at present, there is no ingergction between the decomposition and letter-to-phoneme algorithms, a more highly efficient System could be developed in the future.
The size of the lexicon could be reduced, f6r example, by app.l!ication of stress placement rules to the output 8f the decomposition algorithm or by omitting unnecessary phonemic representations The c~nversfon of a letter string to a phoneme string in the letter-tosound program prdceeds in three s-ges.
In the first stage, prefjxes and suffixes are detected, (cc.
Figure I) Such affixes appear' im the list.of phonological rules.
Each is classified according to :13 its po~sible parts of speech, (2) the possible arts pf speech bf aasuffix preceding it, f%) its restriction or lack of restriction to word-final pos"i5op and (4) its*abitlity to change a preceding Ly] to [i] or to cause the omission of a preceding [el.
Prefixes aye given no further specification.
Detectio~ of suffixes proceeds in a xight-to-left, longest-match-first fashion.
When no additional ~ffixras c-an be d'etected, or; FJhe~ a possible suffix is judged as syntacSically incompatible with its right-adjacent suTfix by a parts-of-speech test using classifications (I) and (2) above, the pacees is terminated.
Finally, prefixes are detected 2eft-to-sight, a1so.b~ longest match first.
If at any time the removal of an affix would leave no consonant or no vowel in the remainder of the word, the affix is not removed.
Example : dkt ;+ ate + or + ship ship: (a) nominal suffix (b) follows nominal suffix or: (a) nominal suffix (b) fo$lows verbal suffix ate: (a) verbal, nominal and adjectival (b) fol~ows verbal, nominal and ad j ectival suffixes dict + ate + or + ship possible suffix analysis parts of speech are compatible; analysis accepted.

as verb with verbal endxng, is11 The domain of application of the second stage rules excludes any previously recognized affixes and is assumed to be a single morpheme.
This stage is intended primarily for consanant rules and proceeds from the left of the string to the right.
Extsnding the domain to the whole letter string once again for the third stage, a phonemic representation is given to affixes and to vowel6 and vowel digraphs, (cf.
Figure 1).
Phonemic repr'esentations are produced by a set of ordered rules which convert a letfer string to a phoneme sGri&g in a given context.
Bgth left and right contexts are permitted in the expression of a rule, and may contain, variables as well as letters or phopemes Any one context may be composed of either letters and letter variables or of phonemes and phoneme vpriablesCombination of these possibilities for both left and right contexts allows fog four possible co~text types.
One cype Q£ rule, for exapple, makes it possible to convert a particular letter string to a phoneme string only if the left context is a specified phoneme string and the right context is a specified letter string.
The method of ordering rules allows converted strings which are highly dependable to be used as context for those requiring a more complex framework.
Because the pronunciatioh of consonants is least dependent uDon context, phonological rules for consonants are applied first, i.e., in the second stage.
Rules for vowels and affixes, requiring more specification of environment, are applied in the thiddand final stage.
With the benefit of a previously converted consonant framework and the option of including as context any phoneme to the left of a string under consideration, the task of converting, voweks and affixes is simplified.

Figure 1 Application of Letrer-to-Solin-d Rules within the two sets of rules for conversion of consonants and vowels, ordering proceeds from longer strings to shester strings and, for each string,,from specific context to general context.
The rule for pronunciation uf [cch], then, appears before rhe rules for [cc] and ich], each of which is ordered before rules for LC] and [h].
Procedures for the recognition of prefixes and suffixes also require an ordering: t'le pfefixes lcomj and [con] must be ordered before [co]; any suffSx ending with the letter Ls] must be recognizpd before the suffix consisting of 'that letter only.
As an example of ordering rules for a particular string, consider the vowel [a] and .assume that it is followed by the Letter Cr].
This [a f 1 I may be pr,onounced like the [ a? in "warp, " "lariat" or carp" depending upon spebif ication of further context.
It is pronounced like the [ a] in I I carp" if it is followed by [r] and another consonant (other than Lr]) and if it is preceded by any consonant phoneme except /w/ (n,ote "quarter, 11 "wharf") Consequentlv, a rule for [a1 in the context of being preceded 7 by the phoneme /w/ ~d.followed by the sequence [r~] is placed in the setof rules.
~~rcif'ication of a left context in the rule for the [a] in 11 carp" is subsequentl!
Unnecessary. If the [a] is preceded by a /w/, this rule will never be reached; if preceded by a vowel, a rule for vowel digraph9 will already haveapplied.
Using this method.
rules may be stated simply and without redundancy.
Development of the set of phonological rules was begun by informal 8 inspection and reference to published works, e.g., Venezky.
By,a process of extensive statistical analysis, other rules were added and ordered appropriately.
The. principal source of words was the Merriam Websteb .Pockef 9 Dictionary.
A computer print-out was generafed in which all words containing each letter and each specified cluster of letters were isolated.
Within each category, words were sorted alphabetically according to the riglit-hand context of the letter(s) under considaration.
In addition, walker's rhyming dictionary lo was used to determine pronunciation of suffixes and the ef fect of suffixation on preceding phonemes.
Words from Lb Brown Corpus, the I1 12 Heritage Engllsh Dictionary ahd Stedman's Medical Dictionary have heed used in testing procedures.

~odifications fall into three categories: (1) adjustments due to the corrdition that input is completely phonemic, (2 reduction of the numbeir of str~ 4s to 1 stress (primary) 2 .* stress (stress less tban primary) ~LIU 0 stress, and (3) addition of special suffiwdependent stress categories.
Application of the rules proceeds in two phases.
The first phase cons is.^^ of the application of three-ordered rules which are applied cyclically, first to the root, then to the root and left-most suffix,combined.
The process continues with one more suffix adjoined to the string under consideration before each cycle begins until the end of the word is reached.
This cyclic phase is devoted solely to the placement of primarLy stress.
The second, non-cyclicphase, includes the appli-ion -to the entire word of ordered rules and reduces all but one of the primary stress marks to secondary or zero stress.
In the following section, stress placement rules will be given in symbolic form.
Each rule which contains more than one case is brdken down lint0 cases for whicLbrief descriptions and examples are given.
The rules,are 11 listed in the order in which they apply and are marked either cyclic" or 11 non-cyrlicm" Particular modifications to each rule will be given at the end of the discussion about that rule under the subheading Modifications.
(See Figure 3 for an explanation of notation, Figure 4 for a flow ahart of the stress rules and Figure 5 for* the complete set of stress-placement rules-in linguistic notation.
Main Stress Rule (cyclic) Condition: (1) no stress placement to the left of a prefix boundary (2) if right-most morph is a suffix, test for special stress placement category assign LI stress] or skip cycle according to category Case 1.
(Maximum string; all parentheses removed) (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a weak cluster followed by a morph-final syllable containing a short vowel and zero or more consonants: 1 difficult dzf fzk~lt (b) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a weak cluster followed by a morph-final vowel: 1 oregano 3rEnmno (c) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a vowel f~llowed by a morph-final syllabxe containing a short vowel and zero or more consonants: 1 secretariat s~krtt~ri~ t (d) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a vowel f olloked by a* morph-f inal vowel : 1 oratorio 3r &t~rio Case, 2.
(Innermost parenthesized string exclpded) I (a) Assign 1 Btress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a short vowel and zero or more consonants: 1 edit ldrt bitumen 1 bdjtum~n (b) Assign 1 stxess to the vowel in a svllable preceding a morph-final vowel: 1 agenda Case 3.
(All parenthesized strings excluded) (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in the last syllable: 1 1 slt and stxnd go go 1 parole p~rbl hurricane Impken (reduced to 2 stress by a later rule) Conversion of the Main Stress Rule into aigorithmic form is facilitated by ordering the above cases in the following manner: Algorithmic Order of Application: (1) If the final syllable is the only syllable, or if it consists of a long vowel followed 'by at least one consonant, the final vowel receives primary strgss.
Otherwise, (2) if there are only two syllables, or if the penultimate syllable terminates in more than one consonant or if it consists of a bng vowel follmed by at least one consonant, the penultimate vowel receives primary stress.
Otherwise, (3) the antepenultimate vowel receives primary stress, Modifications: The presence of the optimal vowel immegiatel~ preceding another vowel and the presence of the morph-final vowel are necessary modifications of tk Main Stress Rule due to the difficulty of retrieving the long (tense) pronunciation of a laxed vowel when its orthographic representation i,s no longer available, The Main Stress Rule, as developed by Halle, applies mly to roots which function as nouns and to suffixed forms.
However, until parsing methods are further developed, it will not be possible to take advantage of known parts of speech.
15 For
this reason, the Main Stress Rule is currently applied to all roots.
The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories.
Some suffixes are marked to force stress to be placed on either the final or the penultimate syllable of the root and suffixes under consideration.
This placement of stress replaces the MSR on the cycle in which the special suffix is the right-most morph.
These suffixes are listed below with the phonemic representation which actually appears as input.

Later cycles, however, do include the suffix as part of their.
domafn of application.
These suffixes are listed below, and are accompanied by exqmples demonstrating their inclusion in this category.
1 ABLE: (a) all words terminating in KABLE, e.g., eradicable, 1 connnunicabla 1 1 1 1 (b) formidable, n6 t iceable, manageable, knowled geabl~ ABLY: as with ABLE above 1 12 12 AGE: (a brigandage, vagabondage, chaperonage 1: 2 (b) anecdotage -at the time Walker's rhyming dict$onary was compiled, the two stresses were interchangeq 1 DOM: (a) bachelordom 1 1 (b) words such as chrtstendom and martyrdom do not sfipply evidence; "d~m" must be considered a separate syqlable, i.

e., it is not a separate syllable.
2 1 2 1 EJR: (a) caravaneer, charioteer EN : There is no evidence of stress change due to the suffixation of "erl"; most words to which it is added are l-syllable roots.

Stressed Syllable Rule (cyclic) Conditions: (1) Y contains no primary stress (2) no stress placement to the left of a prefix boundary Case 1.
(Maximum string: all parentheses removed) ~4 1 .tress] x c vco [ 1 stress y 3 (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a weak cluster followed by a vowel and any number of consonants @hich is followed by the right-most priniary-stressed vowel,: oxygenate aks~ j €net (stress on final syllable later reduced) b Assign 1 stress to the vowel in a syllable preceding a vowel followed by a vowel and any number of consonants which is followed by the right-most primary-stressed vowel: stereobate 01 st~riobet (stress on final syllable later reduced) Case 2.
(Innermost parenthesized string excluaed) ~.*~lstress-~ covco [ 1 Y-3 1 stress (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel two syllables to the left of the right-most primary-stressed vowel: 1 1 prapxg cxnd 3.L propaganda (stress on left-most stressed vowel later reduced) Case 3.
(Next innermost parenthesized string excluded) r s7 7 v v+\i stress] / EX,c0 stressj Y (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel one syllable to the left of the right-most primary-stressed vowel, i.e., to the vowel in the first syllable of the root* hormone '0 1 h.zrmon Case 4.
(All parenthesized strings excluded) v-1 C 1 stressJ /EX c0 3 (a) Assign 1 stress to the voael in the last syllable, i, to the vowel in the only eyllable of the root: 1 stand st bend (assig~bng 1 stress to vowel which already carries 1 stress bas no effect unless the rule specifies as in the Compound Stress Rule, that the vowel inust pre'viously be 1-stressei ).
Algorithmic Order of Application: (1) If the right-moqt syllable containing primary stress is the left-most syl>able in tlie word, no stress is assinried.
Otherwise, (2) if the syllable preceding the right-most stressed syllable is-the only syllable preceding it, asqign primary stress to the vowel in that syllable.
Otherwise, (3) if the second syllable to the left of t.he right-most stressed syllable is the left-mosg syllable, or if it terminates in more than one consonant _or consists of a long vowel followed by at least one consonant, assign primary stress to the vowel in that syllable.
Otherwise, (4) the vowel in the third syllable to the left of the righf-most-stressed syllable receives stress.
Modificatims: The ~ptional~vowel in pre-vocalic position appea'rs in the Stre-d Syllable Rulo as well as in the Main Stress Rule.
Its presence prevents words such as "stereobate, I' "alveolate, I' and "heliotrope" from being stressed incorrbctly.
The Stressed Syllable Rule, as developed by Halle, places stress on the final syllable of the non-nouns which have been excluded fromthe domain of application of the Main Stress Rule.
Words for which the Categorization of nounlnon-noun amear to be most useful are those in which a one-syllable* 12 prefix precedes a one-syllable root or bound morpheme, e.
g., Cperrnit] vs.
1 12 1 N [PR-l,lit], Cins~lt)~ vs.
linsult] Because there are many more verbs of v v this sort than nouns, the Stressed Syllable Rule has beep mod.ified to prevent the retraction of stress into a prefix.
The effect-of this modification is to produce only the verbal pronunciation of two-syllable noun/verb pairs.
Another more positive, effect is the correct placement of stress in Vkrbs 1 1 1 such as edit,; inhibit and pummel.
However, two-syllable nouns of the form "prefix-roo,tl' which.have no verbal counterpart are stressed incorrectly, e.g. 1 1 empire, inverse.
(This modification will be remaved or changed after a parsing algorithm is incorporated in the system).
Alternating Stress Rule (cvclic) Case 1.
(.Maximum string) V+ [I stress] / EX C~WC~\.
z stress) c0 3 (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel three syllables to thealeft of a primary-stressed vowel occurring in the last syllable if the.
following syllable contains only a vowel: heliotrope (stress in last syllable later reduced) Case, P (Parenthesized stting excluded) (a) Assign 1 stress to the vowel two syllables to the left of a primary-stressed vowel occurring in the'lakt syllable: 11 1 gelinate Te1~ t'lnet (stress in first syllable later deleted; stress in last syllable later reduced) Algorithmic Order of Application: (1) If there are at least two syllables preceding a primary-stressed vowel in the last syllable of the phoneme string, and if tbe first of these two syllables is composed of more than a single vowel, place primary streon the vowel two syllables to the left of the vowel with primary stress.
Otherwise, (2)*if there are at least three syllables to the left, the second of which is composed of a singl'e vowel, place primary stress on the vowel three syllables to the left of the vowel with primary stress.
Otherwise, (3) no stress ~ssignment is made.
1 2 1 2 Exceptions; Note that words such as peregrinate, oxygenate and 1 2 metropolitanate which are corcectly stressed ~y the Stressed Syllable Rule are stressed incorrectly, thereafter,by the Alternating Stress Rule.
Modification: The optional vowel in pre-vocalic position appears in the Alternating Stress Rule as well as.
in the Main Stress and %Stressed Syllable rules.
Proposed Modification: The restriction'of the Alternating Stress Rule to word@ in which a prefix boundary does not precede the final primarystressed syllable could be constraided to uerbs.
Such a c~nstraint would provide the correct stress placement in nouns and adjectives such as 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 multiform, contraband: intercept and miniskirt while retaining correct* 2 1 21 2 1 stress placement in the verbs intercept, contradict-and comprehend.
Such a modification would require moving thg Strong First Syllable Rule in Halle's scheme to follow the Compound Stress Rule, asgigning [2 stress] in the same context in which (1 st'ress] was previously ass'igned.
This-modification has already been implemented in this program for independent reasons, and is discussed under the heading Modifications in the Strong First Syllable Rule.
Destressing Rule (non-cyclic, applicable to all vowels having required context) Conditions: (1) if ( )ais not present; ( 1 must be present b (2) not applied to first vowel ifapplied %a second vowel Case 1.
(Vowel to be reduced not in first syllable) +tS 3 (a) Shorten and' destress any vowel not in the first syllable which is followed by a singl'e coneonant and a stressed vowel: 1 sol instrumental Tnstrumf nt ~1 ( /u/ reduced to /U/, later to /a/) Case 2.
(Vowel to be reduced is in first syllable) (a) Destress a non-long vowel in the first syllable which is followed by a single consonant and a stressed vowel: flO1 1 gelat-inate jrl~ trnet Algorithmic Application: (1) If a vowel not in the first sy1Lable is immediately followed by one consenant and s vowel which has'previously been assigned primary stress6 shorten (lax) it if ie is long, and remove,any stress it has been assigned.
(2) If a short vowel is in $he first syllable, and is immediately followed by one consonant and a vowel which has previously been assigned primary stress; and if (1) doe$ not apply to the vowel in the second tsyllable, remove any stress that has been assigned to the vowel in t,he first syllable.
Modificakibn: The single required consonant preceding the ~rimary stressed vowel has been changed from C; (zero oz one consonane to C one consonant) so that pre-vocalic vowels are not shotcened.
Compound Stress Rule (non-cyclic) This rule, as developed by Halle, applies to both compounds and non-compounds.
As it applies to words converted by letter-to-phoneme rules in the program, and therefore to non-compounds only, its efPect is to locate the primary stress which is to be retained.
All other primary stress is reduced to secondary.
Halle has used the Nuclear Stress Rule for both phraselevel stress and the reduction of secondary to tertiary stress in lexical* ttems.
Neither is necessary in this algorithm; the Nuclear Stress Rule has therefore been omitted.
Condition: (1) Y contains no 1 stress (2) if right most morph is a suffix, check for special stress retention or stress exclusion, category and reassign [l stress] according &o category Case 1.

Otherwise, (2) if the right-most vowel with primary stress is followed by at least one more syLMle, the right-most of whikh is not composed of an unstressed /i/, it retains primary stress and all other prfmary stress is reduced to secondary.
(3) If the right-most vowel+ with primary stress is (a) the rigfit-most vowel in the word, or (b) the right-most vowel with the exception of a final syllable chpased of an unstressed /i/, the first primary-stressed vowel to its left retains primary stress and all other primary stress is reduced to secondary.
Modifications: As mentioned previously, input to the stress rules from the letter-to-phoneme program do~s not include compounds.
The part of-he rde designed for compounds is, the~efore, omitted.
This rule formerly contained the letter Cy] instead of has been substituted due to unavailability of the original brthogsaphy.
The suffixes referred to in Condition (2) fall into two categories.
Those suffixes discussed under Condition (2) of the Main Stress Rule which do not affect stress placement are excepted from the Bamain of the Compound Stress Rule if they are either word-final or precede another word-final suffix in the same category.
The other category of suffixes is marked for special stress retention.
The fellowing suffixes retain primary stress in word-final position under Condition (2) of the Compound Stress Rule: 2 1 2 1 EE: trainee, legatee 2 1 2 1 EER: buccaneer, engineet 2 1 2 I ESCE: luminesce, acquiesce 2 1 2 1 ESQUE : arabesque, Romanesque 2 1 ZB 1 ETTE : marionette, majorette Z 1 1 OON : macaroon, baboon The foldowing suffix does not retain primary stress on the penultimate syllable under Condition (2) of the Compound Stress Rule: ---12 2 I a ISM: Babism, dRomanticism Note: Th&s categorization is equivalent to the statement that syllabic M does not function as a syllable .in morph-final position.
The same stress pattern appears in wordp ending in [ithm], although it is not included here as a sbffix, e.g., 12 1 2 logarithm, algorithm.
The same categorization should be extended to morph-final syllabic 113.
However, it does not function as a suffix, e.g9 1 corpuscle The original set of stress rules included the Trisyllabic Shortening Rule at this point in the ordering.
The rule was stated as follows: Condition: (1) does not apply to /u/ Test results indi,cated misp~onunciations arisYkng from its application.
A 16 study was undertaken to determine the usefulness of this rt~lp.
and to uncover problem areas which might lead to a more proper resolution of observed effects for which the Trisyllabic Shortening Rule was formulated.
It: was found that a restatement of phonological rules, including the requirement of a short vowel in a one-syllable root preceding a Single consonant, and certain suffixes, obviated the need for the Trisyllabic Shorte'ning Rule in the set of stress rules.
Strong First Syllable Rule (non-cyclic) Condition: (1) ( ) or ( ){ must be a present Case 1.
(Maximum string) (a) Assign 2estress to the vowel in the,first syllable if it is long and followed by at least two cpnsonants: 0 11 hydrosanitation h adros~nrteJan Case 2.
(First subscripted optional string excluded) ~+\2 stress] / KC/* CO (a) Assign 2 stress to the vowel in the first syllable if it is followed by at least two consonants: 1 1 1 Case 3.

primary stress.
Modifications: This rule has been extended to include both the-first syllable of the root and the first syllable of the left-most prefix.
This rule has been moved to follow the Compound Stress Rule to prevent the retentipn of primary stress in prefixes by the Compound Stress Rule in words such as recruit and intend.
Cursory Rule (non-cyclic) Conditibn: (1) if right-most morph is a suffix, check for stress exclusion category, Algorithmic Application: (only one case of the Cursory Rule) The vowel following the primary-stressed vowel, if it is not the last vowel in the word, is shortened and its stress removed.
2 1 X'O 1 AH0 lPO Examples : infirmary, cursory-, curative (/e/-+ 1 a~ 1,later reduced tb /a /).
Modifications: Pre-vocalic vowels are not shortened.
The suffixes discussed under the Main Sttess Ruleahi-ch do not affecL stress placement are excepted from the domain of the Cursdry Rule if they are either.

Modification: The phonemes /€/ and /T/ are reduced Go /I/ rather than to' /a/.
A Stress-Depe'hden~ Letter-to-Phoneme Rule The rule which follows appears to be stress-dependent and was placed in the stress placement section rather than with other letter-to-phoneme rules : Rule: The phoneme it/ is changed to /$/ and the phoneme /d/ to /J/ if it is not in the initial consonant cluster and precedes unstressed /u/ or /U/, or if it precedestlnstressed /a/ which was /u/ or /U/ before application of stress placement rules.
2 1 2 1 Example : perpetuity (It/) perpetual (I:/) Examples (showing wards which do not fit the context of the rule and 'herefire retain /t/ or Id/ as pronunciation): 1 1 I 1 1 (a) tutor, duty, studious, duration, Lureen In these -cases, the /t/ or /d/ is in the initial consonant cluster 2 1 1 1 (b) adumbration, modus, status The It/ or /d/ in these cases is not in the initial consonant cluster; but precedes unstressed /9/ which was not /u/ or / U/ before application of stress rules.
2 I
2 1 1 1 2 (c) institution, centurion, Hindu, constitute In the above cases, /t/ or /d/ is not in the initial eonsonant cluster and precedes stressed /u/ or /U /.
The stress program has been modified to effect this change.
The phonemes ft/ and /d/ preceding unstressed /u/ or /U / not in the first syllable are chgnged following the cyclic rules which place all stress.
After the Destressing Rule and the Cursory Rule, a change is also made if the destressed (and possibly 'shortened) vowel was previously a /u/ or /u / and not in the first syllable.

The set of letxer-to-phonemewrules used in the first testing proced~re contained 534 rules: included were 127, consonant roles, 46 prefix rules (giving pronunciations for 40 prefixes), 155 suffix rules (covering 96 suffixes) and 206 vowel rules.
The Trisyllabic Shortening Rule was included in the set.of stress rules.
A sample of 4,725 worb from the Brown Corpus was ~ested with the following results.
Percentage given Number of Words acceptable pronunciation r 7-letter words 1,174 73 72to 21-letter words 637 65 An acceptable pronunciation .is one which is given in Webster ' s 17 Third International Dictionary, either preferred or alternate.
Of the 2,375-1rq 5-lekter words which receiyed acceptable pronunciatLons, 2,135 were given preferred pronunciat&ons, 228 were given alternace pronunciations and 12 received the verbaL pgonunciation of nounlverb pairs.
A table of frequency of use and statistical accuracy 6f each rule was derivet from this study.
These results led to the removal of the Tris'yllabic Shortening Rule and to the formulation of eight gets of phonological rules ranging from a maximal set of 557 rules to a minimal set of 277 rules.
In the second study, these eight sets of rules were each applied to a new group of te$t words which was composed of a xandom sampling of sixletter words from the Brow Corpus (250 words), the Heritage English Dictionary (150 words) and Stedman's Medical Dictionary (100 words).

There are a number of problem areas, many of which derive from the lack of a lekicon.
Boblems of this type include incorrect suffix or prefix recognition and the treatment of compounds as single norphs.
Some examples from each problem area are given below: Mispronunciation of single vowel: international menu /e/ modeled /e/ * /u/ strategf cally /€/ environmental /r/ bur jed /PI hotels /a/ two The pr~nunciations of the underlined vowels in the contexts above ark encountered infrequently, and, in most cases, are not predictable.
In the word international, the context which determines the pronunciation of @]is the right-hqnd context Lc+~v], A 10xowel almost always is found in this context as in nation, station, explanation, observational, gensational.
A short [el is usually found preceding PC], e.g ., maleuc, angelic,.
systemic, photogenic, and is long only in a few words, e.g., strategic, scenic, and the suffix *legit.
.There are very few words ending in the vowel[u]-most are either low frequency words or proper names.
The palatalization in menu is not found in other words with finallu], e.g., flu, emu, gnu, -i'mprqmptu.
The word two is very irregular in pronunciation.
Most words ending in[o]such as E, no, so, calico, echo have the sound lo/.
It may be noted, however, that two other words which, like -1 two me very high frequency words, have the same pronunciation of final[o]as -9 two i.e., do, to.
The mispronunciation of the[e]in modeled is due to the assumption, lacking a lexicon, that the morphemic analysis is -model C ed.
Mispronunciation of vowel digraph: said break /i/ forfeit endowed shoes should, would theirs The reasons for mispronunciation of the vowel digraphs underlined above fall into a number of categories.
There are very high frequency words, said, should and would, which do not follow letter-to-sound rules.
Said may be contrasted with the words laid, maid, paid, and raid; the words should and would contrast with mould, shoulder and boulder.
The sequence bir] as in theiys, heir, weir is not found frequently in English, nor is the sequence (feit] as in for£ eit surfsit and counterfeit . Rules for ki],....9 in these two contexts w@rakcskis:risidered unproductive.
~inal to4 in English is usually pronounced as in oboe, toe aA foe; the pronunciation found in shoe, and also in canoe, is rare.
Rules governing the pronunciation of &ow] (endowed) and bi] (guitars) are statistically based.
Althougfi there are rna~ywordo inwhiekhllar nort=ccmt ext dsqxmdmt-prwornlat3m~~s m, e.g., -9 cow' allow, eyebrow and build, guilt, guinea, other pronunciations are statistically more likely, e.g., those found in shadow, glow, follow and bruise, juice, nuisance.
The ptonunciation of break is not-predictable -the word steak has the same digraph pronunciation, but other similar words such as creak, freak and Streak are pronounced like the majority of words congaining the digraph Lea], Mispronunciation of .single consonant: of /f/ cor~ /PI eager / j/ exhaust /h/ two /w / physiological /s/ deserts /s/ schizophrenic /z/ The consonants underlined above are either silent or have unpredictable or unusual pronunciations.
Silent consonants are found in two, corpand exhaust .The yord two is a h'igh-frequency word in which both the l&] ahd b] have unusual pronunciatio~s . Silent M is rare, although it is also found in the word sword.
Pinal silent [d, as found in corp is also rare.
(This word is c~~sidered in this section because the pronunciation of both the,[r]and therp] are determined by rules for single consonants).
There are a few tmrds, like exhaust, in which [h] is .silent following kx], e.
g. exhibit, exhilarate, exhort and exhume.
However, this rule is not sufficiently productive to merit inclusion.
The letter b] preceding (e],[il and ty] in English usually has a soft sound as in integer and wager.
In particular, many words ending inber] ark a combinatton of a root with final [el and the Buff ix her], e.
g ., mrager, manager, merger, all of which have a soft [g] sound.
The pronunciation of the \g] in eager is unusual and not predictable.
Another pr~nunciation which is frequently unpredictable, i.e., not context-dependent,, ts that of the lqtter[s] between vowels.
The rule for this context predic~ the more frequent sound /s/ whereas the sound /z/ is found in deserts and physiologieal.
The letter [ z] in schizophrenic has the rgre pronunciation /ts/, and the word if, as previously discussed, is the only English word in which a final [f] is chef /c/ laugh/-/ wauld -3 should /ld) cliches 7 /E/ calf /lf / issue /s/ tsar /ts/ these /e / Consonant clusters are in£ rqquently mispronounced The cluster tch 1 is the most frequent problem fn Ghi~ category, its pronu~eiation being determined, in many cases, by the Greek or Latin origin of the word in which it appeBrs.
The pronunciation /If as in -.
chef and cliches is less frequent than.
either /:/, e.g., church, or /k/, e.
g., .chemical.
Morphfinal Cgh] may be pdonounced either if/ as in laugh, enough and cough or, with slightly hiqher probability, not pronounced, a3 in high, weigh and dourn.
Unusual and rare pronunciations of the clusters -3 t~ -9 ss id add li are found in other yoxds above.
The pronunciatipn of [ss] as /J/ is found preceding certain suffixes, e.g.,.deprgsqion, fissute, but rarely within a motph, (tissue, above).
Russian orthography is still reflected in the English spelling of tsar evemthough the pronunciation has been Anglicized.
A silent [l] appears in could, .would and calf.
The words could and would are high freauency words and also .differ from regular;,pz'~nunciation in the vowel digraph cou3.
Although half like -5 calf also has a silent [l], in most words a final [lf] is gronopnced /If /, e.
g., elf, -shelf, self, gulf.
The high-frequency-ward pronunciation of: morph-in itial [th] as / 8 1, e.

Words are pronounced incorrectly because letter strings in a root which appear to be suffixes are converted to phonemes using,rules for suffix pronunciation.
It may be seen in the examples above that a mistake in morph ana5iysis can cause obvious errors in pronunciation.
Incorrect prefix recognition: 1 1 unit / an=Zt/ /d%s ~m+dl/ decimal 1 i cool /ko=al/ emerald It m= tr 1116 / 1 reah 1 /ri=am/ encouragement It ntbhr+f j+mTnt I 1 de~ /di=€m/ -rQnenters.

These may 6e added by a user with particular technical needs.
A few prefixes such as[a]in apart andp] in eject have not been included because a high error rate would result, i.e., all words begipning in &or g would be incorrectly analyzed.
In the remaining cases, prefixes were incorrectly analyzed as part of a root after suffixes were incorrectly removed.
Errors in pronunciation, and particularly in stress are the result.
Incorrect stress: Most of the words in this category have unusual stress patterns which are unpredictable.
A comparison with similar words shows the regular stress pattern: 1 motel 1 palette 1 sonata 1 urea 1 uncomfortable 1 lunatic 1 renegade marsel, gavel9 fuel 1 1 1 majorette, crurette, suffragette 1 1 1 vertebra, camera, automata 1 1 1 trachea, azalea, miscelanea 1 1 unaffordable, uncontestable 1 '1 1 erratic, fanatic, aromatic brigade, serenade, marinade The word selects is stressed incorrectly due to lack of information concerning its part of speech (c.f., discussion of modificatiqns in the Main Stress Rule).
The results of this study indicate that the letter-to-phoneme system is quite powerful, even in isolaqion.
When considered in the domain of the over-all text-to-speech system in which a lexicon is available for highfrequency words and compounds, the letter-to-phoneme system should be highly reliable . References Alleq, J.
