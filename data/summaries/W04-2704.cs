This perspective of discourse is based on a series of papers extending lexicalized treeadjoining grammar (LTAG) to discourse (DLTAG), beginning with Webber and Joshi (1998).

The tag set for Chinese and English PropBanks are to a large extent similar and more details can be found in (Xue and Palmer, 2003).

Palmer et al (2004b) present an hierarchical approach to verb senses, where different levels of sense distinctions, from PropBank Framesets to WordNet senses, form a continuum of granularity.

The same annotation philosophy has been extended to the Penn Chinese Proposition Bank (Xue and Palmer, 2003).

to the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is currently being built by the PDTB team at the University of Pennsylvania, providing the next appropriate level of annotation: the annotation of the predicate argument structure of connectives (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b).

At the intermediate level of sense hierarchy we are considering manual groupings of the SENSEVAL-2 verb senses (Palmer, et.al., 2004a), developed in a separate project.
