Litman and Passonneau(Litman and Passonneau, 1995)'s work can be considered to be a related research, because they presented a method for text segmentation that uses multiple knowledge sources.

Watanabe(Watanabe, 1996) can be considered as a related work.

Here we call a sequence of words which have lexical cohesion relation with each other a lezical chain like(Morris and Hirst, 1991).

In the area of speech recognition, to improve the accuracy of the language models, clustering the training data is considered to be a promising method for automatic training(Carter, 1994; Iyer et al., 1994).

There are a variety of methods for combining multiple knowledge sources (linguistic cues)(McRoy, 1992).

By this experiment, we try to clarify the upper bound of the performance of the text segmentation task, which can be considered to indicate the degree of the difficulty of the task(Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Gale et al., 1992).

Since determining weights by hand is a labor-intensive task and the weights do not always to achieve optimal or even near-optimal performance(Rayner et al., 1994), we think it is better to determine the weights automatically in order to both avoid the need for expert hand tuning and achieve performance that is at least locally optimal.

Okumura and Honda (Okumura and Honda, 1994) found that the information of lexical cohesion is not enough and incorporation of other surface information may improve the accuracy.

Therefore, identifying segment boundaries in a text is considered as a first step to construct the discourse structure(Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

In the past researches (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Cohen, 1987), the weights for each cue tend to be determined by intuition or trial and error.

Among a variety of surface cues, lexical cohesion(Halliday and Hasan, 1976), the surface relationship among words that are semantically similar, has recently received much attention and has been widely used for text segmentation(Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Okumura and Honda, 1994).
