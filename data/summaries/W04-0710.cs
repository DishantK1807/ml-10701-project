In command dialogs, the problem is to match the REs produced by the user against the objects managed by the interface, again known formally to the system (Huls et al., 1995; Skantze, 2002).

This difficult but important task in discourse understanding by computers appears to be more tractable when enough knowledge about a domain is available to a system (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 1997), or when the representations are considerably simplified (Popescu-Belis et al., 1998).

The present separation between tasks (2) and (4) needs further explanations—see also (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000; Popescu-Belis, 2003) for more details.

. . In the present case, reference resolution over a restricted domain differs significantly both from anaphora resolution (Mitkov, 2002) and from coreference resolution (Hirschman, 1997; van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).

If the RE is anaphoric, then it is associated to the current article or document element—a very simple implementation of a focus stack (Grosz et al., 1995)—except if the RE is the first one in the meeting, which is never considered to be anaphoric.

It has long been observed that a more accurate view is that REs rather specify representations of entities in the speaker’s or hearer’s mind, an abstraction called discourse entities or DEs (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al., 1995).
