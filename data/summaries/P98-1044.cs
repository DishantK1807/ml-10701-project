Most recently, Marcu (1997) has described a method for text summarization based on nuclearity and selective retention of hierarchical fragments.

Our approach is closer to that of Passonneau (1995) and Hahn and Strtibe (1997), who both use a stack-based model of discourse structure based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) focus spaces.

The corpus was prepared using an encoding scheme for discourse structure (Cristea, Ide, and Romary, 1998) based on the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) (Ide (1998)).

use Grosz and Sidner's (1986) terminology here, but note the equivalence of dominance in G&S and nucleus/satellite relations in RST pointed out by Moser and Moore (1996).

Introduction As originally postulated, Centering Theory (CT) (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995)) accounts for references between adjacent units but is restricted to local reference (i.e., within segment boundaries).

of Computer Science Vassar College Poughkeepsie, NY, USA ide@cs.vassar.edu Laurent ROMARY Loria-CNRS Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France romary @loria.fr Abstract In this paper, we propose a generalization of Centenng Theory (CT) (Grosz, Joshi, Weinstein (1995)) called Veins Theory (VT), which extends the applicability of centering rules from local to global discourse.

We use centering transitions (Brennan, Friedman and Pollard (1987)) to define a <<smoothness>> index, which is used to compare different discourse structures and interpretations.

Such a model is equivalent to a dynamic processing model of a tree-like structure reflecting the hierarchical nesting of discourse segments, and thus has significant similarities to discourse structure trees produced by RST (see Moser and Moore (1996)).
J96-3006
Given the mapping of Grosz and Sidners (1986) stackbased model of discourse structure to RST structure trees outlined by Moser and Moore (1996), the domains of referentiality defined for left-polarized trees using VT are consistent with those defined using the stack-based model (e.g.

CT defines a set of transition types for discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995); Brennan, Friedman and Pollard (1987)).
