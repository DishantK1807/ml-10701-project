This view is taken for instance in SDRT (Asher, Lascarides, 2003), which places emphasis on the notion of ‘right frontier’ (also discussed recently by (Webber et al., 2003)).

Two examples of such corpora are the RST Tree Corpus by (Marcu et al., 1999) for English and the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) for German.

Our Discourse Marker Lexikon ‘DiMLex’ (Berger et al., 2002) assembles information on 140 German connectives, giving a range of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features, including the coherence relations along the lines of (Mann, Thompson, 1988).

However, when we trained two (experienced) students to annotate the 171 newspaper commentaries of the Potsdam Commentary Corpus (Stede, 2004) and upon completion of the task asked them about their experiences, a very different picture emerged.

words/phrases as preposed predicate complements preand post-modi ed connectives co-occurring connectives single and multiple clauses/sentences as arguments of connectives annotation of discontinuous connective arguments Annotators have to also make syntactic judgements, which is not the case in our approach (where syntax would be done on a di erent annotation layer, see (Stede, 2004)).

1In our corpus of newspaper commentaries (Stede, 2004), we found that 35% of the coherence relations are signalled by a connective.

A number of approaches tackling the di cult problem of automatic discourse parsing have been proposed in recent years (e.g., (Sumita et al., 1992) (Marcu, 1997), (Schilder, 2002)).

However, since we also have in our group an XML-based lexicon of German connectives at our disposal (Berger et al., 2002), why not use this resource to speed up the rst phase of the annotation? 3 Annotating connectives and their scopes In our de nition of ‘connective’, we largely follow (Pasch et al., 2003) (a substantial catalogue and classi cation of German connectives), who require them to take two arguments that can potentially be full clauses and that semantically denote two-place relations between eventualities (but they need not always be spelled out as clauses).

Annotation of the remaining (unsignalled) relations between larger segments Step 1 is inspired by work done for English in the Penn Discourse TreeBank2 (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).
