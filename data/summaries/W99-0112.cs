Since a more general theory to referring expressions is needed, an extension is presented by Grosz and Sidner (1986).

Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (Asher, 1993) is enriched by the ranking system developed in centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995).

In addition, a tree logic is used to represent underspecification within the discourse structure (Schilder, 1998).

CT proposed by Grosz et al.(1995) offers a text comprehension model that describes the relation between the focus of attention and the choices of referring expressions within a discourse segment.

In order to cover coreference over discourse segments the centering model was extended by a stack mechanism (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
