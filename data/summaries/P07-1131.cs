(Ji et al., 2005) uses semantic relations to refine co-reference decisions, but in a approach different from ours.

We developed the initial entity detection, relation detection, and event detection systems using the same techniques as our submission systems to ACE (Florian et al., 2004).

Similar to many previous works on co-reference (Ng, 2005), we cast the problem as a classification task and solve it in two steps: (1) train a classifier to determine whether two mentions are co-referent or not, and (2) use a clustering algorithm to partition the mentions into clusters, based on the pairwise predictions.

Our existing co-reference module is a state-ofthe-art system that produces very competitive results compared to other existing systems (Luo et al., 2004).
