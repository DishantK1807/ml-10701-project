The next three grammars are derived from the Treebank corpus (Brill et al.1990) of hand-parsed sentences from the Wall Street Journal.
H90-1055
Schabes and Waters (1993a) a formalism almost identical to LTIG is referred to as lexicalized context-free grammar (LCFG).
P93-1017
This observation stems from the equivalence of TAG and head grammars (Vijay-Shanker et al.1986). In contrast, every operation allowed by a TIG inserts a string into another string.
C86-1048
4. Parsing TIG Since TIG is a restricted case of tree-adjoining grammar (TAG), standard O(n6)-time TAG parsers (Lang 1990; Schabes 1991; Vijay-Shanker 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Weir 1993; Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1985) can be used for parsing TIG.
J93-4002 P85-1011 P93-1017
Schabes and Waters (1993a) these three kinds of auxiliary trees are referred to differently, as right recursive, left recursive, and centrally recursive, respectively.
P93-1017
This approach is discussed in Schabes and Waters 1993c.
P93-1017
5. TIG Strongly Lexicalizes CFG In the following, we say that a grammar is lexicalized (Schabes 1990; Schabes et al.1988) if every elementary structure contains a terminal symbol called the anchor.
C88-2121
A simple O(nB)-time bottom-up recognizer for TIG in the style of the CKY parser for CFG can be straightforwardly constructed following the approach shown in Schabes and Waters (1993a).
P93-1017
of the linguistic formalisms illustrating the increased use of lexical information are: lexical rules in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan 1983), GPSG (Gazdar et al.1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987), Categorial Grammars (Steedman 1987; Karttunen 1986), some versions of GB theory (Chomsky 1981), and Lexicon-Grammars (Gross 1984).
P84-1058
One could allow at most one left auxiliary tree and one right auxiliary tree as we did in Schabes and Waters (1993a).
P93-1017
Gross, Maurice' (1984).
P84-1058
Schabes, Yves, and Shieber, Stuart (1994).
J94-1004
Third, one can introduce stochastic parameters controlling the probabilities with which particular substitutions and adjunctions occur (see Schabes and Waters 1993b).
P93-1017
However, these context-sensitive formalisms entail larger computation costs than CFGs--O(n6)-time in the case of TAG (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1985), instead of O(n 3) for CFG.
P85-1011
TIG allows arbitrarily many simultaneous adjunctions on a single node in a manner similar to the alternative TAG derivation defined in Schabes and Shieber (1994).
J94-1004
A different name is used here to highlight the importance of the nonlexicalized formalism, which was not given a name in Schabes and Waters (1993a).
P93-1017
Vijay-Shanker, K., and Weir, David (1993).
