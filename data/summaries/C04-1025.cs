Others (van Noord, 1991; Ramsay, 1999) have the grammar writer provide a combinatory predicate (such as concatenate, shuﬄe, or head-wrap) for each rule specifying how the string coverage of the mother is determined from the string coverages of the daughter.

Some of these approaches (Johnson, 1985; Reape, 1991) lack word order constraints altogether.
P85-1015
In the spirit of Johnson (1985) and Reape (1991), and following Ramsay (1999), we represent edge coverage with bitvectors, stored as integers.
P85-1015
A range of analyses for languages with relatively free constituent order have been developed on this basis (see, for example, Reape, 1993; Kathol, 1995; M¨uller, 1999; Donohue and Sag, 1999; Bonami et al., 1999) so that it is attractive to exploit these approaches for processing languages with relatively free constituent order.
P95-1024
Instead, the order can be used to generalize the head marking used in grammars for head-driven parsing (Kay, 1990; van Noord, 1991) by additionally ordering the non-head daughters.
P91-1015
Later work (Kathol and Pollard, 1995; Kathol, 1995; Yatabe, 1996) introduced the notion of partial compaction, in which only a portion of the daughter’s order domain is compacted; the remaining elements are domain unioned.
