Work (Traum and Allen, 1994) defined a model of linguistic interaction based on the notion of obligation.

While in (Traum and Allen, 1994) discourse obligations are social norms that speakers have to learn, in our model, the speakers have to learn in what conditions humans happen to be offended; this same knowledge explains the use of indirect speech acts (as in (Ardissono et al., 1999)).
P94-1001
Differently from (Traum and Allen, 1994), (Allwood, 1994) introduces, besides the obligations associated to the communicative acts, two additional sources of obligation which are related, respectively, to ethical and rational motivations intrinsic to social relations and to the management of communication itself.
P94-1001
While we agree with (Traum and Allen, 1994) that cooperation between agents who are not part of a group has to be explained by some mechanism which obliges an agent to answer at least for refusing explicitly we want to go deeper inside the notion of obligation and try to show that it is strictly related to that of intention.
P94-1001
In order to overcome these difficulties, (Traum and Allen, 1994) claim that speech acts pose obligations on the hearer: obligations are pro-attitudes which provide the hearer with a motivation to act, even if he is not strictly speaking cooperating with the speaker.

(Traum and Allen, 1994) have challenged intention-based approaches to dialog modeling ((Cohen and Levesque, 1990), (Lambert and Carberry, 1991), (Airenti et al., 1993)) arguing that, in non-cooperative settings (i.e., when the participants do not have 1 (Merrit, 1976) ~(Green and Carberry, 1999) shared goals), intention-based approaches leave unexplained why a participant should bother to be cooperative, both at the conversational and at the behavioral level.

In this paper we proposed an intention-based approach to dialog that aims at overcoming the critics posed by (Traum and Allen, 1994) by assuming the existence of social goals.

of obligation, even if some similarities can be found with (Traum and Allen, 1994).
