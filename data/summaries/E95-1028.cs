The kinds of non-linear effects common in Semitic languages, where vowel and consonant patterns are interpolated in words (Kay, 1987; Kiraz, 1994) could be treated efficiently by the mechanisms described here if it proved possible to define a representation that allowed the parts of an inflected word corresponding to the root to be separated fairly cleanly from the parts expressing the inflection.

For agglutinative languages such as Korean, Finnish and Turkish (Kwon and Karttunen, 1994; Koskenniemi, 1983; Oflazer, 1993), dimension (b) is very large, so creating an exhaustive word list is out of the question unless the lexicon is trivial.

In compilation, one may compose any or all of (a) the two-level rule set, (b) the set of affixes and their allowed combinations, and (c) the lexicon; see Kaplan and Kay (1994 / for an exposition of the mathematical basis.

The interaction of morphological analysis with spelling correction (Carter, 1992; Oflazer, 1994; Bowden, 1995) is another possibly fruitful area of work.
E95-1044 P92-1021
Rules are applied recursively and nondeterministically, somewhat in the style of Abramson (1992), taking advantage of Prolog's unification mechanism to instantiate the part of the surface string corresponding to affixes and to place some spelling constraints on the start and/or end of the surface and/or lexical forms of the root.
C92-3125
Each feature for a major category is assigned a unique position in the compiled Prolog term, and features for which finite value sets have been specified are compiled into vectors in a form that allows boolean expressions, involving negation as well as conjunction and disjunction, to be conjoined by unification (see Mellish, 1988; Alshawi, 1992, pp46-48).
J88-1004
The automata may be derived from the rules alone (Trost, 1990), or involve composition with the lexicon (Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen, 1992).

These feature-augmented production rules are just the same device as those used in the CLE's syntactico-semantic descriptions, and are a much more natural way to express morphotactic information than finite-state devices such as continuation classes (see Trost and Matiasek, 1994, for a related approach).

Once the root spelling patterns and the affix combinations pointing to them have been created, analysis essentially reduces to an instance of affixstripping, which would be amenable to exactly the technique outlined by Carter (1992).
P92-1021
The original formulation has been extended to allow morphotactic constraints to be expressed by feature specification (Trost, 1990; A1shawi et al, 1991) rather than Koskenniemi's less perspicuous device of continuation classes.
