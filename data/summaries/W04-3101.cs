We apply it to five molecular biology EI and information extraction systems: ABGene (Tanabe and Wilbur 2002a, Tanabe and Wilbur 2002b); KeX/PROPER (Fukuda et al.1997); Yapex (Franzén et al.2002); the stochastic POS tagging-based system described in Cohen et al.(in submission); and the entity identification component of Ono et al.’s information extraction system (Ono et al.2001), and show how it gives detailed useful information about each that is not apparent from the standard metrics and that is not documented in the cited publications.
