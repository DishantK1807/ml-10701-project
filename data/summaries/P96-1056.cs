(Schabes and VijayShanker, 1990) describes the construction of an LR parsing algorithm for TAGs 1.
P90-1035
The LR parser (of (Schabes and Vijay-Shanker, 1990)) uses a parsing table and a sequence of stacks (Fig.
P90-1035
2The algorithm described here can be extended to use SLR(1) tables (Schabes and Vijay-Shanker, 1990).
P90-1035
The moves made by the parser can be explained by an automaton which is weakly equivalent to TAGs called Bottom-Up Embedded Pushdown Automata (BEPDA) (Schabes and Vijay-Shanker, 1990) 3.
