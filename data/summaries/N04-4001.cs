These findings are additionally supported by the fact that automatic n-gram-based evaluation measures now being used to assess predominately extractive multi-document summarization systems correlate strongly with human judgments when restricted to the usage of unigrams and bigrams, but correlate weakly when longer n-grams are factored into the equation (Lin & Hovy, 2003).

Work Jing (2002) previously examined the degree to which single-document summaries can be characterized as extractive.
