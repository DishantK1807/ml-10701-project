Statistical systems build translation models from this data without linguistic analysis (Brown, 1993).

Like Watanabe (2000) and Meyers (2000), we use a lexicon to establish initial tentative word correspondences.

system Our translation system (Richardson, 2001) begins by parsing an input sentence and obtaining a logical form.

We augment this with 19,762 translation correspondences acquired using statistical techniques described by Moore (2001).

Up Experiment-2 compares Best-First to the previous algorithm we employed, which used a bottom-up approach, similar in spirit to that used by Meyers (1998a).

Another class of systems, including our own, parses sentences in parallel sentence-aligned corpora to extract transfer rules or examples (Kaji, 1992) (Meyers, 2000) (Watanabe, 2000).
