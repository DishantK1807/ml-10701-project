Strube (1998) claims that the incremental generation and processing of the S-list enables his system to handle interand intrasentential anaphora without any further specifications.
P98-2204
Di Eugenio (1990) proposed that the alternation of null and overt pronominal subjects in Italian could be explained in terms of centering transitions.
C90-2047
The reader is referred, however, to Miltsakaki and Kukich (2000a, 2000b) for a discussion of the significance of Rough Shifts in the evaluation of text coherence.
P00-1052
A sequence of two Rough Shift transitions in this short discourse is counterintuitive and unexpected given that of all centering transitions, Rough Shifts in particular have been shown to (a) disfavor pronominal reference (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Di Eugenio 1998; and Miltsakaki 1999, among others), (b) be rare in corpora, to the extent that the transition has been ignored by some researchers (Di Eugenio 1998 and Hurewitz 1998, among others), and (c) be reliable measures of low coherence in student essays (Miltsakaki and Kukich 2000a).
J94-2003 P00-1052
They argue against Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994), in which the Cf ranking is viewed as a language-specific parameter that needs to be set.
J94-2003
We will now demonstrate these differences with respect to Lappin and Leass’s (1994) and Hobbs’s (1978) algorithms, which are conceptually the closest to our approach.

3. The Proposal: Aposynthesis 3.1 Outline of the Discourse Model We assume that the discourse is organized hierarchically in linear and embedded segments as specified in Grosz and Sidner (1986).
J86-3001
Each subordinate conjunction may anchor a family of trees to reflect variations in the surface order of the substituted argument clauses, but the predicateargument relation remains the same (Webber and Joshi 1998; Webber et al., 1999a, 1999b).
P99-1006 W98-0315
The centering model (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) makes the following assumptions: 1.
J86-3001 P83-1007
The low salience of subordinate clause entities is further confirmed in the experimental results reported in Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999).
J99-2001
It was soon observed, however, that the BFP algorithm was not capable of handling cases of intrasentential anaphora such as in (2) (adapted from Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro [1999]).
J99-2001
In Miltsakaki (2000), we argue that speakers of various languages use available nominal and pronominal forms and prosodic features in spoken language to signal attention structure in discourse.
P00-1052
For other languages, either free-word-order languages like Greek or languages in which salience is determined by other factors (e.g., information status, as has been argued for German [Strube 1998]), Hobbs’s search procedure would fail, because it is too rigid to accommodate linguistic variation in marking salience.
P98-2204
The Cp(U i ) corresponds to the theme of U i . The rhematic elements of U i are the ones not contained in U i−1 . Although the original motivation for the functional recast of centering was due to German, a free-word-order language, Strube and Hahn (1996) claim that the functional framework is superior because fixedand free-word-order languages can be accounted for using the same principles.
P96-1036
such discourses it seems that a structural account is at play (in the sense of Grosz and Sidner [1986]).
J86-3001
Manipulating the semantics in the second main clause to make resolution to Dodge the most plausible choice does not seem sufficient to warrant felicitous pronominalization, as has been shown experimentally in Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999), demonstrated here in (30).

2. Issues and Insights in Anaphora Resolution 2.1 The BFP Algorithm Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987) were the first to use the centering model as the basis for an anaphora resolution algorithm.
P87-1022
Algorithms for Focus Tracking/Revised Algorithms for Pronoun Resolution Based on previous work (Suri and McCoy 1994), Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro (1999) propose a methodology of extending their Revised Algorithms for Focus Tracking/ Revised Algorithms for Pronoun Resolution (RAFT/RAPR) to handle focusing properties of complex sentences.
J94-2006 J99-2001
The distinction between a Smooth Shift and a Rough Shift is due to Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard (1987), who observed that the centering model generates ambiguity in cases such as (5): (5) a.
P87-1022
Empirical evidence in support of Kameyama’s hypothesis that tensed subordinate clauses should be treated as independent processing units was brought forth by Di Eugenio (1990, 1998), who carried out centering studies in Italian.
C90-2047
Further, Suri, McCoy, and DeCristofaro’s (1999) “SX because SY” construction indicates that the referent appearing in the subordinate clause is not the preferred focus in the subsequent discourse, whereas resolution to the subject of the main SX clause yields the desired interpretation.
J99-2001
Although the S-list has the merit of avoiding ambiguities caused by the way the Cb and the centering transitions interact, it is not capable of handling intrasentential anaphora without any further specifications, as claimed in Strube (1998).
P98-2204
2 First, centering, formulated as a model of the relationship between attentional state and form of referring expressions, was utilized as the basis of an algorithm for binding pronominals on the intersentential level (Brennan, Walker-Friedman, and Pollard 1987).
P87-1022
Centering Strube and Hahn (1996, 1999) elaborate on the nature of the Cf list and propose a centering-based model of anaphora resolution in which the Cf ranking is based not on grammatical function but on functional information status.
J99-3001 P96-1036
As Lappin and Leass (1994) have pointed out, however, the syntactic search procedure seems to work pretty well in English because grammatical order corresponds to phrase order.
J94-4002
326 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 3 2.3 The S-list Algorithm A further modification of the centering model is proposed by Strube (1998), who replaces the functions of the backward-looking center and the centering transitions with the ordering among elements of what he calls the S-list, that is, the list of salient discourse entities.
