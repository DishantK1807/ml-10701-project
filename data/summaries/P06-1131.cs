We handle the issue of frame of reference ambiguity and model the semantics of projective prepostions using the framework developed in (Kelleher et al., 2006).
P06-1094
We use the model of topological proximity developed in (Kelleher et al., 2006) to model all the relations at this level.
P06-1094
An important point in this context is the issue of infinite regression (Dale and Haddock, 1991).
E91-1028
We take R1 as first candidate landmark, and check for topological proximity in the scene as modeled in (Kelleher et al., 2006).
P06-1094
The salience ordering of the landmarks is inspired by (Conklin and McDonald, 1982) who found that the higher the salience of an object the more likely it appears in the description of the scene it was embedded in.
P82-1030
Several GRE algorithms have addressed the issue of generating locative expressions (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Horacek, 1997; Gardent, 2002; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; Varges, 2004).
