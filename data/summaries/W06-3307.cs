To compute the “degree of interaction” between two proteins D4 BD and D4 BE, we use the information-theoretic measure of pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), which is computed based on the following quantities: 1.

Name Annotation and Normalization For the annotation of gene names and their normalization, we use a dictionary-based approach similar to (Cohen, 2005).

It is known that PMI gives undue importance to low frequency events (Dunning, 1993), therefore the evaluation considers only pairs of genes that occur at least 5 times in the whole corpus.

2 Sentence-level relation extraction Most systems that identify relations between entities mentioned in text documents consider only pair of entities that are mentioned in the same sentence (Ray and Craven, 2001; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005).
