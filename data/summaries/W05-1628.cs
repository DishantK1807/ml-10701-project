Accordingly, approaches such as Witbrock and Mittal [1999] and Wan et al.[2003] have investigated models that improve the choice of words in the sentence.
W03-1202
Collins’ distance heuristics [1996] weight the probability of a dependency relation between two words based on the distance between them.
P96-1025
The relationship Depsym(a; b) is modelled using a simpli ed version of Collins’ [1996] dependency model.

Here, we summarise our re-implementation (described in [Wan et al., 2003]) of the Viterbi algorithm for summary sentence generation, as rst introduced by Witbrock and Mittal [1999].
W03-1202
To model the probability of a dependency relation, we use the statistical dependency models inspired by those described in Collins [1996].

In this work, we use the clusters of event related sentences from the Information Fusion work by Barzilay et al.[1999]. The edges between nodes in the HMM are typically weighted using bigram probabilities extracted from a related corpus.
P99-1071
For our evaluation cases, we use the Information Fusion data collected by [Barzilay et al., 1999].

Research in summarisation has also addressed the problem of generating non-verbatim sentences; see [Jing and McKeown, 1999], [Barzilay et al., 1999] and more recently [Daum·e III and Marcu, 2004].
