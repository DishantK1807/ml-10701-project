Incidentally, this is in accordance with a study by (Dagan et al., 1997) who found that it consistently performed better than a number of other popular functions.

There have been a few studies (e.g., Lin, 1998; Ciaramita, 2002; Alfonseca and Manandhar, 2002) where word representations are modified through this or that kind of feature weighting.

algorithms Two classification algorithms were used in the study: k nearest neighbors (kNN) and Na√Øve Bayes, which were previously shown to be quite robust on highly dimensional representations on tasks including word classification (e.g., Ciaramita 2002).
