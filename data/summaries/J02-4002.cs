Klavans and Kan (1998), who use verb clusters for document classification according to genre, observe that verb information is rarely used in current practical natural language applications.

In many genres, paragraphs also have internal structure (Wiebe 1994), with high-level or summarizing sentences occurring more often at the periphery of paragraphs.

For example, Barzilay, McKeown, and Elhadad (1999) introduce the concept of information fusion, which is based on the identification of recurrent descriptions of the same events in news articles.

Like fact extraction methods (e.g., Radev and McKeown 1998), our method also uses a “template” whose slots are being filled during analysis.

of Rhetorical Status The annotation experiment described here (and in Teufel, Carletta, and Moens [1999] in more detail) tests the rhetorical annotation scheme presented in section 2.4. 420 Computational Linguistics Volume 28, Number 4 3.2.1 Rationale and Experimental Design.

We measured associations using the log-likelihood measure (Dunning 1993) for each combination of target category and semantic class by converting each cell of the contingency into a 2×2 contingency table.

First, the experiments in Teufel and Moens (1997) showed that in our corpus only 45% of the abstract sentences appear elsewhere in the body of the document (either as a close variant or in identical form), whereas Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen report a figure of 79%.

421 Teufel and Moens Summarizing Scientific Articles We use the kappa coefficient K (Siegel and Castellan 1988) to measure stability and reproducibility, following Carletta (1996).
J96-2004
Other approaches to the summarization of news articles make use of the typical journalistic writing style, for example, the fact that the most newsworthy information comes first; as a result, the first few sentences of a news article are good candidates for a summary (Brandow, Mitze, and Rau 1995; Lin and Hovy 1997).
A97-1042
Table 10 shows the results in terms of three overall measures: kappa, percentage accuracy, and macro-F (following Lewis [1991]).
H91-1061
Extracts are often useful in an information retrieval environment since they give users an idea as to what the source document is about (Tombros and Sanderson 1998; Mani et al.1999), but they are texts of relatively low quality.
E99-1011 P99-1072
This is not surprising, given that the definition of our task has little to do with the distribution of “content-bearing” words and phrases, much less so than the related task of topic segmentation (Morris and Hirst 1991; Hearst 1997; Choi 2000), or Saggion and Lapalme’s (2000) approach to the summarization of scientific articles, which relies on scientific concepts and their relations.

Because of this, it is generally accepted that some kind of postprocessing should be performed to improve the final result, by shortening, fusing, or otherwise revising the material (Grefenstette 1998; Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999; Jing and McKeown 2000; Barzilay et al.2000; Knight and Marcu 2000).
