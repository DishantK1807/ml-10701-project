Similarly, for some theories of filler-gap dependencies, notably those based on 'slash features' (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag 1985; Pereira 1981), it is possible to use a kind of prediction to constrain the possible occurrences of empty nodes in a wide variety of parsing strategies.

Sponsorship is closely related to lexicalization in TAGs and CFGs (Schabes 1990, 1992; Schabes, AbeillG and Joshi 1988; Schabes and Waters 1993; Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992).

Assuming that indices are just unbound variables (thus coindexing is unification and contraindexing is an inequality constraint), an interesting technical problem arises if the basic parsing engine uses a chart (Kay 1967, 1980).
