The comparative system is the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005).

Since the identified character ratio of the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005) is about 55%, there are still about 15% improving room left.

Since the size of problem space for syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is much less than that of syllable-tocharacter (STC) conversion, the most pinyinbased Chinese input systems (Hsu, 1994; Hsu et al., 1999; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Microsoft Research Center in Beijing; Tsai, 2005) are addressed on STW conversion.

In our previous work (Tsai, 2005), a wordpair (WP) identifier was proposed and shown a simple and effective way to improve Chinese input systems by providing tonal and toneless STW accuracies of 98.5% and 90.7% on the identified poly-syllabic words, respectively.

In (Tsai, 2005), we have shown that the WP identifier can be used to reduce the over weighting and corpus sparseness problems of bigram models and achieve better STW accuracy to improve Chinese input systems.

Conventionally, there are two approaches to resolve the two critical problems: (1) linguistic approach: based on syntax parsing, semantic template matching and contextual information (Hsu, 1994; Fu et al., 1996; Hsu et al., 1999; Kuo, 1995; Tsai and Hsu, 2002); and (2) statistical approach: based on the n-gram models where n is usually 2, i.e. bigram model (Lin and Tsai, 1987; Gu et al., 1991; Fu et al., 1996; Ho et al., 1997; Sproat, 1990; Gao et al., 2002; Lee 2003).

The pinyin syllable-words were translated by phoneme-to-pinyin mappings, such as “ㄩˊ”-to-“ju2.” 2.1 Auto-Generation of WP Database Following (Tsai, 2005), the three steps of autogenerating word-pairs (AUTO-WP) for a given Chinese sentence are as below: (the details of AUTO-WP can be found in (Tsai, 2005)) Step 1.

From the studies (Hsu 1994; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Kee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), the linguistic approach requires considerable effort in designing effective syntax rules, semantic templates or contextual information, thus, it is more user-friendly than the statistical approach on understanding why such a system makes a mistake.

According to (Becker, 1985; Huang, 1985; Gu et al., 1991; Chung, 1993; Kuo, 1995; Fu et al., 1996; Lee et al., 1997; Hsu et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2000; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Lee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), the approaches of Chinese input methods (i.e.

The training/testing corpus, closed/open test sets and system/user WP database used in the following STW experiments are described as below: 844 (1) Training corpus: We used the UDN2001 corpus as our training corpus, which is a collection of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News, 2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002).

This observation is similarly with that of (Tsai, 2005).

In addition, following (Tsai, 2005), an optimized bigram model called BiGram was developed.
I05-3002
This observation is similarly with that of our previous work (Tsai, 2005).
I05-3002
(Note that, as per (Tsai, 2005), the differences between the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of the BiGram and the TriGram are less than 0.3%).

and Future Directions In this paper, we present a word support model (WSM) to improve the WP identifier (Tsai, 2005) and support the Chinese Language Processing on the STW conversion problem.

The UDN2001 corpus is a collection of 4,539624 Chinese sentences extracted from whole 2001 UDN (United Daily News, 2001) Website in Taiwan (Tsai and Hsu, 2002).

We conduct STW experiments to show the tonal and toneless STW accuracies of a commercial input product (Microsoft Input Method Editor 2003, MSIME), and an optimized bigram model, BiGram (Tsai, 2005), can both be improved by our WSM and achieve better STW improvements than that of these systems with the WP identifier.

As per (Chung, 1993; Fong and Chung, 1994; Tsai and Hsu, 2002; Gao et al., 2002; Lee, 2003; Tsai, 2005), homophone selection and syllableword segmentation are two critical problems in developing a Chinese input system.
