Treatments of quantifier scope in Montague grammar (Montague, 1973; Dowty et al., 1981; Cooper, 1983), transformational grammar (Reinhart, 1983; May, 1985; Helm, 1982; Roberts, 1987) and computational linguistics (Hobbs and Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988) have depended implicitly or explicitly on a constraint on possible logical forms to explain why examples 1 such as (1) * A woman who saw every man disliked him are ungrammatical, and why in examples such as (2) Every man saw a friend of his (3) Every admirer of a picture of himself is vain the every.., noun phrase must have wider scope than the a... noun phrase if the pronoun in each example is assumed to be bound by its antecedent.

The resulting system is related to the earlier system of conditional interpretation rules developed by Pollack and Pereira (1988), but avoids that system's use of formal conditions on the order of assumption discharge.

In accounts of scoping possibilities based on quantifier raising or storage (Cooper, 1983; van Eijck, 1985; May, 1985; Hobbs and Shieber, 1987), the free-variable constraint is enforced either by keeping track of the set of free variables FREE(q) in each ralsable (storable) term q and when z E FREE(q) blocking the raising of q from any context Bz.t in which z is bound by some binder B, or by checking after all applications of raising (unstoring) that no variable occurs outside the scope of its binder.
