Levelt, (1983), Nakatani and Hirschberg, (1993)).

Lastly, Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) also used the ATIS corpus, but in this case, focused only on detection, but detection of all three types of repairs.

(Further details of this scheme can be found in (Heeman and Allen, 1994a)).

Good part-of-speech results can be obtained using only the preceding category (Weischedel et al., 1993), which is what we will be using.

Heeman and Allen, 1994b); words 3They referred to modification repairs as nontrivial repairs, and to abridged repairs as trivial repairs; however, these terms are misleading.

The SRI group (Bear et al., 1992) employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs.

Hindle (1983) addressed the problem of correcting selfrepairs by adding rules to a deterministic parser that would remove the necessary text.
P83-1019
Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) investigated using acoustic information to detect the interruption point of speech repairs.
P93-1007
There is typically a correspondence between the removed text and the resumed text, and following Bear, Dowding and Shriberg (1992), we annotate this using the labels m for word matching and r for word replacements (words of the same syntactic category).
P92-1008
Determining the Correction Based on the work done at SRI (Bear, Dowding and Shriberg, 1992), we next looked at the speech repair patterns in our annotated training corpus.

Recently, Dowding et al.(1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the DARPA Airline reservation corpus (Dowding et al., 1993).

Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1993); however, we are restricting ourselves to lexical clues, and so need to be more lenient.
P93-1007
In a test set containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al., 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a recall rate of 62%.

299 Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning to a word the category that is most probable given the sentential context (Church, 1988).

Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg (1992) use the ATIS corpus, which is a collection of queries made to an automated airline reservation system.
P92-1008
Dowding et al.(1993) used a similar setup for their data.

Further details are given in Heeman and Allen (1994c).
H94-1034
The algorithm runs in lockstep with a part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988), which is used for deciding possible word replacements.
