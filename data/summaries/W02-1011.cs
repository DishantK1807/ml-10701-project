We also note that Turney (2002) found movie reviews to be the most 2Indeed, although our choice of title was completely independent of his, our selections were eerily similar.

Entropy Maximum entropy classiflcation (MaxEnt, or ME, for short) is an alternative technique which has proven efiective in a number of natural language processing applications (Berger et al., 1996).

However, feature/class functions are traditionally deflned as binary (Berger et al., 1996); hence, explicitly incorporating frequencies would require difierent functions for each count (or count bin), making training impractical.

Other work explicitly attempts to flnd features indicating that subjective language is being used (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Wiebe et al., 2001).

(Turney (2002) makes a similar point, noting that for reviews, \the whole is not necessarily the sum of the parts").

In terms of relative performance, Naive Bayes tends to do the worst and SVMs tend to do the best, although the 12http://www.english.bham.ac.uk/stafi/oliver/software/tagger/index.htm 13Turney’s (2002) unsupervised algorithm uses bigrams containing an adjective or an adverb.

Some of this work focuses on classifying the semantic orientation of individual words or phrases, using linguistic heuristics or a pre-selected set of seed words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2002).

Since adjectives have been a focus of previous work in sentiment detection (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Turney, 2002)13, we looked at the performance of using adjectives alone.

Turney’s (2002) work on classiflcation of reviews is perhaps the closest to ours.2 He applied a speciflc unsupervised learning technique based on the mutual information between document phrases and the words \excellent" and \poor", where the mutual information is computed using statistics gathered by a search engine.

This would not rule out the possibility that bigram presence is as equally useful a feature as unigram presence; in fact, Pedersen (2001) found that bigrams alone can be efiective features for word sense disambiguation.

Another, more related area of research is that of determining the genre of texts; subjective genres, such as \editorial", are often one of the possible categories (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Finn et al., 2002).
