As in other uses of parallel corpora, good alignment is essential in order for the results to be meaningful (Och and Ney, 2000).

This matching/alignment procedure is different in detail from the preliminary analysis procedure reported in (Reiter and Sripada, 2002b).

and Future Work 6.1 Verb Choice We would like to use our corpus to learn choice rules for verbs which are near-synonyms (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002).

One of the domains SUMTIME is working in is weather forecasts, and in this domain we acquired a corpus of 1119 weather forecasts (for off-shore oil rigs) written by five professional meteorologists (Sripada et al., 2002; Sripada et al., 2003b).

This is broadly similar in concept to the use of parallel multilingual corpora in machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), except that our parallel corpus consists of texts and underlying numeric data, not texts and their translations.

Siskind (2001), in contrast, used data which was explicitly created for his experiments; Barzilay and Lee (2002) used texts which subjects had written for a previous experiment; and Roy (2002) used both data and texts that were created for his experiments.

We have published other papers that have summarised our key findings, notably variation between individuals (Reiter and Sripada, 2002a; Reiter and Sripada, 2002b); and also described the corpus itself (Sripada et al., 2003b).

There is growing interest in trying to learn word meanings from parallel text-data corpora, for example (Siskind, 2001; Barzilay and Lee, 2002; Roy, 2002).

This very small corpus showed that once again there were major differences between individuals (Reiter and Sripada, 2002a), but the corpus is too small to allow meaningful statistical analysis of word meanings.

However, a preliminary analysis has suggested to us that we cannot conduct such an analysis until we remove non-physiological events from the data (Sripada et al., 2003a).

Perhaps in retrospect this should not have been a surprise, because we have also observed changes over time in how people write in a previous project (Reiter et al., 2000).
W00-1429
Clearly we would benefit from better matching and alignment techniques, and we wonder if perhaps some of the alignment techniques used for parallel multi-lingual corpora (Och and Ney, 2000) could be adapted to help align our text-data corpora.
