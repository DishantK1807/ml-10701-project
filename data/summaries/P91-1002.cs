Introduction Our focus in this paper is a stripped-down monotonic inheritance-based knowledge representation system which can be applied directly to provide a clean declarative semantics for Halliday's systemic choice systems (see Winograd 1983, Mellish 1988, Kress 1976) and the inheritance module of head-driven phrase-structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987, Pollard in press).

An example of a systemic choice network in the notation of Mellish (1988), is Figure 4.

Systemic Choice Systems Mellish (1988) showed how the concepts expressible using a systemic choice network such as that found in Figure 4 can be embedded into the lattice of first-order terms with conjunction represented by unification.
