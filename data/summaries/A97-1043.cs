The correct ratio of our WSD was 78.4% (Fukumoto, 1996).

A phrasal lexicon such as Atlantic Seaboard, New England gives a negative influence for keywords retrieval, since it can not be regarded as units, i.e. each word which is the element of a phrasal lexicon is assigned to each semantic code (Fukumoto, 1996).

Major approaches which are based on keyword frequency assume on the fact that the keywords of the article appear frequently in the article, but appear seldom in other articles (Luhn, 1958), (Nagao, 1976), (Salton, 1993), (Zechner, 1996).

We used Watan292 abe's X2 method for term weighting which is shown in formula (1) (Watanabe, 1996).

However, when unrestricted subject matter must be treated, as is often the case in practice, the passage retrieval and text summarisation methods proposed have not proven equal to the need, since deep knowledge of particular subject fields is required (Paice, 1990), (Zechner, 1996).

The results of Key Paragraph Extraction: 3 ---+ 4 --+ 1 ---+ 2 Figure 2: The sample of the article In the field of text summarisation, a vector model was often used for extracting key sentence or key paragraph (Tokunaga, 1994), (Zechner, 1996).

Our disambignation method is based on Niwa's method which uses the similarity between a sentence containing a polysemous noun and a sentence of dictionarydefinition (Niwa, 1994).

In the third experiment, Comparison to Other Related Work, we applied Zechner's key sentences method (Zechner, 1996) to key paragraphs extraction (we call this method_A), and compared it with our method.

Word-sense disambiguation (WSD in short) is a serious problem for NLP, and a variety of approaches have been proposed for solving it (Brown, 1991), (Yarowsky, 1992).
