Semantic affinity is essentially the probability that a phrase extracted by pattern p will be a semantically appropriate filler for role rk, weighted by the log of the frequency.3 Note that it is possible for a 3This formula is very similar to pattern ranking metrics used by previous IE systems (Riloff, 1996; Yangarber et al., 2000), although not for semantics.

Many information extraction (IE) systems rely on rules or patterns to extract words and phrases based on their surrounding context (e.g., (Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000)).

The terrorism scores are competitive with the MUC-4 scores reported by Chieu et al.(2003), although they are not directly comparable because those scores are based on template generation.

and Results 6.1 Data Sets We evaluated the performance of our IE system on two data sets: the MUC-4 terrorism corpus (Sundheim, 1992), and a ProMed disease outbreaks corpus.

Examples of classifier-based IE systems are SRV (Freitag, 1998), HMM approaches (Freitag and McCallum, 2000), ALICE (Chieu et al., 2003), and Relational Markov Networks (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004).

Examples of rule/pattern-based approaches to information extraction are FASTUS (Hobbs et al., 1997), PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993), LIEP (Huffman, 1996), CRYSTAL (Soderland et al., 1995), AutoSlog/AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1993; Riloff, 1996), RAPIER (Califf and Mooney, 1999), WHISK (Soderland, 1999), ExDisco (Yangarber et al., 2000), SNOWBALL (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), (LP)2 (Ciravegna, 2001), subtree patterns (Sudo et al., 2003), predicate-argument rules (Yakushiji et al., 2006) and KnowItAll (Popescu et al., 2004).

In previous work (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2006), we introduced a metric called semantic affinity which was used to automatically assign event roles to extraction patterns.

Classification-based IE systems (e.g., (Freitag, 1998; Freitag and McCallum, 2000; Chieu et al., 2003)) also generally decide whether to extract words based on properties of the words themselves as well as properties associated with their surrounding context.
