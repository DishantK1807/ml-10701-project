Techniques based on machine learning (Zhou et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) are expected to alleviate this problem in manually crafted IE.

Zhao and Grishman (2005) reported that adding local information to deep syntactic information improved IE results.

Zhou et al.(2005) argued that most information useful for IE derived from full parsing was shallow.

However, Table 1 shows that the word distance is long between interacting protein names annotated on the AImed corpus (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004), and we have totreatlong-distancerelationsforinformationlike protein-protein interactions.

This approach is also applicable to IE in other domains, where related entities are in a short 4Considerthecasewhereasourcesentenceforapatternis “ENTITY1 is an important homodimeric protein.” (“homodimeric” represents that two molecules of “ENTITY1” interact with each other.) 291 distance like the work of Zhou et al.(2005). 6 Conclusion We proposed the use of PASs to construct patterns as extraction rules, utilizing their ability to abstract syntactical variants with the same relation.

Work Sudo et al.(2003), Culotta and Sorensen (2004) and Bunescu and Mooney (2005) acquired substructures derived from dependency trees as extraction patterns for IE in general domains.

Parsing 2.1 Necessity for Full Parsing A technique that many previous approaches have used is shallow parsing (Koike et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005).
