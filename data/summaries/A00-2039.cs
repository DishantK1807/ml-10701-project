The 2This can be seen as an application of the ignore operator of Kaplan and Kay (1994), where E* is being ignored.

While it is possible to transfer much of the present proposal to the transducer-based setting that is often preferred nowadays, the monostratal approach still offers an attractive alternative due to its easy blend with monostratal grammars such as HPSG and the good prospects for machine learning of its surfacetrue constraints (Ellison (1992), Belz (1998)).

Using finite-state methods, it has been possible to describe both word formation and the concomitant phonological modifications in many languages, ranging from straightforward concatenative combination (Koskenniemi, 1983) over Semitic-style nonconcatenative intercalation (Beesley (1996), Kiraz (1994)) to circumfixional long-distance dependencies (Beesley, 1998).

As a starting point, I adopt Bird & Ellison (1994)'s One-Level Phonology, a monostratal constraintbased framework where phonological representations, morphemes and generalizations are all finitestate automata (FSAs) and constraint combination is accomplished via automata intersection.
