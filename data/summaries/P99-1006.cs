The semantic contribution of a lexical anchor includes both what it presupposes and what it asserts (Stone and Doran, 1997; Stone, 1998; Stone and Webber, 1998).

Partee (1984), Webber (1988), inter alia) and modality (Stone, 1999).

Thus we take such constructions to be structural as well (Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999).

Moore and Pollack (1992) argue that both informational (semantic) and intentional relations can hold between clauses simultaneously and independently.

First, the approach demands a precise semantics for connectives, as in the work of Grote (1998), Grote et al.(1997), Jayez and Rossari (1998) and Lagerwerf (1998).

In previous papers (Cristea and Webber, 1997; Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999), we have argued for using the more complex structures (elementary trees) of a Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) and its operations (adjoining and substitution) to associate structure and semantics with a sequence of discourse clauses.
