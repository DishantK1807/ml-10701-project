For example, COGEX (Moldovan et al., 2003) uses its logic prover to extract lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers.

Since these candidate answers have day and month in common, an answer such as The ”fˆete de la musique” takes place every June 21st can be proposed (Moriceau, 2005).
