We argue that linguistic knowledge could not only improve results (Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993) but is essential when extracting collocations from certain languages: this knowledge provides other applications (or a lexicon user, respectively) with a ne-grained description of how the extracted collocations are to be used in context.
