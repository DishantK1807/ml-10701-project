In particular, mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990; Wu and Su, 1993) and other statistical methods such as (Smadja, 1993) and frequency-based methods such as (Justeson and Katz, 1993) exclude infrequent phrases because they tend to introduce too much noise.

Termight uses a part of speech tagger (Church, 1988) to identify a list of candidate terms which is then filtered by a manual pass.
A88-1019
Part-ofspeech taggers are used in a few applications, such as speech synthesis (Sproat et al., 1992) and question answering (Kupiec, 1993b).

We have been using the output of word_align, a robust alignment program that proved useful for bilingual concordancing of noisy texts (Dagan et al., 1993).
W93-0301
Algorithms for the more difficult task of word alignment were proposed in (Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993) and were applied for parameter estimation in the IBM statistical machine translation system (Brown et al., 1993).

work and issues for future research Smadja (1992) and van der Eijk (1993) describe term translation methods that use bilingual texts that were aligned at the sentence level.

Word alignment is newer, found only in a few places (Gale and Church, 1991a; Brown et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1993).

The monolingual component of termigM can be used to construct terminology lists in other applications, such as technical writing, book indexing, hypertext linking, natural language interfaces, text categorization and indexing in digital libraries and information retrieval (Salton, 1988; Cherry, 1990; Harding, 1982; Bourigault, 1992; Damerau, 1993), while the bilingual component can be useful for information retrieval in multilingual text collections (Landauer and Littman, 1990).
C92-3150 P88-1025
As has been noticed elsewhere (Bourigault, 1992; Justeson and Katz, 1993), most technical terms can be found by looking for multiword noun phrases that satisfy a rather restricted set of syntactic patterns.

have been used in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), terminology research and translation aids (Isabelle, 1992; Ogden and Gonzales, 1993; van der Eijk, 1993), bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Smadja, 1992), word-sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991b; Gale et al., 1992) and information retrieval in a multilingual environment (Landauer and Littman, 1990).

Some methods use sentence alignment and additional statistics to find candidate translations of terms (Smadja, 1992; van der Eijk, 1993).
J93-1007
The multi-word terms match a small set of syntactic patterns defined by regular expressions and are found by searching a version of the document tagged with parts of speech (Church, 1988).
