When combined with the spoken word being spelled, such keypad ambiguity can be reduced even further (Chung et al., 2003).

We have recently developed the capability to utilize a pronounced version of a word to greatly enhance the accuracy of a letter recognition task, and have successfully integrated this technology into a personal name enrollment task (Seneff et al., 2003; Chung et al., 2003).

If no match is found in either the short list or the external lexicon of known city names, another recognition cycle is initiated, in which the phonetic content of the spoken word is used to enhance the performance of the spelling recognizer, following procedures described in (Chung et al., 2003).

Analysis We have been collecting MERCURY data over the telephone for the past several years (Seneff and Polifroni, 2000), involving user interactions with the system to make flight reservations.

Spoken dialogue systems are emerging as an intuitive interface for providing conversational access to online information sources (Eckert et al., 1997; Gorin et al., 1997; Dahlback et al., 1999; Zue et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2001; Glass and Seneff, 2003; Pieraccini et al., 1997; Quast et al., 2003; J.

In Sections 3 and 4, we describe the error detection and recovery strategies that have been adopted in our MERCURY flight reservation system (Seneff, 2002; Seneff and Polifroni, 2000), and we provide an analysis of the degree to which error recovery was successful, specifically for the case of entering a source or destination city name.
