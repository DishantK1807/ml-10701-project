A proper solution for categorising Primoten is derived from this as well, since the coordinative conjunction i will usually connect the NEs from the same category (Mikheev, 1999).

In such cases all tokens forming an NE and all their combinations are stored in the dynamic lexicon (Mikheev et al.1999:5). In our case it would be also Investicijskokomercijalna, komercijalna banka, Investicijska banka, and also an acronym derived from the first letters of all tokens (IKB).

While the tagging component is similar to other pattern-based IE systems (e.g., Appelt et al.1995; Aone et al.1998, Yangarber and Grishman 1998), our EventTagger is more portable through a lexicon-driven approach.

Given the variety of methods that are available for generating training data efficiently automatically using extant domain resources (Morgan et al., 2004) or semi-automatically (active learning approaches like Shen et al.(2004) or systems using seed rules such as Mikheev et al.(1999)), it would be of interest to have a shared task in which the participants would have access to evaluation data only and they would be invited to use such methods to develop their systems.

Dynamic lexicon are used by a numer of NERC systems such as ones described in (Mikheev et al.1998), (McDonald 1996) and (Piskorski et al.2000). 3.3 Global word sequence checking This strategy is used for solving complex ambiguities (Mikheev, 1999).

Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992) formed a hypothesis that ambiguous words have a strong tendency of keeping a single meaning in the same 13 text/discourse.

The internal and external evidence is being used by all NERC systems such as LTG (Mikheev et al.1999), FASTUS (Hobbs et al.1997), Proteus (Yangarber, Grishman, 1998).

This strategy is used in systems by Mikheev et al.(1999) and Wacholder (1997).
