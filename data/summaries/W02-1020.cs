For one thing, most of the approach described here carries over more or less directly to monolingual text prediction, which is an important tool for the handicapped (Carlberger et al., 1997).

The combined model is shown in (Foster, 2000a) to have significantly lower test corpus perplexity than the linear combination of a trigram and IBM 2 used in the TransType experiments (Langlais et al., 2002).

The test corpus consisted of 5,020 sentence pairs and approximately 100k words in each language; details of the training corpus are given in (Foster, 2000b).
P00-1006 W00-0707
The translation component is an analog of the IBM model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), with parameters that are optimized for use with the trigram.
J93-2003
The top portion corresponds to the MEMD2B maximum entropy model described in (Foster, 2000a); the bottom portion corresponds to the linear combination of a trigram and IBM 2 used in the TransType experiments (Langlais et al., 2002).
P00-1006 W00-0707
It is faster because the search problem for noisychannel models is NP-complete (Knight, 1999), and even the fastest dynamic-programming heuristics used in statistical MT (Niessen et al., 1998; Tillmann and Ney, 2000), are polynomial in Jâ€”for instance O(mJ4V 3) in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).
C00-2123 J99-4005
Our model for p(wjh;s) is a log-linear combination of a trigram language model for p(wjh) and a maximum-entropy translation model for p(wjs), described in (Foster, 2000a; Foster, 2000b).
