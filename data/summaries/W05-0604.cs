The Jensen-Shannon divergence—an average of the divergences of a55 and a56 from their mean distribution— does not share this sensitivity and has previously been used in tests of lexical similarity (Lee, 1999).
P99-1004
This capability may be exploited to generate corpus-based thesauri automatically (Lin, 1998), or used in any other application of text that might benefit from a measure of lexical semantic similarity.
P98-2127
We have restricted our attention to a relatively small space of similarity measures, excluding many previously proposed measures of lexical affinity (but see Weeds, et al (2004), and Lee (1999) for some empirical comparisons).
C04-1146 P99-1004
It has been shown that measures based on the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between question words yield good results on the TOEFL (Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003).
N03-1032
While WordNet has been used before to evaluate corpus-analytic approaches to lexical similarity (Lin, 1998), the metric proposed in that study, while useful for comparative purposes, lacks an intuitive interpretation.
P98-2127
Terra and Clark (2003) report a top score of 81.3% on an 80-word version of the TOEFL, which compares favorably with Ehlert’s best of 82% on a 300word version, but their corpus is approximately 200 times as large as Ehlert’s.
N03-1032
It can be shown that the a48 -divergences (or divergences defined by combinations of them, such as the Jensen-Shannon or “skew” divergences (Lee, 1999)) are the only ones that are robust to redundant contexts (i.e., only divergences in this family are invariant) (Csisz´ar, 1975).
P99-1004
The decision whether or not to observe a particular contextual token is made before counting commences, and is not sensitive to the circumstances of a particular occurrence (e.g., its participation in some syntactic relation (Lin, 1997; Lee, 1999)).
