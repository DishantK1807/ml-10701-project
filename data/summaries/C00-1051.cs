Recently, there have been various attempts to at)ply committee-based techniques to NLP tasks such as POS tagging (Halteren et al., 1998; Brill et al., 1998), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999), word sense disambiguation (Pedersen, 2000), machine translation (lh'ederking and Nirenburg, 1994), and speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997).
