Hindle uses the observed frequencies within a specific syntactic pattern (subject/verb, and verb/object) to derive a cooccu,> rence score which is an estimate of mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1990).

In the past five years, important research on the automatic acquisition of word classes based on lexical distribution has been published (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Grei~nstette, 1994; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).

Itowever, Harris' methodology implies also to simplify and transform each parse tree 2, so as to obtain so-called "elementary sentences" exhibiting the main conceptual classes for the domain (Sager lIa'or instance, Hindle (Hindle, 1990) needs a six million word corpus in order to extract noun similarities from predicate-argunlent structures.

parse trees to classify words 2.1 The need for normalized syntactic contexts As Hindle's work proves it, among others (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Grefenstette, 1994:), the mere existence of robust syntactic parsers makes it possible to parse large corpora in order to automate the discovery of syntactic patterns in the spirit of Harris's distributional hypothesis.

an adequate similarity esfimatation for the building of ontologies The comparison with the similarity score of (Hindle, 1990) shows that SYCLADE similarity indicator is specifically relevant for ontology bootstrap and tuning.

Our approach can be opposed to the a prior one which consists in building simplified representations while parsing (Basili et al., 1994; Metzler and Haas, 1989; Smeaton and Sheridan, 19911).
