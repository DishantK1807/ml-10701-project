Other SMT models assume translation units where the source and target language annotation is based on either contextfree grammar (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2007) or context-free dependency grammar (Quirk et al., 2005; Ding, 2006).

However, many of these models are not applicable to parallel treebanks because they assume translation units where either the source text, the target text or both are represented as word sequences without any syntactic structure (Galley et al., 2004; Marcu et al., 2006; Koehn et al., 2003).

Parallel treebanks are increasingly seen as a valuable resource for many different tasks, including machine translation, word alignment, translation studies and contrastive linguistics ( ˇCmejrek et al., 2004; Cyrus, 2006; Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006).

The requirements are also indirectly satisifed by parallel treebanks with a constituent layer and a word alignment, eg (Han et al., 2002; Cyrus, 2006; Hansen-Schirra et al., 2006; Samuelsson and Volk, 2006), since it is possible to transform constituent structures into dependency structures — a procedure used in the CoNLL shared tasks in 2006 and 2007 (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).

In particular, unlike the essentially context-free translation rules used in frameworks such as (Quirk et al., 2005; Ding, 2006; Chiang, 2007), we will not assume that the words in the translation rules are ordered, and that the translation rules can only be used in a way that leads to projective dependency trees.
