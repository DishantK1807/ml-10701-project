The remaining highly confident name pairs are used to train a letter to letter translation matrix using HMM Viterbi training (Vogel et al., 1996).
C96-2141
A word based approach depends upon traditional statistical machine translation techniques such as IBM Model1 (Brown et al., 1993) and may not always yield satisfactory results due to its inability to handle difficult many-to-many phrase translations.
J93-2003
Al-Onaizan and Knight (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) proposed a spelling-based model which directly maps English letter sequences into Arabic letter sequences.

Based Named Entity Translation For phrase-based NE translation, we used an approach similar to that presented by Tillman (Tillmann, 2003) for block generation with modifications suitable for NE phrase extraction.
W03-1001
The cost function has some similarity with the multi-cost aligning approach introduced by Huang (Huang et al.2003) but it is significantly different.
W03-1502
Huang et al.(Huang et al., 2003) proposed an approach to extract NE trans-lingual equivalences based on the minimization of a linearly combined multi-feature cost.

The reader is referred to (Tillmann, 2003) for detailed description of the algorithm.

of Words Person names 803 1749 Organization names 312 867 Location names 345 614 The BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) with a single reference translation was deployed for evaluation.
P02-1040
We used a dynamic programming beam search decoder similar to the decoder described by Tillman (Tillmann, 2003).
W03-1001
Initially, the corpus is automatically annotated with NE types in the source and target languages using NE identifiers similar to the systems described in (Florian et al., 2004) for NE detection.
