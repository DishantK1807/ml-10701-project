We do not believe that the quality of our tags matches that of the better methods of SchÂ¨utze (1995), much less the recent results of Clark (2000).

Researchers have explored this problem for a variety of reasons: to argue empirically against the poverty of the stimulus (Clark, 2001), to use induction systems as a first stage in constructing large treebanks (van Zaanen, 2000), or to build better language models (Baker, 1979; Chen, 1995).

CDC-40, from (Clark, 2001), reflects training on much more data (12M words).

The conditional model of Klein and Manning (2001b) had the drawback that the variance of final F1, and qualitative grammars found, was fairly high, depending on small differences in first-round random parses.

6EMILE and ABL are lexical systems described in (van Zaanen, 2000; Adriaans and Haas, 1999).

Klein and Manning (2001b) and Clark (2001) take treebank part-of-speech sequences as input.

Clark (2001) finds exactly this effect, and must resort to a filtering heuristic to separate constituent and distituent clusters.

The task of inducing hierarchical syntactic structure from observed yields alone has received a great deal of attention (Carroll and Charniak, 1992; Pereira and Schabes, 1992; Brill, 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994).

10Pereira and Schabes (1992) find otherwise for PCFGs.

To the extent that such approaches work, they work because good local heuristics have been engineered (Klein and Manning, 2001a; Clark, 2001).

In previous work, we presented a conditional model over trees which gave the best published results for unsupervised parsing of the ATIS corpus (Klein and Manning, 2001b).
