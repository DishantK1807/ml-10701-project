Elhadad (1992) draws a similar conclusion (though his list of potentially argumentative relations is somewhat shorter).
C92-2096
The rules of inference are clear candidates for operationalisation: moves such as Modus Ponens are clearly vital components of any argument though, as noted in Grosz and Sidner (1986), p201, it is inappropriate to view the implication step as one of conventional material implication.

The roles of these goals and their interrelationships are explored in relation to the informationintention-attention model of Grosz and Sidner (1986) in more detail in Reed and Long (1997a).
J86-3001
Multiple subarguments conjoined to support a 1091 conclusion are the norm (see for example, Cohen (1987), Reed and Long, 1997b), and these necessarily form parallel structures.
J87-1002
In 1096 related work, this abstract structure is often lost certainly in coherence relation based NLG (such as operational RST), but also in (Elhadad, 1992) (which captures some, but not all of the commonly found argument structures) and in (Maybury, 1993) (which fails to capture the hierarchical nature of argument).
