The preference selection for a single antecedent in (Aone and Bennett, 1995) is based on the maximization of confidence values returned from a pruned decision tree for given anaphor-candidate pairs.
P95-1017
As briefly noted in section 1, the work described in (Conolly et al., 1994) and (Aone and Bennett, 1995) differs from our approach according to the usage of the decision tree in the resolution task.
P95-1017
Whereas knowledge-based systems like (Carbonell and Brown, 1988) and (Rich and LuperFoy, 1988) combining multiple resolution strategies are expensive in the cost of human effort at development time and limited ability to scale to new domains, more recent knowledge-poor approaches like (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996) and (Mitkov, 1998) address the problem without sophisticated linguistic knowledge.

Moreover, clues are used about the grammatical and pragmatic functions of expressions as in (Grosz et al., 1995), (Strube, 1998), "or (Azzam et al., 1998) as well as rule-based empirical approaches like (Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996) or (Murata and Nagao, 1997), to determine the most salient referent.

results reported in (Mitkov, 1998).
P98-2143
Based on discourse markers extracted from lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing, the approach of (Aone and Bennett, 1995) uses 66 unary and binary attributes (lexical, syntactic, semantic, position, matching category, topic) during decision tree training.
