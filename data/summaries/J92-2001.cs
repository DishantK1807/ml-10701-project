Dependency grammar has been applied in the experimental parsing systems of Hellwig (1986), Sigurd (1989), and Covington (1991); in the 'Kielikone' natural language interface of Jappinen, Lassila, and Lahtola (1988); in the machine translation systems of EUROTtLA (Johnson, King, and des Tombe 1985), DLT (Schubert 1987), Charles University (Sgall and Panevov~ 1987), and IBM Tokyo (Maruyama 1990); and in the speech recognition system of Giachin and Rullent (1989).

For example, Gibbon and Reinhard have proposed inheritance-based solutions to problems of phonology and prosody (Gibbon 1990; Reinhard and Gibbon 1991).

According to WG--and more recently Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow (1985) and Flickinger (1987)--all that is needed is default inheritance, which is available (though generally not explicitly recognized) in every linguistic theory; so any theory capable of accommodating exceptional morphology already has the power to deal with subject-inversion, passives and extraction.

Parsers based on the theories of Lexicase (Starosta and Nomura 1986) and Word Grammar (Fraser 1989; Hudson 1989) have also been developed.
