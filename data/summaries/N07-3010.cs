In Biemann (2006b), the tagger output was directly compared to supervised taggers for English, German and Finnish via information-theoretic measures.

An important parallelism between human language and network models is the small world structure of lexical networks both built manually and automatically (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), providing explanation for power-law distributions like Zipfâ€™s law and others, see Biemann (2007).

The system presented in Biemann (2006b) uses CW clustering on graphs constructed by distributional similarity to induce a lexicon of supposedly non-ambiguous words w.r.t.

Clustering this graph with CW and regarding clusters as senses, this method yields comparable results to Bordag (2006), tested using the unsupervised evaluation framework presented there.

In Biemann and Teresniak (2005) and more detailed in Biemann (2006a), the Chinese Whispers (CW) Graph Clustering algorithm is described, which is a randomized algorithm with edge-linear run-time.

More detailed results are reported in Biemann (2006a).
P06-3002 W06-3812
Throughout, the likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) is used as significance measure because of its stable performance in various evaluations, yet many more measures are possible.

The methodology of Dorow and Widdows (2003) was adopted: for the focus word, obtain its graph neighborhood (all vertices that are connected via edges to the focus word vertex and edges between these).

Biemann et al.(2007) report that for standard Named Entity Recognition, Word Sense Disambiguation and Chunking tasks, using unsupervised POS tags as features helps about as much as supervised tagging: Overall, almost no significant differences between results could be observed, supporting the initial claim.

As described by Agirre et al.(2006), better performance can be expected if the WSI component distinguishes between a large number of so-called micro-senses.
