Semantic non-monotonieity A constraint on grammar formalisms that can be dealt with in current generation systems is semantic monotonicity (Shieber, 1988; but cf.

Both entail a variant of the crucial starting-point of the semantic-he~d-driven algorithms described in Calder et al.(1989) and Shieber et al.(1989): if the functor of a semantic representation can be identified, and can be refated to a lexical representation containing syntactic information, it is possible to generate the arguments syntactically.

THE CALCULUS Natural Language Processing as deduction The architectures in this paper resemble the uniform architecture in Shieber (1988) because language processing is viewed as logical deduction, in analysis and generation: "The generation of strings matching some criteria can equally well be thought of as a deductive process, namely a process of constructive proof of the existence of a string that matches the criteria".

Algorithms for tactical generation are becoming an increasingly important subject of research in computational linguistics (Shieber, 1988; Shieber et al., 1989; Calder et al., 1989).

Although attempts to find such architectures (Shieber, 1988) have been termed "looking for the fountain of youth', s it is a stimulating question to what extent it is possible to use the same architecture for both tasks.

Bidirectionality might in the first place be implemented by using one grammar and two separate algorithms for analysis and generation (Jacobs, 1985; Calder et el., 1989).
