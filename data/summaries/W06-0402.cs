If CWC6 CZ BNBV CZA0BD BNCA CZA0BD CX succeeds with CD CZ,then CWC6BNBVBNCACX succeeds with CD BD CJBMBMBMCJCD CZ . 11 2.3 Active Edge Subsumption Revisited So far, this is very similar to the strategy outlined in Penn and Haji-Abdolhosseini (2003).

In the 2 Actually, Penn and Haji-Abdolhosseini (2003) use CanBV and OptBV, which can be defined as BVCPD2BUCE CK CACTD5BUCE.

Johnson (1985), Reape (1991) and others have suggested using bit vectors to index chart edges as an alternative to substring spans in the case of parsing over FWO languages, but that is really only half of the story.

Penn and Haji-Abdolhosseini (2003), we can characterize a search state under these assumptions using one non-terminal, C6,and two subsets/bit vectors, the CanBV and ReqBV.

As outlined in Penn and Haji-Abdolhosseini (2003), the predictive step from a state consisting of CWC6BNBVBNCACX using an immediate dominance rule, C6 BC AX C6 BD BMBMBMC6 CZ, with CZBQBD and no linear precedence constraints transits to a state CWC6 BD BNBVBNAUCX provided that C6 is compatible with C6 BC. In the case of a classical set of atomic non-terminals, compatibility should be interpreted as equality.

While chart parsing can famously be cast as deduction (Pereira and Warren, 1983), what chart parsing really is is an algebraic closure over the rules of a phrase structure grammar, which is most naturally expressed inside a constraint solver such as CHR (Morawietz, 2000).
