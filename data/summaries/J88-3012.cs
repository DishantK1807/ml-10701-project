As opposed to Schuster, who defines a discourse model as "containing representations of entities, along with their properties and relations they participate in", which corresponds exactly to our dialog memory, I use discourse model according to the framework of Grosz and Sidner (1986), where a discourse model is the syntactic structure of a dialog.

On the other hand, the user's utterances can also be analyzed from another viewpoint, namely incorporating them into a coherent discourse model as described by, e.g., Grosz and Sidner (1986).
