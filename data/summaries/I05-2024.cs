Information retrieval (IR) has been studied since an earlier stage [e.g., (Menzel, 1966)] and several kinds of basic retrieval models have been proposed (Salton and Buckley, 1988) and a number of improved IR systems based on these models have been developed by adopting various NLP techniques [e.g., (Evans and Zhai, 1996; Mitra et al., 1997; Mandara, et al., 1998; Murata, et al., 2000)].
