jp Abstract In this paper, we proposed a new diMogue system with multiple dialogue agents.
In our new system, three types of agents: a) domain agents, b) strategy agents, and c) context agents were realized.
They give the follmving advantages to the user: • the domain age.nts make the user aware of the boundary between the domains.
• the strategy agents make the user aware of the difference between the strategies.
• the context agents help the user to deal with multiple goals.
We expect that the complex behaviors of the system will become more visible to the user in different situations.
The experimental results show that the user can retrieve effectively and obtain the expected goals easily by using these multiple agents.
1 Introduction
Recently, research into 'multi-agent systenF is increasing.
The multi-agent systeln is now one of the promising solutions to achieve a complicated system (Maes, 91; Nishida and Takada, 93; Nagao aud Takeuchi, 94).
The multi-agent system which silnulates cooperation between qmman-agents' is realized by an integration of simplified autonomous flmctions.
And ms a result it achieves a complicated system in total.
It also has a latent potential to make a very flexible system.
Thus, we believe that if we introduce the concept of the nmlti-agent system into a dialogue system, we are able to construct a more sophisticated system which is able to treat various linguistic phenomena and to understand or to solw., nmre cmnplicated problems.
Focusing on dialogue systelns, while most current dialogue systems can treat only one domain (a small world for a single service), some research(Goddeau et al., 94; Nalnba et 31., 94) which aims at increasing the domains, what is called a transportable system(Grosz, 83; Paris, 89) are lmW on-going.
Ill such systems, information re.trieval across multil)le domains is realized using the relational databases.
However in our systeln, it is difficult to retrieve information across nmltipie donlains, I)ecause the information is retrieved from CD-ROMs in which a large amount of texts are contained, 1)y using full-text retrieval techniques.
And while there are robust and useful strategies in certain goals, there isn't an all-powerful sterategy which covers all goals.
If a robust strategy in a certain goal is introduced into tile system, the user misunderstands that the system hKs an allpowerful strategy.
Thus, in our system the user sometimes gets into trouble as follows: • the user misunderstands that the information contained across several data sources call be obtained at once.
• the user is confused between a certain retrieval strategy which is robust in a certain goal and another siml)le but rather redmldant strategy.
Furthernmre, it is difficult to manage a discourse involving multiple goals in current diMogue systems.
This is because most current systems aren't robust enough for anaphora and they are able to manage only a single and simple context.
This sometimes causes the following problem: • the user has to manage the nmltiple contexts involving multiple goals, because the system only ma.nages a single context.
And ithis makes it hard for the user to use the system.
As the result, the user also gets lost in the system.
In this paper, we focus on how to make the user aware of what the system Call or cannot do.
Thus, we propose a nev¢ dialogue system with multiple agents, in which we introduce the concept of multi-agent system into our dialogue system.
Ill our system, three types of dialogue agents are re~ alized: 1) for each domain, 2) for each strategy and 3) for each context.
These agents take turns and play their roles according to the discourse situations.
With these agents, our system will haw; the following characteristics: • the domain agents mM~e the user aware of the 1)oundary between unintegrated domains.
• the strategy agents make the user aware of the difference, between the don lain oriented strategies.
400 • the context agents make it ea.sy for the user to deal with tit(; coml)licatcd discourse involving multiple goals.
In this pal)er, we first Cxl)lain our l)aseline spoken dialogue systeln TARSAN which deM with multiple domains.
Secondly, we describe the problems which arise when wc extend the system into multiple domains.
After that, we propose a new dialogue systeln with nmltiple diMogue agents.
We,also describe the results of the examinations on the l)rOl)OSC(l system.
Finally, we conclude the pal)cr.
2 The
baseline system: TARSAN We have been constructing a spoken diah)gue system which retrieves inforlnatlon froln a large anlount of texts contained ill CD-ROMs, named TARSAN(Sakai et al., 94; Sakai et al., 95).
Figure 1 shows the contiguration of the baseline syso tern TARSAN for multiple domains.

multiple domains TARSAN retrieves the information using the folh)wing processes: 1.
Tile inlmt analyzer analyzes the result of the speech recognition or the sentence re(:eived frOlll keyboard.
2. The intention extractor extracts the user's intcntion (i.e.
question, answer, (:ondition (:hange, and so on) 1)ased on the analysis of the modality.
3. The uttera.nce l)air controller deals with not only a silnl)le pair of QA I)ut also deals with tollow-u 1) questions bused on utteran(:e lmir controlling.
4. The retrieval (:ondition maker makes retrieval conditions which is sent to the fnll text retrieval 1)rocess by.
the dialogue controller de.scribed below.
The retrieval conditions are created 1)y refl'xring the 'text-models', which define the relation betwcell the inlmt words and the retrieval conditions.
5. The 1)araphr~user translates various CXl)ressions of the inputs into a single donlain oriented con(:el)t.
6. The diah)gue controller dctcrlnines the system's l)ehavior (to retrieve and to answer the result, or to request lnorc rctricvM conditions to the user) by referring the retrieval conditions and the diMogue strategy.
7. The outlmt generator generates the output sentence, to be announ(:ed by the text-tospeech 1)rocess and the information to be dis1)layed on the monitor.
Our current system TARSAN is able to access the folh)wing four CD-ROMs: CD-ROMI: sight-seeing infl)rmation in Japan (i.e.
name, locat.ion, explanation, and so on of temples, hot springs, golf courses, and so on)(Kosaido, 90).
CD-ROM2: hotel inforlnation in Japan (i.e.
name, telel)hone number, room charges, equip,nent, and so on)(JTB, 92).
CD-ROM3: Japanese and foreign cinema information(i.e, tith', cast, director, story, and so,,n)(PIA, 90).
CD-ROM4: Jalmnese professional baseball player information(i.e, name, belonging team, records, and so on)(NMfigai, 90).
TARSAN treats cD-ROM1 and 2 as a single travel domain, CD-R,OM3 as a cinema domain, and CD-ROM4 as a baseball domain.
3 ProMems
As we described ill the introduction, we have addressed three main l)robh'ms ill our (liMogue.
systenl.
Two problmns derive froln the e×tension of the system to multil)h', domains.
And the last Olle derives from the single path contextual managelllellt, 1.
The first problem is that the user nfisunderstands that the information contained across several data sources call be obtaincd by a siltgle input sentence.
The fl)llowing are exam1)les of requests ac(:ross domains: The first e.xample is contained in the cinema (lomain and in the travel domain, and the second examl)le is contailmd ill the b~Lseball dolnmn and in the cinema domain.
l'\]xamph~ l: " tStm, ag,..ch, i MoTnoe.
ga.sh..uen sita ciga no b'utai "hi natta onacv, wo,shiritai".
(i want to know tim hot sl)ring which is th(~ scene of the cinema whose s|,ar is Ymnaguchi Momoe).
Example 2: "Puro yakyu.u acn.shu dat~.a haiywlt fla ah'u,t,vu, en sita eiga wo o,shiete".
(Tell m(" the cilteln;t whore ;nl actor who was a profestdonM 1)~usel)all player performs).
401 Figure 2: Three types of agents 2.
The second problem is that the user nfisunderstands that the system h~ an Ml-powcrfifi strategy, if it has a robust strategy for a certain purpose.
Suppose that several discourse strategies exist in a single dialogue agent: one is a very sophisticated but very goal specific strategy which allows the user to reach the goal immediately, and another is a very simple but redundant strategy which has the ability to achieve any kind of goal.
In this case, the user may conflme the potential of these strategies and feel uncomfortable about the gap.
3. The last problem is that the user has to manage multiple contexts concerning to multiple goals, because the system isn't enough robust for anaphora and only manages a single context.
And this makes it hard for the user to use the system.
Table 1 is an example that the user compares the information between Hakone and Nikko 1.
The example shows that the user ha.s managed the context himself, which seems very complicated.
We have,also assmncd that these three problems arise because the system only has a single diMogue agent.
A single dialogue agent usually deals with everything and this makes the user invisible what the system can or cannot do.
Thus, we propose a new diMogue system with multiple agents which make the system's ability more visible to the user.
4 Dialogue
system with multiple dialogue agents In this section, we introduce a new dialogue system with multiple, dialogue agents.
The purpose is to make the user aware of what the system can or cannot do.
In our system, three types of dialogue agents are realized: 1) for each donaain, 2) for each strategy and 3) for the each context.
Here, we call these agents as 1) domain agents, 2) strategy agents, 3) context agents, respectively.
Figure 2 shows a brief sketch of these three types of agents.
These agents take turns and play their 1 They are famous sight-seeing places in Japan.
Table 1: An example that the user manage the multil)le-goals by oneself 'usrl: Hakonc ni aru onscn wo oshiete.
(Tell me the hot springs in Hakone Town).
sysl: 16 ken arimasu.
(There are 16 hot springs).
usr2: Nikko deha.
(How about in Nikko)? sys2: Chuuzenji onsen, Nikko yumoto onsen ga arimasu.
(There are Chuuzenji onsen and Nikko yumoto onsen).
usr3: Hakone niha jiin ga arimasuka.
(Are there any temples in Hakone)? sys3: Amida dera, Kuduryu Myojin, Saunji nado 7 ken arimasu.
(There are 7 temples; Amida dera, Kuduryu Myojin, Saunji, and so on).
usr4: Nikko niha.
(How about in Nikko)? sys4: Nikko Toshoguu ga arimasu.
(There is Nikko Toshoguu).
usr5: Sono setsumci wo kikitai.
(Please explain it).
sys5: Tokugawa Ieyasu no rei wo matsuru ....
(The soul of Tokugawa Ieyasu is worshipped.
)... roles according to the discourse situations.
The details of these agents are as follows.
4.1 The
domain agents To solve the first problem, we realized domain agents which perform information retrieval ill each different domain.
Figure 3 shows a brief sketch of the domain agents.
The domain agents perform the basic interaction between the user and the system to retrieve the information in the basic manner specific to each domain.
In every domain agent, indispensable and basic conditions for information rctrievM are defined.
Using these conditions, the domain agent communicates with the user and performs the information retrievM.
And when the user's input 1-noves from one domain to another domain, the domain agent will also change.
Thus with the domain agents, the user is made aware of the boundary between the domains.
We expect this mechanisnl to prevent the user from asking the question across uninte402 User Agents Figure 3: The donmin agents / User Agents Figure 4: The strategy agents Table 2: An examl)le of two agents try to make an action llsr: C.agt: T.agt: " Yamnguchi Momoc ga shuen,sita ciga no butai ni natta onsen we ~qhiritai".

(There are 13 cinemas: Izu no Odoriko, Slmnkinsho, and so on) "Joukcn ni gaitou,~uru onscn ha arima.~en".
(There is no hot spring satisfying the condition).
grated multiple domains.
For exmnl)le, in the case of the example 1 in section 3, two agents dealing with the <:inema domain and the travel domain try to make each action as Table 2 shows 2.
Thus the, user will be aware of the boundary between the two domains.
4.2 The
strategy agents To solve the second probleln, we reMized the strategy agents which 1)crforins informatioll retrieval according to each specific strategy for the information retrieval.
Figure 4 shows a brief sketch of the strategy agents.
The strategy agents handle the interaction between the user and the system to retrieve the information in the manner specific to each task.
In every strategy agent, task specific conditions for tim information retriewd are defined.
Using the task specifc conditions, the strategy agent is al)le to use the default condition specific to the task and is able to give advice or t<> give choices to the user.
Thus with the strategy agents, the user is made aware of the strategy which is specific to the task an<l this mechanism prcvcnts the user using the task specific strategy for other tasks.
In the current system, there are two strategy agents for the travel dmnain: 2Travel agent is able to retrive and find "the hot spring which is the scene of Izu no odoriko".
business trip strategy agent: indispensable c<mdition for the inlmt is the destination, and the optional con<liti<)ns are the room charge and the circumstances.
When the optional con<litions arc not defined by the user, the strategy agent will rex:olmncnd some choices to the user.
The default responses arc the name of the hotel and its telephone number in this task.
recreation strategy agent: indisl)ensablc condition for the input is the recreation equipment and the number of participants and the other conditions are optional.
When the optional conditions are not defined by the user, the strategy agent will recommend some choices to the user.
The default responses are also the name of the hotel and its telephone lmnJ)er in this task.
These strategy agents not Olfly allow the user to use the system easily 1)ut ~dso hell> the user to 1)e aware of the <:haraeteristies of the diah)gue strategy specific to the task.
Table 3 ct)mpares the difference between using the domain agent for travel and the business trip strategy agent.
As you can see from the table, more frielldly discourse is achieved when using the strategy agent.
4.3 The
context agents To solve the last l)rol)lem, we realized the context agents which perform the information retrieval dclmndent ill different contexts.
The context agent is defined when the user n mves from one context to another.
Figure 5 shows a brief sketch of the context agents.
Using the context agents the user can easily compare the re, sults relating to lnultiplc goals.
Table 4 is the dialogue which aims at the same goal ~us table \] by using multil)le contex:t agents.
As you can see from the table 1 and 4, more sim1)lified discourse: is achieved when using context agents.

5 Examinations
In this section, we described the examinations of the prol)osed system.
In order to examine the effectiveness of the multiple dialogue agent system (new system), we compare it with the single dialogue agent system (old system).
Here the single dialogue agent is the domain agent for the travel domain.
We evaluated the system by counting the nun> ber of the interactions between the user and the system (Tnrns), the number of inl)ut characters of the users (Characters), and session time (Seconds) that subjects took to reach the same goal with new system and the old one.
Eight sul)jects examined these systems.
They are all typists, but novices with diah)gue systems.
They were given a brief explanation of both systems and practiced on them for about quarter an hour each.
We divide User Agents Figure 5: The context agents Table 4: The dialogue using two context agents (to ttakone agent and Nikko agent) usrl: Onsen wo sMritai.

N.agt3: Tokugawa Ieyasu no rei wo matsuru ....
(The soul of Tokugawa Ieyasu is worshipped ....
) tile subjects into two groups.
Group 1 examined new system first and old one next, and group 2 did old system first and new one next.
5.1 Examination
1 The following goal is given to every subject: Goal 1: You will go to Kurashiki City on business.
Find a suitable hotel a.
(You may select different hotels with each system).
The relevant agent in the new system is the business trip agent.
Table 5 shows the results (averages of Turns, Characters, and Seconds) of examination 1.
These results show not only that both groups needed less diMogue using new systeln than using old system, but also that group 1 needed less dialogue, especially less session time (360:640), when they used old system than group 2.
This aThere are 41 hotels in Kurasldki City.
404 nmans that the user is Mile to learn how to use the old (strategy-less) systenl by using new system with a typical strategy.
~rc also lnenti}m that all six subjects who selected different hotels were happy about the hotel using the new system.

Colnl)are them using some retrieved inlbrlmtti<)n, and seh'ct one.
The relevant agents in the new systeln arc Kanazawa agent and Scndai agent.
Tal)le 6 is the results of examination 2.
These results show an interesting phenomenon that in the ca.se of the dialogue comparing multiple goals with these Colnplicared processes, the user tends to stop comparing by session time (from five nfinutes to ten minites) in favour of the obtained retrieval results.
And thc new system is able~ to obtain more ret:riewd results than thc old system.
Thus the new system is better than the old system in the case of dealing with multil)le goals.

In our new system, three types of agents were realized.
They were' a) domain agents, b) stratcgy agents, and e) context agents.
These agents give the fl)lh)wing advantages to the user: * the domain agcnts prevent the user fi'om asking the questions across unintegrated domains.
. the strategy agents make the user aware of the difference between the domain oriented strategies.
• the context agents make it e~Lsy for the user to deal with the complicated discourse inw)lving multiple goals.
Using these agents, we exl)ect the user to nnderstand what the system can or eanlmt do.
The experilnental resnlts show that the user can retrieve effectively and obtain the expected goals easily by using these multiple agents.
