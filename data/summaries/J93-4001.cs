It is also possible to process constituents in a head-driven order (Kay 1989) or to utilize an opportunistic islands-of-certainty heuristic (Stock, Falcone, and Insinnamo 1988).

It also avoids the objections that Wittenburg and Barnett (1988) raise to a canonical representation for PP attachment, such as always attaching low.

In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention devoted to this problem, and a number of different techniques have been advanced to reduce the amount of copying (Karttunen 1986; Wroblewski 1987; Godden 1990; Tomabechi 1991).

This is in agreement with Nagata 1992's finding that a medium-grain phrase structure grammar performs better than either a coarse-grain or fine-grain grammar.

Kasper observed that separating constraints into disjunctive and nondisjunctive parts and processing the nondisjunctive constraints first can improve performance when the nondisjunctive constraints are unsatisfiable (Kasper 1987).

There are also several disjunctive unification algorithms that exploit independence, such as constraint unification (Hasida 1986; Nakano 1991), contexted unification (Maxwell and Kaplan 1989), and unification based on disjunctive feature logic (D6rre and Eisele 1990).
C86-1018 P91-1040
There are, of course, other popular parsers, such as the generalized LR(k) parser (Tomita 1986); however, in the worst case these are known not to be polynomial (Johnson 1989) unless a chartlike mechanism is added (Schabes 1991), and so they raise no new interface issues.

The grammar for PPs in English is well known to be exponentially ambiguous (Church and Patil 1982).

Nagata (1992) reports similar results with early and late unification.

There have been several successful efforts in recent years to develop solution algorithms for Boolean combinations of functional constraints that are polynomial for certain special, perhaps typical, cases (Kasper 1987; Maxwell and Kaplan 1989; D6rre and Eisele 1990; Nakano 1991).

It is interesting to compare this technique to the restriction proposal in Shieber (1985).
P85-1018
In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research devoted to the development of unification algorithms that perform well when confronted with disjunctive constraint systems (Hasida 1986; Maxwell and Kaplan 1989; D6rre and Eisele 1990; Nakano 1991).

This approach produces an effect similar to Bear and Hobbs (1988), only without requiring special mechanisms.
