(McShane et al., 2005; Poesio and Artstein, 2005) (the ninth and tenth papers) both pertain to issues about improving the annotation process.

(McShane et al., 2005) discusses the issue of human-aided annotation (human correction of a machine-generated analysis) as it pertains to a single-integrated annotation scheme, similar in many ways to Pie in the Sky, although it has been in existence for a lot longer.

(Pustejovsky et al., 2005) describes issues that arise for merging argument structures for verbs, nouns and discourse connectives, as well as time and anaphora representations.

Pie in the Sky can be viewed as a framework for unifying these annotation schemata into a single representation (a Uni ed Linguistic Annotation framework in the sense of (Pustejovsky et al., 2005)).

While an underlying all-inclusive theory could be a useful roadmap, unifying the results of several annotation efforts (and resolving inconsistencies) may yield the same result (as suggested in (Pustejovsky et al., 2005)) while maintaining the advantages of investigating the phenomena separately.

3 What’s in the Latest Pie in the Sky Analysis As of this writing, the latest Pie in the Sky analysis includes: (1) argument structure of all parts of speech (verbs, nouns, adjectives, determiners, conjunctions, etc.) using the PropBank/NomBank/Discourse Treebank argument labels (ARG0, ARG1, ARG2, a0a1a0a2a0 ), reminiscent of Relational Grammar of the 1970s and 1980s (Perlmutter, 1984), (2) some more speci cally labeled FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) roles for these same constituents; (3) morphological and part of speech features; (4) pointers to gazetteers, both real and hypothetical (thanks to B.

In fact, with help from the authors of (Calhoun et al., 2005), I did incorporate their analysis into the latest version (number 6) of the Pie in the Sky annotation.

The 5th through 7th papers (Inui and Okumura, 2005; Calhoun et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005) investigate some additional types of annotation that were not part of the distributed version of Pie in the Sky, but which could be added in principle.

(Poesio and Artstein, 2005) discusses some better ways of assessing interannotator agreement, particularly when there is a gray area between correct and incorrect annotation.

Naumann, 2005; Bies et al., 2005; Dinesh et al., 2005) all discuss some aspect of merging annotation.
