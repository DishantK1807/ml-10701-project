Abstract 
We present two approaches for syntactic and se
mantic transfer based on LFG f-structures and 
compare the results with existing co-description 
and restriction operator based approaches, fo
cusing on aspects of ambiguity preserving trans
fer, complex cases of syntactic structural mis
matches as well as on modularity and reusabil
ity. The two transfer approaches are interfaced 
with an existing, implemented transfer con> 
ponent (Verbmobil), by translating f-structures 
into a term language, and by interfacing f
structure representations with an existing se
mantic based transfer at)proach, respectively. 
1 Introduction

Target and source levels of representation in 
transfer-based machine translation (MT) are 
subject to often comt)eting demands: on the one 
hand, they need to abstract away fl'om partic
ulars of language specific surface realization to 
ensure that transfer is as simple and straightfor
ward as possible. On the other hand, they need 
to encode sufficiently fine-grained information to 
steer transfer. Furthermore, target and source 
representations should be linguistically well es
tablished and motivated levels of representa
tion. Finally, h'om a computational perspective 
they need to be sensible representations for both 
parsing and generation. LFG Lstructures are 
abstract, "high-lever' syntactic representations 
which go some way towards meeting these of
ten irreconcilable requirements.

Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework of 
the Verbinobil project under grant 01 IV 701 Na. 
Correspondence-based transfer on f-structures 
has been proposed in (Kaplan et al., 1989). 
A closer look at translation problems involv
ing structural mismatches between languages 
in particular head switching phenomena (Sadler 
and Thompson, 1991) led to the contention 
that transfer is facilitated at the level of seman
tic representation, where structm'al differences 
between languages are often neutralized. Struc
tural misalignment is treated in semantics con
struction involving a restriction operator (Ka
plan and Wcdekind, 1993) where f-structures are 
related to (possibly sets of) disambiguated se
mantic representations. 
Given the high potential of semantic ambigui
ties, the advantage of defining transfer on se
mantic representations could well be counter
balanced by the overhead generated by nmlti
ple disambiguated structures as input to trans
fer. This and the observation that many seman
tic (and syntactic) ambiguities can be preserved 
when translating into a target language that is 
ambiguous in similar ways, sheds light on the 
issue of the properties of reI)resentations for tim 
task of defining transfer. 
In principle, the problem of semantic mnbi
guity in transfer can be tackled in a number 
of ways. Packed ambiguity representation tech
niques (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993) could be 
integrated with the approach in (Kat)lan and 
Wedekind, 1993). In the linear logic based se
mantics of (Dalrymple et al., 1996) scope am
biguities are accounted for in terms of alterna
tive derivations of meaning assignments from 
a set of meaning constructors. Ambiguity pre
serving semantic transfer can be devised on 
sets of meaning constructors rather than dis
ambiguated meanings (Genabith et al., 1998). 
Transfer on packed representations is considered 
341 
in (Emele and Dorna, 1998). 
In the present paper we consider alternative ap
proaches to transfer on underspeeified syntac
tic or semantic representations, focusing on is
sues of modularity, reusability and practicality, 
interfacing existing implemented approaches in 
a flexible way. At the same time, the propos
als readdress the issue of what is an appropriate 
level of representation for translation, in view of 
the known problems engendered by structural 
mismatches and semantic ambiguity. 
We first show how the underlying machinery 
of the semantic-based transfer approach de
veloped in Dorna and Emele (1996b) can be 
ported to syntactic f-structure representations. 
Second, we show how the underspecified seman
tic interpretation approach developed in Gen
abith and Crouch (1997) can be exploited to in
terface f-structure representations directly with 
the named semantic-based transfer approach. 
Third, we compare the two approaches with 
each other, and with co-description and restric
tion operator based approaches. 
2 Syntactic
Transfer 
This section presents a simple bidirectional 
translation between LFG f-structures and term 
representations which serve as input to and 
output of a transfer component developed 
within the Verbmobil project (Dorna and Emele, 
1996a). The term representation is inspired by 
earlier work (Kay et al., 1994; Caspari and 
Sehmid, 1994) which uses terms as a quasi
semantic representation for transfer and gener
ation. 
The translation between f-structures and terms 
is based on the correspondence between directed 
graphs representing f-structures and the func
tional interpretation of these graphs (cf. (John
son, 1991)). Given an arc labeled f which con
nects two nodes nl and n2 in a graph, the same 
can be expressed by a function f(nl) = n2. An 
f-structure is the set of such feature equations 
describing the associated graph. Instead of fea
ture equations f(nt) = n2 we use the relational 
notation f(nl, n2). 
Using this idea f-structures can be converted 
into sets of terms and vice versa. 1 F-structure 
1For motivation why we prefer term representations 
PRED features and their "semantic form" values 
are given special treatment. Instead of introduc
ing PRED terms we build unary relations with 
the semantic form predicate name as flmctor 
(see Example (1)). The resulting representation 
is similar to a Neo-Davidsonian style event se
mantics (Parsons, 1991) but uses syntactic roles. 
For a formalization of the f-structure-term cor
respondence see Appendix A.

b. Hans kocht gerne 
C. { kochen(nl), 
SUBJ(nl,n2), Hans(n2), 
ADJN(nl,n3), gerne(n3) } 
Consider the simple head switching example in
volving the German attitude adverb gerne and 
the English verb like (see (lb) and (3b)). (la) 
is the LFG f-structure for the German sen
tence (lb). 2 (lc) is the set of terms representing 
(la). 
Transfer works on source language (SL) and tar
get language (TL) sets of terms representing 
predicates, roles, etc. like the ones shown in (lc). 
The mapping is encoded in transfer rules as in 
(2). For a rule to be applied, the set on the SL 
side must be a matching subset of the SL inl}ut 
set. If this is the case, we remove the covering 
set from the input and add the set on the other 
side of the rule to the TL output. Transfer is 
complete, if the SL set is empty.

d. { ADJN(E,X),gerne(X) } # { SUBJ(E,Y) } 
<-> { Iike(X),XCOMP(X,E),SUBJ(X,Y) }. 
The transfer operator <-> is bidirectional. Up
per case letters in argmnent positions are logical 
variables which will be bound to nodes at run
time. Because of the variable sharings oil both 
sides of a rule we work on the same nodes of a 
graph. The result is a graph rewriting process.

Dorna, 1998). 
2For presentational purposes we leave out morpho
syntactic information in f-structures here and in the fol
lowing examples. 
342 
The head switching rule (2d) shows two compo
nents on its lefthand side: the part to the right 
of # is a test on a copy of the original input. The 
test binds the variable Y at runtime when ap
plying the rule from left to right. In the reverse 
direction (and in general), TL tests are ignored. 
Applying the rule set in (2) to (lc), we get 
(3c). We now use the correspondence between f
structures and term representations to construct 
the TL f-structure. The result is (3a) represent
ing the English sentence (3b).

3 Semantic
Transfer 
Semantic-based transfer as detailed in (Dorna 
and Emele, 1996a; Dorna and Emele, 1996b) 
is based on rewriting underspecified semantic 
representations. The representations (Boset 
al., 1996) are UDRS variants (Reyle, 1993). 
F-structures are abstract syntactic representa
tions. They do, however, encode basic predicate
argument relations, and this is essentially se
mantic information. It turns out that there 
are important structural similarities between 
f-structures and UDRSs: f-structures can be 
"read" as UDRSs and hence be assigned an 
underspecified truth-conditional interpretation 
(Genabith and Crouch, 1997). a Appendix B 
gives a relational formulation of the corre
spondence between f-structures and UDRSs. 
The UDRS representations are processed by 
semantic-based transfer. The resulting system is 
bi-directional. Consider again the simple head 
switching case discussed in (1) and (3) above. 
(4) shows the corresponding UDRSs. 
The structural nfismatch between the two f
structures has disappeared on the level of UDRS 
representations and transfer is facilitated. 4

4 Embedded
Head Switching and 
Multiple Adjuncts 
How do the two approaches fare with embed
ded head switching and multiple adjuncts? Due 
to space limits we will not discuss straightfor
ward eases where ambiguites represented in un
derspecified representations are carried over into 
the target language. Examples of this type in
volve quantificational and plural NPs, negation, 
or adjunct sets. Instead, we concentrate on com
plex cases where a source language ambiguity 
needs to be resolved in target language. 
4.1 Embedded
Head-Switching 
The syntactic transfer rules (2) are supple
mented by (5). The complex rule for gcrne in 
(5) overrides 5 (2d) and the COMP rule in (5). For 
each additional level of embedding triggered by 
head switching adjuncts a special rule is needed. 
(5) { vermuten(E) } <-> { suspect(E) }. 
{ Ede(X) } <-> { Ede(X) }. 
{ COMP(E,X) } <-> { COMP(E,X) }. 
{ gerne(X),ADJN(E,X),COMP(EI,E) } # 
{ SUBJ(E,Y) } <-> 
{ like(X) ,XCOMP(X,E) ,SUBJ(X,Y) ,COMP(EI,X) }. 
By contrast, on the level of UDRSs head switch
ing has disappeared and transfer is facilitated. 
Figure 1 shows the transfer correspondence be
tween terms and UDRSs. 
coding of predicate argument relations is used. The sub
ject of the target like relation is determined by the fol
lowing transfer rule: 
{ L:gerne(L1) } # { L2 _< L1, L2:agent(R) } 
<-> { L:like(A,L1) }. 
is the transitive closure over subordination con
straints <. Here and in the following we do not give set 
representations of UDRSs and transfer rules. Instead, we 
provide a gral)hical representations of standard UDRSs 
to better illustrate the structural mismatches discussion.

The corresponding term representation is (7b) 
and, in the absence of fllrther constraints, we get 
a flat scopally underspecified UDRS (7c). Let 
(6a) be our translation candidate. For syntactic 
transfer, adding rules (9) to the ones introduced 
in (2) leads to (Sa).

(Sa) corresponds to only one of the En
glish translations, namely (6d), of (6a). 'As 
in the correspondence-based approach (Ka
plan et al., 1989), ofl, en can only be assigned 
wide scope over like if the transfer formal
ism allows reference to and rewriting of par
tial nodes. In tile present case the two terms 
kochen(nl), SUBJ(nl,n2) could then be rewrit
ten as the complement of like, XCOMP(n4,nl), 
whereas hDJN(nl,n3) is rewritten as ADJN(n4,n3) 
or hDJN(nl,n3).6 
The target f-structure for English must resolve 
the relative scope between like and often ((8b) 
and (10)).

However, (11) is not in the direct f-structure 
UDRS correspondence with (10) and (8b). In
stead, the correspondences on the enmneratioils 
of the seeping possibilities of (11) yield (10) and 
(Sb) as required. 
By contrast, the reading of (6t)) is restricted by 
the surface order in which tile two adverbials 
occur. On the semantic level this is reflected 
in terms of corresponding subordination con
straints (12). The target UDRS corresponds to 
f-structure (8b). 
6As an alternative, we can get both readings if 
we define special rules for adverbials in head switch
ing contexts, giving them wide or narrow scope rel
ative to the head switching adverbial. A narrow 
scope rule is already given in (9). A wide scope 
rule would be {ADJN(E,X)} # {HS(EI), XCOMP(EI,E)} 
{ADJN(EI,X)} where HS(E1) is a "marker" on the 
switched adverbial's node El. 
(12) 
In LFG linearization effects can be captured m 
terms of f-precedence constraints -~f as in (13). 
Semantic subordination and f-precedence con
straints can then be linked as in (14). 
(14) \[i\] -Q \[\] ~ c, l\[\] < lml 
With (14) the head switching -multiple adjunct 
interaction is correctly resolved in semantic
based transfer. Similarly, in syntactic transfer, 
the precedence constraint (13) can be used to 
steer translation to f-structure (81)). 
5 Discussion

We have presented two alternative architectures 
for transfer in LFG. In both cases, transfer is 
driven by the transfer module developed and 
implemented by Dorna and Emele (1996a). In 
the case of syntactic transfer, transfer is de
fined oil term representations of f-structm'es. In 
the case of semantic transfer, transfer is de
fined oil UDRS translations of f-structures. F
structure, term and UDRS correspondences are 
defined in the Appendix. The transfer rules are 
bi-directional, as are the f-structure-term and 
f-structure-UDRS correspondences. 
Co-description based approaches (Kaplan and 
Wedckind, 1993) require annotation of source 
and target lexica and grammars. By contrast, 
both approaches presented here support mod
ular grammar development: they don't involve 
additional coding in the grammar specifications. 
An important issue, noted above, is the problem 
of ambiguities and ambiguity preserving trans
fer. F-structures and UDRSs are underspecified 
syntactic and semantic representations, respec
tively. Both support ambiguity preserving trans
fer to differing degrees (NP scope, operators, 
adjuncts). F-structure based syntactic represen
345 
tations may come up against structural mis
matches in transfer. The original co-description 
based approach in (Kaplan et al., 1989) faced 
problems when it came to examples involving 
embedded head-switching and multiple adjuncts 
(Sadler and Thompson, 1991), which led to the 
introduction of a restriction operator, to en
able transfer on partial f-structures or semantic 
structures (Kaplan and Wedekind, 1993). One 
might suppose that the need to refer to partial 
structures is an artifact of the correspondence
based approach, which doesn't allow the map
ping from a single node of the source f-structure 
to distinct nodes in the target f-structure with
out violation of the functional property of the 
T correspondence. On closer inspection, though, 
the rewriting approach to syntactic f-structure
term translations presented above suffers from 
the very same problems that were met by the 
correspondence-based approach in (Kaplan et 
al., 1989). 
By contrast, transfer on the semantic UDRS 
representations does not suffer from such prob
lems. Head switching is dealt with in the con
struction of semantic representations. Under
specified semantic representations in the form of 
UDRSs (or related formalisms) offer the follow
ing advantanges for transfer: they abstract away 
from cross-language configurational variation to 
facilitate transfer. Unlike tile original restric
tion operator approach (Kaplan and Wedekind, 
1993) whenever possible they avoid the detour 
of multiple transfer on disambiguated represen
tations. At the stone time they provide a flexible 
encoding of information essential to steer trans
fer. 
Of course, semantics does not come for free nor 
does it always blend as seamlessly with syntac
tic representations as one would hope for. Se
mantics has to be encoded in the grammar or 
defined in terms of correspondences as below. 
System design has to address the question where 
to do what at which cost. Semantic representa
tions pay off when they are useful for a num
ber of tasks: evaluation (as against a database), 
inference and transfer. Even more so when ex
isting resources can be interfaced qua semantic 
representations: in our case the tested transfer 
methodology and resources developed in (Dorna 
and Emele, 1996a).
