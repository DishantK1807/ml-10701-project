See Eisner and Satta (1999) for discussion and an algorithm with time and space requirements proportional to the fourth power of the length of the input sentence in the worst case.
P99-1059
In our implementation (which is based on Schmid (2000a)), we use a cutoff of 0.1, and print only indices a76 where a79 a23 a76 a27 is above the cutoff.
C00-2105
The LoPar parser (Schmid, 2000a) on which our implementation of the governor algorithm is based represents the parse forest as a graph with at most binary branching structure.
C00-2105
Estimated frequency computations in parse forests have previously been applied to tagging and chunking (Schulte im Walde and Schmid, 2000).
