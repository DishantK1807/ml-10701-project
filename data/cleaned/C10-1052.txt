Abstract 
It has ben recognized for quite some 
time that sustainable data formats play 
an important role in the development 
and curation of linguistic resources. 
The purpose of this paper is to show 
how GermaNet, the German version of 
the Princeton WordNet, can be con-
verted to the Lexical Markup Frame-
work (LMF), a published ISO standard 
(ISO-24613) for encoding lexical re-
sources. The conversion builds on 
Wordnet-LMF, which has ben pro-
posed in the context of the EU 
KYOTO project as an LMF format for 
wordnets. The present paper proposes a 
number of crucial modifications and a 
set of extensions to Wordnet-LMF that 
are neded for conversion of wordnets 
in general and for conversion of Ger-
maNet in particular. 
1 Introduction

It has ben recognized for quite some time that 
sustainable data formats play an important role 
in the development and curation of linguistic 
resources. As witnesed by the suces of the 
guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative
1
 
(TEI) and of published standards isued by the 
International Standards Organization
2
 (ISO), 
markup languages such as XML
3
 (short for: 
Extensible Markup Language) have become 
lingua francas for encoding linguistic resources 
of diferent types, including phonetic transcrip-

tions, (anotated) text corpora, and dictionar-
ies. It is fair to say that it has become comon 
practice among developers of new linguistic 
resources to consult TEI guidelines and ISO 
standards in order to develop standard-
conformant encoding schemes that serve as an 
interchange format and that can be docu-
mented and validated by Document Type 
Definitions (DTD) and XML schemata. 
However, for resources that were developed 
prior to or largely in paralel with the emerging 
aceptance of markup languages and of emerg-
ing encoding standards, the situation is far 
more heterogeneous. A wide variety of legacy 
formats exists, many of which have persisted 
due to existing user comunities and the 
availability of tols that can proces only such 
idiosyncratic formats. The development of 
wordnets for a large number of languages is a 
typical example of a type of linguistic re-
source, where legacy formats stil persist as a 
de facto standard. WordNet 1.6 is encoded in 
the data format of lexicographer files
4
 that was 
designed for the English Princeton WordNet 
(Felbaum, 198). It is a plain-text format for 
storing wordnet data and alows lexicographers 
to encode lexical and conceptual relations 
among lexical units and synsets by use of spe-
cial-purpose diacritics. There exist numerous 
tols that can proces WordNet 1.6 lexicogra-
pher files to extract relevant information or to 
transform the data into other special-purpose 
formats such as Prolog-fact databases. Even 
tough stil widely used for the reasons just 
mentioned, the complexity of the format itself 
has a number of undesirable consequences. As 
Henrich and Hinrichs (2010) have pointed out,

the editing of lexicographer files is highly er-
ror-prone and time-consuming in actual lexi-
cographic development. Moreover, format 
validation of the data as wel as development 
of new tols for data visualization and data 
extraction become increasingly dificult since 
they canot be based on generic state-of-the-
art tols, that are, for example, available for 
XML-based encodings. 
For exactly these reasons, XML-based inter-
change formats have ben proposed in recent 
years also for wordnets. One of the first, if not 
the first, example is the XML format for Ger-
maNet
5, a wordnet for German (Lemnitzer and 
Kunze, 202; Henrich and Hinrichs, 2010). An 
even more recent development along these 
lines is the specification of Wordnet-LMF (se 
Soria et al., 209), an instantiation of the Lexi-
cal Markup Framework
6
 (LMF, (Francopoulo 
et al., 206) customized for wordnets. 
Since LMF is an ISO standard (ISO-24613), 
it is a particularly atractive candidate for en-
coding wordnets. Everything else being equal, 
ISO standards have a high chance of being 
adopted by a wide user comunity and of be-
ing recognized as an interchange format.
7
 Such 
agred-upon interchange formats are a crucial 
prerequisite for interoperable linguistic re-
sources in the context of web services and of 
procesing pipelines for linguistic resources. 
The purpose of this paper is threfold: 
1. To compare and contrast the GermaNet 
XML initialy proposed by Lemnitzer 
and Kunze (202) with the Wordnet-
LMF. This comparison is instructive 
since it reveals two completely difer-
ent conceptions of representing seman-
tic knowledge at the lexical level. 
2. To point out a number of open isues 
that ned to be resolved if Wordnet-
LMF is to be adopted widely among

 An anonymous reviewer raised the question why OWL 
is not a god candidate for encoding wordnets. On this 
isue, we agre with the asesment of Soria et al. (209) 
who point out that “[…] RDF and OWL are conceptual 
repositories representation formats that are not designed 
to represent polysemy and store linguistic properties of 
words and word meanings.”

number of languages. 
3. To show how these open isues can be 
resolved in a customized version of 
Wordnet-LMF suitable for GermaNet. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as 
folows: section 2 provides a general introduc-
tion to GermaNet. Details about the adapted 
XML format used for GermaNet up until now 
are provided in section 3. Section 4 introduces 
the chalenge of how to represent a wordnet in 
the Lexical Markup Framework. As one posi-
bility, Wordnet-LMF is regarded. Isues that 
arise during the conversion of GermaNet into 
Wordnet-LMF lead to a modified version of 
ordnet-LF. Finaly, section 5 concludes 
with a comparison of the two representation 
formats. 
2 GermaNet

GermaNet is a lexical semantic network that is 
modeled after the Princeton WordNet for Eng-
lish. It partitions the lexical space into a set of 
concepts that are interlinked by semantic rela-
tions. A semantic concept is modeled by a syn-
set. A synset is a set of words (caled lexical 
units) where al the words are taken to have 
(almost) the same meaning. Thus a synset is a 
set-representation of the semantic relation of 
synonymy, which means that it consists of a 
list of lexical units and a paraphrase (repre-
sented as a string). The lexical units in turn 
have frames (which specify the syntactic va-
lence of the lexical unit) and examples. The list 
of lexical units for a synset is never empty, but 
any of the other properties may be. 
There are two types of semantic relations in 
GermaNet: conceptual and lexical relations. 
Conceptual relations hold betwen two seman-
tic concepts, i.e. synsets. They include rela-
tions such as hyperonymy, part-whole rela-
tions, entailment, or causation. Lexical rela-
tions hold betwen two individual lexical units. 
Antonymy, a pair of oposites, is an example 
of a lexical relation. 
GermaNet covers the thre word categories 
of adjectives, nouns, and verbs, each of which 
is hierarchicaly structured in terms of the hy-
peronymy relation of synsets.

3 Current
GermaNet XML Format 
The structure of the XML files closely folows 
the internal structure of GermaNet, which 
means that the file structure mirors the under-
lying relational organization of the data. There 
are two DTDs that jointly describe the XML-
encoded GermaNet. One DTD represents al 
synsets with their lexical units and their atrib-
utes (se subsection 3.1). The other DTD rep-
resents al relations, both conceptual and lexi-
cal relations (se subsection 3.2). 
The GermaNet XML format was initialy 
developed by Kunze and Lemnitzer (202), but 
modifications of the GermaNet data itself led 
to an adopted XML format, which is presented 
here.

3.1 XML
Synset Files 
The XML files that represent al synsets and 
lexical units of GermaNet are organized 
around the thre word categories curently in-
cluded in GermaNet: nouns, adjectives, and 
verbs (altogether 54 synset files since the se-
mantic space for each word category is divided 
into a number of semantic subfields). 
The structure of each of these files is illus-
trated in Figure 1
9
. Each synset represents a set 
of lexical units (lexUnits) which al expres the 
same meaning. This grouping represents the 
                                                
8
 The interested reader might compare the version at hand 
with (Lemnitzer and Kunze, 202) or (Kunze and Lem-
nitzer, 202), which both describe the initial GermaNet 
XML version.

simplicity. 
semantic relation of synonymy. Further prop-
erties of a synset (e.g., the word category or a 
describing paraphrase) and a lexical unit (e.g., 
a sense number or the orthographical form 
(orthForm) are encoded apropriately. 
Figure 1 describes the underlying XML 
structure. Each box in the figure stands for an 
element in the XML files, and the properties in 
each box (listed underneath the wavy line) rep-
resent the atributes of an XML element. This 
means, for example, that a synset element has 
the atributes of an id and a category.
10
 
Figure 2 shows an example of a synset with 
two lexical units (lexUnit elements) and a 
paraphrase. The lexUnit elements in turn con-
tain several atributes and an orthographical 
form (the orthForm element), e.g., leuchten 
(German verb for: to shine). The first of the 
two lexical units even has a frame and an ex-
ample. 
 
<synset id="s58377" category="verben"> 
  <lexUnit id="l82207" 
           sense="1" 
           namedEntity="no" 
           artificial="no"

3.2 XML
Relation File 
This type of XML file represents both kinds of 
relations: conceptual and lexical relations. Al 
relations are encoded within one XML file, 
whose structure is ilustrated in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. Structure of the XML relation file. 
 
The boxes in Figure 3 again represent XML 
elements, which means that there is one rela-
tions element that contains al lexical relations 
(lex_rel elements) and conceptual relations 
(con_rel elements). Both relation types contain 
several atributes. 
Figure 4 ilustrates an example for each of 
the two relation types. The type of the concep-
tual relation is hyperonymy (indicated by the 
name atribute), and it holds betwen the syn-
set with ID s5837 (from atribute) and the 
synset with ID s58376 (to atribute). The lexi-
cal relation is of type antonymy (again indi-
cated by the name atribute), and holds be-
twen the lexical units with the IDs l2471 
(from atribute) and l12470 (to atribute). 
<con_rel name="hyperonymy" 
         from="s58377" to="s58376" 
         dir="revert" inv="hyponymy" /> 
<lex_rel name="antonymy" 
         from="l2471" to="l2470" 
         dir="both" />

4 Wordnet-LMF 
The Lexical Markup Framework (ISO-24613) 
is an ISO standard for encoding natural lan-
guage procesing lexicons and machine read-
able dictionaries (Francopoulo et al., 206). 
The intention of LMF is to provide a comon 
model for the creation and use of lexical re-
sources, to manage the exchange of data be-
twen and among these resources, and to en-
able the merging of a large number of individ-
ual electronic resources to form extensive 
global electronic resources. 
4.1 The
Chalenge 
The core structure of LMF is based on the pro-
totypical structuring of a lexicon in terms of 
lexical entries, each of which enumerates the 
diferent senses of the lexical item in question. 
This word-driven perspective contrasts the 
synset-driven relational structure of wordnets – 
the grouping of word senses (i.e., lexical units) 
that expres the same meaning into synsets. 
Exactly these two radicaly diferent organiz-
ing principles (relation-based in the case of 
wordnets versus lexical-entry-based in the case 
of LMF) constitute the chalenge of encoding 
wordnets in LMF. We take up this chalenge: 
How can a synset-based wordnet, e.g. Ger-
maNet, be represented in a word-driven format 
like LMF? 
4.2 Aply
LMF to Wordnets 
The conversion of GermaNet to LMF wil 
build on Wordnet-LMF (Soria et al., 209; Le 
et al., 209), an existing Lexical Markup 
Framework subset
11
. Wordnet-LMF has ben 
developed in the context of the EU KYOTO
                                                
11
 Wordnet-LMF is a proper subset of LMF since there 
are specifications in LMF that are not in Wordnet-LMF 
and since there is nothing in Wordnet-LMF which is not 
in LMF. Soria et al. (209) themselves refer to Wordnet-
LF as an LMF dialect.

 and is especialy tailored to encode 
wordnets in the LMF standard. 
Wordnet-LMF is specified by a Document 
Type Definition (se Apendix E in (Soria and 
Monachini, 208) and fuly complies with 
standard LMF. 
The Wordnet-LMF XML structure is shown 
in Figure 5
13
. There is a Lexical Resource 
which contains at least one Lexicon (in this 
case a wordnet lexicon).
14
 A Lexical Entry rep-
resents a word entry in a Lexicon, where the 
word itself is represented by the writenForm 
atribute of the Lema element. Lexical En-
tries group diferent Senses of a particular 
word. The Senses have a synset atribute that 
relates them to a Synset element by the core-
sponding ID. If two Senses have the same syn-
set atribute, they belong to the same Synset 
and are thus synonyms. 
A Synset can have several relations to other 
Synsets. These relations are encoded in Syn-
setRelation elements.

 Note that this figure does not show the whole Wordnet-
LMF model. Only the monolingual part that is relevant 
for this paper is represented. The representation of multi-
lingual resources (i.e., the optional SenseAxis element 
with its children) is not considered in this paper. For a 
complete picture, se Soria et Monachini (208).

 Here, XML element or atribute names again apear 
italic if they are referenced in the text. 
4.3 Aply
Wordnet-LMF to GermaNet 
The diferences betwen the synset-driven 
structure of GermaNet (se Figures 1 and 3) 
and the word-driven format of Wordnet-LMF 
(se Figure 5) are obvious. But there is also a 
strong comonality: Both formats have synset 
elements that cluster synonymous words. In 
GermaNet, the words are represented by lexi-
cal units that are child elements of a synset. In 
Wordnet-LMF, senses, which corespond to 
the lexical units in GermaNet, are linked to a 
synset (by an atribute containing a synset ID). 
The conversion of GermaNet to Wordnet-
LMF proceds as folows: Each lexical unit of 
GermaNet is turned into a Sense element in 
Wordnet-LMF (se Figure 5). The synset at-
tribute (containing a Synset ID) of the Sense 
element links this Sense with the Synset that it 
is a member of. The diferent Sense elements 
are grouped by their orthographical form (the 
Lema in Wordnet-LMF) into Lexical Entries. 
An example of a GermaNet LexicalEntry in 
Wordnet-LMF is shown in Figure 6. This 
LexicalEntry represents the word leuchten 
(German verb for: to shine), as the writen-
Form atribute of the Lema element indi-
cates. This LexicalEntry has two Senses, which 
belong to diferent Synsets (se the diferent 
synset atributes of the Sense elements). 
460
Each Sense has a MonolingualExternalRefs 
element with at least one MonolingualExter-
nalRef representing a reference to an external 
system. In this case, each Sense is linked to the 
coresponding entry in the GermaNet data-
base
15
; the externalReference atribute of a 
MonolingualExternalRef specifies the database 
table name with a database ID. 
 
<LexicalEntry id="deu-52-l4601-v"> 
  <Lemma writtenForm="leuchten" 
                       partOfSpeech="v" /> 
  <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_1" 
                 synset="deu-52-s58377-v"> 
    <MonolingualExternalRefs> 
      <MonolingualExternalRef 
        externalSystem="GermaNet-Database" 
        externalReference= 
               "lex_uni_table#id=82207" /> 
    </MonolingualExternalRefs> 
 </Sense> 
  <Sense id="deu-52-l4601-v_2" 
                 synset="deu-52-s58718-v"> 
    <MonolingualExternalRefs> 
      <MonolingualExternalRef 
        externalSystem="GermaNet-Database" 
        externalReference= 
               "lex_uni_table#id=82677" /> 
    </MonolingualExternalRefs> 
  </Sense> 
</LexicalEntry> 
Figure 6. Example of a LexicalEntry. 
 
In the next conversion step, al synsets of Ger-
maNet are listed with their relations to other 
synsets. The coresponding Synset (with the ID 
deu-52-s5837-v) of the first Sense in Figure 6 
is ilustrated in Figure 7. It has, inter alia, a 
describing glos and two example sentences. 
The element SynsetRelations encodes rela-
tions to other Synset instances. The relations 
are simply encoded with a target atribute that 
contains the ID of the referencing Synset. The 
Synsets in Wordnet-LMF are logicaly the 
“same” as the synsets in GermaNet XML, i.e. 
the concept that a synset expreses is exactly 
the same in both formats. 
Each Synset has a reference to the Ger-
maNet database. Therefore, the Monolin-
gualExternalRef element links to the core-
sponding entry in the GermaNet database; the

 For eficency reasons, GermaNet is stored in a 
relational database. 
externalReference atribute specifies the data-
base table name with the synsets database ID.

4.4 Necesary
Modifications to Wordnet-
LMF 
As the previous discusion has shown, Word-
net-LMF provides a very useful basis for con-
verting GermaNet into LMF. However, a 
number of modifications to Wordnet-LMF are 
neded if this conversion is to preserve al in-
formation present in the original resource. The 
present section wil discus a number of modi-
fications to Wordnet-LMF that are neded for 
conversion of wordnets in general. In adition, 
we wil also discus a set of extensions to 
Wordnet-LMF that are neded for conversion 
of GermaNet in particular. 
The most glaring omision in Wordnet-LMF 
concerns the modeling of lexical relations 
which hold betwen lexical units (i.e., Senses 
in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF). In the 
curent Wordnet-LMF DTD only conceptual 
relations (i.e., SynsetRelations in the terminol-
ogy of Wordnet-LMF), which hold betwen 
synsets, are modeled. Thus antonymy, which is 
a typical example of a lexical relation (se 
(Felbaum, 198) for further details), can cur-
461
rently not be modeled without violating the 
Wordnet-LMF DTD. 
Among the synset relations specified in 
Wordnet-LMF, the entailment relation is miss-
ing, which plays a crucial role in the modeling 
of verbs in the Princeton WordNet and in 
GermaNet alike. The list of values of atribute 
relType for SynsetRelation elements (se Ap-
pendix A in (Soria and Monachini, 208)) 
therefore has to be amended acordingly.
16
 
A third omision in the curent Wordnet-
LMF DTD concerns syntactic frames used in 
the Princeton WordNet to indicate the syntac-
tic valence of a given word sense. Syntactic 
frames are also used in GermaNet, albeit using 
a diferent encoding
17
. Syntactic frames to-
gether with example sentences, which ilustrate 
the meaning and prototypical usage of a par-
ticular word, help to distinguish among word 
senses. 
In WordNet both syntactic frames and ex-
amples are linked to synsets. However, at least 
in the case of syntactic frames the linkage to 
synsets sems problematic since diferent 
members of the same synset may wel have 
diferent valence frames. For example, the 
German verbs finden and begegnen both mean 
met and thus belong to the same synset. Both 
are transitive verbs, but their object NPs have 
diferent cases: acusative case for trefen and 
dative case for begegnen. As this example 
shows, syntactic frames ned to be asociated 
with lexical units rather than synsets. This is 
exactly the design choice made in GermaNet, 
as shown in Figure 1. 
A related question concerns the anchoring of 
example sentences which ilustrate the mean-
ings and prototypical usage of a particular 
word sense. In both the Princeton WordNet 
and GermaNet such examples are asociated
                                                
16
 Piek Vosen (personal comunication) has pointed out 
to us that Wordnet-LMF does not impose a list of rela-
tions as a standard yet. 
17
 In WordNet, frames are encoded in a controled lan-
guage using paraphrases such as Somebody ----s some-
thing for a transitive verb with an animate subject and an 
inanimate object. The frames in GermaNet use comple-
mentation codes provided with the German version of the 
CELEX Lexical Database (Bayen et al., 205) such as 
N.AN for transitive verbs with acusative objects. 
with lexical units
18
. GermaNet corelates ex-
amples aditionaly with particular syntactic 
frames and treats both examples and syntactic 
frames as properties of lexical units, i.e. Senses 
in the terminology of Wordnet-LMF. 
The above isues lead to a modified version 
of the Wordnet-LMF DTD as shown in Figure 
8. Compared to Figure 5, the Sense element is 
enriched by thre optional subelements: Sen-
seRelations, SenseExamples, and Subcategori-
zationFrames. 
It has to be noted, though, that LMF proper 
contains al necesary elements. The thre no-
tions SenseRelation, SenseExample, and Sub-
categorizationFrame come from LMF proper 
and these elements can be used to remedy the 
omisions in Wordnet-LMF. 
The SenseRelation element in Figure 8 rep-
resents relations betwen diferent Senses (the 
lexical units in GermaNet). The SenseExam-
ples and SubcategorizationFrames elements 
both group several SenseExample or Subcate-
gorizationFrame instances. A Subcategoriza-
tionFrame element represents the syntactic 
valence of a word sense. A SenseExample 
shows the prototypical usage of a word sense 
as an example sentence. The syntactic valence 
for a concrete example sentence can be speci-
fied with the optional frame atribute of a Sen-
seExample. 
5 Conclusion: Comparing GermaNet 
XML with Wordnet-LMF XML 
We would like to conclude with a comparison 
betwen the GermaNet native XML format 
described in section 3 and the modified Word-
net-LMF format described in section 4.4. Since 
the GermaNet native XML format was particu-
larly tailored to the structure of GermaNet, it 
enjoys the usual advantages of such custom-
ized solutions: it contains al and only the nec-
esary XML elements and atributes to de-
scribe the resource. Moreover, the data are dis-
tributed over 5 diferent XML files, which 
facilitates easy data handling and eficient 
search by word clases and lexical fields. 
These properties are in fact exploited by a 
number of GermaNet-specific tols, including

 In WordNet, the examples are placed at the synset 
level, but referencing to a word sense at the same time.

a GermaNet-Explorer, a tol for data explora-
tion and retrieval, and a GermaNet Pathfinder, 
a tol for the calculation of semantic related-
nes, similarity, and distance (Cramer and 
Finthamer, 208). Al of these tols utilize 
the Java API that has ben developed for the 
GermaNet native XML format. 
At the same time the GermaNet native XML 
format is a proprietary data format that was 
developed at a time when the only de facto 
encoding standard for wordnets consisted of 
the lexicographer files, originaly developed 
for the Princeton WordNet. As such GermaNet 
XML was never developed with the goal of 
providing an XML standard for modeling 
wordnets in general. With Wordnet-LMF a 
candidate standard has now ben proposed that 
is compliant with the LMF ISO standard for 
lexical resources and that strives to provide a 
general encoding standard of wordnets for dif-
ferent languages. As the discusion in section 
4.4 has shown, the curent Wordnet-LMF DTD 
stil neds to be amended to acount for the 
ful range of wordnet relations, frames, and 
examples (se Figure 8). These elements are 
not in Wordnet-LMF because Wordnet-LMF is 
a subset, but these elements are defined in the 
ISO document 24613 where LMF proper is 
defined. However, Wordnet-LF apears to 
be suitably mature to serve as an interchange 
format for wordnets of diferent languages as 
wel as for linking wordnets of diferent lan-
guages with one another
