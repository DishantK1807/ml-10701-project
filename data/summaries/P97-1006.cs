In order to address this difficulty, (Guthrie, Walker, and Guthrie, 1994) have proposed using distributions based on what we refer to as hard 1A related issue is the retrieval, from a data base, of documents which are relevant to a given query (pseudodocument) (e.g.,(Deerwester et al., 1990; Fuhr, 1989; Robertson and Jones, 1976; Salton and McGill, 1983; Wong and Yao, 1989)).

(Jelinek and Mercer, 1980; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993)), this is the first work, to the best of knowledge, that uses it in the context of document classification.

2We borrow from (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993) the terms hard clustering and soft clustering, which were used there in a different task.

HCM cMculates the likelihood values 3We calculate the probabilities here by using the socalled expected likelihood estimator (Gale and Church, 1990): .f(kjlc, ) + 0.5, P(k3lc~) = f-~--~-~ x m (4) where f(kjlci ) is the frequency of the cluster kj in ci, f(ci) is the total frequency of clusters in cl, and m is the total number of clusters.

This is the data.sparseness problem that so often stands in the way of reliable statistical language processing (e.g.(Gale and Church, 1990)).

Method based on hard clustering In order to address the above difficulty, Guthrie et.al, have proposed a method based on hard clustering of words (Guthrie, Walker, and Guthrie, 1994) (hereafter we will refer to this method as HCM).
