Among others we can mention eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002) or acquired from British National Corpus (BNC) (McCarthy, 2001), largescale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or acquired from the BNC (Cuadros et al., 2005).

First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Linguistic research has documented a wide range of regularities across the sound systems of the world?s languages (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986; de Boer, 2000; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b).

Syntactic lexicons have been derived from other resources ??the LinGO ERG lexicon (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000) contains entries extracted from ComLex (Grishman et al., 1994), and Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) acquire a CCG lexicon from the Penn Treebank.

TSWEB2: Inspired by the work of (Leacock et al., 1998), these Topic Signatures were constructed using monosemous relatives from WordNet (synonyms, hypernyms, direct and indirect hyponyms, and siblings), querying Google and retrieving up to one thousand snippets per query (that is, a word sense), extracting the words with distinctive frequency using TFIDF.

Functional phonologists argue that such regularities are the consequences of certain general principles like maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972), which is desirable between the phonemes of a language for proper perception of each individual phoneme in a noisy environment, ease of articulation (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; de Boer, 2000), which requires that the sound systems of all languages are formed of certain universal (and highly frequent) sounds, and ease of learnability (de Boer, 2000), which is required so that a speaker can learn the sounds of a language with minimum effort.

Work HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006) and WordNet provide domain information for Chinese and English, but there has been no domain resource for Japanese that are publicly available.8 Domain dictionary construction methods that have been developed so far are all based on highly structured lexical resources like LDOCE or WordNet (Guthrie et al., 1991; Agirre et al., 2001) and hence not applicable to languages for which such highly structured lexical resources are not available.
