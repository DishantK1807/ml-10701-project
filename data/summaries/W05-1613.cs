Recent work has formalised NLG algorithms for referring expression generation in terms of algorithms for finding an appropriate subgraph of a graph representing the domain knowledge [Krahmer et al., 2003].

This is also related to the “problem of logical form equivalence” [Shieber, 1993] which arises because from a domain point of view two logically equivalent formulae are interchangeable and so it is a matter of chance which of the many logically equivalent formulae is given to a realiser.

In NLG, the process of building such complex sentences is known as “aggregation” [Shaw, 1995].

It was argued that a more opportunistic approach to content determination was needed for this sort of application [Mellish et al., 1998].
