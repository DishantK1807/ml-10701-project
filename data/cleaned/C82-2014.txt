"YREB" ORDER LANGUAGES: AN EXPERZM~NTAL LEXICON BASED PARS~ Cristlano Castelfranoni, Domenico Parisi, 01ivtero Stock Zstituto di Pstoologia, Oonsiglio Nazionale delle Rioex~he Via dei Monti Tiburtini, 509, O0157-Roma Most of the work on natural language understanding (NLU) has been done on English.
E~ish is a language with relatively rigid word order, a characteristic that has influenced all NLU systems proposed so far.
These systems have dedicated only minor attention to problems that are of major importance in lemguagee with a freer ordering like Italian.
Work on parsing partially un~ram~atioal sentences in rigid l~s (Hayes and Mo~radtan, 1980l Charniak, 1981) bears some similarity to work on p~rsing of "free" order language.
Tn both oases an exclusively top-down model seems inappropriate.
For instance, when considering an incomplete sentence it may still be advis.
able to proceed in building some representation.
The resulttng structure will then be inserted within a larger oo~xitive structure.
The sane bottom-up way of proceed£ng must necessarily be part of an NLU eyste~ for "free" order languages.
An ATN (Woods, 1970) type systaw, like the one developed for Ztalian (Cappelli etal., 1978), shows definite l~nitations even when it is furnished with heuristics for strate~ selection (Ferrari and 8took, 1980) based on adaptation to a coherent text.
Other ideas such as passing infox~nation in the case of failure (Weisohedel and Black, 1980) or relaxing conditions on aras in certain oirotvastances (Kwasny and Sondheimet, 1979) do not seem to be satisfying solutions for our px~bl~.
65 In other hand, we do not agree that syntax be given a subordinate role, as Schank's theoretical approach implies (though in Schank and Riesbeck's parser, ELI (Riesbeck and Schank, 1978), syntax has a more important role than would be expected).
In any event, without enough syntax it becomes hard to analyze complex sentences and to explain a number of psycholinguistic phenomena.
2. WEDNESDAY, the system proposed here, is the core of an extended mechanism we are developing and implementing in LISP (flg.1) (see Pariei and Castelfranchi, in press).
It is an analyzer with semantic output based on word interpretation.
The semantic information brought in by each word is progressively connected to get at the sentence's meaning according to syntactic constraints and expectations.
Syntax is a set of instructions directly concerned with assembling semantic units.

1 What
is characteristic of WEDNESDAY is that syntax is not a separate component, but is distributed throughout the lexicon.
Lexical entries are composed of a declarative part and a procedural part.
The procedural part is made up of syntactic instructions designed to assemble the declarative (semantic) part of the entry with the declarative parts of the other words in the sentence.
The syntactic assembling process 66 allows the construction of the sentence's semantic network to be carried out progressively and so it can also operate on incomplete sentences.
Furthermore, the system's output has a format which is homogenous to that of the knowledge base (encyclopedia).
This means that as the sentence analysis proceeds, it is natural to have the knowledge base controlling the assembly process top-down, in cooperation with the lexioal-syntactic analysis.
Clauses in multl-clause sentences are conceived as restricted search spaces for the assembly instruc~ tions carried by the words, and the same is true for noun spaces (noun phrases).
Part-of-speech word categories are interpreted as procedures for opening and closing spaces as a function of context.
Therefore, part of the process is dependent on a recursive (push-down storage) mechanism.
On the other hand there is a semantic sentence memory that is transparent to the closed-level system.
Being lexically based, WEDNESDAY can deal in a natural way with idiosyncrasies typical of many words.
It can also deal with flexible idioms, i.e. idioms that can vary in morphology, word order, syntactic construction, semantic additions, and synonyms.
Their reoo~ition is governed by the individual lexical entries and takes place at +.he assembling level.
Word disambiguation is treated in a non-deterministic way.
Syntactically based disambiguation (e.g.
the word J~) attempts each reading of an ambiguous word in turn and cancels inappropriate readings by testing them against syntactic wellformednese criteria.
Encyclopaedia based disembiguation (e.g.
the word b_~) works through the activation of encyclopaedic nodes by the words in the sentence.
It selects that reading of an ambiguous word which activates the node "better" connected to the other activated nodes.
It should be noted that, our approach, in comparison to Small°s work on Word Expert Parsing (Small, 1980), is characterized by (a) non-determinism, (b) a more systematic recourse to syntax, (c) a separation of syntactically based word disambiguation from encyclopaedia based word disembiguation.
