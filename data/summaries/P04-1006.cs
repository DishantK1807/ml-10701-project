In Figure 4 we present the general overview of a multi-stage parsing technique (Goodman, 1997; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001).

ˆα(N i j,k ) (4) = summationdisplay i,l,q,r fwd(T q i,j )p(N i |T q )p(T r |N i )bkwd(T r k,l ) The outside probability is approximated with a bitag model and the standard tag/category boundary model (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Hall and Johnson, 2003).

The first stage parser is a best-first PCFG parser trained on sections 2 through 22, and 24 of the Penn WSJ treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

A number of syntactic language models have proven to be competitive with the n-gram and better than the most popular n-gram, the trigram (Roark, 2001; Xu et al., 2002; Charniak, 2001; Hall and Johnson, 2003).
J01-2004 P01-1017 P02-1025
The model presented by Charniak (Charniak, 2001) identifies both syntactic structural and lexical dependencies that aid in language modeling.

2.1 n–best list reranking Much effort has been put forth in developing efficient probabilistic models for parsing strings (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998; Goldwater et al., 1998; Blaheta and Charniak, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001); an obvious solution to parsing wordlattices is to use n–best list reranking.

These contexts include syntactic structure such as parent and grandparent category labels as well as lexical items such as the head of the parent or the head of a sibling constituent (Charniak, 2001).

By definition of 4 The notion of attention shifting is motivated by the work on parser FOM compensation presented in (Blaheta and Charniak, 1999).
P99-1066
In this particular parsing model a PCFG best-first parser (Bobrow, 1990; Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) is used to search the unconstrained space of parses Π over a string.
J98-2004 W98-1115
This first stage performs overparsing which effectively allows it to generate a set of high probability candidate parses π prime . These parses are then rescored using a lexicalized syntactic model (Charniak, 2001).
P01-1017
The second stage parser used is a modified version of the Charniak language modeling parser described in (Charniak, 2001).
P01-1017
We use a first stage PCFG parser that performs a best-first search over the space of parses, which means that it depends on a heuristic “figure-ofmerit” (FOM) (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998).
J98-2004 W98-1115
We ran the first stage parser with 4-times overparsing for each string in 7 The n–best lists were provided by Brian Roark (Roark, 2001) 8 A local-tree is an explicit expansion of an edge and its children.

For example, the model presented by Chelba and Jelinek (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Xu et al., 2002) uses syntactic structure to identify lexical items in the left-context which are then modeled as an n-gram process.
P02-1025
Solutions to improve these results include modifying the first-stage grammar by annotating the category labels with local syntactic features as suggested in (Johnson, 1998) and (Klein and Manning, 2003) as well as incorporating some level of lexicalization.

on the BLLIP99 corpus (Charniak et al., 1999); a corpus of 30million words automatically parsed using the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000).

The first stage is a PCFG word-lattice parser that generates a set of candidate parses over strings in a word-lattice, while the second stage rescores these candidate edges using a lexicalized syntactic language model (Charniak, 2001).
