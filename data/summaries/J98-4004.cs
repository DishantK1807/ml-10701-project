A PCFG is a CFG in which each production A ~ o~ in the grammar's set of productions P is associated with an emission probability P(A ~ o~) that satisfies a normalization constraint P(A ~ ~) = 1 o~:A---~o~EP and a consistency or tightness constraint not discussed here, that PCFGs estimated from tree banks using the relative frequency estimator always satisfy (Chi and Geman 1998).

For example, it would be interesting to know to what extent the performance of more sophisticated parsing systems, such as those described by Collins (1996) and Charniak (1997), depends on the particular tree representations they are trained on.

Correctly resolving PP attachment ambiguities requires information, such as lexical information (Hindle and Rooth 1993), that is simply not available to the PCFG models considered here.

While PCFG models do not perform as well as models that are sensitive to a wider range of dependencies (Collins 1996), their simplicity makes them straightforward to analyze both theoretically and empirically.
