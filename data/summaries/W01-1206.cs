Since (Radev and McKeown, 1998) describes the summary fusion mechanisms, Class 3 of questions can be reduced in this paper to Class 2, which deals with the processing of the template.
J98-3005
Template-based questions and summaryasking inquiries cover most of the classes of question complexity proposed in (Moldovan et al., 2000).
P00-1071
Such abductive mechanisms are detailed in (Harabagiu et al., 2000).

To find the answer to a question several steps must be taken, as reported in (Abney et al., 2000) (Moldovan et al., 2000) (Srihari and Li, 2000): a2 First, the question semantics needs to be captured.

Since data producing these summaries can be sourced in different documents, summary fusion techniques as proposed in (Radev and McKeown, 1998) can be employed.
J98-3005
When question dependencies are known (Harabagiu et al., 2000) proposed a technique of identifying the answer type based on the semantic category of the question stem and eventually of its most connected dependent concept.
C00-1043
Capturing question or answer dependencies can be cast as a straightforward process of mapping syntactic trees to sets of binary headmodifier relationships, as first noted in (Collins, 1996).
