Work The rise of the empirical paradigm in the field of machine translation is, to a large degree, due to the wide-spread availability of parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1990).

Especially in scientific and technical sublanguages, we observe a high frequency of domain-specific and content-bearing suffixes (e.g., ‘-itis’, ‘-ectomia’ in the medical domain), as well as the tendency to construct utterly complex word forms such as ‘pseudo hypo para thyroid ism’, ‘gluco corticoid s’, or ‘pancreat itis’.1 In order to properly account for the particularities of “medical” morphology, we introduced subwords (Schulz et al., 2002) as selfcontained, semantically minimal units and motivated their existence by their usefulness for document retrieval rather than by linguistic arguments.

Koehn and Knight (2002) derived such a seed lexicon from German-English cognates which were selected by using string similarity criteria.

An additional boost can be achieved by retrieving content-related document pairs using CLIR techniques (Utsuro et al., 2003).

They also constitute an important resource for the automated acquisition of translational lexicons (Turcato, 1998).

the well-known cosine metric (Salton and McGill, 1983) and an inverted, normalized (within the interval [0,1]) variant of the cityblock metric (advocated by Rapp (1999) as an alternative that outperformed cosine in his experiments).
P99-1067
Rapp (1999) used unrelated parallel corpora in order to learn English and German word-to-word translations.

In the next step, we created a context vector for each MID, the components of which contained the relative frequencies of co-occurring MIDs in a local window of four subsequent, yet unordered MID units (a size also endorsed by Rapp (1999)).

At a first glance, this seems to contradict the statement of Rapp (1999), who found in a number of experiments that the city-block metric yields the best results among others, viz.

Our claim that this interlingual approach is useful for the purpose of cross-lingual text retrieval and categorization has already been experimentally supported (Schulz et al., 2002; Mark´o et al., 2003).
