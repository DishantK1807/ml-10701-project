Text documents are generally cb~ssified by significant words (keywords) of the documents.
However, it is difficult to extract these significant words from Japanese text, because Japanese texts are written without using blank spaces, such as delimiters, and must be segmented into words.
Therefore, instead of words, we used domain specific kanji characters which appear more frequently in one domain than the other.
We extracted these domain specific kanji characters by X,2 method.
Then, using these domain specific kanji characters, we classifted editorial columns "TENSEI JINGO", editorim articles, and articles in "Scientific American (in Japanese)".
The correct recognition scores for' them were 47%, 74%, and 85%, respectively.
1 Introduction
Document cl~sification has been widely investigated for assigning domains to documents for text retrieval, or aiding human editors in assigning such domains.
Various successful systems have been developed to classify text documents (Blosseville, 1992; Guthrie, 1994; Ilamill, 1980; Masand, 1992; Young, 1985).
Conventional way to develop document classification systems can be divided into the following two groups: 1.
semantic approach 2.
statistical approach In the semantic approach, document classification is based on words and keywords of a thesaurus.
If the thesaurus is constructed well, high score is achieved.
But this approach has disadvantages in terms of development and maintenance.
On the other hand, in the statistical approach, a human exl)ert classifies a sample set of documents into predefined domains, and the computer learns from these samples how to classify documents into these domains.
'\]'his approach offers advantages in terms of development and maintenance, but the quality of the results is not good enough in comparison with the semantic approach.
In either approach, document classification using words has problems as follows: 1.
Words in the documents must be normalized for matching those in the dictionary and the thesaurus.
Moreover, in the case of Japanese texts, it is difficult to extract words from them, because they are written without using blank spaces as delimiters and must be segmented into words.
2. A simple word extraction technique generates to() many words.
In the statistical approach, the dimensions of tim training space are too big au(l tim classification process usually fails.
Therefore, the.
Jal)anese document classification on words needs a high l)recision Japanese morphological analyzer and a great amount of lexical knowledge.
Considering these disadvantages, we propose a new method of document classification on kanfi character,s, on which document classification is performed without a morphological analyzer and lexieel knowledge.
In our approach, we extracted domain specific kanji characters for' document classification by the X 2 metho(I.
The features of doculnents and domains are rel-)resented using the tim_ ture space the axes of which are these domain specific kanji characters.
Then, we classified Japanese documents into domains by mea~suring the similarity between new documents and the domains in the feature space.

Classification on Domain Specific Kanji Characters 2.1 Text Representation t)y Kanji Characters In previous researches, texts were represented by significarlt woMs, and a word was regarded as a minimmn semantic unit.
But a word is not a minimum semantic unit, because a word consists of one or more morphemes.
Here, we propose the text representation by morpheme.
We have applied this idea to the Japanese text representation, where a kanji character is a morpheme.
Each kanji character has its meaning, and Japanese words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so on) usually contain one or more kanji characters which represent the meaning of the words to some extent.
When representing the features of a text by kanji characters, it is important to consider which kanji characters are significant for the text representation and useful for classification.
We assumed that these significant kanji characters appear more frequently 794 samp!e set of Japanese texts 2 x method input / g / ? d # / feature space / / for " / document /" /",# classification ',' /' /,,'"" /////",,,//......... measure the similarit yl '° J he feature space ..................

I,'rOlll llOW Oli, these kanji characters are called the domain specific kanji characlcrs.
Then, we represented the conteut eta Japanese text x as the following vector of douiain specific kanji characters: x = (fl, f2 ..... f/ .....
/I), (1) where coinponent fi is the frequency ofdoniain SlW.
ciIic kanji i and I is the nuniber of all the extracted kanji characters by the X 2 lnethod.
In this way, tilt' Japanese text x is expressed as a point in the ~l.
dimensional feature space the axes of which are the domain specific kanji characters.
Then, we used this feature space for tel)resenting the features of the domains.
Nainely, the domain vl is rel)rese.nted usilig the feature vector of doniain specific kanji characters as follows: Vi = (fl, f2,..., St,..., .\[1).
(2) We used this feature space llOt only for I, he text representation but also for the docunient classification.
\[f the document classification is lJerforined Oil kanji characters, we may avoid the two problenls described in Section 1.
1. It is simpler to extract ka, iji characters than tO extract Japanese words.
2. There are about 2,000 kanji char~tcte,'s that are considered neccssary h)r general literacy.
So, the rnaximuln number of dimensiolis of the training space is about 2,000.
Of course, in our approach, the quality of the results may not be as good as lit the i)revh)us al)preaches ilSilig the words.
But it is signilicanl, I.hat we can avoid the cost of iriorphologi(:at mialysis which is not so perfect.
2.2 Procedure
tbr the Doemnent Classification using Kanji Characte.rs Our approach is the following: 1.
A sample set of Japanese texts is classifie.d by a htiniaii expert.
2. Kanji characters which distribute unevenly aniong> text domahm are extracted by the X 2 Iliethod.
3. The featllre vect,ors of the doliiains are obtained by the inforniation Oll donlain specilic kanji characters and its fr0qllOlioy of OCCllrrellCe.
4. Tile classification system builds a feaDtlre vc(> tor of a new doclllllel\]t, COIIllJal'es il.
with the feature vectors of each doniain, anl dcl.erlnhies the doniahi whh:h l, he docunie.nt I)c\[ongs to.
Figure 1 shows it procedure for the docuinent classification /ISilI~ dOlltaill specific kanji chara.cters. 3 Automatic Extraction of \])Olliaiil Specific Kanji Characl;ers 3.1 The Loariling Sample For extracting doiriain specific kanji characters and obtaining the fea, till'e voctoi's of each domain, we ilSe articles of "l<ncych}pedia lh:'.ibonsha" ~IrS the le/trning sa.nll)le.
The reasoll why we use this encycloImdia is thai, it is lmblished in the electronic form and contains a gi'oat liiiiill)oi' of articles.
This enc.yclopedia was written by 6,727 atlthors, and COilrains about 80,000 artich'.s, 6.52 x 107 characters, and 7.52 X 107 kanji characters.
An exanlple artic.le of "Encyclopedia lloibonsha" is shown in Figure 7.
Unfortunately, tile articles are not classified, hut there is the author's llaliie at the end of each article and his specialty is notified in the preface..
There fore, we can chussit'y these articles into the authors' specialties autonlaLically.
The specialties used i.
the encyck}l)edia are wide, but they a.re not well balanced i Moreover, some doniains of the authors' specialties contain only few iFor exaniple, the specialty of Yuriko Takeuchi is Anglo American literature, oil the other hand, that of Koichi Anlano is science fiction.

So, it is difficult to extract appropriate domain specific kanji characters from the articles which are classified into the authors' specialties.
Therefore, it is important to consider that 206 specialties in the encyclopedia, which represent almost a half of the specialties, are used as the subjects of the domain in the Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC).
For example, botany, which is one of the authors' specialties, is also one of the subjects of the domain in the NDC.
In addition to this, the NDC has hierarchical domains.
For keepiug the domains well balanced, we combined the specialties using the hierarchical relationship of the NDC.
The procedure for combining the specialties is as follows: 1.
We aligned the specialties to the domains in the NDC.
206 specialties corresponded to the domains of the NDC automatically, and the rest was aligned manually.
2. We combined 418 specialties to 59 code domains of the NDC, using its hierarchical relationship.
'Fable 1 shows an example of the hierarchical relationship of the NDC.
However, 59 domains are not well balanced.
For example, "physics", "electric engineering", and "German literature" are the code domains of the NDC, and we know these domains are not well balanced by intuition.
So, for keeping the domains well balanced, we combined 59 domains to 42 manually.
3.2 Selection
of Domain Specific Kanji Characters by the X 2 Method Using the value X 2 of the X 2 test, we can detect the unevenly distributed kanji characters and extract these kanji characters as domain specific kanji characters.
Indeed, it was verified that X ~ method is useful for extracting keywords instead of kanji characters(Nagao, 1976).
Suppose we denote the frequency of kanji i in the domain j, mid, and we assume that kanji i is distributed evenly.
Then the value X 2 ofkanji i, X~, is expressed by the equations as follows: I j=l d _ (*'d (4) rlzij 1 xij k j=l midk, x~.it (s) i=1 d:l where k is the number of varieties of the kanji characters and 1 is tile number of the domains.
If the value X/2 is relatively big, we consider that the kanji i is distributed unevenly.
There are two considerations about the extraction of the domain specific kanji characters using the X 2 method.
The first is the size of the training samples.
If the size of each training sample is different, the ranking of domain specific kanji characters is not equal to tile ranking of tile value X 2.
'File second is that we cannot recognize which domains are represented by the extracted kanji characters using only the value X :~ of equation (3).
In other words, there is no guarantee that we can extract the appropriate domain specific kanji characters from every domain.
From this, we have extracted the fixed number of domain specific kanji characters from every domain using the ranking of the value X~ d of equation (4) instead of (3).
Not only the value X~ of equation (3) but the value X~ d of equation (4) become big when the kanji i appears more frequently in the domain j than in the other.
Table 2 shows top 20 domain specific kanji characters of the 42 domains.
Further, Appendix shows tim meanings of each domain specific kanji character of "library science" domain.
3.3 Feature
Space for the Docmnent Classification In order to measure the closeness between an unclassified document and the 42 domains, we proposed a feature space the axes of which are domain specific kanji characters extracted from the 42 domains.
To represent the features of an unclassified document and the 42 domains, we used feature vectot's (1) and (2) respectively.
To find out the closest domain, we measured an angle between the unclassifted document and the 42 domains in the feature space.
If we are given a new document the feature vector of which is x, the classification system can compute the angle 0 with each vector vi which represents the domain i and find vi with rain 0 ( vi, z ) . i Using this procedure, every document is classified into the closest domain.

articles in "Scientific American (in .lapanese)" (162 articles) 2.
editorial columns in Asahi Newspaper "TENSE\[ JINGO" (about 2,000 articles) 3.
editorial articles in Asahi Newspaper (about 3,000 articles) Because the articles in "Scientific American (ill Japanese)" are not cb~ssified, we classified them manually.
The articles of "TENSEI JINGO" and tile editorial articles are classified by editors into a hi797 erarchy of domains which differ from the domains of the NDC.
We aligned these domains to the 42 domains described in Section 3.1.
Some articles in thereof contain two or more themes, and these articles are classified into two or more domains by editors.
For example, the editorial article 'qbo Many Katakana Words" is classified into three domains.
In these cases, we.j,dge that the result of the automatic classification is correct when it corresponds to one of the domains where the document is cbLssifted by editors.
Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 describe the variations of the classification results with respect to the number of domain specific kanji characters.
4.2 Evaluation
In our approach, the maximum correct recognition scores for the editorial articles and the articles in "Scientific American (in Japanese)" are 74 % and 85 %, respectively.
Considering that our system uses only the statistical information of kanji characters and deals with a great amount of documents which cover various specialties, our approach achieved a good result in document classification.
From this, we believe that our approach is efficient for broadly classifying various subjects of the documents, e.g. news stories.
A method for classifying news stories is significant for distributing and retrieving articles in electronic newspaper.
The maximum recognition scores for "TENSEI JINGO" is 47 %.
The reasons why the result is far worse than the results of the other are: 1.
The style of the documents The style of "TENSEI,lINGO" is similar to that of an essay or a novel and it is written in colloquial Japanese.
In contrast, the style of the editorial articles and "Scientific American (in Japanese)" is similar to that of a thesis.
We think the reason why we achieved the good result in the classification of the editorial articles and "Scientific American (in Japanese)" is that many technical terms are used in there and it is likely that the kanji characters which represent the technical terms are domain specific kanji characters in that domain.
2. Two or more themes in one document Many articles of "TENSEI JINGO" contain two or more themes.
In these articles, it is usual that the introductory part has little relation to the main theme.
For example, the article "Splendid ILetirement", whose main theme is the Speaker's resignation of the llouse of Representatives, ha~s an introductory part about the retirement of famous sportsmen.
In conclusion, our aplJroach is not effective in classifying these articles.
However, if we divide these articles into semantic objects, e.g. chapter and section, these semantic objects may be classified in our approach.

And it is correct that the system classified Chapter 3 and Chapter 5 into the "linguistics" and "psychology", respectively, because human language is described in Chapter 3 and human psychological aspect is described in Chapter 5.
5 Conclusion
The quality of the experimental results showed that our apl)roach enables document classification with a good ac.e|lracy, and suggested the possibility for Jat)anese documents to t)e represented on the basis of kanji characters they contain.
6 Future
Work Because the training samples are created withovt this application in mind, we may be able to improve the performance by increasing the size of the training samples or by using different samples which have the similar styles and contents to the documents.
We would also like to study the relation between tile quality of the classification result and the size of the documents.
