Introduction to Information Retrieval by Manning, Raghavan, and Sch¨utze is an up-to-
date, thorough, and systematic introduction to information retrieval (IR) from a com-
puter science perspective. Written as a textbook, its main audience is graduate and
senior undergraduate students taking IR courses. The book will also be valuable to
researchers in other computer science ﬁelds, such as computational linguistics, as well
as to professional practitioners wishing to delve into the IR ﬁeld.
Thebookisstructuredinto21chapters,whichgraduallyunfoldthesubjectofinfor-
mation retrieval, starting with the fundamentals (such as Boolean retrieval, document
indexing, vector-space model, and evaluation in IR) and moving on to more advanced
topics(suchasprobabilisticmodels,XMLretrieval,textclassiﬁcation,machinelearning
for IR, document clustering, and Web retrieval). Pedagogical features of the book in-
clude short exercises at the end of each section and brief overviews of related research
literature at the end of each chapter. Some of the major strengths of the book are its
accessibility, clarity, and good balance between theory and practice. There are many
concreteexamplesthroughoutthebookthatfacilitateunderstandingofcomplextopics.

specialized IR tasks, such as opinion retrieval or enterprise search, which might beneﬁt

Chapter 1 gives a succinct and focused introduction to the main concepts in IR,
such as term, index, document, query, recall, precision, and so on. It outlines the main
principles of Boolean retrieval, brieﬂy criticizes it, and compares it to ranked retrieval.
The authors also present a good real-world example of a commercial Boolean retrieval
system.
Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion of the initial stages of the document
indexing process that include tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, stopwords
removal, and approaches to dealing with phrases at the indexing stage, namely bi-
gram indexing and the use of positional indexes. In this chapter the authors discuss
some linguistic aspects of these processes. For example, when examining tokenization,
they discuss various morphological and other aspects of languages that complicate
this process (e.g., hyphenation in English, compound nouns in German, and word
ComputationalLinguistics Volume35,Number2
sequences in East Asian languages). A brief outline of word segmentation approaches
is provided. The authors also give a very good summary of the key relevant research
works in these areas at the end ofthe chapter.
In Chapters 3, 4, and 5 the authors discuss data structures for indexes, index con-
struction, and compression. These three chapters will most likely be of least interest to
thecomputationallinguisticscommunity.However,twotopicsthatmightbeofinterest
are the use of wildcard queries by users and spelling correction of queries, discussed
in Chapter 3. In their discussion of wildcard queries, the authors examine only the
use of wildcards in queries to represent different morphological variants of a word
(e.g., American vs. British), the user’s uncertainty in the correct spelling of a word, and
stemmedwords(e.g.,judicia*torepresentbothjudicialandjudiciary).Itwouldhavebeen
interesting if the authors also discussed the use of wildcards to represent entire words,
since some commercial search engines started to provide this functionality, allowing
users to search for a phrase with a user-speciﬁed number of words in the middle (e.g.,
the use of ﬁne * me torepresent ﬁne by me, ﬁne with me,andﬁne for me).
Chapters 6 and 7 introduce the fundamentals of ranked document retrieval, term
frequency and inverse document frequency, and the vector-space model. The authors
brieﬂy touch upon phrase queries, and how they can be handled by the vector-space
model. Phrase or proximity-based retrieval is an important problem in IR, but unfor-
tunately, the authors do not discuss in detail different approaches to proximity-based
term weighting.
Chapter 8is devoted to evaluation in IR, and presents major evaluation frame-
works,suchastheTextRetrievalConference(TREC)andclassicalevaluationmeasures,
such as mean average precision, precision at different cutoff points, as well as the
more recently developed measure NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain)
for evaluation with graded (non-binary) relevance judgments. The penultimate section
in the chapter discusses various approaches to presenting retrieved documents in the
ranked list shown to the user, such as snippets, and query-independent and query-
biased document summaries.
Chapter9reviewsrelevancefeedbackandqueryexpansion.Queryexpansion(QE)
following relevance feedback is one of the most effective techniques in IR. The authors
provide an overview of the main types of QE: local, whereby the query is modiﬁed
on the basis of retrieved documents, and global, which is query independent. Among
the local methods, they introduce here the classic Rocchio algorithm. Probabilistic
approaches to query expansion following relevance feedback are discussed in detail
in Chapter 11 after the authors introduce probabilistic models of IR. Query expansion
followingrelevancefeedbackcanbeeitherautomatic(AQE),wherebythesystemselects
terms and adds them to the query, or interactive (IQE), whereby the selected terms are
shown to the user for further selection. The authors only discuss AQE in the context
of relevance feedback. Among the global QE methods, they mention the use of manual
and automatically generated thesauri, as well as approaches to QE on the Web, such as
suggestion of related queries.
Chapter 10 discusses XML retrieval, including such topics as a vector-space model
for XML retrieval and INEX (Initiative for the Evaluation of XML retrieval), the main
evaluation framework for XML retrieval.
Chapters 11 and 12 focus on probabilistic information retrieval and language mod-
eling, respectively. Chapter 11 introduces the theoretical underpinnings of probabilistic
IR models, and describes the Robertson and Sp¨arck Jones probabilistic model and the
BM25 term weighting function. Chapter 12 starts by describing the basic approach to
language modeling in IRand then reviews some of its extensions.

In Chapters 16 and 17 the authors introduce document clustering. Flat clustering
methods (K-means and expectation maximization) and clustering evaluation methods
are discussed in Chapter 16, and Chapter 17 is devoted to hierarchical clustering. Here,
the authors present different agglomerative clustering algorithms, such as single-link,
complete-link, group-average, and centroid similarity, as well as top–down (divisive)
hierarchical clustering. An important problem in clustering is the labeling of clusters.
The authors discuss and compare two approaches to labeling: differential cluster la-
beling, where label terms are selected on the basis of their distribution in one cluster
compared to the others, and cluster-internal labeling, where a label is selected only on
the basis of the cluster being labeled.
Chapter 18introduces latent semantic indexing. This is a rather theoretical chapter,
and readers might have beneﬁted from a more extensive discussion of the use and
practical applications of LSI.
The remaining three chapters are devoted to Web-based IR. Among the topics
discussed are spam, types of user information needs, Web crawling and indexing, link-
based approaches to document ranking such as PageRank, Markov chains, and hubs
and authorities.
To sum up, Introduction to Information Retrieval is a comprehensive, authoritative,
and well-written overview of the main topics in IR. The book offers a good balance
of theory and practice, and is an excellent self-contained introductory text for those
new to IR. Although the book does not cover advanced NLP techniques for IR, it is
recommended for experts in computational linguistics who wish to learn about IR.
Although many computational linguists are familiar with the material covered in the
chapters on text classiﬁcation, they will most certainly ﬁnd chapters on different IR
models and methods very useful.
