Like the methods developed by Allauzen et al.(2003) and Cortes et al.(2003) our technique incorporates finite automata, but uses a direct thresholdcounting technique, rather than a nondeterministic counting technique which relies on path multiplicities.

The method described here is similar in spirit to those of Gao et al.(2006) and Jansche (2005), who discuss maximum expected F-score training of decision trees and logistic regression models.

Among the most general methods are those of Mozer et al.(2001), whose constrained optimization technique is similar to those in (Gao et al., 2006; Jansche, 2005).

In general, decoding can be a hard computational problem (Casacuberta and de la Higuera, 2000; Knight, 1999).

More specialized methods also exist, for example for support vector machines (Musicant et al., 2003) and for conditional random fields (Gross et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2006).
P06-1028
For example, the constrained optimization method of (Mozer et al., 2001) relies on approximations of sensitivity (which they call CA) and specificity2 (their CR); related techniques (Gao et al., 2006; Jansche, 2005) rely on approximations of true positives, false positives, and false negatives, and, indirectly, recall and precision.
