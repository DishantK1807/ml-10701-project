This built-in transcategoriality strongly facilitates applications such as interlingual MT, as it renders vacuous many problems connected with category mismatches (Kameyama et al., 1991) and misalignments or divergences (Dorr, 1995), (Held, 1993) that plague those paradigms in MT which do not rely on extracting language-neutral text meaning representations.

It has been lately incorporated into computational lexicography in (Atkins, 1991), (Ostler and Atkins, 1992), (Briscoe and Copestake, 1991), (Copestake and Briscoe, 1992), (Briscoe et al., 1993)).

This mechanism works because we rely on linguistic clues and a See (Viegas and Nirenburg, 1995) for the details on the acquisition process to build the core Spanish lexicon, and (Viegas and Beale, 1996) for the details oil the conceptual and technological tools used to check the quality of the lexicon.

Pustejovsky (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995) has coined an attractive term to capture these phenomena: one of the declared objectives of his 'generative lexicon' is a departure from sense enumeration to sense derivation with the help of lexical rules.

â€¢ Regular Polysemy This set of phenomena includes regular polysemies or regular nonmetaphoric and non-metonymic alternations such as those described in (Apresjan, 1974), (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995), (Ostler and htkins, 1992) and others.
