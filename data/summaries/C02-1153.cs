As in (Candito, 1996), we overgenerate: ultimately, trees are incorrectly being assigned to some lexical items.
C96-1034
Several approaches have been proposed in the literature describing compact representations methods for LTAGs, perhaps the best known being (VijayShanker and Schabes, 1992), (Candito, 1996; Candito, 1998), (Evans et al., 1995; Evans et al., 2000), (Xia et al., 1998; Xia, 2001), and (Becker, 1993; Becker, 1994; Becker, 2000).

to a partial order, as well as distinct treatment for different families.11 We are also interested in aspects of the use of metarules to enhance extracted grammars (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002).
W02-1507
As early noticed by (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992) the information regarding syntactic structure and feature equations in (feature-based) LTAGs is repeated across templates trees in a quite regular way, that perhaps could be more concisely captured than by just having a plain set of elementary trees.
C92-1034
As the grammar grew larger, the process of consistent grammar development and maintenance became harder (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992).
C92-1034
For LTAGs, in particular, there has been quite a few proposals, as we have already mentioned (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992; Becker, 1993; Candito, 1996; Evans et al., 1995; Xia, 2001), and even large-scale grammars built with them, e.g., the French grammar in (Abeille and Candito, 2000) and an English one in (Xia, 2001).
