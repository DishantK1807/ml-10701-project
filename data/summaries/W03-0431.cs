Orthographic Tries (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2003; Whitelaw and Patrick, 2002) and character n-gram modelling (Patrick et al., 2002) are two methods for capturing orthographic features.

To the best knowledge of the authors, the only other attempt to use computational inference methods for this task is Whitelaw and Patrick (2003).

Although n-gram modelling has not always been successful as a lone method of classification (Burger et al., 2002), for the reasons outlined above it is a more flexible modelling technique than Tries.

the observed probability of the word and surrounding words belonging to each category type To classify the various subsets generated as well as to train the final meta-learner, a boosted decision graph (Patrick and Goyal, 2001) is used.

Using a decision graph (Patrick and Goyal, 2001), all words from the test and training sets were then either recapitalised or decapitalised according to the output.

While the use of multiple subsets can increase overall accuracy, the recombination of models has been shown to propagate errors (Carreras et al., 2002; Patrick et al., 2002).

As they are also a classifying tool in themselves, their integration with a machine learning algorithm is problematic, as evidenced by reduction of overall accuracy when processing a Trie output through a machine learner in Patrick et al.(2002). As such, Tries have not been used here.
