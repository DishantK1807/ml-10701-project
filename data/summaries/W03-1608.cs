Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extracted both singleand multiple-word paraphrases from a sentence-aligned corpus for use in multi-document summarization.

Sentence alignment was performed using the Gale and Church algorithm (1991) with the following cost function: cost of substitution =1âˆ’ ncw anw ncw: number of common words anw: average number of words in two strings Here is a sample from two different translations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea: Ned Land tried the soil with his feet, as if to take possession of it.

Work There has been a rich body of research on automatically deriving paraphrases, including equating morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms (Jacquemin et al., 1997), and identifying equivalent adjective-noun phrases (Lapata, 2001).

The structural paraphrases produced by our algorithm are similar to the S-rules advocated by Katz and Levin for question answering (1988), except that our paraphrases are automatically generated.

Our approach is a synthesis of techniques developed by Barzilay and McKeown (2001) and Lin and Pantel (2001), designed to overcome the limitations of both.

Similar to the work of Barzilay and Lee (2003), who have applied paraphrase generation techniques to comparable corpora consisting of different newspaper articles about the same event, we are currently attempting to solve the data sparseness problem by extending our approach to non-parallel corpora.

Other researchers have explored distributional clustering of similar words (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998), but it is unclear to what extent such techniques produce paraphrases.
