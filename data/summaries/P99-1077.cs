Subsequent work has further developed this taxonomy (Hoey, 1991) and explored its implications in such are.as as paragraphing (Longacre, 1979; Bond and Hayes, 1984; Stark, 1988), relevance (Sperber and Wilson, 1995) and discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

Methods that solely use observations of patterns in vocabulary use include vocabulary management (Youmans, 1991) and the blocks algorithm im-plemented in the TextTiling system (Hearst, 1997).
J97-1003
Topic parsing (Hahn, 1990) utilizes both grammatical cues and semantic inference based on pre-coded domain-specific knowledge More general approaches assess word mmllanty based on thesauri (Morris and Hirst, 1991) or dictionary definitions (Kozima, 1994).

(Three out of seven (Litman and Passonneau, 1995; Hearst, 1997) or 30% (Kozima, 1994) are also sometimes deemed sufficient).

The implementation of the text segmenter resembles that of the Texl~Tiling system (Hearst, 1997.), The words from the input are stemmed and associated with their context vectors.
J97-1003
The performance of this system is shown to improve over that of the purely string-based TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 1997).
