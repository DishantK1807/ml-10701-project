The toolkit implements an approach to grammar development and system optimization that builds on precise empirical data and systematic experimentation, as it has been advocated by, among others, Erbach & Uszkoreit (1990), Erbach (1991), and Carroll (1994).

regarding grammaticality and linguistic phenomena presented in an item), as they are represented in the TSNLP test suites, for example (Oepen, Netter, & Klein, 1997); tools to browse the available data, identify suitable subsets and feed them through the analysis component of processing systems like the LKB and PET, LiLFeS (Makino, Yoshida, Torisawa, & Tsujii, 1998), TRALE (Penn, 2000), PAGE (Uszkoreit et al., 1994), and others; the ability to gather a multitude of precise and fine-grained (grammar) competence and (system) performance measures—like the number of readings obtained per test item, various time and memory usage statistics, ambiguity and non-determinism metrics, and salient properties of the result structures—and store them in a uniform, platform-independent data format as a competence and performance profile; and graphical facilities to inspect the resulting profiles, analyze system competence (i.e.

However, not surprisingly the addition of grammatical coverage comes with a sharp increase in ambiguity (which may indicate overgeneration): the graphs in Figure 2 clearly show that, once coverage on the ‘trading’ data was above eighty per cent, grammarians shifted their engineering focus on ‘tightening’ the grammar, i.e. the elimination of spurious ambiguity and overgeneration (see Siegel & Bender, 2002, for details on the grammar).

Although measuring the size of 2Quantifying input complexity for Japanese is a nontrivial task, as the count of the number of input words would depend on the approach to string segmentation used in a specific system (the fairly aggressive tokenizer of ChaSen, Asahara & Matsumoto, 2000, in our case); to avoid potential for confusion, we report input complexity in the (overtly systemspecific) number of lexical items stipulated by the grammar instead: around 50 and 80, on average, for the ‘banking’ and ‘trading’ data sets, respectively (as of February 2002).
