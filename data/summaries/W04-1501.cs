A study on a set of sentences of TUT shows that the basic word order for Italian is SubjectVerb-Complement (SVC), as known in literature (Renzi, 1988), (Stock, 1989), but in more than a quarter of declarative sentences it is violated (see the following table 6 ).

Also in the Penn Treebank ((Marcus et al., 1993), (Marcus et al., 1994)) a limited set of relations is placed over the constituencybased annotation in order to make explicit the (morpho-syntactic or semantic) roles that the constituents play.

(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) had shown the use of dependency in Prepositional Phrase disambiguation, and the experimental results reported in (Hockenmaier, 2003) demonstrate that a language model which encodes a rich notion of predicate argument structure (e.g.

For instance, in Information Extraction relations allows for recognizing diﬀerent guises in which an event can appear regardless of the several diﬀerent syntactic patterns that can be used to specify it (Palmer et al., 2001) 2 .In Question Answering, systems usually use forms of relation-based structured representations of the input texts (i.e.

Other projects adopt mixed formalisms where the sentence is split in syntactic subunits (phrases), but linked by functional or semantic relations, e.g. the Negra Treebank for German ((Brants et al., 2003), (Skut et al., 1998)), the Alpino Treebank for Dutch (van der Beek et al., 2002), and the Lingo Redwood Treebank for English (Oepen et al., 2002).
