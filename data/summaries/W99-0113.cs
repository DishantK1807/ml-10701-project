Roberts (1998) argues that C0 is an unordered setof backward-looking centers in terms of classical Discourse Representation Theory notions of familiarity, compatibility and logical accessibility (Kamp 1981, Helm 1982, Kamp and Reyle 1993, Asher 1993), with an additional constraint that the set of discourse referents are attentionally accessible, a notion taken from Grosz and Sidner (1986).
