On the contrary, constraint unification (CU) (Hasida 1986, Tuda et al.1989), a disjunctive unification method, makes full use of term unification advantages.
C86-1018 E89-1013
Kasper (1987) and Eisele and DSrre (1988) have tackled this problem and proposed unification methods for disjunctive feature descriptions.

Unification and Its Problem This section explains constraint unification ~ (Hasida 1986, Tuda et al.1989), a method of disjunctive unification, and indicates its disadvantage.
C86-1018 E89-1013
Although Eisele and DSrre (1988) have mentioned that their algorithm is applicable to term unification as well as graph unification, this method would lose term unification's advantage of not requiring so much copying.
