Also, we made another experimental environment to compare with the previous work by (Kazama, 2002).

Many machine learning approaches have been applied to biomedical named entity recognition(Nobata, 1999)(Hatzivalssiloglou, 2001)(Kazama, 2002).

66.5). When comparing with the (Kazama, 2002) even though the environments is not the same, the proposed two-phase model showed much better performance in both the entity identification (73.6 vs.

At the second Table 3: Performance comparison with or w/o post-processing(Ffl=1): (A)10-fold cross validation(1800 abstracts, test with 200 abstracts), (B)training with 590 abstracts, test with 80 abstracts A B (Kazama, 2002) No.

Therefore, Kazama and his colleagues tackled the problems by tuning SVMs(Kazama, 2002).
