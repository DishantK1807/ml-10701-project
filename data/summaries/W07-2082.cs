Proposals for computing acceptability (or preference) include raw frequency counts ((Evans and Zhai, 1996) and (Lapata and Keller, 2004)), Latent Semantic Indexing ((Buckeridge and Sutcliffe, 2002)) and statistical measures of association ((Lapata et al., 1999) and (Nakov and Hearst, 2005)).

Nakov and Hearst (2005) examined the use of webbased n-gram frequencies for an NLP task and concluded that these issues do not greatly impact the interpretation of the results.

Hearst: 1992.

In previous research on natural language processing, many methodologies for extracting various relations from corpora have been developed, such as the ?is-a??relation (Hearst 1992), ?part-of??relation (Berland and Charniak 1999), causal relation (Girju 2003), and entailment relation (Geffet and Dagan 2005).
C92-2082
This approach has been applied to problems like compound noun interpretation (Rosario and Hearst 2001) and semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).
W01-0511
The rst method uses sense collocations as proposed by Moldovan et al.(2004), and the second method uses the lexical similarity of the component words in the NC as proposed by Kim and Baldwin (2005).
W04-2609
Moldovan et al.(2004) propose a 35class scheme to classify relations in various phrases; the same scheme has been applied to noun compounds and other noun phrases (Girju et al., 2005).
W04-2609
Collocation Method Moldovan et al.(2004) proposed a method called semantic scattering for interpreting NCs.
W04-2609
(Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use supervised methods and explore classification features from a simple structured type hierarchy.

Patterns 4.1 Motivations Syntactic patterns provide clues for semantic relations (Hearst, 1992).
C92-2082
Rosario and Hearst (2001) used MeSH, a lexical hierarchy of medical terms.
W01-0511
We built the patterns manually, following Hearst (1992) and Nakov and Hearst (2006).

Although automatic semantic parsing is a large and growing field (Moldovan et al., 2004; Litkowski, 2004; Baldewein et al., 2004), two problems present themselves.
W04-2609
The idea of searching a large corpus for specific lexico-syntactic phrases to indicate a semantic relation of interest was first described by Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
(Nakov and Hearst, 2005) use the ?2 measure based on statistics obtained from WWW search engines to compute values to determine acceptability of a syntactic analysis for nominal compounds.

Moldovan et al (2004) also use WordNet.
W04-2609
(Nakov and Hearst, 2005) also report a similar percentage (66.8%) of left-branching noun compounds.
H05-1105
(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2005) gave the annotators an example of each phrase in a sentence along with WordNet senses and position of arguments.
W04-2609
Rosario and Hearst (2001) classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine, using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given noun compound.
W01-0511
For example, Hearst(1992) uses the pattern ?NP such as List??to indicate that nouns in List are hyponyms of NP.
C92-2082
In order to ensure accuracy of the paraphrases, we use statistics gathered from the Web, using a variation of the approaches presented in Lapata and Keller (2004) and Nakov and Hearst (2005).
