Prototypical implementations such as the OpinionFinder (Wilson, Hoffmann et al.2005) have demonstrated that grammatical parsing can successfully address this limitation by identifying ambiguities and capturing meaning-making processes at levels beyond lexis – correctly identifying, annotating and evaluating nested expressions of various complexity (Wiebe, Wilson et al.2005). 6 Keyword Analysis Keyword Analysis locates words in a given text and compares their frequency with a reference distribution from a usually larger corpus of text.

Besides differences in word-sense, analysts also encounter other types of ambiguities – e.g., idiomatic versus non-idiomatic term usage, or various pragmatic ambiguities involving irony, sarcasm, and metaphor (Wiebe, Wilson et al.2005). Given the considerable size of the corpus and the need to publish results in weekly intervals, the system was designed to maximize throughput in terms of documents per second.
