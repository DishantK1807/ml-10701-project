1. The Generator The generation algorithm of ELU is based on the algorithm described in Shieber et al.(1989) and was developed at ISSCO by J.

Carroll. 4 Generation is head-driven: each role has a "semantic head" (see Shieber (1988)), which is specified by the ~ammar writer, and the head daughter of a rule is generated before its siblings.

Nevertheless, tiffs strategy is not sufficient, and the problem posed by the non-determinism of relational abstractions is the most complex and severe of the grammar/generator interactions described in Russell et al.(1990), because of its adverse effects on the restliclion of top-down generation.

These statements 5 Restrictors are also used to restrict the search space in parsing (see Shieber (1985)).

This grammar is primarily intended to be one of the components of a machine translation system built using ELU, 1 an enhanced PATR-II style unification grammar linguistic environment based on the LID system described in Johnson and Rosner (1989), but it is also part of our more general experimentation with fully reversible grammars.

l0 This analysis contrast with that of Baschung et al.(1987), or B6s et al.(1989), which treats separately complements appearing to the left and complements appearing to the right of the verb.

shown by Russell et al.(1990), even though the grammar rules do not refer to the generation process, the generation algorithm imposes particular constraints on the grammar formalism.
