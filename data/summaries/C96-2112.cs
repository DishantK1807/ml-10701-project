2Our implementation interprets rules directly (see (Kiraz, 1996c)); hence, we allow unequal representation of strings.

Feature values in parentheses are disjunctive and are implenlented using boolean vectors (Mellish, 1988; Pulman, 1994).

For the compilation of our formalism into automata, see (Grimley-Evans et al., 1996).

The rules and lexiea samples reproduced here are based on a larger morphological grammar written for the SemHe implementation (a multitape two-level system) for a full description of the system, see (Kiraz, 1996c; Kiraz, 1996b).

seq). addresses various issues in the domain of non-linear morphology: It has been used in analysing rootand-pattern morphology (Kiraz, 1994), the Arabic broken plural phenomenon (Kiraz, 1996a), and error detection in non-concatenative strings (Bowden and Kiraz, 1995).

Motivated by Kay's work, (Kiraz, 1994) proposed a multi-tape two-level model.

aNon-linear proposals include (Kay, 1987), (Kornai, 1991), (Wiebe, 1992), (Narayanan and Hashem, 1993), (Bird and Ellison, 1994) and (Kiraz, 1994).

The notion of using multiple tapes first appeared in (Kay, 1987).
