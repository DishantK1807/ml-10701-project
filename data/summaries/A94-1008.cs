The tagger is reported (Cutting el al., 1992) to have a better than 96 % accuracy in the analysis of parts of the Brown Corpus.
A92-1018
This accuracy compares very favourably with results reported in (de Marcken, 1990; Weisehedel et al., 1993; Kempe, 1994) for instance, to reach the recall of 99.3 %, the system by (Weischedel et al., 1993) has to leave as many as three readings per word in its output.

The tagger itself is based on the Hidden Markov Model (Baum, 1972) and word equivalence classes (Kupiec, 1989).

â€¢ We could leave the text partly disambiguated, and use a syntactic parser that uses both linguistic knowledge and corpus-based heuristics (see (Tapanainen and J//rvinen, 1994)).

The two systems we use are ENGCG (Karlsson et al., 1994) and the Xerox Tagger (Cutting et al., 1992).

taggers in outline 2.1 English Constraint Grammar Parser The English Constraint Grammar Parser, ENGCG (Voutilainen et al., 1992; Karlsson el al., 1994), is based on Constraint Grammar, a parsing framework proposed by Fred Karlsson (1990).

Tagger The Xerox Tagger 1, XT, (Cutting et al., 1992) is a statistical tagger made by Doug Cutting, Julian Kupiec, Jan Pedersen and Penelope Sibun in Xerox PARC.
