(Bear & Price 1990) discusses integrating prosody and syntax in parsing spoken English, relative duration of phonetic segments being the one aspect of prosody examined.

262). (Steedman 1990) explores taking advantage of intonational structure in spoken sentence understanding in the combinatory categorial grammar formalism.

(Bear & Price 1990) modified the grammar they use to change all the rules of the form A -> B C to the form A -> B Link C, and add constraints to the rules application in terms of the value of the =breaking indices" based on relative duration of phonetic segments.

This is similar to that used in (Hirschberg & Pierrehumbert 1986).

ATTACHMENT (Steedman 1990 & Cruttenden 1986) observed that intonational structure is strongly constrained by meaning.

(Briscoe & Boguraev 1984) suggests that if prosodic structure could be derived for the noun compound Boron epoxy rocket motor chambers, then their parser LEXICAT could reduce the fourteen licit 112 morphosyntactic interpretations to one correct analysis without error (p.

No work has yet been carded out which treats prosody at the same level as syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, even though evidence shows that prosody is as important as the other means in human understanding of utterances (see, for example, experiments reported in (Price et a11989)).

Cue words, such as "now" in "Now, I want to...", are words whose meta-function in determining the structure of dialogues overrides their semantic roles (Reichman 1985).Cue words and phrases are prosodically distinct due to their high pitch and pause separation from tone groups that convey most of the propositional content (Hirschberg & Litman 1987).
