Although these tags were corrected by hand, part-ofspeech tagging can be automatically performed with an error rate of 3 to 4 percent (Merialdo, 1994; Brill, 1994).

Good surface cues are easy to identify, abundant, and correspond to the needed lexical semantic information (Hearst (1992) identifies a similar set of desiderata).

The Penn Treebank version of the Brown corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993) served as the corpus.

In the human language acquisition literature, Grimshaw (1981) and Pinker (1989) advocate this approach; others have described partial computer implementations: Pustejovsky (1988) and Siskind (1990).

Another example is the use of patterns such as NP, NP *,and otherNP to find lexical semantic information such as hyponym (Hearst, 1992).
C92-2082
However, there exist systems for such word sense disambiguation which do not require explicit lexical semantic information (Yarowsky, 1993; Schiitze, 1992).
H93-1052
Finally, inducing lexical semantics from distributional data (e.g., (Brown et al., 1992; Church et al., 1989)) is also a form of surface cueing.
