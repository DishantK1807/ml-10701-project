Finally, we discuss and present a preliminary evaluation of the use of rapid finite-state tagging to reduce the parsing search space, as was done in (Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Ratnaparkhi, 1999).

(Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2002), are re-ranking approaches, in which another model (typically a generative model) presents a relatively small set of candidates, which are then re-scored using a second, discriminatively trained model.

Beam-search parsing using an unnormalized discriminative model, as in Collins and Roark (2004), requires a slightly different search strategy than the original generative model described in Roark (2001; 2004).

This approach has been shown to be accurate, relatively efficient, and robust using both generative and discriminative models (Roark, 2001; Roark, 2004; Collins and Roark, 2004).

A generative parsing model can be used on its own, and it was shown in Collins and Roark (2004) that a discriminative parsing model can be used on its own.
