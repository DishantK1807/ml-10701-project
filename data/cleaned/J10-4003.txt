In the known literature, hapax legomena in an English text or a collection of texts roughly
account for about 50% of the vocabulary. This sort of constancy is bafﬂing. The 100-million-
word British National Corpus was used to study this phenomenon. The result reveals that the
hapax/vocabulary ratio follows a U-shaped pattern. Initially, as the size of text increases, the
hapax/vocabulary ratio decreases; however, after the text size reaches about 3,000,000 words,
the hapax/vocabulary ratio starts to increase steadily. A computer simulation shows that as the
textsizecontinuestoincrease,the hapax/vocabulary ratiowould approach 1.
1. Introduction
Words in English texts have a very peculiar distribution. On the one hand, between
50–100 top frequency words typically account for about 50% of the words in any text
(Kennedy 1998); on the other, generally, about half of the words of the vocabulary of a
text occur only once in the text (Baayen 1996; Kornai 2002). These lexical singletons are
referred toas hapax legomenon (plural form: hapax legomena), hapax for short.
Hapaxes play a very important role in language studies. For example, the ratio
between the number of hapaxes and vocabulary size (hereinafter referred to as HVR)is
widelyusedinstudiessuchasvocabulary growth(TweedieandBaayen1998),vocabu-
laryrichnessandauthoridentiﬁcation(Holmes1991),languagetypology(Popescuand
Altmann 2008), the degree of analytism (Popescu, Maˇcutek, and Altmann 2009), and
so on.
The high percentage of the top 50–100 words within a text is understandable, as
only two of them, the and a(n) would account for over 5% of the total word tokens of
a text. However, the seemingly constant and high HVR of a text or collection of texts
is bafﬂing. Intuitively, as the length of a text or collection of texts increases, the HVR
woulddecrease;astextlengthapproachesinﬁnity,allthewordsinthelanguagewould
have occurred, and the number of hapaxes would approach zero. But the known facts
so far do not seem to corroborate this intuition. For example, in Lewis Carroll’s 26,505-
wordAlice’sAdventuresinWonderland,44%ofthevocabularyarehapaxes(Baayen2001);
in Mark Twain’s 71,370-word The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the percentage is 49.8%
(Manning and Sch¨utze 2001); in the 43-million-word Merc Corpus, this percentage is

56.6% (Kornai 2002). There seems to be no explanation for this strange behavior of
hapax legomena in the literature.
ThehighHVReveninamega-corpusposesproblemsfornaturallanguageprocess-
ing; it would suggest at least sparseness of lexical, semantic, syntactic, discoursal, and
pragmatic information on roughly half of the vocabulary. The following questions
ensue: What are the factors behind this enigmatic distribution of HVR? Is it possible
to substantially reduce HVR by increasing the size of a corpus? If so, how large should
such a corpus be?These questions are the focus of this article.
In this study, the dynamic relationship among the vocabulary size V, number of
hapaxes H, and text length N was examined in the 100-million-word British National
Corpus(BNC).Inthestudy,theorthographicwordconceptisadoptedasaworkingdef-
inition, that is, a word (also called word token) is a string of contiguous alphanumeric
characters with a space on either side (Kuˇcera and Francis 1967; Biber et al. 1999). The
alphanumeric character setΣis deﬁned as
Σ={a,b,c...z;A,B,C...Z;0,1,2...9}
The word ω is deﬁned as
ω ∈ Σ
+
There are 62 characters in Σ; however, in this study, all words are case-insensitive (i.e.,
wordssuchasLanguage, LANGUAGE,andlanguage are regarded as the same). So there
areactually36charactersinΣ.Anotherconceptusedislemma,whichreferstothesetof
words having the same stem, the same major part-of-speech, and the same word-sense
(Jurafsky and Martin 2000). In this study, the vocabulary of a text or a corpus is the set
of different lemmas within the text or corpus.
2. Data and Analysis
To study the dynamic relationship between N, V,andH, the entire BNC was divided
into equi-sized text blocks automatically by the computer. The size of each of the text
blocks was initially set to 4,500 words, a size suitable for this study because in comput-
ing the growth curves of V, H,andHVR of a large corpus, text blocks much smaller
thanthis(suchastheaveragesizeofthetextblocksoftheone-million-wordBrownand
LOB corpora, which is about 2,000 words) would considerably increase the number of
textblocks and would therefore result inalonger computing time.However, the actual
size of each of the text blocks is N ≈ 4,200 words because of the removal of textual
structurecodesinthetextblockssuchassn=“10”, /head,/p,andsoon;andpunctuation
tags such as cPUN. The total number of such text blocks is 23,709. These text chunks
were subsequently tokenized and lemmatized; characters that are not included in Σ
wereignored,exceptforword-linkinghyphens,whichwerereplacedwithwhitespaces.
These processed text blocks were then recombined into 10test sets, each having 2,371
text blocks, totaling about 10,000,000 word tokens, with the exception of the tenth set,
which has 2,370text blocks. The formation of each set was done by random sampling
without replacement from the 23,709 text blocks. During the formation of each set, as
the text blocks were continuously sampled and pooled one by one to form a set, the
growth of V, H, and the corresponding HVR were computed along the way. The V, H,
and HVR of each of the ten sets are close to the means, which are 103,588.9, 42,384.6,
and 0.4091, respectively.
However, when the HVR curves were plotted, an interesting pattern was revealed.
(See the right panel, Figure 1.) The HVR curves drop sharply initially, then stop drop-

displays a general upward trend until the end is referred to as POR (Point Of Return).

the sets.

the growth of V, H,andHVR of the entire BNC were computed at an interval of
21 text blocks, about 89,000 word tokens. There are 1,129 such intervals, each formed
by random sampling without replacement from the 23,709 text blocks. The purpose of
reforming the 23,709 text blocks into 1,129 larger text chunks was to reduce computing
time. The result is shown in Figure 2. The vocabulary size of the entire BNC is 346,578,
and the number of hapaxes is 154,403. The initial HVR is 0.4583, the minimum HVR is

To ﬁnd out the general composition of the 154,403 BNC hapaxes, 1,000 of these
hapaxeswererandomlysampledandexamined.Thesesampledhapaxescanberoughly
divided into three major types: within-dictionary words, out-of-dictionary words, and
typos. The total number of within-dictionary words is 232. They consist of 137 general
words (niffy, superreader, theonomous, etc.); 93 techno-scientiﬁc words (metavolcanosed-
imentary, bitstream, etc.); and two Early-modern English words (auncyent, howshold).
The total number of out-of-dictionary words is 718. They consist of 416 personal,
organizational, and place and brand names of various national origins (Khachaturyan,
Nimmanhemin,Canham,etc.);161alphanumericstrings(hhfd,dlgs,90kyr,etc.);123Arabic
numerals (0431, 2562, 817200, etc.); 16 foreign words (mkukumkuku, gevald, gesprach,
etc.); and two interjections (aagghhh, khrrrrr). There are 50typos ( appication, disolv,
challeneger,etc.).
The word length distribution of the entire BNC hapaxes was also analyzed. The
average length of the hapaxes is 7.74 characters, compared with the average length of
7.29charactersofthenon-hapaxes.Thelongesthapaxhas104characters(itisthelongest

3. Computer Simulation
A computer simulation was designed and performed to test this hypothesis. In the
simulation, Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There was

used as a miniature language source that contains all the within-dictionary-words of
the miniature language. The novel has 30,566 word tokens and 2,754 word types. A
simulationcorpuswasbuiltbyrepeatedsamplingwithreplacementfromtheminiature
languagesource.Thesizeofthesamplewas100,eachconsistingof94wordsrandomly
drawn from the source, with six low-probability random alphanumeric strings added.
These strings were automatically generated by the computer with lengths between
six and nine characters, and would roughly simulate the number of low-probability
hapaxes in a natural English text of about 4,000 words, as there are about six low-
probability hapaxes in a 4,200-word text chunk of the BNC. The following are some
of these computer-generated random alphanumeric strings: sygtxue, ungwba, aruvfyr9,
layyieubk.Asthesizeofthesimulationcorpusincreased,V,H,andHVRwerecomputed.
The simulation corpus ﬁnally consisted of 639,506 such samples, with N = 63,950,600,
V = 3,838,940, H = 3,835,368, the initial HVR = 0.8554, POR = 20,300, the HVR at POR =
0.6004, and the ﬁnal HVR = 0.9991. The result is shown in Figure 3. At N = 192,000 the
HVR curve looks similar to that of the BNC; after the HVR curve reaches POR,itstarts
togoupandgraduallyapproachesitsasymptote.Ifwewereabletobuildacorpuswith
N hundredsoftimeslargerthantheBNC,itsHVRcurvewouldbesimilartothatofthe
simulation corpus.
4. Conclusion
This study reveals that HVR is not constant at all; it follows a U-shaped pattern. In
the case of the BNC, initially, as N increases, HVR decreases; after N reaches POR,
HVR starts to increase. This HVR distribution is due to the reoccurrence of hapaxes
consisting of within-dictionary words and high probability alphanumeric strings, and
the accumulation of extremely low probability within-dictionary words and out-of-
dictionary alphanumeric strings. If N approaches inﬁnity, HVR would approach its
horizontal asymptote 1.
The asymptotic property of HVR indicates that, at least for a general balanced
corpusliketheBNC,ifitdoesnothaveadistinctPOR,thiswouldsuggestthatithasnot
reached the stage where hapaxes of extremely low probability within-dictionary words
and out-of-dictionary alphanumeric strings substantially contribute to the vocabulary
growth, and this may imply insufﬁcient coverage of the core vocabulary of the text

for such a corpus, as shown in Section 2. On the other hand, a corpus with a size much
larger than that of the BNC would have higher HVR; such a corpus would have more
lexical noise, with the within-dictionary words far outnumbered by out-of-dictionary
alphanumeric strings, leaving sparseness of lexical, semantic, syntactic, discoursal, and
pragmatic information on more than half of the vocabulary of the corpus practically
unsolved.
