Areas where abstractions may be made over the lexicon are morphosyntax (Gazdar 1990), transitivity (Charniak and McDermott 1985; Flickinger et al.1985; Hudson 1990), and combinations of these leading to lexical rules such as passive.

To this end, DIALEX has been adapted for compilation of a generation lexicon (Youd and McGlashan 1992).

Linguistic Framework Linguistic knowledge is structured in terms of a simple unification categorial grammar (Calder et al.1988) in which featural constraints at the levels of morphology, syntax, and semantics may all occur in a lexical sign.

To this end, we adopt the principles of default inheritance (Gazdar 1987), as embodied in the DATR language (Evans and Gazdar 1989).

For example, the same dialog manager software module has been used in each prototype with minor customizations for each language (Bilange 1991; McGlashan et al.1992). The same principle should apply to the design of tools for the construction of knowledge bases, including lexical knowledge bases.

The form of encoded DAGs is known as normal form (Bouma 1990); that is, if two DAGs share a common sub-DAG, this is explicitly represented in both, with the exception of unevaluated sharing sub-DAGs that are represented as Prolog variables.

2. Overview of the System In common with contemporary generative theories that are unification based and for which information is concentrated in the lexicon (Pollard and Sag 1987; Calder et al.1988), we adopt the sign as our basic unit of linguistic representation.
