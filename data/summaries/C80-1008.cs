Kwasny and Sondheimer (1979) extend Weischedel's first method to allow for successively less stringent constraints.

Alternatively one can relate the ill-formedness to normal processing; Hendrix, et al.(1978), Biermann and Ballard (1978), Weischedel (1977), and Kwasny and Sondheimer (1979) have taken this approach for some classes of ill-formedness.
P79-1006
Where no difference is maintained either ill-formed inputs can be included in the regular components, (e.g., putting unallowable words in dictionaries to detect some queries that cannot be answered (Codd et al., 1978) and sentence fragments in the granmlar (Burton and Brown, 1977)), or the components can be written to ignore many wellformedness constraints (Shapiro and Kwasny, 1975; Waltz, 1978; Lebowitz, 1979), when the task does not depend on them.

Kwasny and Sondheimer (1979) generalize this technique by allowing evenmore dramatic relaxation of the grammar through patterns that allow the input to be matched against the grammar in a relaxed way, either by skipping words in the input, or by skipping the application of rules.
P79-1006
When it is done, one approach is to make no effort to analyze ill-formed portions, e.g., unidentified words are often skipped and processing resumed (Burton and Brown, 1977; Codd et al., 1978; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1979).

Using a third approach, many systems attempt to clarify the nature of --47-the ill-formedness by directly considering the source of the failure (Weischedel et ai.,1978; Weischedel and Black, 1980; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1979).

For example, new classes of rules could be added to the existing components (Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1979).

Weischedel and Black (1980) report the results of testing the method on a parser for English.
