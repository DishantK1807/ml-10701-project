Abstract 
Recnt resarch in computaional music resarch, including my own, has ben greatly influenced by methods in 
omputaionl iguistics. But Ibelive th influee ol als g te othr way: Music may ofr so interstig 
lesns fr laae rsearch, particularly with rgard t the modeling f cogniton. 
 
In this talk Iwil focus on a important problem in usic ogniton: the problem of key identifcation. Iwil argue 
tat is problem is in sme ways logus to the problem f sytacti arsing in languag. Iwil presnt  simpl 
Byesian dl that perfors el at he ky-findig task. Iwil then onsider some iplications of th model for 
othr isues. Te modl rpresnts mont-to-moent changes i ky vr ti and catures “realysi” fcts in 
key percption. h el ca be used t estiat th tol mbiguit of a musicl psg, and cn also be used to 
stimat the rbailty of not patrns (just s  probailstic ramar cn be sed to estimte the prailty f 
word strings). An iterstig questio her concerns expectaion: I forig xpctains for t nxt surfce le-
ment (ote or word), o we considr al psibl structrs (ytacti structres or keys) r just he most probale 
o? Finaly, the mel shds light on the concept of “informtion flow.” It has bn sugestd tat language re-
flects  tedency towards uniform desity f ifrmati, in that les prbale lemts ar spre out or lonated; 
I wil sugst hat he sme ay b tru in music.
