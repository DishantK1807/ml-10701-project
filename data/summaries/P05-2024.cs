Though it is still below the coverage achieved by SLUNG (Mitsuishi et al., 1998), our grammar has richer information that enables semantic analysis, which is lacking in SLUNG.

Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is classified into lexicalized grammars (Schabes et al., 1988).
C88-2121
SLUNG (Mitsuishi et al., 1998) is an HPSG grammar whose coverage on real-world sentences is about 99%, but the grammar is underspecified, which means that the constraints of the grammar are not sufficient for conducting semantic analysis.
