The first application I will consider is statistical machine translation involving a directed translation model and a target language model, of the sort advocated by Brown et al.(1993). If only the translation model may be varied, then the objective function for this application should be based on how well the translation model predicts the distribution of words in the target language.

recognition on the bag-of-words translation task was measured directly, using Bitext-Based Lexicon Evaluation (BIBLE: Melamed, 1995).

Daille et al., 1994; Smadja et al., 1996) define "collocations" in terms of monolingual frequency and part-of-speech patterns.

Several authors have used mutual information and similar statistics as an objective function for word clustering (Dagan et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1996), for automatic determination of phonemic baseforms (Lucassen & Mercer, 1984), and for language modeling for speech recognition (Ries ct al., 1996).

To the extent that translation-oriented definitions of compositionality overlap with other definitions, NCC lists derived from parallel data may benefit other applications where NCCs play a role, such as information retrieval (Evans & Zhai, 1996) and language modeling for speech recognition (Ries et al., 1996).

Searching a space of data models in this manner has been proposed before, e.g. by Brown et al.(1992) and Wang et al.(1996), but their particular methods have been limited by the computational expense of inducing data models and the typically vast number of potential NCCs that need to be tested.

It is well known that two languages are more informative than one (Dagan et al., 1991).

In practice, texts contain an enormous number of word sequences (Brown et al., 1992), only a tiny fraction of which are NCCs, and it takes considerable computational effort to induce each translation model.

Work In their seminal work on statistical machine translation, Brown et al.(1993) implicitly accounted for NCCs in the target language by estimating "fertility" distributions for words in the source language.

Models A translation model can be constructed automatically from texts that exist in two languages (bitexts) (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 1997).
