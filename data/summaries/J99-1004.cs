Usually, the solution is computed by the EM algorithm with the following iteration (Baum 1972; Baker 1979; Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977): n ~E~k\[f(A ~ a;r)\]r C f~r~\] /gk+l(A ---+ o:) ---i=1 (7) // Ep~\[f(A; r)\]r E f~ri\] i=1 Like ~ in (5), pk for k > 0 impose proper probabifity distributions on f~ (Chi and Geman 1998).

A sufficient condition for proper assignment is established by Chi and Geman (1998), who prove that production probabilities estimated by the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation procedure (or relative frequency estimation procedure, as it is called in computational linguistics) always impose proper PCFG distributions.

Chi and Geman (1998) proved the properness of PCFG distributions imposed by estimated production probabilities, and around the same time S~nchez and Benedi (1997) established the subcriticality of the corresponding branching processes, hence their properness.

Proof The proof is almost identical to the one given by Chi and Geman (1998).

Among the most widely studied is the Gibbs distribution (Mark, Miller, and Grenander 1996; Mark et al.1996; Mark 1997; Abney 1997).
J97-4005
The theory has been applied in probabilistic language modeling (Mark, Miller, and Grenander 1996; Mark et al.1996; Johnson 1998), natural language processing (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996; Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Lafferty 1997), as well as computational vision (Zhu, Wu, and Mumford 1997).

This simple estimator, as shown by Chi and Geman (1998), assigns proper production probabilities for PCFGs.
