Some lexicon systems try to be reasonably theory-independent, though they still have to adopt some basic syntactic notions that locate them into a family of theories (Gofii and GonzAlez, 1995; Grimshaw and Jackendoff, 1985; Grishman et al., 1994).
C94-1042
So far, lexicons have been structured in syntactic inheritance hierarchies, in which more or less abstract syntactic classes form the upper nodes and actual words are associated with the leaf nodes (Flickinger and Nerbonne, 1992; Russell et al., 1992).
J92-3002 J92-3003
This theory guides the structuring of lexical information and also decides what information should be available to the user (Andry et al., 1992; Flickinger and Nerbonne, 1992; Mel'Suk and Polgu~re, 1987; Russell et ~l., 1992; Krieger and Nerbonne, 1991).
