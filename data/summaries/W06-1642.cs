For example, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) separated facts from opinions and assigned polarities only to opinions.

For example, Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) labeled adjectives as positive or negative, relying on semantic orientation.

The token precision is higher than 90% in all of the corpora, including the movie domain, which is considered to be difficult for SA (Turney, 2002).

Turney (2002) used collocation with “excellent” or “poor” to obtain positive and negative clues for document classification.

Extensive syntactic patterns enable us to detect sentiment expressions and to convert them into semantic structures with high precision, as reported by Kanayama et al.(2004). From the example Japanese sentence (1) in the digital camera domain, the SA system extracts a sentiment representation as (2), which consists of a predicate and an argument with positive (+) polarity.

Inter-sentential contexts as in our approach were used as a clue also for subjectivity analysis (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004), which is two-fold classification into subjective and objective sentences.
