For the purpose of comparison, we also ran the diversity based model as given in Nomoto and Matsumoto (2001c) and a tfidf based ranking model (Zechner, 1996) (call it Z model), which simply ranks sentences according to the tfidf score and selects those which rank highest.

Recall that the diversity based model (DBS) (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001c) consists in Find-Diversity and the ranking model by Zechner (1996), which they call Reduce-Redundancy.
