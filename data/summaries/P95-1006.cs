Gale (Gale et al., 1992) and Nasukawa (Nasukawa, 1993) reported that polysemous words within the same discourse have the same word sense with a high probability (98% according to (Gale et al., 1992),) and the results of our analysis indicate that most content words are frequently repeated in the discourse, as is shown in Table 1; moreover, collocation (modifier-modifiee relationship) patterns are also repeated frequently in the same discourse, as is shown in Figure 1.

To handle such sentences, most previous approaches apply various heuristic rules (Jensen et al., 1992; Douglas and Dale, 1992; Richardson and Braden-Harder, 1988), including • Relaxing constraints in the condition part of a grammatical rule, such as number and gender constraints • Joining partial parses by using meta rules.
