This gave rise to a relatively new research area within the emerging field of Textto-Text Generation (TTG) called Multiple-Choice Test Item Generation (MCTIG).1 Mitkov et al.(2006) developed a system which detects the important concepts in a text automatically and produces MCTIs testing explicitly conveyed factual knowledge.2 This differs from most related work in MCTIG such as Brown et al.(2005) and the papers in BEAUNLPII (2005) which deploy various NLP techniques to produce MCTIs for vocabulary assessment, often using preselected words as the input (see Mitkov et al.for more extensive comparisons).
