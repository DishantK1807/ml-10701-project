For example, EXDISCO (Yangarber et al., 2000) used Wall Street Journal articles for training.

Many research ideas have exploited the Web in unsupervised or weakly supervised algorithms for natural language processing (e.g., Resnik (1999), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), Keller and Lapata (2003)).

IE systems typically focus on information about events that are relevant to a specific domain, such as terrorism (Sundheim, 1992; Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Chieu et al., 2003), management succession (Sundheim, 1995; Yangarber et al., 2000), or job announcements (Califf and Mooney, 1999; Freitag and McCallum, 2000).

Work Unannotated texts have been used successfully for a variety of NLP tasks, including named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), subjectivity classification (Wiebe and Riloff, 2005), text classification (Nigam et al., 2000), and word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995).

Unannotated texts have been used for weakly supervised training of IE systems (Riloff, 1996) and in bootstrapping methods that begin with seed words or patterns (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000).

MUC-4 IE Task and Data The focus of our research is on the MUC-4 information extraction task (Sundheim, 1992), which is to extract information about terrorist events.

Indeed, many researchers have recently tapped the Web as a data-source for improving performance on NLP tasks (e.g., Resnik (1999), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), Keller and Lapata (2003)).

The best results reported across all string slots in MUC-4 were in the 50%-70% range for recall and precision (Sundheim, 1992), with most of the MUC-4 systems relying on heavily handengineered components.

Many recent approaches in natural language processing (Yarowsky, 1995; Collins and Singer, 1999; Riloff and Jones, 1999; Nigam et al., 2000; Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) have recognized the need to use unannotated data to improve performance.
P95-1026 W99-0613
Many IE systems use extraction patterns or rules to identify the relevant information (Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Yangarber et al., 2000).

Chieu et al.(2003) recently developed a fully automatic template generator for the MUC-4 IE task.
