Error intervals were computed using bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004b).

This reduction can be achieved by increasing training data or via morphologically driven preprocessing (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).

The Portage decoder, Canoe, is a dynamic-programming beam search algorithm, resembling the algorithm described in (Koehn, 2004a).
W04-3250
Decoding weights are optimized using Och’s algorithm (Och, 2003) to set weights for the four components of the log-linear model: language model, phrase translation model, distortion model, and word-length feature.

Recent publications on the effect of morphology on SMT quality focused on morphologically rich languages such as German (Nießen and Ney, 2004); Spanish, Catalan, and Serbian (Popovi´c and Ney, 2004); and Czech (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005).
H05-1085
Specifically considering Arabic, Lee (2004) investigated the use of automatic alignment of POS tagged English and affix-stem segmented Arabic to determine appropriate tokenizations.

We use the phrase-based SMT system, Portage (Sadat et al., 2005).
