Brill and Hladká (Haji et al., 1998) have first explored committee-based dependency parsing.
P98-1029
In all experiments, the TotPrecision voting scheme of (van Halteren et al., 1998) has been used.
P98-1081
Henderson and Brill (1999) also reported that context did not help them to outperform simple voting.

to related work Brill and Hladká in (Haji et al., 1998) were able to improve the original accuracy of the mc parser on PDT 0.5 e-test data from 79.1 to 79.9 (a nearly 4% reduction of the error rate).
P98-1029
This approach roughly corresponds to (Henderson and Brill, 1999)’s Naïve Bayes parse hybridization.
W99-0623
(Henderson and Brill, 1999) improved their best parser’s F-measure of 89.7 to 91.3, using their naïve Bayes voting on the Penn TreeBank constituent structures (16% error reduction).

Combination techniques have been successfully applied to part of speech tagging (van Halteren et al., 1998; Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 2001).

A successful application of voting and of a stacked classifier to constituent parsing followed in (Henderson and Brill, 1999).
W99-0623
Described in (Haji et al., 1998; Collins et al., 1999).
P99-1065
Parallel to (van Halteren et al., 1998), we ran experiments with two stacked classifiers, Memory-Based, and Decision-Tree-Based.

combining For applications preferring precision to recall, unbalanced combination — introduced by Brill and Hladká in (Haji et al., 1998) — may be of interest.

Similar advances have been made in machine translation (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), named entity recognition (Borthwick et al., 1998), partial parsing (Inui and Inui, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Florian and Yarowsky, 2002) and question answering (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003).

To some extent, we are porting the ideas of Henderson and Brill (1999) to the world of dependency structures.
