Independently, in artificial intelligence an effort arose to encode large amounts of commonsense knowledge (Hayes, 1979; Hobbs and Moore, 1985; Hobbs et al.1985). The research reported here represents a convergence of these various developments.

Since so many concepts used in discourse are graindependent, a theory of granularity is also fundamental (see Hobbs 1985b).
P85-1008
We can stipulate the time line to be linearly ordered (although it is not in approaches that build ignorance of relative times into the representation of time (e.g., Hobbs, 1974) nor in approaches employing branching futures (e.g., McDermott, 1985)), and we can stipulate it to be dense (although it is not in the situation calculus).
P85-1008
We are encoding the knowledge as axioms in what is for the most part a first-order logic, described by Hobbs (1985a), although quantification over predicates is sometimes convenient.
