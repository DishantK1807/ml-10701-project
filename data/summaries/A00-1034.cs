NE Segmentation through constrained HMM Our original HMM is similar to the Nymble \[Bikel et al.1997\] system that is based on bigram statistics.
A97-1029
The core module of the system is a bigram-based HMM \[Bikel et a1.1997\].
A97-1029
These include rule-based systems \[Krupka 1998\], Hidden Markov Models (HMM) \[Bikel et al.1997\] and Maximum Entropy Models (MaxEnt) \[Borthwick 1998\].

1 FST-based Pattern Matching Rules for Textract NE The most attractive feature of the FST (Finite State Transducer) formalism lies in its superior time and space efficiency \[Mohri 1997\] \[Roche & Schabes 1997\].
J97-2003
In addition, it has been verified by many research programs \[Krupka & Hausman 1998\] \[Hobbs 1993\] \[Silberztein 1998\] \[Srihari 1998\] \[Li & Srihari 2000\], that FST is also a convenient tool for capturing linguistic phenomena, especially for idioms and semi-productive expressions like time NEs and numerical NEs.
M98-1015
\[Borthwick et al.1998\] discuss a technique for combining the output of several NE taggers in a black box fashion by using MaxEnt.
M98-1018
A "global word sequence checking" \[Mikheev, 1999\] is also employed.
