The disambiguation is performed by a corpus-based method which relies on endogenous learning procedures (Bouriganlt, 1993; Ratnaparkhi, 1998).

The contribution of this paper is to propose an integrated platform for computer-aided term extraction and structuring that results from the combination of LEXTER, a Term Extraction tool (Bouriganlt et al., 1996), and FASTR 1, a Term Normalization tool (Jacquemin et al., 1997).
P97-1004
As reported in (Jacquemin, 1999), morphological and semantic variations are two other important families of term variations which can also be extracted by FASTR.
P99-1044
In the platform presented in this paper, term normalization is performed by FASTR, a shallow transformational parser which uses linguistic knowledge about the possible morpho-syntactic transformations of canonical terms (Jacquemin et al., 1997).

Terminology In the domain of corpus-based terminology two types of tools are currently developed: tools for automatic term extraction (Bourigault, 1993; Justeson and Katz, 1995; Daille, 1996; Brun, 1998) and tools for automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette, 1994).
