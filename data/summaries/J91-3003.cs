Moortgat (1987) and Aone and Wittenburg (1990) have presented systems that allow extended categorial grammars to operate at both the morphological and syntactic levels, but the operations that can be carried out by their extended sets of rules produce results very similar to the lexical operations we allow here.

A similar 306 Carpenter CG and HPSG with Lexical Rules restriction allows Aone and Wittenburg (1990) to pre-compile the results of closing a categorial lexicon under a set of morphological operations.

While our notation follows the usage of HPSG and Unification Categorial Grammar (Calder et al.1988), it should be clear how it relates to more traditional categorial grammar notation (see Bar-Hillel et al.1960). We assume the following schematic phrase structure rule that allows heads to combine with a single complement: Definition 1 b\[Cl,..., c,\] ~ b\[co,..., On\] CO In most categorial grammars and in HPSG, there are rules in which the complement category precedes the head, but we do not even need this much power.
