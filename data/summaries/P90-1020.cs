(Pereira, 1985, Karttunen, 1985, Boyer, 1988, Hirsh, 1988) for discussions of data-structures and compilation of FUGs).
P85-1016 P85-1017
The extended formalism described in this paper is implemented in Common Lisp using the Union-Find algorithm (Elhadad, 1988), as suggested in (Huet, 1976, Ait-Kaci, 1984, Escalada-Imaz & Ghallab, 1988) and is used in several research projects (Smadja & McKeown, 1990, Elhadad et al, 1989, McKeown & Elhadad, 1990, McKeown et al, 1991).
P90-1032
Most work in computational linguistics using a unification-based formalism (e.g., (Sag & Pollard, 1987, Uszkoreit, 1986, Karttunen, 1986, Kay, 1979, Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982)) does not make use of explicit typing.
C86-1045
It uses very few primitives, has a clean semantics (Pereira&Shieber, 1984, Kasper & Rounds, 1986, E1hadad, 1990), is monotonic, and grants equal status to function and structure in the descriptions.
P84-1027 P86-1038
In particular, one type of unification formalism, functional unification grammar (FUG) is widely used for text generation (Kay, 1979, McKeown, 1985, Appelt, 1985, Paris, 1987, McKeown & Elhadad, 1990) and is beginning to be used for parsing (Kay, 1985, Kasper, 1987).
P87-1014
One of the most attractive characteristics of FU is that non-atomic FDs can be abstractly viewed in two ways: either as a fiat list of equations or as a structure equivalent to a directed graph with labeled arcs (Karttunen, 1984).
P84-1008
We have implemented a functional unifier (EIhadad, 1988) covering all the features described in (Kay, 1979) and (McKeown & Paris, 1987).
