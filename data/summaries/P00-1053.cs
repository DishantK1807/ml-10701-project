Here, we compare VT to stack-based models of discourse structure based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) (G&S) focus spaces (e.g., Hahn and Strübe, 1997; Azzam, et al., 1998).

This is consistent with the distinction between "direct" and "indirect" references discussed in (Cristea, et al., 1998).

3 Similarly, the text in (2), taken from the MUC annotated corpus (Marcu, et al., 1999), was assigned the RST structure in Figure 4, which presents the same problem for the stack-based approach: the referent for this in C2 is to the Clinton program in A2, but because it is a subordinate segment, it is no longer on the stack when C2 is processed.

We compare VT to stack-based models based on Grosz and Sidner's (1986) focus spaces, and show how VT addresses the problem of "left satellites", i.e., subordinate discourse segments that appear prior to their nuclei (dominating segments) in the linear text.

Figure 3: RST analysis of (1) 3 Note that Moser and Moore (1996) also propose an informational RST structure for the same text, in which a « volitional-cause » relation holds between the nucleus a and the satellite b, thus providing for a to be on the stack when b is processed.

Details of the annotation process are given in (Marcu et al., 1999).

(Marcu, et al., 1999) show that over a corpus of texts drawn from MUC newspaper texts, the Wall Street Journal corpus, and the Brown Corpus, reliable agreement among annotators is consistently obtained for discourse segmentation and assignment of nuclear-satellite status, while agreement on rhetorical labeling was less reliable (statistically significant for only the MUC texts).

For example, one RST analysis of (1) proposed by Moser and Moore (1996) is given in Figure 3.
J96-3006
Moser and Moore note that the relation of an RST nucleus to its satellite is analogous to the dominates relation proposed by G&S (see also Marcu, 2000).
