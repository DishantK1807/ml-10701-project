Closer to our concerns is the study by Hachey et al.(2005) who apply AL to named entity (NE) annotation.

In their study on AL for base noun phrase chunking, Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) compare the costs of rule-writing with (AL-driven) annotation to compile a base noun phrase chunker.

While significant time savings have already been reported on the basis of automatic pre-tagging (e.g., for POS and parse tree taggings in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993), or named entity taggings for the Genia corpus (Ohta et al., 2002)), this kind of pre-processing does not reduce the number of text tokens actually to be considered.

However, it has been shown (Pierce and Cardie, 2001) that semi-supervised learning is brittle for NLP tasks where typically large amounts of high quality annotations are needed to train appropriate classifiers.

After an initialization phase needed by AL to take off (which can considerably be accelerated when one carefully selects the sentences of the first AL round, see Section 4.2), AL selects, by and large, only sentences which contain at least one entity mention of the type of inter10The named enatity tagger used throughout in this section is based on Conditional Random Fields and similar to the one presented by (Settles, 2004).

A common metric to estimate the disagreement within an ensemble is the so-called vote entropy, the entropy of the distribution of labels li assigned to an example e by the ensemble of k classifiers (Engelson and Dagan, 1996): D(e) = âˆ’ 1logksummationdisplay li V (li,e) k log V (li,e) k Our AL component employs such an ensemblebased approach (Tomanek et al., 2007).

After the success in syntactic (Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993)) and propositional encodings (Penn PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005)), more sophisticated semantic data (such as temporal (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) or opinion annotations (Wiebe et al., 2005)) and discourse data (e.g., for anaphora resolution (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) and rhetorical parsing (Carlson et al., 2003)) are being generated.

AL approaches have already been tried for different NLP tasks (Engelson and Dagan, 1996; Hwa, 2000; Ngai and Yarowsky, 2000), though such studies usually report on simulations rather than on concrete experience with AL for real annotation efforts.
