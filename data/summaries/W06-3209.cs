Locating irregular words could use methods similar to those of (Yarowsky and Wicentowski 2000), who pair irregular inflections and their roots from raw text.

with Linguistica In this section, we compare our system with Linguistica 3 (Goldsmith 2001), a freely available program for unsupervised discovery of morphological structure.

In section 6, we compare the probabilistic paradigm to the signature model of (Goldsmith 2001).

A paradigm lists the prototypical morphological properties of lexemes belonging to a particular part of speech (POS) category; for example, a paradigm for regular English verbs would include the suffixes {$,ed$,ing$,s$} 1. Hand-built computational implementations of paradigms as inheritance hierarchies include DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1996) and Functional Morphology (Forsberg and Ranta 2004).

These models include the signature of (Goldsmith 2001), the conflation set of (Schone and Jurafsky 2001), the paradigm of (Brent et.

We compare our system with Linguistica (Goldsmith 2001), and discuss the advantages of the probabilistic paradigm over Linguisticaâ€™s signature representation.
