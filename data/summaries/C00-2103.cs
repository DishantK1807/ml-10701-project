Disambiguation Algorithm In the implementation, an underspecified senlant;ie representation formalism is used to encode the source analysis and the transfer result for the target (the Verbmobil Interface Term (FIT) formalism (Bos el; al., 1998), which is based on the theory of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (Ileyle, 1995)).

In a first step, the source and target representations are converted into an abstract representation, using the VIT transfer forlnalism (Dorna and Emele, 1996).

rlk'anslation was perforined by the Verbmol)il transfer component (Dorna and Emele, 1996).

If translations can be aligned with the training data, it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which the model can be used to extract (parts of) the pertinent granularity information on temporal nouns from the corpus (Schiehlen, 1998).
