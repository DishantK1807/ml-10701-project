un~-erlangen de Abstract In tins paper, an architecture is presented for robust and portable summansatlon, COSY-MATS COSY-MATS Can avmd the superfimahty and domain-dependence of IE approaches by means of lngh-level (pragmatic and rhetorical) content selectmn features It can also obviate the text typedependence and cumbersome computation• revolved m NLU-based snmmansatl0n systems, because surface criteria are add~t~onally used m the content selectmn process, as are ~dent~fied mappings between those and the htgh-level features In ths way, COSY-MATS should retain ~ts generic and scalable character, wlnle also pernuttmg mtelhgent apphcatmn-spec~Sc processing 1 Motivations behind the Design of COSY-MATS The goal of the research reported here has been to develop a fleable, easdy-portable and scalable, but also efficient and robust, NLP system that automatically generates summaries of real-world unrestricted texts To tins effect, an archttecture was designed for a hybrid COnnectmmst-SYmbohc MAchine for Text Summansatlon (henceforth, COSY-1VIATS) (Axetoulah, 1996) A major concern m des~gmng COSY-MATS has been to identify content selectmn features that are generic and apphcatmn-mdependent (Section 2) The features should be apphcable to any text, Irrespective of domain or text type Tins is so that COSY-MATS 1s readdy portable to dflferent operation ehv~onments vath a nnmmum amount of cnstonnsa~ tton The isolation of such features would provzde a permanent infrastructure for both content selection and analysis The front-end text analysis modules can be developed so that they are geared towards the s,mmansatlon task, rather than text understandmg m general, wlnch is computatlonally-mteuslve Thus, these modules need only perform an analysis that 1s suiBc~ent for the evaluation of the selected content selectlon features The estabhshment of umversal unportance determlnatlon criteria means that the permanent set of analysis, interpretation, content selection and generation processors can be extended with apphcatlon-specfflc modules dunng the porting of COSY-MATS Tlns m also what renders COSY-MATS a type of summartsatson shell Slgmficantly, the computatlons of the supplementary modules wdl already be accommodated for m the standard flow of processing of the system by wrtue of these features (Section 3) Admittedly, the ldentxficatlon of content selectlon features of general apphcablhty is a very d,mcnlt task Tins is demonstrated m the lnmtatlons of the two mare trends m current surnmansatlon research (cf (Aretoulah, 1996)) There are In/ormatzon Eztrachon (Is) enwronments, wlnch perform a superiiclal and partial analysis of the input text based on the progressmn of keywords and apphcatmn-specfllc phrasal patterns thereto, e g (BT, 1994, Jacobs and Rau, 1990, L,lhn, 1958, MUC-5, 1993, Palce, 1981, Patce, 1990, Salton et al, 1994) The problem with IE systems ~s that, although they can be used very efllclently on any type of text, they are domain-dependent and hkely to produce maccurate output Ths ~s due to their excessive rehance on speclahsed content words There are also systems winch are based on Natural Language Understandsng (NLU) methods revolving deeper processmg Apart from syntactic and lexlco-semantlc analysis, the lnerarclncal rhetorical orgamsatlon of the source text can also be taken into account, as can certain aspects of the context of the dmcourse, e g (Ganghano et al, 1993, Lehnert, 1981, lVIltkov et al, 1994) Such more soplnstlcated types of system, however, are prohlbltlvely slow as a result of the extenmve processing revolved They are also very fragde, because the hlgh-level knowledge em• ployed is usually hand-coded and hence arbitrary and incomplete Even when this knowledge has been acqurred automatically, e g (Maybury, 1993, Soderland and Lehnert, 1994), it is apphcatlondependent Consequently, despite their occasional 74 I i i I l I I ! I domain-independence (e g (En&es-Nlggemeyer and Neugebauer, 1995, Ono et al, 1994, Rau et al, 1993, Sharp, 1991)), NLU approaches are ---on the whole-specmhsed m a particular text-type For the demgn of COSY-MATS, a ~o~$c and umfymg approach has been adopted that revolves both extrahngmst:c, NLU-type, analysts and selective statmt~cs-based lmgmst:c processing reminiscent of IZ, m co-ordination S~mdarly to NLU, analysts m COSY-MATS is sufl~cmntly deep for the semantic, rhetorical and contextual aspects of the input text to be considered m content selection In contrast to what the case ts with such systems, however, the computation of these d~verse aspects of the text ts efficmnt Thin ts because objective cues on the surface of the text are also explmted m COSY-MATS, echoing. the I~ approach Nevertheless, unhke rE, these cues are function words'and g~nenc content words winch point towards the ingh-level functmus of the respective textual umts m the context of the dmcourse, while at the same tnne being domain-independent Thus, apart from ldent~fymg umversal content selection criteria that should render COSY-MATS portable and scalable, the research reported here has also attempted to establtsh mappings between the concrete and the more abstract criteria m the devmed feature scheme, so that the system ts also mtelhgent and pruct~cnl, ~ e so that the evaluation of these abstract criteria ts fully automated (Section 2) 2 Intelligent Content Selection Criteria In order to identlfy generic content eelectlon features that can be used by COSY-MATS m any apphcatlon context, an extensive corpus analyms was camed out on a variety of real-world texts Three mare types of text have been analysed newspaper articles, sczent~fic papers and (s~entsfic) author abstracts The subcorpus of newspaper artxcles (160) m extremely dwerse m both ~ts content • and form The topics range from business news and legal reports to social commentary, me&cal msues and pohtlcs Slmalarly, the other two subcorpora constst of 170 articles and abstracts, respectxvely, that pertain to scmnttfic fields such as computer science, the natural scmnces, as well as pinlosophy and hngmstxcs In addltmn, the texts are of varying length from half a page m the case of the abstracts and most news agency reports, to four or more pages, when smentlfic papers and newspaper special reports are revolved Consequently, apart from covering a range of subject domama, the corpus used m designing the content selection processes m COSY-MATS a\]8o represents more than two text types The corpus was analysed both on the surface and on more abstract levels Given the chvermty of the types of text and the writing styles exh~inted m the corpus, regulantms regarding the rhetorical develop75 ment of the texts and the central mformat4onal umts thereto could not be easdy estabhshed 0nly m the case of the smenttfic papers and thetr abstracts could any statements be made on the logical progresmon of the presentation of the content, from the purpose of the research, to the methodology, the experimental set-up and the evaluation of any results (d (Gopink, 1972, Jordan, 1993, Lucas et ai, 1993, Mmzell et al, 1971)) The newspaper articles were mainly studmd m terms of groups of ad3acent sentences and the rhetoncal relatlonsinp between them (d (Ono et al, 1994)) No generahsatlons could be made regarding their top-level orgamsatlon A number of theories of pragmatlcs, dmcourse analyms and text development have prowded useful concepts for tins study of the corpus at a Ingher level • a) theories winch are preoccupmd with the comrnun:catsng agents, their goals, plans and behefs, such as Speech Act Theory (Austin, 1962, Searle, 1969), Rhetorical Structure Theory (RAT) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), or AI research on scripts (Lehnert, 1981, Schank and Abelson, 1977) and behef ascnptmn (Wdks and Balhm, 1987) • • b) theories on the tracking of the dsscourse h~tory by means of identlfymg the focused items thereto, e g (Grosz, 1986, Hobbs, 1978, Relchman, 1985, S1dner, 1983, Webber, 1983) • c) theories of cohesson and coherence and how these are m~mfested on the surface of the text, e g SysteInlc-~uuctlonal Lmgutstlcs (Halhday and Hasan, 1976) and the Problem-Solutmn mformation metastructure (Hoey, 1994, Jordan, 1984) (cf (Pmce, 1981)) The &verslty of the subject matter covered m the corpus has meant that specmhsed keywords were ignored m its analysm Instead the emphasts was placed on functlon words and.regular generallanguage content words winch are assooated wlth the mstantlatmn of the semantlc, rhetorical and pragmatlc functlous cous~dered Such lemcal xtems can be employed as markers, not only of the development of the dmcourse but also of the focused and central points thereto In thin process, the var1ous cohesion and coherence theorettlcal frameworks were very mfluentlal, as were the computatlonal approaches to focus pre&ctmn and identtficatmn As a result of thin corpus analysm at the sur-.
