State-of-the-art systems for unsupervised syntactic structure induction system uses models that are very different to these kinds of PCFGs (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2006).1 Our goal in this section is modest: we aim merely to provide an illustrative example of Bayesian inference using MCMC.

This algorithm appears fairly widely known: it was described by Goodman (1998) and Finkel et al (2006) and used by Ding et al (2005), and is very similar to other dynamic programming algorithms for CFGs, so we only summarize it here.

However, much recent work in machine learning and statistics has turned away from maximum-likelihood in favor of Bayesian methods, and there is increasing interest in Bayesian methods in computational linguistics as well (Finkel et al., 2006).
