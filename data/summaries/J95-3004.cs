Yarowsky (1992) proposed a method for sense disambiguation using wide contexts.
C92-2070
Another potentially problematic case is the coverage problem, that arises whenever we do not have enough data in the corpus for disambiguation of a certain word (see a discussion on this problem in Dagan, Itai, and Schwall \[1991\]).
P91-1017
In the context of machine translation, Dagan and Itai (Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994) used corpora in the target language to resolve ambiguities in the source language.
J94-4003 P91-1017
Methods using the short context of a word in order to resolve ambiguity (usually categorical ambiguity) are very common in English and other languages (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Karlsson 1990).

A much simpler problem occurs in English, where for some words the correct syntactic tag is necessary for pronunciation (Church 1988).
A88-1019
These methods have reported performance in the range of 95-99% "correct" by word (DeRose 1988; Cutting et al.1992; Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992; Kupiec 1992).
