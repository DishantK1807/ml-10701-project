Surely we cannot reasonably expect that the manual annotation of one billion words along with corresponding parse trees will occur any time soon (but see (Banko and Brill 2001) for a discussion that this might not be completely infeasible).

Marialdo's HMM part-of-speech tagger training (1994), Charniak's parser retraining experiment (1996), Yarowsky's seeds for word sense disambiguation (1995) and Nigam et al's (1998) topic classifier learned in part from unlabelled documents.

The more recent set of techniques includes mult iplicative weightupdate algorithms (Golding and Roth, 1998), latent semantic analysis (Jones and Martin, 1997), transformation-based learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997), differential grammars (Powers, 1997), decision lists (Yarowsky, 1994), and a variety of Bayesian classifiers (Gale et al., 1993, Golding, 1995, Golding and Schabes, 1996).

The complementarity between two learners was defined by Brill and Wu (1998) in order to quantify the percentage of time when one system is wrong, that another system is correct, and therefore providing an upper bound on combination accuracy.

Efficacy of Voting Voting has proven to be an effective technique for improving classifier accuracy for many applications, including part-of-speech tagging (van Halteren, et al, 1998), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999), and word sense disambiguation (Pederson, 2000).
