Nevertheless, this taxonomy can be used to identify 'lexical conceptual paradigms' (Pustejovsky & Anick, 1988); for example, there is a class 'beverages' (147 word senses), a class 'motion pictures' (113 word senses), and a class 'literature' (377 word senses).

It can be seen as a further contribution to the use of unification-based formahsms in linguistic description and specifically as an enriching of the minimal sort-based lexical semantic taxonomy incorporated into the Esprit ACORD system (Moens et al., 1989) and the SRI (Cambridge) CLE system (Alshawi et al., 1989).

Pustejovsky (1989, 1989b) and Pustejovsky & Anick (1988) propose that the lexical representation of nouns is enriched to include a specification of processes typically associated with the objects they denote and that, in cases of coercion, this information is utilised.

Thus, we are lead to an 'ontologically promiscuous' semantics (Hobbs, 1985).
