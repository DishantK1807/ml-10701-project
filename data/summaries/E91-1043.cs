Therefore, inconsistencies of the language behaviour of the system can be avoided (Jacobs 1988).

In Finkler and Neumann (1989) and Neumann and Finkler (1990) we have already described an implemented generation system (named POPEL-HOW) that realizes an incremental and bidirectional flow of control based on a uniform parallel processing model.

6Basic ideas of the approach are influenced by the head-driven parser of Proudian and Pollard (1985).

245 Currently developed approaches that consider parsing as well as generation (e.g., Shieber 1988; Shieber et al.1990; Dymetman et al.1990; van Noord 1990; Zajac and Emele 1990) assume: ° that both tasks take place independently from each other, i.e. an utterance is either generated or parsed and • that grammatical processing can be performed without considerations of discourse.

Recently, there are first approaches to uniform architectures for grammaticallprocessing (e.g., Shieber 1988; Dymetman and Isabelle 1988; Dymetman et al.1990). These architectures are based on Pereira and lWarren's (1983) paradigm of parsing as deduction.

As McDonald et al.(1987) define, one generator design is more efficient than another, if it is able to solve the same problem with fewer steps.

Hoeppner et al.1983; Busemann and Hauenschild 1988; Allgayer et al.1989) Currently, it is an open question what degree of bidirectionality should or could be desired (cf.

But in some research areas uniform processing models have been developed that are based on formalisms which are well suited for uniform irepresentation and processing, e.g., Koskenniemi's (1984) two-level model of morphology.

A fundamental requirement of a bidirectional knowledge base is that it be represented declaratively (Appelt 1987).

Theoretically, the assumption of common knowledge sources for both generation and analysis is essential for the view of language as "an interpersonal medium and an interface to thought" (McDonald 1987).
