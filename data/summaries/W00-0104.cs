In particular, we like to test whether our method extracts the same groups of senses which human annotators disagreed (Ng et al., 1999).

Indeed, recent studies in WSD show that, when sense definitions are fine-grained, similar senses become indistinguishable to human annotators and often cause disagreement on the correct tag (Ng et al., 1999; Veronis, 1998; Kilgarriff, 1998b).

Our method uses a modification of a tree generalization technique used in (Li and Abe, 1998), and generates a tree-cut, which is a list of clusters that partition a tree.

MDL Principle To select the best tree-cut model, (Li and Abe, 1998) uses the Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1978).

This algorithm, called Find-MDL in (Li and Abe, 1998), finds the best tree-cut for a tree by recursively finding the best tree-cuts for all of its subtrees and merging them from bottom up.

Systematic Polysemy 3.1 Generalization Technique Using the generalization technique in (Li and Abe, 1998) described in the previous section, we wish to extract systematic polysemy automatically from WordNet.

particular, (Buitelaar, 1997, 1998) identified systematic relations that exist between abstract semantic concepts in the WordNet noun hierarchy, and defined a set of underspecified semantic classes that represent the relations.
W97-0205
In (Li and Abe, 1998), this generalization problem is viewed as a problem of selecting the best model for a tree-cut that estimates the true probability distribution, given a sample corpus data.
J98-2002
The problem is that, when the granularity of the abstract classes is too coarse, systematic relations defined at that level may not hold uniformly at more fine-grained levels (Vossen et al., 1999).

A similar effort was also made in the EuroWordnet project (Vossen et al., 1999).

Generalization using Tree-cut and MDL Before we present our method, we first give a brief summary of the tree-cut technique which we adopted from (Li and Abe, 1998).
