Domains This is an unsupervised WSD method based on the WordNet Domains lexical resource (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000).

This resource has already been used on Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strapparava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses information.

Our systems use both corpus-based and knowledge-based approaches: Maximum Entropy(ME) (Lau et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998) is a corpus-based and supervised method based on linguistic features; ME is the core of a bootstrapping algorithm that we call re-training inspired ‚ÅÑ This paper has been partially supported by the Spanish Government (CICyT) under project number TIC-2003-7180 and the Valencia Government (OCyT) under project number CTIDIB-2002-151 by co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998); Relevant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al., 2003) is a resource built from WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) that is used in an unsupervised method that assigns domain and sense labels; Specification Marks(SP) (Montoyo and Palomar, 2000) exploits the relations between synsets stored in WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) and does not need any training corpora; Commutative Test (CT) (Nica et al., 2003), based on the Sense Discriminators device derived from EWN (Vossen, 1998), disambiguates nouns inside their syntactic patterns, with the help of information extracted from raw corpus.
