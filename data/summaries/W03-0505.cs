The other main LT TTT program is ltpos, a statistical combined part-of-speech (POS) tagger and sentence identifier (Mikheev, 1997).

Table 3 compares precision, recall, and F scores for our system with CoNLL-2001 results training on sections 15-18 of the Penn Treebank and testing on section 21 (Marcus et al., 1993).
J93-2004
Teufel et al.(1999) do not explicitly use tense information in their heuristic categories.

The first two phases are approached as straightforward classification in a maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996).

cue phrases such as ‘the importance of’, ‘to summarise’, ‘we disagree’) (Teufel and Moens, 2002), (Teufel and Moens, 2000).

Our methodology builds and extends the Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 2002) approach to automatic summarisation.
J02-4002
We pursue a methodology based on Teufel and Moens (2002) where sentences are classified according to their argumentative role.
J02-4002
Although there is a significant distance in style between scientific articles and legal texts, we have found it useful to build upon the work of Teufel and Moens (Teufel and Moens, 2002; Teufel and Moens, 1997) and to pursue the methodology of investigating the usefulness of a range of features in determining the argumentative role of a sentence.
J02-4002 W97-0710
The argumentative roles which Teufel and Moens settled upon for the scientific domain (Teufel and Moens, 1999) consist of three main categories: BACKGROUND: sentences which describe some (generally accepted) background knowledge.
E99-1015
A state-of-the-art approach is included in our XML pipeline (Mikheev, 2002).
