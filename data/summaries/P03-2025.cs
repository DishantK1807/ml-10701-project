Translation Query translation ambiguity can be drastically mitigated by considering the query as a phrase and restricting the single term translation to those candidates that were selected by the proposed combined statistics-based and linguistics-based approach (Sadat et al., 2003).

2.1 Two-stages Comparable Corpora-based Approach The proposed two-stages approach on bilingual terminology acquisition and disambiguation from comparable corpora (Sadat et al., 2003) is described as follows: Bilingual terminology acquisition from source language to target language to yield a first translation model, represented by similarity vectors SIMS!T. Bilingual terminology acquisition from target language to source language to yield a second translation model, represented by similarity vectors SIMT!S.

Japanese adverbs and adjectives are compared to English adverbs and adjectives, because of the close relationship between adverbs and adjectives in Japanese (Sadat et al., 2003).

Merge the first and second models to yield a twostages translation model, based on bi-directional comparable corpora and represented by similarity vectors SIM(S$T . We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al., 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second models and propose a merging and disambiguation process for the two-stages translation model.

In addition, non-aligned comparable corpora have been given a special interest in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexical resources enrichment (Dejean et al., 2002; Fung, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1999).
