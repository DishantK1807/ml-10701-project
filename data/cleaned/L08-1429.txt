<context>ng.upenn.edu Abstract This paper presents a corpus study of parenthetical constructions in two different corpora: the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, (PDTBGroup, 2008)) and the RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001). The motivation for the study is to gain a better understanding of the rhetorical properties of parentheticals in order to enable a natural language generation system to produce parentheticals as pa</context>
<context> study is to take this first step by examining the rhetorical context of parentheticals. We describe a corpus study on two differently annotated discourse treebanks: the RST Discourse Treebank (RST, (Carlson et al., 2001)) and the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB, (PDTB-Group, 2008)). We show how parentheticals can be extracted from these treebanks and identify the discourse relations whose arguments are realized as par</context>
<context>rpora. Section 5. discusses our findings and shows how the results of the study can be used to inform a natural language generation system. 3. Corpus Study on RST Treebank The RST Discourse Treebank (Carlson et al., 2001) consists of 385 Wall Street Journal texts from the Penn Treebank, segmented into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) and annotated with rhetorical relations (78 different relations in total).
