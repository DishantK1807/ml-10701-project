Other applications of NEs are in Question Answering (Mann, 2002; P´erez-Couti˜no et al., 2004) and Machine Translation (Babych and Hartley, 2003).

(Bikel et al., 1997) and (Bikel et al., 1999) are other examples of the use of HMMs.

Given the usefulness of Named Entities (NEs) in many natural language processing tasks, there has been a lot of work aimed at developing accurate named entity extractors (Borthwick, 1999; Velardi et al., 2001; Ar´evalo et al., 2002; Zhou and Su, 2002; Florian, 2002; Zhang and Johnson, 2003).

For instance, Zhou and Su trained HMM with a set of attributes combining internal features such as gazetteer information, and external features such as the context of other NEs already recognized (Zhou and Su, 2002).

Carreras et al.presented results of a NER system for Catalan using Spanish resources (Carreras et al., 2003a).

In contrast to other methods we do not perform binary classifications, as (Carreras et al., 2003b), thus we do not build specialized classifiers for each of the tags.
