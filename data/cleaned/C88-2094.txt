First, I would like to say why I do care E.~mmmr formalisms.
The point is not only tha%-I was %ra.ined as a student of linguist-ics and %hat I always ha.re been interested in theor~l Lcal ling'uJ, stics, but in the present context a.\]SO ) and main\].~ ~ that natu:e&:\[ \].anguage processing systems mostly a~'e too complex to be bui\].t, modified, comp\].emented, enriched.,., o, without a solid theoretical baekground~ As Prof.Nagao puts it, theory Js important and valuable for the explanaJ;ion ~).nd undcrsta.nding~ a.

~heu\].d be understandable on the bachground (,f a powerful \].inguistic theory.
On the other hand~ :\[ would lille I;o stress that if lin~gtlJllties wants -to be nsefu\], a~l\] to lllaqke safe its own perspeet:ives, then it has to be useful for :l.l.ng!\igi~J_~ q en__q6~ineeri_q C.
Thie means for me that; the theory has 9o bc not o.nly adequate, hut also economical and merlu\]ar.
The t},s\]~ of the theory is to offer a re\].ativel:7 complete framework, which never captures all th.e detai\].s in their specific and often exeept:i, ona\].

The most important peint is that the meshes are there, and we know wbere \[;hey are and for what purpose "they might be 'useful° 2o The formalism is /tot the only import~ln~ ingredieni; of a.n NLP system, and it Is not interesting here for its own ~akeo :\[% is true that %he bottleneck of an NLP system Is in hanjling-the "dirty" exceptional cases, ra'ther "i;han the cases dlreet\].y fitting into the main body of this or tha,% theory.
As a ma-l;%er of fact, using any theory, we have.
%o.face such intricate but common examples as Kirschner's cases of target language amblguity (or vagueness) corresponding e.g. to that of F, nglish,i.n_~\[-forms, or the long but lexiea\]ly bound sequences of nouns in termino\].ogioal noun groups, or a procedure translating \].exieal items by modifying the productive affixes of int.ernational terms of (\]reek and \],atin origin and other "emergency rules" ensuring that 6t leas% an approximate (at leatvt partially readable) output will be ae h i e w~, (',.
o 3o A\],\] this heavily sUppo:P't;s the a:egumen% that t})e theoretical framework sheu\].d be relatively eeonomi.ta!o If two theories~ which in the given conditions cannot be systematica\].ly compared with respect to their oover~ge ~ seem %o exhibit a more or less equal degree of ad.equaoy ~ 1;hen %be simpler one will be preferred.
With this framework it is more probable that %here would be space enough for cap%firing all the necessany "dirty" del;ails illustrated in Section 2o Dep_ende__nn£;f.
grammar meets %his condition, since its trees (or even the more comp\]ex representations required for a treatment of coordinated structures) are much s:lmplcr than any kind of phrase--structure baecd represen-.
ta%ions: it is pom~ible to use here comp\].ex (although strictly limited) node labc\]s and i;hus dJstlnguish between the syntactically free lexiea.\] oectn, renees and function morphemes (the latter used not have nodes of %heir own); moreover, the representations can be conceived of without nonterminal symbols (if the kinds of dependency re\];v~Jon, similar e.g. to %hera roles, cases, an@ vs\]ency, a~.-~'e denoted by the labels of the edges)° II.
