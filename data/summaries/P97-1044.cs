Hepple (1996) shows how deductions in implicational linear logic can be recast as deductions involving only first-order formulae.

9 10 Conclusion We have shown how the linear categorial deduction method of (Hepple, 1996) can be modified to allow incremental derivation, and specified an incremental normal form for proofs of the system.
C96-1091
Although we have adapted the (Hepple, 1996) approach to allow flexibility in deduction, the applicability of the notion 'leftbranching' is not clear since it describes the form of structures built in proof systems where formulae are placed in a linear order, with combination dependent on adjacency.

Note that the extent of incrementality allowed by using 'generalised composition' in the compiled firstorder system should not be equated with that which 7For an example of a system allowing word-by-word incrementality, see (Milward, 1995).

These modifications, however, give a system which suffers 2See, for example, the formalisms developed in (Moortgat & Morrill, 1991), (Moortgat & Oehrle, 1994), (Morrill, 1994), (Hepple, 1995).

In what follows, we show how the method of (Hepple, 1996) can be modified to allow processing which has a high degree of incrementality.

Hepple (1996) introduces a linear deduction method, involving compilation to first order formulae, which can be combined with various labelling disciplines.

See (Hepple, 1996) for more details, including a precise statement of the compilation procedure.

Morrill (1995) shows how types of the associative Lambek calculus may be translated to labelled implicational linear types, with deduction implemented via a version of SLD resolution.

In this paper, the approach of (Hepple, 1996) is modified to yield a linear deduction system that does allow flexible deduction and hence incremental processing, but that hence also suffers the problem of 'spurious ambiguity'.
