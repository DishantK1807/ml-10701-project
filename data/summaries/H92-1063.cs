Earlier papers have focused on the probabilistic aspects of the system \[Weischedel et al., 1991; de Marcken, 1990\]; here we focus on the other two design features.
H91-1037
Based on local syntactic and semantic information, a fragment combining algorithm combines phrases to provide more complete analyses of the input \[Weischedel, et al., 1991a\].
H91-1037
Though we have not (yet) made substantial changes to the parsing code nor to the grammar, we are replacing his "disambiguator", which deals with part-of-speech ambiguity with our stochastic part-of-speech tagger (POST) \[Meteer, et al.1991\]. The resulting syntactic component is named the Fast Partial Parser (FPP).

(Jacobs et al.\[1991\] estimate that 75% of the words in these MUC texts are not relevant).
H91-1066
The fragment combining rules were as follows ranked by frequency of occurrence in the experiment are as follows: PP attachment to an NP (55%) PP attachment to a VP (14%) merging of several N's into a single NP (13%) combing appositive NPs (7%) attaching a conjoined NP (6%) PP attachment to an ADJP (3%) attaching time NP to VP (1%) repairing dates (< 1%) To evaluate the relative contribution of the deterministic parser and the fragment combining component, we used recently developed grammar evaluation software \[Black, et al., 1991\].
H91-1060
Discourse processing would normally look for entities to fill roles in stated predicates, as Hobbs \[1989, 1988\] has argued.
P88-1012
The novel aspect in PLUM is that the case frames for verbs were hypothesized by a statistical induction algorithm \[Weischedel, et al., 1991a\].
