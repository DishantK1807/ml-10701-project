Introduction
The papers in these proceedings were presented at the Coling 2008 workshop on human judgements in
Computational Linguistics, held in Manchester on 23 August 2008.
Human judgements play a key role in the development and the assessment of linguistic resources and
methods in Computational Linguistics. They are commonly used in the creation of lexical resources
and corpus annotation, and also in the evaluation of automatic approaches to linguistic tasks: In the
developmental phase, human judgements help to define an inventory of categories as well as robust
annotation criteria, and in the assessment phase they are used to evaluate the results of automatic
systems against existing linguistic standards. Furthermore, systematically collected human judgements
provide clues for research on linguistic issues that underlie the judgement task, providing insights
complementary to introspective analysis or evidence gathered from corpora.
The workshop included papers about experiments that collect human judgements for Computational
Linguistic purposes. A particular focus of the workshop was concerned with human judgements on
‘controversial’ linguistic tasks (those that are not clear from a theoretical point of view, such as many
tasks having to do with semantics or pragmatics). Such experimental tasks are usually difficult to design
and interpret, and they typically result in low agreement scores. They are often poorly documented in
the literature; however, they are especially well-suited as a basis for a fruitful discussion.
We were pleased to receive 22 submissions, of which we accepted eight papers for presentation at the
workshop. We would like to thank the program committee for the excellent job they did in reviewing
the submissions. As well as the paper presentations, the workshop also included a keynote talk by
Martha Palmer of the University of Colorado at Boulder. These proceedings include an abstract of her
talk.
The workshop was supported by the Spanish Education and Science Ministry via the KNOW project
(TIN2006-15049-C03-03) and by Sonderforschungsbereich 732, Universit¨at Stuttgart.
