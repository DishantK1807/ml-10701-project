There have been successful attempts to automatically detect the ethnic group of a proper name for use in anglophone countries like the United States, and to apply a different set of rules depending on that group (Church 1985, Vitale 1991).

Nevertheless, there have been some important studies done on grapheme-phoneme correspondences in past years; for English: Ainsworth (1973), Bakiri and Dietterich (1991), Bernstein and Nessly (1981), Elovitz et al.(1976), Hertz (1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985), Hunnicutt (1976, 1980), Levin (1963), McCormick and Hertz (1989), McIlroy (1974), O'Malley (1990), Venezky (1962, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c, 1970), Venezky and Weir (1966), Vitale (1991), Weir (1964); for French: Auberg4 (1991), B4chet, Spriet, and E1-B~ze (1996), Catach (1989), Catach and Catach (1992), Cotto (1992), Divay (1984, 1985, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1994), Laporte (1988), Prouts (1980), Yvon (1996).

For example, there are roughly 1.5 million different surnames in the US alone (Spiegel 1985; Spiegel and Machi 1990; Vitale 1991); moreover, one-third of these surnames are unique in that they are singletons.
