These are most directly presented in Ostler and Atkins (1991).

Within this class would fall the Lexical Implication Rules (LIRs) of Ostler and Atkins (1991), the lexical rules of Copestake and Briscoe (1991), the Generative Lexicon of Pustejovsky (1995), and the ellipsis recovery procedUres of Viegas and Nirenburg (1995).

Copestake and Briscoe (1991) mention that they regard the metaphoric extension involving use of a word denoting an animal to refer to humans as involving a core component that should be expressed as a lexical rule (1991:89).

They state the semantic constraint as applying to containers (especially all purpose-built ones) as well as some other items that can be viewed as containers (e.g., spade, spoon, fork, hand, fist, belly) (Ostler and Atkins, 1991:78).

We find less antithetical to our viewpoint the emphasis on the computational value of lexical rules (Viegas et al., 1996) and on ellipsis recovery as triggered by syntactic/lexical cues and accomplished through contextual means (Viegas & Nirenburg, 1995).
P96-1005
For example, Copestake and Briscoe (1991) discusses primarily the grinding rule, which creates a mass noun denoting substance out of a count noun.

Our account constrasts with that of, say, Hobbs et al.(1987) who posit an underspecified and impoverished lexical semantic representation which is enriched through an open-ended process of abductive or deductive reasoning with world (or domain) knowledge" (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991:88).

As the field of NLP has matured, the nature of the problem of sense disambiguation for lexical items has become clearer (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991; Levin, 1993; Nirenburg 1996; Pustejovsky & Bergler, 1992; 1.

(LOB corpus via Briscoe and Copestake, 1991:97) Ostler and Atkins point to the exceptions to the food--substance rule such as pea, bean, and lentil (that is, it is not usual to say, Have some more pea).
