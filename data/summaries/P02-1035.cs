Furthermore, properties refering to lexical elements based on an auxiliary distribution approach as presented in Riezler et al.(2000) are included in the model.

Estimation Discriminative estimation techniques have recently received great attention in the statistical machine learning community and have already been applied to statistical parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Collins, 2000; Collins and Duffy, 2001).

The lower reduction in error rate relative to the upper bound for DR evaluation on the Brown corpus can be attributed to a corpus effect that has also been observed by Gildea (2001) for training and testing PCFGs on the WSJ and Brown corpora.5 Breaking down results according to parse quality shows that irrespective of evaluation measure and corpus, around 4% overall performance is lost due to non-full parses, i.e.

The approach presented in this paper is a first attempt to scale up stochastic parsing systems based on linguistically fine-grained handcoded grammars to the UPenn Wall Street Journal (henceforth WSJ) treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).

Then P( ) can be defined for a conditional exponential model p (zjy) as: P( ) = L( ) G( ) = log mY j=1 p (zjjyj) + nX i=1 2i 2 2i = mX j=1 log P X(yj;zj)e f(x) P X(yj)e f(x) + nX i=1 2i 2 2i = mX j=1 log X X(yj;zj) e f(x) + mX j=1 log X X(yj) e f(x) + nX i=1 2i 2 2i : Intuitively, the goal of estimation is to find model pa1An earlier approach using partially labeled data for estimating stochastics parsers is Pereira and Schabesâ€™s (1992) work on training PCFG from partially bracketed data.

In our experiments, we used around 1000 complex property-functions comprising information about c-structure, f-structure, and lexical elements in parses, similar to the properties used in Johnson et al.(1999). For example, there are property functions for c-structure nodes and c-structure subtrees, indicating attachment preferences.

Rather, parameter estimation for such models had to resort to unsupervised techniques (Bouma et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2000), or training corpora tailored to the specific grammars had to be created by parsing and manual disambiguation, resulting in relatively small training sets of around 1,000 sentences (Johnson et al., 1999).
