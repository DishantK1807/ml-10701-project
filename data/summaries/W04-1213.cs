Song et al.(2004) exploited automatically generated virtual examples and reported good e ect on both recall and precision.

HMMs were employed by one system in isolation (Zhao, 2004) and by two systems in combination with SVMs (Zhou and Su, 2004; R ossler, 2004).
W04-1216 W04-1219
Part-of-speech information was incorporated in ve systems: four of them utilized domainspecialized part-of-speech taggers (Zhou and Su, 2004; Finkel et al., 2004; Song et al., 2004; Park et al., 2004) and the other utilized generalpurpose taggers (Lee et al., 2004).

It seems (Zhou and Su, 2004) overcomes the drawback of SVMs by mapping the SVM output into probability, and complementing it with Markov models.
W04-1219
Similarly, CRFs were employed by one system in isolation (Settles, 2004) and by another system in combination with SVMs (Song et al., 2004).
W04-1220 W04-1221
It is somewhat surprising that Maximum Entropy Models were applied by only one system (Finkel et al., 2004), while it was the most successfully applied model in the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task of Named Entity Recognition, and at this time also the MEMM system yields quite good performance.

Lee et al.(2004) suggests the use of external protein/gene taggers instead of using gazetteers.
W04-1215
However, one participant (Settles, 2004) reported that their attempt to utilize gazetteers (together with other resources) had failed in gaining better overall performance.
W04-1221
Zhao (2004) reports about the usefulness of unlabeled MEDLINE corpus as a complement to expensive and limited size of labeled corpus.
W04-1216
Finkel et al.(2004) exploited BNC corpus and World Wide Web as knowledge sources and achieved good performance., but the e ectiveness of the use of such resources was not clearly examined.
W04-1217
Park et al.(2004) suggested the use of word variation features, a unique way of selecting substrings from words, but the effectiveness was not reported.
W04-1214
Settles (2004)’s CRF system deserves special note in the sense that it achieved comparable performance to top ranked systems with a rather simple feature set.
W04-1221
Lee et al.(2004) utilized external protein and gene taggers instead of using gazetteers but the e ectiveness was not reported.
W04-1215
Park et al.(2004) reports their e orts to nd out useful information by corpus comparison.
W04-1214
(MUC, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003)) that has led to ‘near human’ levels of performance, measured in the high 90s for Fscore (van Rijsbergen, 1979), similar methods have not performed so well in the bio-domain leaving an accuracy gap of some 30 points of Fscore.
W03-0419
As the resulting performance may not seem very successful, other systems suggest interesting approaches: Song et al.(2004) reports about the e ectiveness of using virtual examples.
W04-1220
Finkel et al.(2004) explicitly pointed out the problem of \abusing" positive information with regard to using gazetteers, and utilized frequency information from BNC corpus to prevent such \abusement".
W04-1217
The most frequently applied 72 models were SVMs with totally ve systems adopting SVMs as the classi cation models either in isolation (Park et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004) or in combination with other models (Zhou and Su, 2004; Song et al., 2004; R ossler, 2004).
