This is discussed in more detail elsewhere (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio, 1996), but in short, we input our 350 coded examples to Quinlan's C4.5 learning algorithm (Quinlan, 1993), which induces a decision tree mapping from the functional features to the appropriate form.

We are currently using this information to drive the generation of warning messages in the DRAFTER system (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio, 1996).

In computational linguistics, on the other hand, positive imperatives have been extensively investigated, both from the point of view of interpretation (Vere and Bickmore, 1990; Alterman et al., 1991; Chapman, 1991; Di Eugenio, 1993) and generation (Mellish and Evans, 1989; McKeown et al., 1990; Paris et al., 1995; Vander Linden and Martin, 1995).

The first task, which is commonly achieved by giving simple imperative commands and statements of purpose, has received considerable attention in both the interpretation (e.g., (Di Eugenio, 1993)) and the generation communities (e.g., (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995)).

To support a more rigorous analysis, however, wc have followed Carletta's suggestion (1996) of using the K coettMcnt (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) as a measure of coder agreement.
J96-2004
We have successfully used the correlations discussed here to support the generation of warning messages in the DRAFTER project (Paris and Vander Linden, 1996).
