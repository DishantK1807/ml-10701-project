For example, both (Holzapfel et al., 2004) and (Johnston, 1998) essentially adapt Earleyâ€™s chart parser by representing edges as sets of references to terminal input elements unifying these as new edges are added to the agenda.

For example, the representational differences between neural networks, decision trees, and finite-state machines (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000) have limited the adoption of the results using these models, and the typical reliance on the use of whole unimodal sentences defeats one of the main advantages of MMI the ability to constrain the search using cross-modal information as early as possible.

Thisiscontrasted with the all-paths bottom-up strategy in GEMINI (Dowding et al, 1993) that finds all admissable edges of the grammar.
