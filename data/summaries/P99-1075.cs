For realizing efficient NLP systems, I am currently building an efficient parser by integrating the packing method with the compilation method for HPSG (Torisawa and Tsujii, 1996).

unification of disjunctive feature structures (Kasper and Rounds, 1986; Hasida, 1986; DSrre and Eisele, 1990; Nakano, 1991; Blache, 1997; Blache, 1998).

Griffith (Griffith, 1995; Griffith, 1996) points out the same problem and proposes a compilation method for feature structures called modularization.

I implemented the algorithms for packing and unification in LiLFeS (Makino et al., 1998).
