The English sentences were parsed using the Bikel parser (Bikel, 2004), and the sentences were aligned with GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).

1(Chiang, 2005) also reports that with his hierarchical generalization of the phrase-based approach, the addition of parser information doesnâ€™t lead to any improvements.

However, attempts to retrofit syntactic information into the phrase-based paradigm have not met with enormous success (Koehn et al., 2003; Och et al., 2003)1, and purely phrase-based machine translation systems continue to outperform these syntax/phrase-based hybrids.

Machine translation based on a deeper analysis of the syntactic structure of a sentence has long been identified as a desirable objective in principle (consider (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001)).

Statistical machine translation has, for a while now, been dominated by the phrase-based translation paradigm (Och and Ney, 2003).
