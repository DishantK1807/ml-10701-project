As known from work on unsupervised part-of-speech tagging (Rohwer and Freitag, 2004; Rapp, 2005), the size of the window in which words will be found similar to the target word plays a decisive role.

This method has been successfully used by other authors as well (Purandare, 2004; Ferret, 2004) because it is straightforward and produces intuitive numbers that help to directly estimate whether the output of a WSI algorithm is meaningful.

The input to a WSI algorithm is a target word to be disambiguated, e.g. 1Sometimes called word sense discovery (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) or word sense discrimination (Purandare, 2004; Velldal, 2005) space, and the output is a number of word sets representing the various senses, e.g.

The significance values are obtained using the loglikelihood measure assuming a binomial distribution for the unrelatedness hypothesis (Dunning, 1993).

It is also possible to use graph-based clustering techniques to obtain sense representations based on sub-graph density measures (Dorow and Widdows, 2003; Bordag, 2003).

They are all based on co-occurrence statistics, albeit using different context representations such as co-occurrence of words within phrases (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Dorow and Widdows, 2003; Velldal, 2005), bigrams (SchÂ¨utze, 1998; Neill, 2002; Udani et al., 2005), small windows around a word (Gauch and Futrelle, 1993), or larger contexts such as sentences (Bordag, 2003; Rapp, 2004) or large windows of up to 20 words (Ferret, 2004).

This is not surprising, since with the low frequency words, each occuring only about50times in the BNC, the algorithm runs into the data sparseness problem that has already been pointed out as problematic for WSI (Ferret, 2004).

However, as also pointed out by Yarowsky (1995), this observation does not hold uniformly over all possible co-occurrences of two words.

These reasons have led some researchers to opt for a manual evaluation of their algorithms (Neill, 2002; Rapp, 2004; Udani et al., 2005).
