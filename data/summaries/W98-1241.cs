In Powers (1997a) both 'y' and space were identified as vowels using certain clustering techniques and methods (and the issues are discussed in that paper).

The approach used by Powers (1997b) is only intended to identify typing errors and substitution errors (e.g.

At the same time however, Entwisle and Groves (1994), Powers (1997"o) and Entwisle and Posers (1997) have produced a constraint Powers 308 Unsupervised Clustering, Segmentation and Cohesion I I I l I I I I | I II II II II II II II II II Ii II parser which uses precisely the kind of morphological and grammatical classes which are thro:wn, up by the selforganizing and clustering experiments, and have started to address how one develop meaningful statistics for a true grammar learning system without any preconceived notions of what the correct parse/phrase structure is (if any).

In particular Powers (1997b) performed experiments in the context of grammat checking application, using automatic segmentation techniques based on those of Harris (I 960) and similar to those used by Brent (1997), but combined with context-conditioned probabilities which were used to decide between confusable words.

In addition, even the initial functional segments found may be used directly to learn or check a grammar (Entwisle and Groves, 1994; Powers, 1997b), although this already makes use of the known word segmentation and the assumption, which is for English is an excellent first approximation, that affixes are either word initial or word final, and that it is this prefixes and suffixes which determine the syntactic roles of the words.

The specific approach we are using in our current work is to extend the structure determined by a version of the approach of Powers (1992 and 1997a) which produces binary grammar rules.

Note that Powers (1997a) generalizes the approach and considers a multitude of different clustering metrics and methods, introducing a pair of goodness measures which allow a more principled approach to closing and evaluating clusters (rather than closing at a specific cluster, you close when the goodness measure reaches its first local maximum).
