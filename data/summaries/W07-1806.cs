In previous studies, we have evaluated speech recognition and speech understanding performance for physician-side questions in English (Bouillon et al., 2005) and Spanish (Bouillon et al., to appear 2007b), and investigated the impact on performance of the help system (Rayner et al., 2005a; Starlander et al., 2005).

The English (physician) side recogniser is compiled from the large English resource grammar described in Chapter 9 of (Rayner et al., 2006), and was constructed in the same way as the one described in (Rayner et al., 2005a), which was used for a headache examination task.

For example, the recognition grammar from (Rayner et al., 2005a) is specialised to cover only second-person questions (“Do you get headaches in the mornings?”), while the generator grammar used in the present application covers only firstperson declarative statements (“I visited the doctor last Monday.”).

Our experiments with MedSLT show that even a quite simple help system is enough to guide users quickly towards the intended coverage of a mediumvocabulary grammar-based speech translation application, with most users appearing confident after just an hour or two of exposure (Starlander et al., 2005; Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006).

Regulus feature grammars can also be compiled into generators using a version of the Semantic Head Driven algorithm (Shieber et al., 1990).

Regulus has also been used to build several other systems, including NASA’s Clarissa (Rayner et al., 2005b).

As previously noted, the MedSLT system addresses this problem by incorporating an online help system (Starlander et al., 2005; Chatzichrisafis et al., 2006).

Our experience is that grammarbased systems which also incorporate probabilistic context-free grammar tuning deliver better results than purely statistical ones when training data are sparse (Rayner et al., 2005a).
