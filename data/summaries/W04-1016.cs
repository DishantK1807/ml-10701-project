Based on this information, it is possible to select one or more of the outputs as the “gold standard” and compare the rest in the pyramid scoring scheme described by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004).

Questions regarding the agreement between people in the area of single document summarization and multi-document summarization have already been raised and are currently only partially answered (Halteren and Teufel, 2003; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004; Marcu and Gerber, 2001).

The first partition aims to develop manual evaluation criteria for determining the quality of a summary, and is typified by the extensive research done in single-document summarization by Halteren and Teufel (2003) and by the evaluation strategy proposed by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004).

This follows the general rubric described by Nenkova and Passonneau’s (2004) pyramid scoring scheme, though it differs in the sense that we base our evaluation not on a reference summary, but on the original two document sentences.

A few researchers have focused on other aspects of summarization, including single sentence (Knight and Marcu, 2002), paragraph or short document (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2002), query-focused (Berger and Mittal, 2000), or speech (Hori et al., 2003).

This system achieves a precision, recall and f-score of 0:528, 0:668 and 0:590, respectively (which is a significant increase in performance (f = 0:407) over the IBM models or the Cut & Paste method (Jing, 2002)).

This has been leveraged by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004) to produce a manual scoring method for summaries, though the fact that humans show so little agreement in this task is somewhat disheartening.

Work in this area includes that of Lin and Hovy (2003) and Pastra and Saggion (2003), both of whom inspect the use of Bleu-like metrics (Papineni et al., 2002) in summarization.

The use of sentence fusion in multidocument summarization has been extensively explored by Barzilay in her thesis (Barzilay, 2003; Barzilay et al., 1999), though in the multi-document setting, one has redundancy to fall back on.
