2:59	As the workshop co-chairs, we are indeed honored to pen the first few words in the SIGHAN-6 proceedings.
3:59	Over the last few years, exciting research endeavors in Chinese language processing have been pursued vigorously all over the world.
4:59	We feel privileged to be able to chair the Sixth SIGHAN, particularly at this juncture in our history when the Chinese language is receiving worldwide attention which places us at an important period of growth and change.
5:59	SIGHAN-6 received 14 regular paper submissions this year, 9 of which are accepted for presentation, contributing to yet another stimulating and inspiring scientific program.
6:59	We would like to thank all the authors who submitted their research work, and all the reviewers who have put an immense amount of timely and quality work into the paper review.
7:59	We would also like to express our gratitude and appreciation to the chair of SIGHAN, Prof. Benjamin Tsou, who has led SIGHAN to what it is today, especially for his invaluable advice at various stages of the development of SIGHAN-6.
8:59	Our workshop also uniquely features the Fourth International Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff, which was jointly held with the First CIPS Chinese Language Processing Evaluation over the summer of 2007.
9:59	In addition to the classic Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition tasks, there is a new track on Chinese POS-tagging.
10:59	The bakeoff was co-organized by SIGHAN, ChineseLDC, and the Verifying Center on Chinese Language and Character Standards of the State Language Commission of PRC, and coordinated by Dr. Guangjin Jin of the Institute of Applied Linguistics, MOE, China.
11:59	Special thanks to Dr. Jin and the bakeoff organizing committee for organizing another successful bakeoff.
12:59	The generous support from the benchmarking corpora providers (Academia Sinica; City University of Hong Kong; Institute of Applied Linguistics, MOE, China; Microsoft Research Asia; Peking University; Shanxi University; and University of Colorado) is greatly appreciated.
13:59	Certainly the bakeoff cannot stand without the support from the 28 participating teams.
14:59	We have collected 23 bakeoff system reports in this volume.
15:59	SIGHAN-6 marks its second time to co-locate with IJCNLP, the flagship conference of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing.
16:59	The organization of our workshop will not be so smooth without all the logistic support from the IJCNLP-08 committee, particularly the Workshop Committee, the Publication Chair Dr. Jing-Shin Chang, as well as everyone in the Local Organizing Committee.
17:59	To them we would like to express our heartiest gratitude.
18:59	Last but not least, thank you for your active participation.
19:59	Enjoy our program, and we wish you an educational and entertainment-filled experience in Hyderabad.
