A particularly simple way of doing this is to use unseoped logical forms where qmmtifiers are left in situ (silnilar to the representations used by Hobbs and Shieber (1987), or to Quasi Logical Form (Alshawi 1990)).

In this case we obtain: 12) gives(< V,X,ITIall(X)>,< 3,y,book(y)>,< -~,z,'l'>) Scoped propositions can then be obtained by using an outside-in quantifier scoping algorithm (Lewin, 1990), or an inside-out algorithm with a free w~riable constraint (IIobbs and Shieber, 1987).
