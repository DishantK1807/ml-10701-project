One approach that partially overcomes these limitations is to collect parallel texts from the web (Nie et al., 1999; Resnik, 1999).

In order to collect descriptions for technical term X, such as ‘data mining’, (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2000) collected phrases like “X is Y” and “X is defined as Y”, from the web.

One interesting approach to extending the current system is to introduce a statistical translation model (Brown et al., 1993) to filter out irrelevant translation candidates and to extract the most appropriate subpart from a long English sequence as the translation by locally aligning the Japanese and English sequences.
