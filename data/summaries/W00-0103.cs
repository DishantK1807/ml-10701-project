This approach took inspiration from the pioneering work by (Dolan 1994), but it is also fundamentally different, because instead of grouping similar senses together, the CoreLex approach groups together words according to all of their senses.

The approach for finding systematic polysemous classes is based on that of (Buitelaar 1998a, Buitelaar 1998b), but takes into account some shortcomings as pointed out in (Krymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998).

Similarly, in shallow syntactic processing tasks, like statistical disambiguation of PP-attachment, the use of underspecified senses may be preferable as shown in experiments by (Krymolowski and Roth 1998).

Algorithm The algorithm works example for nouns): as follows (for 3.1 A More Flexible Approach The CoreLex database has been used and/or evaluated in a number of projects, leading to some criticisms of the approach in (Krymolowski and Roth 1998) (Peters, Peters and Vossen 1998) (Tomuro 1998) and in personal communication.

Introduction This paper presents an algorithm for finding systematic polysemous classes in WordNet (Miller et al 1990) and GermaNet (Hamp and Feldweg 1997) -a semantic database for German similar to WordNet.
