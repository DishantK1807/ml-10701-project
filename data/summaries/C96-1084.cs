The resolution of textual ellipses depends on the results of the foregoing resolution of nominal anaphors (Strube & Hahn, 1995) and the termination of the semantic interpretation of the current utterance.

We therefore incorporate into our model criteria which relate to the fimctional information structure of utterances using the methodological framework of the well-known centering model (Grosz et al., 1995).
J95-2003
The main difference between Grosz et al.'s work and our proposal (see Strube & Hahn (1996)) concerns the criteria for r~mking the forward-looking centers.
P96-1036
The solution we propose is embedded within the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995).

The machinery of DRT, however, might work well for (pro)nominal anaphora, but faces problems when elliptical text phenomena are to be interpreted (though Wada (1994) has recently made an attempt to deal withrestricted forms of textual ellipsis in the DRT context).

It conskters conceptual criteria to be o1' primary importance and provides linkage constraints for role paths in a terminological knowledge base in order to assess the plausibility of possible, antecexlents as proper bridges (Clark, 1975) to elliptical expressions.

For example, the PUNDIT system (Palmer et al.(1986)) provides a fairly restricted solution in that only direct conceptual links between the concept denoted by the antecedent and the elliptical expression are considered ("plausible" paths of length 1, in our terminology).
