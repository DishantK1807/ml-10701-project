... . . .71 I INTRODUCTION Ia this paper we describe the ssgsnitation of the natural language passes dewloped over the last twa years.
T11ia fotms an important paet uf s question-answering system under de~@logmnt with natural language (Japanese) input.
T11c patsar can transform frnir-tv cumplczl, srrltepces into abstract structures marked for case, It utilikes detailed srpbmntic dictionary descriptions and cont~xtual infurmatton skutract~d from th~ preceding sentences.
For: the present, we heve confined the dewin of the system to the field of elamentary ehemlistrj where we can describe the semantic world in rather concrete terms At the same ti=, various compleuevents occur ln this field For example, substances which partleipate in part~cular events may disappear, new substances may emerge, or some properties of the substance? may be altered To treak these comple situations, it was necessarv to formally represent relationships between events and cl~aages of state and to devise an appropriate schema of representing context, In mst appr~ache~ to the understanding of natural barlgunpe tl~roupk artificial intelligence, schemas which entail rigid logical operations are used to represent both knowledge and context Loglcal operatlons appear to be necessary for solving some kinds of problems in natural language, especially at the deep deductive level of unders tandlng.
However, lntui tlwe reasoning is not easily formalized in terms of loglcal operatlons It is our contention that intuitive reasoning 1s completely based on the language activity in the human brain Associative functions relating to semantic similarities between words, semantic depth of an interpretation and probability of associative occurrence of events are inherent factors in intuitive understandinn and the seasoning process, Y.
WII~ES (1975) in his eykatem carries out intuitive r~tarsoning by employing the notion of 'eemntie preference'.
His system seems to work well an anralytfng local relationeahips among words, Mowever, in order to analyze amre global relationohips (e.lg., in dealing with complex cams of azlaphora) we require access to we information than can be contained in formulae (templates) a ed with the haxicon.
We find Wilks' uss of '6s-inference rules' sahkar awkward.
The system w~uld be much improved if accoarpanied by afi appropriate achema for representing context.
v Case gsam~r' ~entence-analysis theories such as those of Fillmore (1968) and Celce-Muscia (1972) are based on the semantic relat ibnskips between verbs ad nouns -events and concepts, R.
F. Simmaas (1973; 19751, n (3973), D, E.
Rumelhart (1973) and so on follow these theories to represent knowledge and context in their systems.
We also adopted case s and nsodifded it to account for Japanese sentences.
We represent cantext fn the form of a @@antic network.
An input sentence is transformed into a c~rxeeponding deep saee etswcture, This structure is assillllsilated with the ~e tie network constructed from previous sentences, Japanese is a typical SQV language.
The word order 1s rather srLItrary except that the main verb comes lest.
Cases such as subjective, ~bjective and dative as syntactically indicated by postpos~tions, but a petposition can be used for several deep cases anibiguously Hence the determination of underlying senteatial structures rests heavily on an undarstarading of the semantic relatione between the main verb and nouns kloreover in Japanese the words which are essential in understanding a sentence are often omitted without pronqminal reflexes.
Our system can 5 infer from the semantic ddscriptions of wards what kinds of ghzsses should be supplied to fill lexieal gaps ?nd sgarch the contextual tcpreaentation to find appropriate fillers.
The final analysis produced by our pamor ia a srtwntic netwvtk, This could he used fox the internal,raps@sentatisn of data in a qupgtt~ftanswering system ox as an interniwdiete e~pr~ssiun in '61:mchin~ txansl,stiurt H~wu\!r, it is still too early to report on th~.
rcsults of these ~ISL~~U~C~CIJI applications.
The paxscr cottsists essrntisll wf four fixed cornp~>pcArs* I$ The grammar consists of rules written in PLATDE;, PLATOK 1s a new programming language which is a variant of the sqqtem deuelwped by Woods (1970) called 'Augmented Tkansitlon Network PLATON has add~tlonal facilities for pat tern matching and flexible backtr ackinp, A grammatical rule in PIATOW consists of two parts pattern rewrite which 1s expressed as a pair of syntactic patterns, and semantic and contextual check bhich is an arbitrary LISP function.
Ffllen a rule is to be applied, the semantic and contehtual chech is emplnved to determine whether the rule is mwnr ically and csnteutuallv feasihlo, For the present we have about two hundred rules for the analysis of Japanese sentences, These rules are devised to combine Various syntactic patterns in Japanese with appropriate sewntlc and contevt ual checklng functlohs, PLATON is presented in more detall In another papec by Nagao and Tsujil (1976).
2) In the dictionary are stored words along wlth their various semantlc relatlonshlps.
We express the meaning of a word in terms of hov it may be related to other words, The meapinq of a verb 1s described In 1 the form of activity patterns' in the verb dictlonarv An actlt~itv pattern -6is actually the case frame of a verb and additional related information.
The case fr regresents what case relations the activity entails and what kind sf referents will be appropriate for each case slot, Adartions1 information provided feeds into the 'change' or 'causative' compahent used by Norman (1973).
Such infortnstfdn indicates how one activity pattern my be related TO another by causal re, onghipe and what related change may occur in the eeatlantie network representing cbntext, From auch inflarmtion we can Infer what activitiefi and changt! will.
foll~-)w the pre~enfr ~ctlvity, The meanings of nouns are also expressed in the caee-frame-like description8 They also haurn relational slots which will be filled in by sther words or phrases, 3) The ~onterrtual representation is similar in fom to the semantic netw~sk of R.
F, Simmons (1973;1975) or the nodcspase sf B, A, Nomn (1973).
In tk~s representation there are two kinds of nodes.
The C-node esrsespands to a concept typically expressed by a noun The S-node correqponds to an event.
h event is .rs realization of an actian pattern and each argument of the pattern is assigned a C-node.
C-nsdea are related to S-nodes by the case labled rclationa.
These ~latbons are bidirectional The fallawing kist shaws the relations used in the network: (1 Deep Cue Relations.
ACT', OBJ, PUCE, TIHE -A deep case relation connects an S-node with its argument C-node, (ii) Attributive Relations: VOLUME, (r;OLOR, MASS, SHAPE -An attribute relation connects a C-node with its value.
We Gan dlstingulsh two C-nodes associated with the same lertical entry but different values of attributes.
(iii) Taken substitution.
TBK -TBK is used to connect a node with -7a lexical entry, (iv) Went-krent Relation MUSE, IFPLY -Two S-nodes arc somtiws connected by n particular relation.
The rclntions arc roaatims cxpscqst*d explicitly in the ~urfsjce sentenre hv a spocfal romjtmrtl~n sue11 aa NOBE (because), NA (if) and sa OR* In Our system the somantic network is acco~anicd with spt.cia1 Lists (Noun Stack-NS, Hvpathatirel Noun St,~ck-HSS, Trdpping L~z-TLL Ve call thqsc li~ta intrmrdiate Term bbmxy.
Contcxtnal fu~~ctiuns votk on these Sis ts to seaxck appropriate nudes of the semantic ne twark correseend to the referents sf snaphosic expressions or the unex~sessed rLewnts of sentences, (4) Selaant~c and Contextual functions are propmmned in LISP These functions are lncorposated in the PLATON rules along with rewrltlng patterns A contextual function takes as arguments the seaantls constsalnts a target node must satisfy and returns the node when an appropriate node rs found from the semantic network A senwntic fu~ction cheeks dcscriptiuns in tt~c dic ~~QII,ILY te7 dc turnline ~~hcrt~er tEw cwrnhin,~t ion of two 'r~ards is sen~anticallv pedwsibl~, For analp zing nourl-nc7tnl combir~ations, wc provide sixteen semantxc functions.
The whole system is wrltten in LISPl.6 whlch 1s implemented on a minicomputer, TOSBAC-GO.
The mlnlcomputer 1s equlpped wlth 64KB as main memory and 512KB as secondary core memory The LISP1 6 uses the secondarv memory as virtual storage The drctlonary conslsts of about 400 nouns, 200 verbs and lLQO adjectives and other categosles The parser with rules and the dictionary occupies about 50K cells The LISP uses a soft-ware -8paging mechanism, and the main memory is rather smell in comparison with the secondary mmory The content of the dictionary is stored on a disc in the form of S-expressions.
Consequently, the speed of execution is slow.
It takes typically about 10 to 15 minutes to analyze sentences which oontain 3 to 5 simple sentences and 10 to 15 noun phrases.
XI LEXIUL DFSCRlPTIONS OF WOW 2,-1 Now kscripkiern &st nouns have a definite meaning by themselves.
We call these Entity Wows.
kn entity noun is considered to represent a set of objects, and therefore is taken aa a name of the set.
The sbjects belonging tta the set $hare the same properties By lntsoducing another property the set my be divided Into a number of subsets, each of which is expressed by another noun, We describe such set-inclusion relationshrps and set propestles ln the noun dletfonaq.
We represent a property of a noun by an attrxb-ute-value pair expres~ed aa (A Vb . For instance, the dirtinner entries for the nouns 'wtcsiel' and ' liquid' are : wterJl~aI ( ( SP> (AmR(STATE) (MASS) (COLOR) (%WE) --------1) liquid ( ( SP material) (ATTR (STATE *LIQVID) (WE NIL )) ) Re descriptions (STATE) (WSS) and so on m the deflnltlon of 'materlall, I Lack values (V) showing chat material' may have arbitrary values of these zttributes, In the definrtlon of 'Ilquid', there 1s a $P-link to 'raaterlal', which meam that 'material' 1s a super-set concept of 'Ilquld', or that 1 ' liquid' is a subset or a lower concept of materxal' . Objects belonging to -9s subset are considered to have the earn properties 18 the abjeca laf tha super-oat, in addition to the proprties described axglLcitLy in its dafinition.

Tna verbs FUERU [increase) and MERU (deciease) are such &xamples gf verbs.
Figure 2 2 Attribute Nouns 'Liquid' is another relational noun.
The Japanese word whirh csrreapoads to 'liqula is EKITAI.
While 'liquid' in English can be elther a now or an adjective, ERITWI in Japanese is ca~rgorrzed synta~t~calJy as a nom.
But @emantically EKLTAF has two diffe~ent meanings, one corresponding to the liom usage of 'liquid', the other corresponding to the adjective usage of it.
The noun EKITAI in the adjective uasp is collsd a Value Noun wf th the! attribute STATE.
Anofekes word IRB (scd color) 18 alga a vrlua noun of the attsibuta COLOR.
Figure 2.3 ahws rlrc da~cription of th~n~ nouns in the noun distionerv, ( EEFXTAT ( (NF N-E) (SP BUSSHITSU, (ATR (STATE trqvrs;rs CSWPE ~11;) 5 liquid wt@1'f;;laX ( (NF N-V) (V-DESCKZPTIUN (STATE &I;XQVI'I)? 1 ) There are other kinds of relational nouns Action, Prepositional, hnphorie, and Function nouns, h action noun 1s the nsmnalization of,I verb.
For example, KANSATSU (obserwat~on) is the nodnallrzation wf the ~erb Q'iNSATSU-SlrRU (~bscmel 'bu'c describe this in the dicti~nax~ kv giving a link to the ~xigit~~3.l verb and bv adding other infua;mtS~?n There arc nut t positions1 pb%rtic9cs Ln Japanese fur r.wr\ preposition in English, Sow special nouns plg the sole af English preposltlons.
We call such nouns Preposltlanal Nouns Because a prepasltl-onal noun usually has more than one meaning just as an Engl~sh preposltlon has, we attach semantic conditions to help disambiguate then Flgure 2.4 shows example of leslcal descriptions of prepositional nouns C before in %mnt (3% (\MD (WT W-E) (LOWER DOUGU instrument ( (WP W-P) (F-DESCRIPTION Figure 2+4 Prepositional Nouns Corresponding to each waning we give a triplet The Elrst element is the aemntic condition, If the ~ondition is sutlsfled, the corresponding second elewnt 28 adopeed as the waning, If not, the next triplet is tried The q~sond clcmnr of B triplet represents thc wt~ole waning of the phrase.

2,2 Verb kacriptiora Verbs, adjectives, and prepos~tions in Engllsh have relational -wing@ wlth nouns.
A verb represents a certaln acti~ity, Fih~le the agent mooc~eted wzth the activity is not ~nherent to the meaning of the verb (neither is the object the activity affects, nor the other components) These components appear in a sentence with certarn loose selatlons to a verb 13 In our system the meaning QE a verb is d~~csibed by settrirzg up k;emsal relational slots whLch will be fillad in by nouns, JR this sen&@ the waling of e wcrb is not confined to itself, but tw relrtgd to mma.

Tbu& there are usually some syntactic chess in a sentence as to how it instantiates an uctfv~ty, they are not enough to decide the ease rekarionships between nQu;n phrases and a verb.
To establish these relatiomskips we need both svntactic and sc~k~ntic information, A verb has its own sp,t.cinl.

Q@ aall these labled patterns Case Frames for Verbs, and express them ss a list of case palrs such as (WE NOW) A verb usually has are than one case frame corresponding to different usages, A typical description of a verb is shown In Figure 2.5 CCF ( ( ACT MINGEN ) ( OB J KOTAI) ( IN EKITqI) ) human being solid liquid (( ACT NINGM ) ( OB J KOTAI) f l VST) ) human being solid (( ACT SAN ) ODB JKINZOKU )) acid metal Figure 2.5 A typical dpsctiption uE a verb According to this description, we underskand the verb TOKASU (melt, diassolve) hae two different usages.
In one usage the verb takas thc ACTOR case, and prefers to take the sub-concepts of the noun NINGEN (human being taa the case element, In suck a way case f ramc descrip tians are closely tied to noun descriptions, espec~a1l.y with the upper-lower concept relationships amng nouns.
Rere are twca types of cases, Intrinsic and t xtrfnsic cases, The iratrinsis caws st a verb ate eesantial ones for the ~ctivhtv, but extril.lsie: caw@ am not.
For exampl~, the cases of TIME and PUCE, which express when and where an event occnrs, are extrinsic f~r ordinary verbs, kWst aetbvitxes can be modxfied by these extrlnslc cases, bur the kinds of nouns preferred for these case elements do not s tsongly depend on the kinds of activities* Therefore we descrrbe only the lntsinslc cases In the verb dicrj.onaky.
We set up fourteen cases as shown in Table 2.1 for the analysts of sentences In a textbook of elementary che&str]i TABLE 2,1 (1) ACT : ACTss 5s responsible for action.

hen one knowa a certain event has occurred, he can anticipate succe~sive events that will occur and what changee the objects participating in the evant will undergo.
Thie kind of expectation plays an important role in underetanding eentences.
Various kinds of associations clucter conceptually arsund inddvfdumb activities, One can perform eontcxtunl analysis of language by explicating these associations, We append this kind of experiential knowledge t/b the case frau~s of vetbe The follawing two items are described for each vcib in the verb dictionary: (1) CON thie refers to the conseqdent activities which are likely to Eollow the activity sf the verb, but not necessarily, (2) S this refers to the resultant effects on objects in view of how the objects are influenced bv the activity.
In our system the influenre on the objects is described by the following three expressions: (a) ( ADD case a-set-of-(A V)-pairs ) (b) ( DELETE case a-set-of-attributes ) (c) ( CREATE lexical-nam-of-an-objec t a-se t-of(A Vj -pairs) (a) mans that the object rn the case indicated by the second element comes to have a set of prgpertles lndrcated by the thasd element.
(b) is for the deletion of a set of properties from the object.
(r) shows that some objects will be created by the activity.
A typical zxample uslng a CON expression is shown In Figure 2 6 t -r A 'j CI 4 pa d k t D 3 U 4J (Ti QJ u Qi s 0 C -4 'J; ri k 3 w 4 3 fV2 G1 C 4-4 ul 11 0 4 3 [I) IU k CU s C, -a c a h Z 0 U w 0 In this expression one can see the verb TOKASU has two differetlt meanings.
One cottesponds to 'melt', and the ather to 'dissolve in'.
When we analyze the aentense, MU -6 TQKASU . c~gper(0B J) dissolve, melt Sawone mlts copper WP adwt the firgt enae fraw of TOKhSU (melt1 because it gives the highest mtched value against the sentence (aee section 3.4).
As the result ~f evaluating the MWS exgrefssion in the case frame, we conclude the copper 1 is nm in the liquid state.
In the lexical description copper' is a lower concept af 'solid', so that copper in general behaves as e solid object.
But the copper in the above sentence comes to have the attribute value pair (STATE *LIQUID) and will behave as 'liquid' in the succeeding sentences.
On the contrary, when we analyze the sentence SNIQ -0 MZZU -MI TOUSU aalt -(OBJ) water -(IN, PLACE, etc,) melt, dissolw Soeane diswalves salt in water.
the second case frame of TOKASU (dissolve in) gives the highest matched value After the sentence instantlate9 the case frame, a new object (l,e*, a solution which conslsts of salt and water) wlll be created.
CON AND iYl'MTS are thus important in the contextual analysls of sentences.

These functions are applied in turn to a noun phrase to declde what relat~onship holds between two nouns, The order in which these functions are applied 1s based on the frequencj and the tightness of the relations, Each function checks only one semantic relation Xn order to .illustrate how these functions perform their tasks, the following exaxiple of noun + prepositional noun' 22 TABLE 3 1.

We stac~ in the temporary aack noun phrases and adjectivee for which the nouns to be modified have not been deteruned, The analysis of a aorta phrase IS carr;ied out by scanning words one-by-one from left to r:ght, If we scan an adjective or a dererrmner, we stack the# word in the temporary stack.
If we scan a noun, we p~ck up a word from the tempciar stack and check whether: it can modify the noun.

hese examples show that the word EKZTAJ (liquid) has two different usages.
According, to these usages, there are two dffbereqt eee~antic construeticans sf the phrase EKXTAI-NO JOWAI as shm in Figure 3.4.
KTTAI (l&uid) -NO JOWAI (state) (1) 7 STATE liquid indicates an abject: Figure 3.4.
Two different deep structures for the phrase EKITAI NO JOUTAf Because we analyze a noun phrase from left to right, we cannot determine +ich usage is correct unti,l we recognize the rightmost word HENKA (change, transltioo) or SANS0 (oxygen) . Hme~#er, a semantic checking function disadiguates the multiple meanings of the word EKITAI.
If the disambiguation 14 recognized to be .hcorrept in subsequent processing, we must be able to backtrack to the decision point at which this temporary disambiguation was made.
We implemented such a process by using PIATON'S backtracking facilities.

XV CBNTEhTLbIL ANALIS IS 4.1 Basilq r(pproac'lr to Centoxtual rhslv.iirr Our view of thQ ~TOE@SS of sentencc understanding is rouphl~ as follows.
One reads sentences from left te right and understands then In succession.
When he/she cannot understand a serrtence satlsEactorilv, he.
she refers back to the preceding sentences ta rabtsln a ke, to understanding If he/she cannot find what is neeed, he/she leaves the questlon pending and proceeds te the next sentence If a phrase or n sentence 1s found wh~ch seems to solve the question, ttlen hershe checks wtr~ther ~t can renllr 18solve the question.
If SQ th~ PCII~E;'IICC is prwpexl\ organized into the previous contest and thc question is dismissed In anr caw the pending question is likelv to be disnrtssed as time passes We feel thls process of se~~tence ~tnderstandlng 1s not espec~allv complex.
It can be reallzed through an ar~lrlclal lntelllgence approach Whlle we recognize that some klnds of problem may be solved only bv uslng complicated loglcal operatlons, we thlnk most problems In language understanding can be solved by relatively s~mple operatlons Logical operatlons my only be effectively applled on o complete data base In which all the necessary axiom (corresponding to human hnotllrledge) are declared and no contradlctory asloms eslst, In the course of reading sentences, one has i+6 only partial knowledge about the context, and therefore, his knowledge is not coqplete.
However, he can understand the meanings of sentences before he reads through the entire set.
This means that one is content with incomplete deductions for under8 tanding sentences.
For this reason, we employ rather than logicel operations, heuristically admissible operations whi~h tlBe an intarmedlate term mollory structure and various semantic tckartianehipka deeeribed in the dictionary.
b ctsnc~ive of three type8 of memory, Long term mmisr\rr incorpordt~fi knowledge of the world, not considered here.
Short term memory is for diate recall of unanely~ed strings under consideration, Inrcrmedistc term memory is limited but contains a structured representation sf recently analyzed strings and strings des analysis, We su rise our approach as follows: (1) Context i.

Cxne rs for representing the current contextual content, and the sther is to ~u~ttain pending quce;tions, '&he f~mer is furthe1 divided into the noun wtack (NS) and thc hypothet~eal noun stack (HNS) The latter 6a called the Trapping List (TL) . (3) Contextual.
analysis is perf rmed after the processing of each sptactic unit such as a noun phrase or a sentence whlch conveys a mltary idea, (4) NS is organized such that thene words of sentences can be easily retrieved.
Here ' theme words' mean the key sub~ects mentroned m the sentences, (5) Sometimes we have to refer to the succeeding sentences in order to understand a seotence.
In such cases we do not iwdlately refer 47 to the succeeding sentences, but instead hold a pending question in TL to be resolved in the courqe aE analyzing th~ pr:,ccr.dit~p ~eflt~ncc8 I 4.2. kkm~n* Strurt~lra tor Cotztextuol lnt"ozr,ttatiun Tha analysis of B scntenrr is primrill p~otmd~d in the semantic descripticw.1 -case Eram -oS: n mit~ kcrh.

In other words, the bord which IS omtted 0s expressed by a pronoun 1s an important word for the understanding of a sentence.
(2) A them word ~lav apyselar as "dubject1' in the surface stl~~cture.
To emphasize a word whxeh is OBJ-case in deep case structure, or to de-emphasize a word in the ACT-case which is not worth mentioning, the pasgive voice may be used.
This places a stressed word In the subject position of the sentence whlch would otherwise appear as object or xnd~rect object (3) The xmportance of a head noun in a noun phrase is greater than that of other nouns.

To solve this problem we set up a trapping list TL, The bas ir organization of TL is show in Figure 4.6, h trapping elemnt 'is a triplet I--.-1 e trapping elemnt ader FP t arbitran lfsp function F2 r erbitrary lisp function Figure 4.6 ConstructLon of TL and corresponds to s pending problem.
When we cannot Eird an appropriate word in the preceding sentences for an omitted word or an anaphoric expression, WE put s new trapping element in TL.
At this tdme the first of the triplet, N, is eet to zero, When a noun phrase dn a succeeding sentence is analyzed we pick up nouns isom the noun phrase one-by-one end check whether the present noun can resolve a pending problem in TL by evaluating the function Fl la the trapping element.
We have defined several LISP functions far the functdoa Fl.
These dunstions wark aa follows.
(t) They check whether a new at hand Bsn salve the1 problems in TL, (ii) If it can do so; they update the dlta (for example, iE the function F1 is the function which searches thp words in TL for fdling in the? omitted case element, then the function will put the present noun in the case frame), and return the value 'DELETE' Then the system.
will delete the trapping elemnt from TL.
Ciii) If it cannot do so, the system adds 1 to N, the f icst element of tbe trapping element.
Wen M exceeds five, the trapping element is deleted frorp TL.
That is, it is decided that the problem corresponding to the trapping element can not be solved at ell.
Before the deletion of a trapping elcmpenr its third element, the function F2, is eveluated.
Thus far F2 has cnlJ b~an used to provide default values to sllowu some intet pscrsrlon 1 1s p~ndinp By using Pbp idea of TL, we can t;eparate *ridas checking wchuuisari fro& the win program.

fn a Japanese sentence cspeefab&l; in thc field of chemistry, the case element ACTQR is apt to be neglected.
Therefore we adopt a dummy filler fa the ACTOR to represent the author of the sentence or sow other human being.
As there are no preceding sentences, we cannot frll in the OBJECT ease immediately.
So we set up the pending problem in TL which will watch the analvsis of the succeeding a tsinps to fill the gap 2 The clause TAXSSEKI-CA HENKA-SURW will be analyzed next The verb HEN&\-SURU (changed requires uln$v SLWJ case Thr! puseposfrl~lrl Gb, attached to the; noun TAISEKLCI (v.sLwm) paasiblb LiapLies the case SlrRJ.
Ttlc noun TAISEKI: 1s a Irstver concept noun of 'attribute', which stjtisflcftzs the semantlc condition for the case element.
So thls sentence is analyzed :in a straightfoswasd manner, However, because the noun TAISEKI 1s an attribute noun, we must find the corresponding entity noun.
Tkqt IS, we must identifj the object whose volume is being referred to.
As we cannot find such an object in the preceding sentences, we set up a pend~ng problem In TL, I3.1 checking the inflection of the verb WENUSURU (change) and noting that it: is iwwdidt ely followed by a noun, it is recugnized that the sentence is an embedded sentence modifying khe following noun TOKI (time, when), Fu'e then 66 connect this caentential part wit.r the norm TOKE by using the relation SMOD (WDif ied by a Sentence) . 3.

The noun mKI (ti=) ip mciified by the e~nteatid part analyzed at step 2, and deaf gnatee the tfm wbn the event expressed by the senteatid part occurs.
The cedinotion af SWSO (owlgen) ad JOUTAI (state) is also permissible.
The nouns T.OKI (time), SmSB (oxygen) and JOUTAI (state) in the now phrase activate the trapping elements in TL.
The noun SBLNSO (oxygen) aatissfiera the tloradftlcsns sf the two trapping elements set up by s tepa 1 and 2.
That 94, 5M58 (ovvn) fills in the case OBJ af the first clause, TAISEKZ (vstum) in the wecsad clause is wgarded as the vdum QE the oxygen in the @u~tent c%&u~a.

71 By wing this languhge, we cah i+neor;porate naturally sewntbc and contextual analyses into syntactic analysis, We do not aced a large &nd involved proernza which it9 rs~lponaible for the sawntic intamraeotian ~f tha output given by the syntaetle analysis eowonent, Im~tead, awlysera, We have obtained faf rly gaod re~t~lts wfth our npprasrtt', Thpia contextual analvsds psggren on the other hand can treat unly local c~jntrxta, In ordet to treat mm gloBaS, contexts, @e lecl the foll~wing b~r~wm'~t%i (i) Fh must provide our system with an approgsfatesik~c~ c~rmspanding to human long tern memory in order to represent the state sf the world, 'She system naus t haw fr.timst;wearks to express spatial relationship$ among objects time relationships awn8 evr.T7rs and so on.
(ii) At the present stage we have only one .relationship CON t~ connect one activity with another.
Wdwever, human knowledge of the world attlsnm~daeas varitaus, kinds of relsticansfzips among activities, such as cause, purposs;, mason, ete.
These relationahips nmv play an S~purennt role not only in the analysis of sentences, but also in the ~nfercnce processes in answering a question.
(lii) fie descriptions of verb meanlngs using case work rather well far analyzing verb-centered sentences.
However, the results of analysls depend on what verbs are used in surface sentences Hence, the sentences which convey the same meanlng but are expressed by using different verbs may be transf omd into d-if ferent internal representations This is a serious drawback when cons tsucting ques tion-answering systems or other kinds of intelligence systems.
In order to avoid this drawback, we attached a set 72 g rules to each case ftroe siprilar to the descriptions used at hsys;te@ (1913).
We feel, howevesr, that thig wthod is rathsr rvku.rd urd char deeper structuraa ehould be employed (similar to ' carc@ptU11 dependency' propoaad by R.
