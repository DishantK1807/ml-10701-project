To our knowledge, there has been no other formal study of DG.This is reflected by a recent study (Lombardo & Lesmo, 1996), which applies the Earley parsing technique (Earley, 1970) to DG, and thereby achieves cubic time complexity for the analysis of DG.

This is the reason why the PARSETALK text understanding system (Neuhaus & Hahn, 1996) utilizes special heuristics in a heterogeneous chartand backtrackingbased parsing approach.

The dissociation of tree structure and linear order, as we have done in Section 3, nevertheless seems to be a promising approach for PSG as well; see a very similar proposal for HPSG (Reape, 1989).
