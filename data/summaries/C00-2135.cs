First, our approach uses dependency relations rather than alignment, cognate and/or position heuristics previously applied (Melamed, 1995).

The progress in parsing technology are noteworthy, and in particular, various statistical dependency models have been proposed(Collins, 1997),, (Ratnaparkhi, 1997), (Charniak, 2000).

Kitamura et a1.(1996) enmnerates word sequences of arbitrary length (n-grmn of content words) that appear more than the mininmln threshold from English and Japanese and attempts to tlnd the correspomlence based on the prepared candidate lists.

Since the advent of statistical methods in Machine qh'anslation, the bilingual sentence alignmerit (Brown et al., 1991) or word alignment (Dagan et al., 1992) have been explored and achieved numerous success over the last decade.

On the other hand, Matsumoto et a1.(1993), KiLamura et a1.(1995) and Meyers et a1.(1996) use.

Previous methods mostly use rule-based parsers for preprocessing(Matsumoto et al., 1993), (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1995).
