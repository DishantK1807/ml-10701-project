Li and Abe's strategy of pruning at classes less than 3.2.1 Experiments 3 and 4 The input data was produced by the system described in (Briscoe ~ Carroll, 1997) and comprised 2 million words of parsed text with argument heads and subcategorisation frames identified.

Most current research on selectional preference acquisition has used the Penn Treebank parses (Resnik, 1993a, 1993b; Ribas, 1995; Li & Abe, 1995; Abe & Li, 1996) These are obtained semiautomatically with a deterministic parser and manual correction.

The other approach selected was Yarowsky's unsupervised algorithm (1995).

Work 2.1 Selectional preference acquisition Other approaches to selectional preference acquisition closely related to this are those of Resnik (Resnik, 1993b, 1993a) Ribas (1994, 1995), and Li and Abe (Li & Abe, 1995; Abe & Li, 1996) 2.

The only frequency information available for WordNet senses, assuming large scale manual tagging is out of the question, is the portion of the Brown corpus that has been semantically tagged with WordNet senses for the SemCor project (Miller, Leacock, Tengi, & Bunker, 1993).

Additionally the other approaches do not perform any WSD on the input data and most report a major source of error arising from the contribution of erroneous senses sometimes giving incorrect preferences and at other times a noticeable effect of over-generalisation (Ribas, 1995; Resnik, 1993a).

Still the alternative of using an automatically clustered hierarchy has other disadvantages, a particular problem being that techniques so far developed often give rise to semantically incongruous classes (Pereira, Tishby, & Lee, 1993).
