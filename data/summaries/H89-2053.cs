The domain of locality of CFGs can be easily extended by using a tree rewriting grammar (Schabes, Abeill~ and Joshi, 1988) that uses only substitution as a combining operation.

The information put in the lexicon is thereby increased in both amount and complexity: see, for example, lexical rules in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1983), GPSG (Gazdar, Klein, Pullum and Sag, 1985), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987), Combinatory Categorial Grammars (Steedman 1985, 1988), Karttunen's version of Categorial Grammar (Karttunen 1986, 1988), some versions of GB theory (Chomsky 1981), and Lexicon-Grammars (Gross 1984).

Some examples of initial trees are (for simplicity, we have omitted unification equations associated with the trees): 5 4In some earlier work of Joshi (1969, 1973), the use of the two operations 'adjoining' and 'replacement' (a restricted case of substitution) was investigated both mathematically and linguistically.

The information given by anchor 9Unlike our previous suggestions (Schabes, Abeill6 and Josh_i, 1988), we do not distinguish each structure by its anchor position since it increases unnecessarily the number of states of the Earley parser.

LEXICALIZED TAGs An Earley-type parser for TAGs has been developed by Schabes and Joshi (1988).
C88-2121 P88-1032
Then we show how a general Earley-type TAG parser (Schabes and Joshi, 1988) can take advantage of lexicalization.

In 'lexicalized' grammars (Schabes, Abeill$ and Joshi, 1988), each elementary structure is systematically associated with a lexical item called anchor.

The 'anchors' can be freely chosen (Schabes, Abeill~ and Joshi, 1988).
