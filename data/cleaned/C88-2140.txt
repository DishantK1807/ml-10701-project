Nevertheless, since our approach is based on sound linguistic principles, most of the solutions found could be applied to other languages with a similar structure as well.
In this paper' we will focus on the core of the system's parsing component and neglect other features like spelling correction, treatment of anaphoric or elliptic utterances, quantifier seeping and the transformation into SQL.

The only adaptation to be done is a transformation uf the structured SQL output by DB-DIAI.OG into the special SQL used by the spscific DBMSo At the moment versions for ORACLE, REFLEX and MIMER are implementedo in some other ways the interface is also designed to be as portable as possible° Adaptatlon -to new domains is facilitated by keepin q the linguistic, coverage separate from the actual domain knowledge which rests solely in the \].exlcon.
Independence from the modeling of the domain in the data base is achieved by distinguishing between a linguistically motivated description of the domain and a database~,orlented one.
Tllsre is an explicit "translation step between these two parts.
Language independence is not aimed at, because figure io For a description of the interface as a whole see Buchberger et ai./1987/.
We have chosen to base our parser on semantic caseframe instantiation.
Such an approach is well suited for a restricted domain parser, because of its efficiency (by avoiding useless parses in case of syntactic ambiguity) and its robustness in the case of ungrammaticality (see eog.
Grishman et a\]./1986/).
On the other hand, relying solely on that method, it would be difficult to capture syntactic generalities (Cog.active-passive transformation), because syntactic as well as semantic restrictions must be specified explicitly for each slot of overycaseframe.
This means that for every different syntactic realization of the same statement a different caseframe has to be provided in the lexicon.
There are two severe drawbacks to this kind of realization: First, general syntactic properties of the language are implicitly stated in the lexicon entries instead of explicitly in the grammar leading to a possibly inconsistent and patchy syntactic coverage°' Second, the lexicon is inflated because for a single word (meaning) a number of different caseframes is needed.
To illustrate the problem let's have a look a% an example: 'liefern' (= to deliver) could have the following caseframe: (LIEFERN (AOENT (SYNTAX NP/NOM) (SEMANTICS COMPANY)) (OBJECT (SYNTAX NP/ACC) (SEMANTICS GOODS))) 677 This w<)u 1.

The ~enmntic,zontent is given by a ' semantic' prediea't~ and the functional dependencies and meanings of its arguments, and further red, frictions by modifiers (if any) .

Interaction Generally speaking, the topelogioal regularities of phrases are handled by the ATN, whereas free word order constituents are being taken care of by the unification process~ This unification proces~ works on ~ local chart created by the A'I'N, comprlsin 9 only those parts of the sentence relevant to it~ Thus various island phenomena fa\]! out from the conception of the parser., Flow of control between the ATN and the othe~ components is organized in a way p~:eposed by Boguraev /1979/o The ATN starts p'coeessi.~Lc~ a sentence in the usual way~ Afte:c rocognizJ.n<\] a phrase boundary by reachin U a POP az'<~ control is given either directly to the CFM Or the unification process o Th~ process evoked serves as a test for the ?~OP arc, i o e 0 in case of failure the ATN ha~5 to backtrack.
679 In constituents (with strict word order) the CFM is invoked directly and tries to build up a caseffame (or more than one in case of ambiguity)° The result is returned to the ATN which makes use of it during further processing° In structures with free constituent order (clauses) the ATN acts solely as a collector The words are first processed mo~phologically and a chart is returned, rendering a canonical form for each of the words together with word class and syntactic information (e°g.
case markers).
At this level, some ambiguities a~ise, eogo that of "welche" which might be an interrogative pronoun or a relative one, and "die" which may be an article or e relative pronoun.
Welct\]e,, Wien aez~el\]t fueP die Pr'odtJl<tion t)enoetigte Stoffe von Fir'men aus dem Ausland ? Fig.2: Morphological chart of constituents.
Constituent caseframes are merely stored in a local chart and attachment is postponed° The only constituent recognized topologically is the head which always comes in the last position° This chart of constituents Ks then given to the unification process when the POP arc is reached.
In addition to relying heavily on the CFM, the unificator also has various strategies at its disposal in order to take into consideration restrictions of adjacency and category dependent of the category of the phrase processed° This way possible syntactic ambiguity is m~duced and almost no backtracking is needed inside the ATNo Generally, information passed to the CFM is collected while traversing the subnet: head caseframes are instantiated, arguments and modifiers are collected by pushing the appropriate subnets and morphological and/or syntactic clues trigger various informations on the caseframes° AS an example we mention the passive • transformation: if evidence for passive is gathered while analyzing the verbal complex (for S) or a participle (for APs), this information is passed on to the CFM.
The CFM then applies the passive transformation to the relevant slots of the head caseframe before the slot filling takes place.
These transformations are one way to take general syntactic information away from the lexicon (the caseframes) to reduce redundancy /Hayes et ai.1985/. 6.
An Annotated Example To demonstrate how the system works, we will conclude the paper by giving an annotated example of a parse.
For the sake of clarity some of the details shall be simplified, but all of the essentials will be properly described.
We have chosen the following example sentence: "Welche yon unseren Abteilungen in Wien bezieht fuer die Produktion benoetigte Stoffe von Firmen aus dem Ausland"?
("Which of our Viennese departments gets materials necessary for production purposes from abroadT") Please note that the free translation does not capture the grammatical subtleties involved in the original sentence;especially the adjective phrase "fuer die Produktion ber.oet~gte Stoffe" includes a passivizatlon that tis usually not expressed this way in English.
68O There is a simple global control structure which works on this morphological chart° Its main task is to transfer control to ATN networks for phrase-like constituents and %o the unlficator for clause-like constituents° The control structure starts by transferring control to the PP/NP-ATNo The chart entry for "Ausland" is treated first ( remember the right-to-left direction of processing), i~ is found to be a noun, and the next edge, DET, is processed.
The third word, "aus", finishes the PP/NP.
Control is transferz'ed to the caseframe marcher (CFM).
The caseframe for the head, "Ausland", becomes instantiated, and the features of the other components are unified with it, especially the feature of dative, which is derived from the determiner.
After completion of this caseframe, control is transferred back to the PP/NP net which processes "yon Firmen" in a similar way° The CFM is called again, constructing another caseframe~ According to our strategy, PP attachment will not be performed at thls step, instead all the constituents will be collected first° The PP/NP ATN gets its next chance° It treats the chart entry for "Stoffe ~ which makes a perfectly suitable head for a more complex constituent.
We start to anticipate this when the next word, "benoetigte" ("necessary" albeit not an adjectives but a PPP in German), is processed.
In general, inflected PPPs trigger a PUSH AP, so does this one.
(Uninflected PPPs form part of the verb complex).
Next, a PUSH PP/NP is performed which will lead to a constituent embedded in the APe Hut let's see this in detail.
The PP is processed similar to %he others before, the head "Produktion" becoming instantiated and the caseframe filled after the entry for "fuer" has been processed.
This finishes the AP, since the verb, "bezieht", definitely cannot be part of an AP.
As you may remember, APs t~Igger th~ unification component which in turn calls the CFM to handle the simpler tasks.
Thus, th~ head of the AP, "benoetlgte", becomes instantlatedo The associated caeeframe lu presented below: (BENOETIG (SYN SUBJ) (SEM ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT) (SYN DOBJ) (SEM MATERIAL) (SYN PPOBJ (FUER)) (SEM PURPOSE)) Before the caseframe will be filled~ a passive transformation is applied, due to the fact that the example sentence contained the verb "benoetigen" in its PPP re,me This transformation simply changes SUBJ to PPINP~5 5ffr~fib~i ........... k~T 1 Fig~3: After processing of PP/NP3 POBJ PA,%~ t~nd DOBJ "to SUBJo 'The consequences of :tl,iL: t~ansformat:iion will not turn out in this s'te~p, but in %he next one~ when the PP/NP w~th th(~ head "Stoffe" will hav~ been flnished, l~ut let ' s stick to the correct ordex:.

}\[ 5ubj I~ rflaterlal / PPobJ (fuer) Purpose Fig,4: Caseframe for PP/NP3 Let us take a little digression~ Suppose the PP/NP ~'fuer die Produktion" would not have fit into a slot of the PPP.
If we had taken "gefaerbte" ("dyed") instead of "benoetigte" 'this wo%~id do.
In this case we would not get the ree~ding "materials dyed for production puz'poses" but instead two components, dyed materials" and "for production pu~'poses" o The sophisticated reader could argue that 'the first reading might also be correct.
The argument here is that the oaseframes in our systems are constructed .in a wa~ to fit the PP/NP I ......... :IE L Pl::tO~ ........ needs of the domain modelled° In ou~ " domain, this reading would not be appropriate, so we d-_i.d not provide a caseframe for it, thus excluding a theoretical ambiguity where in the practical application thez"e is none° As the slot filling fails, the AP..ATN will.
backtrack. We get an AP consisting of just one single word ("gefaerbte") filling a slot in "Stoffe", making up for one PP/NP and another PP/NP, namely "fuer die Produktion".
These two PP/NPs will be collected at this stage of processing and only attached when all of -the sentence will have been parsed.
We will stop our digression here a**d come back to the original example° Remember, the AP has,lust been flnished and the PP/NP with the head "Stoffe" is POPped° This means a transfer of control to the CFM (in PP/NPs the CFM is called di~ectly, whereas in an AP or S tile unlficator is called first in o~der to :find correct attachments° Afterwards, the uniflcator in turn calls the CFM to realize • the selected attachments ).
The AI? is integrated into the PP/NP caseframe as a modifier predicate in the MOD sloto The SUBJ slot of the subordinated caseframe (the one of "benoetigen" ) is still unfilled.
For syntactic reasons, its filler must be the head of the superordinated PP/NP "Stoffe"o The semantic restriction of the SUBJ slot is MATERIAL which is compatible with the noun "Stoffe", so the slot may be filled (note that SUBJ is the transformed syntactic /'estriction which had been DOBJ before the passive transformation had taken place ) o Thus, a third constituent has been added to the pool of collected constituents° The global control structure ce*rtinues by processing the next entry, the representation of the word "bezieht", which is a finite verb and has to be at the second position according to German grammar° It is set aside for later processing and a special state is entered, knowing that exactly one constituent has been left over° The PP/NP "in Wien" is processed, and a corresponding casef~ame is created.
Similarly, a caseframe for "welche yon unseren Abteilungen" is created and "in Wien" is attached to it when the unificator applies its knowledge that there cannot be more than one constituent in this position.
This way, possible ambiguities e.g° trying to fill "in Wien" into a slot at sentence level, are avoided° PP/NP4 PPINP PPfNP PP/NP~5 ..................... -AP.................

If we do, we will get an ambiguity.-In that case, the system will offer both solutions, using a heuristic which of the solutions to present first° The heuristic implemented prefers flat syntactic structures° AS for' the preferred reading, the CFM realizes it by filling PP/NP3 into the DOBJ slot and (PP/NP2 -.
PP/NP1) into the PPOBJ slot of the caseframe for "bezlehen"o PP/NP4 has already been filled in the SUBJ slot, se the parse of the sentence has been completed° 7.
Conclusion In this paper we have described a parser which is able to deal with a wide variety of German sentences in an efficient and robust wry.
This is made possible by two special properties of the parser: First, syntactic analysis uses two 'different strategies, namely an ATN and unification "to deal with fixed word o~der at the eonsh:\[tu~;nt level and free corrstituent order at the clause level rsspectively° Such an app'~'oaeh i.s well suited fox' German, but also for other SOV languages like Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Japanese ° Second, the interaction between casefram~ instantiation and a syntactic parser leads to the possibility of clear and precise formulation of syntactic and semantic rules and regularities, reduction'of entries in tlre lexicon, flexibility and better malntalnability~ 682 Thus pz'oblems posed by various aspeo'ts of "tbc; gene:c'al ~o\],~t:l,o~'~s which may be aDpllod \[:o othec ian\[~uages ms we~\].lo Aehnow\].edge~ent Work on DB.D\]\[ALOG is done Jointly with Softwa:~c:~ Managem~r!t GmbH~ A-1140 V:ten~s ~ Austr:\[a0 It has also been sponsored by the9 Austwia~ Governmer~t withJ,z'~ the "~-~{9~w~z'::,ur~c~.: S?
