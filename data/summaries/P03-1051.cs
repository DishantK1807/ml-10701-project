(Beesley 1996) presents a finite-state morphological analyzer for Arabic, which displays the root, pattern, and prefixes/suffixes.

(Goldsmith 2000) presents an unsupervised technique based on the expectationmaximization algorithm and minimum description length to segment exactly one suffix per word, resulting in an F-score of 81.8 for suffix identification in English according to (Schone and Jurafsky 2001).

Work Our work adopts major components of the algorithm from (Luo & Roukos 1996): language model (LM) parameter estimation from a segmented corpus and input segmentation on the basis of LM probabilities.
P96-1019
(Darwish 2002), is not very useful for applications like statistical machine translation, (Brown et al.1993), for which an accurate word-to-word alignment between the source and the target languages is critical for high quality translations.
J93-2003 W02-0506
By segmenting words into morphemes, we can improve the performance of natural language systems including machine translation (Brown et al.1993) and information retrieval (Franz, M.
J93-2003
(Schone and Jurafsky 2001) proposes an unsupervised algorithm capable of automatically inducing the morphology of inflectional languages using only text corpora.
N01-1024
(Darwish 2002) presents a supervised technique which identifies the root of an Arabic word by stripping away the prefix and the suffix of the word on the basis of manually acquired dictionary of word-root pairs and the likelihood that a prefix and a suffix would occur with the template from which the root is derived.

(Yarowsky and Wicentowsky 2000) presents a minimally supervised morphological analysis with a performance of over 99.2% accuracy for the 3,888 past-tense test cases in English.
