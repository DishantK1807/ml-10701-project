We do not include discourse entities for verb phrases or other propositional entities in this ranking since we have not studied their contribution (but see Sidner 1979, 1981 and Carter 1987).

In Section 2.4 we will present a slightly modified version of the centering algorithm (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).

In this case the data suggest that perhaps intrasentential candidates should be preferred (Walker 1989).

7 Smooth-shift was called shifting-1 by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).

Remember that in each case the zero in the third utterance was established as the Cb by the previous two utterances: Third Utterance Fourth Utterance Discourse Factor Example SUBJECT OBJECT(2) SUBJECT OBJECT(2) zero(i) NP(j) zero(i) zero(j) Continue/Retain 5 zero(i) NP(j) NP(ga)(i) zero(j) NP(wa)(i) zero(j) NP(ga)(i) zero(j) zero(j) zero(i),empathy zero(j) zero(i) zero(j) zero(i) empathy, Continue/Retain 36 zero(i) ZTA 32, 34 33 zero(j) zero(i) WA-effect ZTA ZTA and empathy zero(j),empathy 35 This analysis suggests that centering may be a universal of context-dependent processing of language, although so far this theory has only been applied to English, German, Turkish, Japanese, and Italian (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Di Eugenio 1990; Cote 1992; Rambow 1993; Nakatani 1993; Hofhnan 1995; Turan 1995).

Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b), and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992, 1993a; Cote 1995).

On the other hand, some purely syntactic accounts require that antecedents for zeros be realized as the grammatical TOPIC, and thus cannot explain the above example because Taroo is never explicitly marked as the topic (Yoshimoto 1988).
C88-2159
The two major previous accounts are those of Kuno (Kuno 1972, 1976b, 1987, 1989) and Kameyama (Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988).
P86-1031
This paper has three aims: (1) to generalize a computational account of the discourse process called CENTERING (Sidner 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished), (2) to apply this account to discourse processing * University of Pennsylvania, Computer Science Department, Philadelphia PA 19104.
J81-4001 P83-1007
This interpretation is found with minimal processing by interleaving the steps of the Centering algorithm proposed in Brennan et al.(1987). Note that nothing special needs to be said about the fact that EMPATHY is the discourse factor that made Hanako the Cp in 24b and thus predicted that Hanako would be the Cb at 24c (pace Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).

REAL-ZERO-PRONOUNS are supposed to have a wa-marked NP or a presentational NP as an antecedent (Yoshimoto 1988).

Remember that ROUGH-SHIFT is claimed to be less coherent than SMOOTH-SHIFT (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).

1. Introduction 1.1 Centering in Japanese Discourse Recently there has been an increasing amount of work in computational linguistics involving the interpretation of anaphoric elements in Japanese (Yoshimoto 1988; Kuno 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Nakagawa 1992).

Our analysis also builds on an earlier analysis put forth by Kameyama (Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988).

Being a subject has been shown to be an important factor for English; this is reflected in a Cf ordering by grammatical function (Prince 1981b; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988; Brennan submitted).
P87-1022
Although Kameyama uses the centering terminology, her account is not based on the constraints and rules of centering theory as developed here and presented in (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).
P83-1007 P87-1022
We have claimed here and elsewhere (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990) that the preference for parallelism is an epiphenomenon of the ordering of the Cf and the preference for CONTINUE interpretations.
P87-1022 P90-1010
Di Eugenio claims that discourse sequences in Italian that are not discourse-coherent according to centering theory produce a garden-path effect (Di Eugenio 1990).

20 In Walker, Iida, and Cote (1990) we called this Center Establishment.
P90-1010
Our analysis uses an adaptation of the Centering algorithm that was developed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard, based on these constraints and rules (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989).

Centering is intended to reflect aspects of ATYENTIONAL STATE in a tripartite view of discourse structure that also includes INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE and LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE (Grosz and Sidner 1986).
J86-3001
Centering has its computational foundations in the work of Grosz and Sidner (Grosz 1977; Sidner 1979; Grosz and Sidner 1986) and was further developed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, unpublished) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981).

Aspects of surface order may also affect the interpretation (Di Eugenio 1990; Hajicova and Vrbova 1982).

Centering Algorithm The CENTERING ALGORITHM that was proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard incorporates the centering rules and constraints in addition to contra-indexing constraints on coreference (Reinhart 1976; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Iida 1993).

This definition of transition states is summarized in Figure 1 (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).

A RETAIN is proposed as a way for a speaker to mark a coordinated transition to a new topic; it predicts a shift (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished; Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).

A polar focus is to concentrate on the role of syntactic information such as what was previously the topic or subject (Hobbs 1976b; Kameyama 1985; Yoshimoto 1988).
