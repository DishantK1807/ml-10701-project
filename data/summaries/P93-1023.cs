This has also been reported by other researchers in different evaluation problems (Lewis and Tong, 1992).

One other published model for grouping semantically related words (Brown et al., 1992), is based on a statistical model of bigrams and trigrams and produces word groups using no linguistic knowledge, but no evaluation of the results is reported.

In addition, we are exploring tests for determining whether two adjectives are antonymous, essentially in the opposite direction of the work by Justeson and Katz (1991), and tests for comparing the relative semantic strength of two adjectives.

(Hobbs et aL, 1993) who call it a noun group), mostly because of the relative ease with which it can be identified.

To determine the syntactic category of each word, and identify the NP boundaries and the syntactic relations among the words, we used the Fidditch parser (Hindle, 1989).

(Matsukawa, 1993)).

However, only recently has work been done on the automatic computation of such relationships from text, quantifying similarity between words and clustering them ( (Brown et aL, 1992), (Pereira et al., 1993)).

Paradigmatic semantic relations in WordNet have been used for diverse NL problems, including disambiguation of syntactic structure (Resnik, 1993) and semiautomatic construction of a large-scale ontology for machine translation (Knight, 1993).
