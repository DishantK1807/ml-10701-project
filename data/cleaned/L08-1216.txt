The term “ping-pong clustering” is not used generally, but in the paper (Dhillon et al., 2002), this method was called by the “ping-pong strategy.” So in this paper, we name this method as “ping-pong clustering.” Each method in the ping-pong clustering can be used as a clustering method by it</context>

LBR does not guarantee to improve the value of the object function used in clustering, but is actually effective to refine the clustering result produced by the spectral clustering method (Ding et al., 2001).

LBR is developed to refine the clustering result produced by the spectral clustering method, Mcut (Ding et al., 2001). The spectral clustering method suffers from the “skewed cut” problem. LBR is the countermeasure for that problem. In this section, first, we briefly explain Mcut, and then LBR. In Mcut, the data se</context>

To handle this problem, we devise the stop condition of the ping-pong. We judge whether the ping-pong is stopped or kept, by evalua</context>
