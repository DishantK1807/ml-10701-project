MI is defined in general as follows: y) I ix y) = log2 P(x) P(y) We can use this definition to derive an estimate of the connectedness between words, in terms of collocations (Smadja, 1993), but also in terms of phrases and grammatical relations (Hindle, 1990).

The classifier uses mutual information (MI) scores rather than the raw frequences of the occurring patterns (Church and Hanks, 1990).

3.2 Class-Sensitive Pattern Matching The pattern matcher runs over corpora that are: part-of-speech tagged using a widely used tagger (Brill, 1992); stemmed by using an experimental system that extends the Porter stemmer, a stemming algorithm widely used in information retrieval, with the Celex database on English morphology; (partly) semantically tagged using the CORELEX set of underspecified semantic tags as discussed in the previous section.
