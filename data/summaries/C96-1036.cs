Language models, such as N-gram class models (Brown et al., 1992) and Ergodic Hidden Markov Models (Kuhn el, al., 1994) were proposed and used in applications such as syntactic class (POS) tagging for English (Cutting et al., 1992), clustering and scoring of recognizer sentence hypotheses.

N-gram models arc usually used for scoring (Gu et al., 1991) (Nagata, 1994), but their training requires the sentences of the corpus to be manuMly segmented, and even class-tagged if class-based N-gram is used, as in (Nagata, 1994).
