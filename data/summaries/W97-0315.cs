This greatly changes the recognition problem, especially for software which finds patterns in text as the basis of its name recognition \[Krupka 1995\].
M95-1018
Name searching, matching, and recognition have been active areas of research for a number of years \[Hickey 1981, Carroll 1985, Rau 1991, Borgman and Siegfried 1992, Paik et al.1993, Hayes 1994, Proceedings 1995, Pfeiffer et al.1996\], but relatively little evaluation of either the effectiveness of name searching tools or of the effect of name recognition on relrieval performance has been published.
