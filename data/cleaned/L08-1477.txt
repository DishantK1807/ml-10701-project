The implementation is based on the finite state transducer technology developed at Xerox (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003; Kaplan and Kay, 1994). The rest of this paper briefly discusses some issues specific to the scripts and discusses the syllabification method for converting Dabire-text to the Arabic-based writing sy</context>
<context>ng. When converting Dabire to PA-Script we also face the problem of 1-to-many mapping between phonemes and graphemes. 3. The XFST Implementation The conversion system is implemented using Xerox XFST (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and is defined as a multilevel composition of transducers Sfy .o. CR .o.

The second statement defines, Sfy, a replacement rule (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) that represents the syllabification process. The replacement operator @&gt; ensures that shortest possible strings (of the form C* V C*) are selected in a left to right direction and identified as syll</context>

<context> introduces a method for converting names written in the PA-Script to Latin. (Kashani et al., 2007) uses letter-based alignment in automatic transliteration of proper nouns in Arabic to English, and (Beesley, 2007) applies morphological analysis to transcription to Arabic. However, we are not aware of any earlier work on automatic transcription from romanized to arabized Persian. The transcription method we us</context>
