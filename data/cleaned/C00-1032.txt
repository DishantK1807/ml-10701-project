The us(', of RAdj is particularly ti'e(luent in scieutiti(: tields (Monceaux, 1993).
P~m~(loxically~ ternlinology acquisition systems suc\]l as TEIMINO (David ~md Plant(': 11,)90), LEXTER (Bourigault, 1992), TERMS (.hlsteson and Katz, 1995), have not 1)een con(:erned with RAdj.

2 Linguistic
properties of relational adjectives Ac(:ording to linguistic and gralnlnaticM tradition, there are two nlain categories aUlOllg adjectives: el)ithetic slM1 as important (,sign'~ificant) and relatio11M adjectives such as laitier Malty).
The tirst ones cannot \]l~ve an ~gentive interl)re215 ration in contrast to the second: tile adjective laiticr (dairy) within the uoun phrase pr'oduclion laiti~re (dairy production) is an argument to the predicative noun production (production) and this is not the case fbr the adjective impof tant (significant) within the phrase production importante (significant production).
Relational adjectives (RAdj) possess the following wellknown linguistic properties: • they are either denonfinal adjectives -morphologically derived from a noun thanks to suttix--, or adjectives having a noun usage such as mathdmatique (mathcmatical/mathcmatics).
For the former, not all the adjective-tbrming sufiqxes lead to relational adjectives.
The following suftixes are considered by (Dubois, 1962) as appropriate:-ain, -air'e, -al, -el, -estr'c, ien,-icr',-il(e),-in,-ique.
However, (Guyon, 1993) remarks that a suffix, even the most appropriate, is never necessary nor sufficient.
Several adjectives carrying a favorable suffix are not relationah this is the case with the adjectives ending with -iquc (-ic), which characterize chemistry and which are not derived from a noun, such as ddsox!/ribonucldique (deoryribonucleic), dodecanoiquc Modecanoic), etc.
Other suffixes inappropriate are sometimes used such as the suffixes -d and -e'a:~:: carbone &,'bon) -* car'bon~J (~.a,'bo,,,,eeo'a,~), c,,,,ce," #a,,,cer9 + ca,~c~r'e'a:~ &ancc','o'~,~), etc.
• they own tile possibility, in special conditions, of replacing tile attributiw'~ use of a corresponding prepositional phrase.
The preposition employed, as well as tile presence or not of a deternfiner, depends on the head noun of the noun phrase: aciditd sanguine (blood acidity) ~_ aciditd du sang (acidity of the blood) conqugtc spatiale (space conquest) ~_ conqu~tc de l'espace (conquest of space) ddbit horairc (hourly rate) ~ddbit par' heure (rate per" h, our) cxpdrimentations animales (animal experimentation) ~ cxpdrimcntations sur lea animaux (experimentation on animals) • and several other properties such the impossibility of a predicative position, the illcompatibility with a degree modification, etc.
3 Morphological
Rule Induction ~lb identify RAdj trough a term extractor, we use their paraphrastic property which inchldes the morphological property, the morl)hological property being insufficient alone.
We need rules to recover the lemma of the noun fl'om which the lemma of the RAdj has been derived.
These rules tbllow the tbllowing schemata: r~ = \[-S +M \]{exceptions} where: S is the relational suffix to be deleted from the end of an adjective.
The result of this deletion is the stem R; M is the mutative segment to be concatenated to R in order to tbrm a noun; exceptions list the adjectives that should not be submitted to this rule.
For example, the rule \[-d -l-e \]{agd} says that if there is an adjective which ends with d, we should strip this ending from it and append tile string c to tile stem except if this a4jective belongs to tile list of exceptions, namely agd.
We extract these mort)hological rules Kom the corpora following the method presented in (Mikheev, 1997) with the difl'erenee that we don't limit the length of the mutative segment.
The relational suffixes are known, only the nmtative segments have to be guessed.
For tlm lemma of an adjective ending with a relational suffix in the corpus Adji, we strip this suffix of Adji and store the resulting stem ill R.
Then, wc try to segment this stein R to each noun Nounj at)pearing in the corpus.
If the subtraction result in all non-empty string, the system creates a morphological rule where tile mutative segment is tile result of the subtraction of R to Nounj.
We thus obtained couples (Ad.ii, Nounj) associated to a morphological rule.
For example: (gazeux, gaz) \[-cux +""\].
This schemata doesn't take into account stem alternants such as: el6 alphabe t/ aph, abd t-ique ~/~ hygi~ ne/hygidn-ique e/i polle n/polli n-ique x/c th, orux / thorac-ique 216 In order to h~mdle this alh)mort)hy, we, use the Lcvenshtein's weighted distance (l,cvenshtcin, 1.966) which determines the minimum numl)e,r of insertions or deletions of characters to transform one word into another.
(Wagner and Fisher, 1974) presents n re(:nrsive ~dgorithm to (:ah:ulate this dist~mcc.
• ! &.s t ('w ~,i, 'w~,j ) = min(di.st (w~,i-~, ""~,j) + q, • ~ di,~t(wi,i, with w~,m 1)eing the substring t)egimfing nt tlm 1l I'h' C\]I}II'}I, CtCI" }~ll(1 tinishing after tim mth characl;(;r of the word w, dis@c,y) = 1 i.f:c--y = 0 if :~: ¢ y and q cost; of the, inserl;ion/de, h',tion of one, character p cost of" t;he sul)stitution of one (:h;~racter |)y ~mothcr.
Generally, a substitution is (:onsidcr(~,d as a dch~lion fi)llowed 1)y ;m insertion, thus I ) -2(1• Wc apply this alg()rithm to e,a(:h stem 1, ()l)tahm(t ;d'te, r the (h~letion of tim r(~,lational suffix, that had not; 1)c(m found ~s a stem ()f n llOllll.
\]~llt,, we add the constraint that l/.
~m(1 the n(mn must share the same, two first; characters, i.e. the sul)string comput(:d t)cgin at character 3.
We only rel;~fin cout)les comi)oscd of ml ~uljectivc and a noun with it Levenshtcin's w(;ightcd e(tual (;o 3 (i.e.
one sul)stitutiol~ + one insertion). From the, se tout)los, wc dcdu(:c new rel;~tional suffixcs to l)c ~ulded to list; of ~dlowc, d sullixes.
More, 1)re('iscly, we (:onsidcr theft such suffixes are, allomorphic w~rbmts of the relation suffixes.
Wc also add new mort)hok)gic;d ruh',s.
For cxample, for the couple (hygi&t,c, hygidniquc,), we add the suffix -~niquc which is conside, red as an allomorph of the sutfix -iquc, mid creatc tim rule: \[-&t, ique +&~,e\].
However, this method doesn't rc,~ricve, RAdj lmilt from non ~mtonomous t)ascs of such nor from Latin noun 1)ases such as ph'r(,./patc/r (fathen'/patcr), vill@urb (tov,,,/,~rb).

4 Term

• it m~tchcs one of the morphosyntactic pattcrns of wh~Lt wc will (:all "l)~se terms", or one of their t)ossible vm'iations.
The l)atterns for base \[;CI'IlIS arc: Noun1 Adj cmballagc biod@radablc (biodcqradabh: packag(;) Noun1 Noun2 ions calcium 217 Nounl (Prep (Det)) Noun2 ions calcium (calcium ion) pTvtdine de poissons (fish protein), ehimioprophylaxie a'u r'~fa~n, pine (riJhmpicin chemoprophylazis) Noun1 5_ Vinf viandes ~t 9riller (grill meat) These base structures are not frozen structures and do accept several variations.
Those which are taken into account are: 1.
Inflexional and Internal morphosyntactic variants: • graphic and orthographic variants which gather together predictable inflexional variants: conservation de p~vduit (product preservation), conservations de p'rvduit (product preservations), or not: conservation dc prod'aits (products preservation) and ease dif ferences.
• variations of the preposition: eh, wmatographie en colonne (column chrwnatography), chromatographic sur colonne (chrvmatograph, y on col'area); • optional character of the preposition and of the z~rticle: fixation azote (hitrogen fization), fixation d'azote (fization of nitrogen), fi.~:ation de l~azote (fization of the nitrogen); 2.
Intermfl modification variants: insertion inside the base-term structure of a modifier such as the adjective inside the Noun1 (Prep (Det)) Nom~2 structure: lair de brebis (goat's milk), lait cru de brebis (milk straigh, t .from the goat); 3.
Coordinational w~riants: coordination of base term structures: alimentation humaine (human diet), alimentation animale et hnmaine (human and animal diet); 4.
Predicative variants: the predicative role of the adjective: peetinc mdthylgc (mcthylate pectin), cos pectines sont m6thyldes (these pectins are metylated).
The corpus is tagged and lemmatized.
The program scans the corpus, counts and extracts collocations whose syntax characterizes base-terms or one of their variants.
This is done with shallow parsing using local grammars based on regular expressions (Basili et al., 1993).
These grammars use the morphosyntactie information associated with the words of the corpus by the tagger.
The different occurrences are grouped as pairs formed by lemmas of the candidate term and sorted following an association measure which takes into account the frequence of the COOCCtlrrOllCeS.
4.2 Term
Extractor modifications The identilication of relational adjective takes place afl;er extraction of the occurrences of the candidate terms and their syntactic variations.
The algorithm below resmnes the successive steps tbr identifying relational adjectives: 1.
Examine each candidate of Noun Adj structure; 2.
Apply a transtbrmational rule in order to generate all the possible corresponding base nouns.
We added morphosyntactie constraints for some suffixes, such as tbr the suffix -er, that the identitied adjective is not a past-participle; 3.
Search the set of candidate terms tbr a pair formed with Nomtl (identical between a Noun1 (Prep (l)°t)) Nou,~2 and a Noun1 Adj structures) and Noun2 generated from step 2.
4. If step 3 succeeds, group the two base structures mlcter a new candidate term.
Take out all the Noun Adj structures owing this adjective from the set; of Noun Adj candidates and rename them as a Nomt RAdj structure.
I11 Step 2, morl)hoh)gical rules generate one or several nouns tbr a given adjective.
We generate a notllt for each relational suffix class.
A class of suffixes includes the allomorphic variants.
This overgeneration method used in inforlnation retrieval by (aacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999) gives low noise because the base noun must not only be an attested for in the corpus, but must also appear as an extension of a head noun.
For exanti)le, with the adjective ioniqne (ionic), we generate both ionic ('ionia) and ion (ion), but only ion (ion) is an attested tbrm; with the adjective gazeux (gaseous), the noun forms gaz #as) and gaze #auze); are generated and the two of them are attested; but, the adjective gazeux (gaseous) appears with the 218 Nmnber of oc(:urrences 1 > 2 Total 1)ase slir~l(:l;ures Nora1 Prep (\])et) Nora2 17 232 5 949 23 181 Nora Adj 12 344 4 778 17 122 Nora h Vinf 203 16 219 '.FoCal 29 912 10 895 40 807 Figure 2: Quantitative (bfl;a on 1)nse, stru(:tures llOllll dchange (ezch, ange) whi(:h is t)aral)hrased in the tort)us t)y dchangc de gaz (.qa.s ezchange) and not by ~.changc de gaze (gauze exehanftc).

This lead us to a linguisti(" i)rc(:ision of more than 99 % in the identitication of relational adjectives.

5.3.1 Relational
adjectives alone Fronl the 124 correct RAdj, 68 appear inside terms of the thesaurus in epithetic 1)osition, and 15 only under their noun tbrm in an extension position, for exmnple arach, idier (groundn'at) does not appear but arach, ide is used in an extension position.
Moreover, among the 124 adjectives, 73 appear in AGROVOC under their noun term as mfitenns.
The adjectives which are not l>resent ill the thesaurus in an extension t>osition tamer either their adje(:tiwfl or n<mn form are 11 in mmflmr.
So 93% of them m'e indeed highly inf'ormtLtive.
219 5.3.2 Candidate terms with a relational adjective Pour 9 AdjR belonging to AGROVOC, we compute the tbllowing indexes: TA tile number of terms in AGROVOC in which tile relational adjective appears in an epithetic position, i.e. the terms of Noun RAdj structure.
Fox" example TA=15 tbr the adjective cellulairc (eellular) because it appears in 15 terms of AGROVOC such as di./~renciation cellulairc (cellular differ'enciation), division cclIulaire (cellular division).
TN the number of terms in AGROVOC in which the noun from which has 1)een derived the relational adjective appears inside ~ prepositional phrase, i.e. the terms of Nounl Prep (Det) Nounl~Adj structure.
For example TN=4 tbr the noun eellulc (cell) because it appears in 4 terms of AGROVOC such as banque de ccllulcs (cell bank), c'alt'a,'e de ecUules (e~tlt~u'e of cells).
C A the number of candidate terms of Noun RAdj structure.
For example, CA=61 for the adjective celluIaire (cellular) because it appears in 61candidate terms such as acidc cellulaire (cellular acid), activitd cell'alaire (cclluhtr activity), agr@at cell'ulaire (ccll'ala'r aggregate).
C N the munber of candidate terms of Noun1 Prep (Det) NounltAd j structure.
For example CN=58 tbr the noun eellule (cell) because it appears in 58 candidate terms such as ADN de cellule &ell DNA), addition de cellules (cell addition).
Then, tbr each candidate term of CA and CN, we checked tbr their presence in AGROVOC.
Tile only matches that we have accepted are exact matches.
With this comparison, we obtained the following indexes: a the number of candidate terms of Noun RAdj structure tbund in AGR.OVOC under the Noun RAdj structure.
b the number of candidate terms of Noun RAdj structure tbund in AGROVOC muler the Nounl Prep (Det) NounlIAdj structure.
Noun RAdj N1 Prep (Det) NIIA4i Precision 0,34 {},{}4 Recall 0,46 O, 14 Figure 3: Averages of precisions and recalls c the number of candidate l;erms of Nounl Prep (Det) Nounl~Adj structure found in AGROVOC under the Noun RAdj structure.
d the number of candidate terms of Nounl.
Prep (Det) Noun~Adj structure found in AGROVOC under the Noun1 Prep (Det) NounRAdj structure.
These indexes allow us to compute precision P and recall R for each Noun RAdj structure and each Noun1 Prep (Det) Noun~Adj structure with the help of the fbllowing tbrmula: ((,, + b) I'No~,~A~j -C~ (1) + d) (2) aNounPrep(Del.)Nounl~A,lj -CN (a + t,) (3) ~NounRAdj -TA (c +d) l~,Nounl)rep(Det)Nounl¢A4i -TAr (4) The averages of precision and recall for the two structures are summarized in table 3.
This comparison of the average of precision computed shows that candidate terms with a Noun RAdj structure are 10 times more likely to be terms than their eqniwflent in Nounl Prep (Det) Nounl~.Adj.
The analysis of the average of recall is also impressive: it is generally difficult to obtain a recall sut)erior to 25 % when comparing candidate terms extracted from a corpus and a thesaurus of the same domain (Daille et el., 1998).
The average of recalls obtained thanks to the identification of RAdj shows that nearly half of the terms lmilt with the defined RAdj are identified.
These good wflues of precision and recall have been obtained on linguistic criteria only without taking into account frequency.
