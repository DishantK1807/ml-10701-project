The latter is currently dominating in NER amongst which the most popular methods are decision tree (Sekine et al., 1998; Pailouras et al., 2000), Hidden Markov Model (Zhang et al., 2003; Zhao, 2004), maximum entropy (Chieu and Ng, 2002; Bender et al., 2003), and support vector machines (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002; Takeuchi and Collier, 2002; Mayfield, 2003).

II: Support Vector Machines Support vector machines (SVM) method produces high performance in many classification tasks (Joachims, 1998; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
