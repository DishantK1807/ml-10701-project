This result is similar to the one obtained by (Kehler et al., 2004), where the task was anaphora resolution.

Reranking Candidate 1 Candidate 2 Candidate 3 Candidate 4 : Case element : Verb Candidate Candidate Figure2: Selectionofpossibleparses for reranking Many methods for reranking the parsing of English sentences have been proposed (Charniak and Johnson, 2005; Collins and Koo, 2005; Henderson and Titov, 2005), all of which are discriminative methods which learn the difference between the best parse and next-best parses.

The recent availability of larger-scale corpora annotated with dependency information has thus resulted in more work on statistical dependency analysistechnologiesthatusemachinelearningalgorithms (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002; Sassano, 2004; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000).

Statistical Japanese dependency analyzers (Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), however, will output the result where “keisatsu-de” modiﬁes “arui-teiru”.

The recent availability of more corpora has enabled much information about dependency relations to be obtained by using a Japanese dependency analyzer such as KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994) or CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

We also added our original features and their combinations, with reference to (Sassano, 2004; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002), but we removed the features that had a frequency of less than 30 in our training data.

Uchimoto et al., for example, used as such a feature whether a particular type of bunsetsu is between two bunsetsus in a dependency relation (Uchimoto et al., 1999), and Sassano used information about what is just before and after the modifying bunsetsu and modifyee bunsetsu (Sassano, 2004).

However, Kehler et al.pointed out that this does not make the analysis more accurate (Kehler et al., 2004).

Statistical Japanese dependency analyzers (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2005; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002; Sassano, 2004; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000) automatically learn the likelihood of dependencies from a tagged corpus and calculate the best dependencies for an input sentence.

(6) The proposed model is inspired by the semantic role labeling method (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), which uses the frame element group in place of the particle set.
