We do not choose the best-first search strategy proposed by Ng and Cardie (2002b).

In the literature, much of the work on coreference resolution is for English text (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al., 2003; McCallum and Wellner, 2005).

The probabilistic model of Seki et al.(2002) both identified and resolved Japanese zero pronouns, with the help of a verb dictionary.

In Iida et al.(2006), they proposed a machine learning approach to resolve zero pronouns in Japanese using syntactic patterns.

This is similar to the approach adopted in Soon et al.(2001). We also train the AZP resolution classifier using the J48 decision tree learning algorithm.

Florian et al.(2004) and Zhou et al.(2005) reported research on Chinese coreference resolution.

Tuning of Parameters Ng (2004) showed that an NP anaphoricity identification classifier with a cut-off threshold t = 0.5 pruned away many correct anaphoric NPs and harmed the overall recall.

Yeh and Chen (2004) proposed an approach for Chinese zero pronoun resolution based on the Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995).
