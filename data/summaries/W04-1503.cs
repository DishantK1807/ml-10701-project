This step is called supertagging and has been suggested and studied in the context of Tree Adjoining Grammar by Bangalore and Joshi (1999).

We will extend our basic approach in the spirit of (Kahane et al., 1998) in future work.

Because the rules make reference to other struc5Kahane et al.(1998) present three different types of rules, for subcategorization, modification, and linear precedence.

In fact, we first extract a Tree Insertion Grammar following the work of (Xia et al., 2000; Chen, 2001; Chiang, 2000), and then directly convert the trees of the obtained TAG into automata for the parser.

In a somewhat related manner, Alshawi et al.(2000) use cascaded head automata to derive dependency trees, but leave the nature of the cascading under-formalized.

4In fact, much of our formalism is very similar to (Lombardo, 1996), who however does not discuss parsing (only recognition), nor the representation of the parse forest.

In this paper, we follow a suggestion made by Abney (1996) and worked out in some detail in (Lombardo, 1996)4 to extend Gaifman’s notation with regular expressions, similar to the approach used in extended context-free grammars.

See (Rambow and Joshi, 1997) for a discussion related to TAG, and see (Rambow et al., 2001) for the definition of a tree-rewriting system which can be used to develop grammars whose derivations faithfully mirror syntactic dependency.

This formalism is based on previous work presented in (Kahane et al., 1998), which has been substantially reformulated in order to simplify it.5 In particular, we do not address non-projectivity here, but acknowledge that for certain languages it is a crucial issue.

In the fourth approach, the dependency grammar is converted into a headed context-free grammar (Abney, 1996; Holan et al., 1998), also the Basic Dependency Grammar of Beletskij (1967) as cited in (Dikovsky and Modina, 2000).

Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not.
