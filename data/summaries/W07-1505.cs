Currently, the scheme supports PhraseChunks with subtypes such as NP, VP, PP, or ADJP (Marcus et al., 1993).

An XML-based NLP tool suite for analyzing and annotating medical language in an NLP pipeline was also proposed by (Grover et al., 2002).

The MEANING format (Pianta et al., 2006) is designed to integrate different levels of morphosyntactic annotations.

For illustration purposes, we extended it here by MUC (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) entity types such as Person, Organization, etc.

PTBConstituent, 38 GENIAConstituent (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005) and PennBIoIEConstituent.

The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative3 established a de facto standard for the Semantic Web.4 For (computational) linguistics proper, syntactic annotation schemes, such as the one from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), or semantic annotations, such as the one underlying ACE (Doddington et al., 2004), are increasingly being used in a quasi standard way.

In the meantime, the Annotation Compatibility Working Group (Meyers, 2006) began to concentrate its activities on the mutual compatibility of annotation schemata for, e.g., POS tagging, treebanking, role labeling, time annotation, etc.
W06-0606
If alternative annotation tag sets are chosen for the same functional task a ‘data conversion’ problem is created which should be solved at the abstract specification level as well (Ide et al., 2003).
W03-0804
With respect to already available POS tagsets, the scheme allows corresponding extensions of the supertype POSTag to, e.g., PennPOSTag (for the Penn Tag Set (Marcus et al., 1993)) or GeniaPOSTag (for the GENIA Tag Set (Ohta et al., 2002)).
