This is nearly equivalent to the disambiguafion method proposed by Hindle and Rooth (1991).

Methods of resolving ambiguities have been based, for example, on the assumption that case slots are mutually independent (Hindle and Rooth 1991), or at most two case slots are dependent (Collins and Brooks 1995).

We generalized the values of the case slots within these case frames using the method proposed in Li and Abe (1998) to obtain class-based case frame data.

In particular, Suzuki (1993) has devised an algorithm, based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen 1989), which estimates the target joint distribution as a dependency forest model (see Li \[1998\] for a derivation of this algorithm from MDL).
