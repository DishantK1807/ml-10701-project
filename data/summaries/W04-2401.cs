The other framework, inference with classifiers (Roth, 2002), views maintaining constraints and learning classifiers as separate processes.

In addition to the conceptual simplicity of this approach, it also seems to perform better experimentally (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

In named entity recognition, “no entities can overlap” is a common constraint used in various works (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).

The learning algorithm used is a variation of the Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth, 1998; Roth and Yih, 2002), a multi-class classifier that is specifically tailored for large scale learning tasks.
