Structuring Two-Medium Dialog for Learning Language and Other Things Henry Hamburger George Mason University; Fairfax, VA, USA Dan Tufts Research Institute for Informatics; Bucharest, Romania Raza Hashim Bridgewater College; Bridgewater, VA, USA OVERVIEW: Naturalistic two-medium communication with a computational system, using both language and interactive graphics (Cohen, 1991; Maier, 1993; McKeown, 1993), is an important practical complement to studies that involve only language, only graphics and/or only people.

Integrative two-medium work should build on insights and findings in the one-medium disciplines of graphical manipulative interfaces (e.g., Hutchins et al., 1986; Sullivan and Tyler, 1991) and natural language discourse (e.g., Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Litman and Allen, 1987; Hovy, 1988; Lambert and Carberry, 1991; Paris, 1991).
