(Meyers et al., 1996)) were designed to produce alignments which preserve the least common ancestor relationship: If nodes a and b map into nodes a' = f(a) and b' = f(b), then f(LCA(a,b)) = LCA(f(a), f(b)) = LCA(a', b').

Based on this alignment we can "chop up" the trees into fragments, or substructures ((Matsumoto et hi., 1993)), where each substructure of a tree is a connected group of nodes in the tree, together with their joining arcs.

Other systems, including our own ((Grishman, 1994) and (Meyers et al., 1996)), syntactically analyze sentences (parse) before acquiring transfer rules (cf.

Similar work (e.g., (Matsumoto et hi., 1993)) considers all possible matches.
