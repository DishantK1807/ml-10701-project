After tagging the corpus using the POS part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988), we used a CREP (Duford, 1993) regular grammar to first extract all possible candidates for entities.

In our work to date on news summarization at Columbia University (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev, 1996), information is extracted from a series of input news articles (MUC, 1992; Grishman et al., 1992) and is analyzed by a generation component to produce a summary that shows how perception of the event has changed over time.

Techniques for proper noun extraction include the use of regular grammars to delimit and identify proper nouns (Mani et al., 1993; Paik et al., 1994), the use of extensive name lists, place names, titles and "gazetteers" in conjunction with partial grammars in order to recognize proper nouns as unknown words in close proximity to known words (Cowie et al., 1992; Aberdeen et al., 1992), statistical training to learn, for example, Spanish names, from online corpora (Ayuso et al., 1992), and the use of concept based pattern matchers that use semantic concepts as pattern categories as well as part-of-speech information (Weischedel et al., 1993; Lehnert et al., 1993).

cal context surrounding the hypothesized proper nouns (McDonald, 1993; Coates-Stephens, 1991) and the larger discourse context (Mani et al., 1993) to improve the accuracy of proper noun extraction when large known word lists are not available.
