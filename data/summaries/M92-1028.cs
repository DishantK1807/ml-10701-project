It is the record that th e reader/listener keeps, at any point of the discourse, concerning who or what is being talked about in the current discourse, as well as where and when an event or action is taking place . There are linguistic devices/cues which serve to establish the deictic center (such as explicit mentioning of a discourse entity in a certain syntactic position and with a certain semantic role), to maintain the deictic cente r (such as the use of deictic verbs and adverbs, as well as pronominal forms), and to indicate the shift of the deictic center or the possibility of such shift (such as long referential distance, referential competition (Givon 1983), as well as the linguistic devices for establishing a new deictic center) . Keeping track of the deictic center of the discourse will contribute to finding the correct referent for anaphoric expressions in the discourse, understandin g the overall event-situation structures (Webber 1987) of the discourse, as well as, in the context of MUC, the task of event separation.

Another important aspect of discourse modeling which is being incorporated into our system involves the notio n of subjectivity/perspective and belief spaces (Banfield 1981, Rapaport 1986, Wiebe & Rapaport 1988) which have been applied to narrative discourse.
