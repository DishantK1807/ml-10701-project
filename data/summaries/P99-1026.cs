They use intonation (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992; Traum and Heeman, 1997; Heeman and Allen, 1997) and probabilistic language models (Stolcke et al., 1998; Ramaswamy and Kleindienst, 1998; Cettolo and Falavigna, 1998).

The word error rate is defined as 100 * ( substitutions + deletions + insertions ) / ( correct + substitutions + deletions ) (Zechner and Waibel, 1998).

In addition, they do not have to be adjacent to each other, which leads to robustness against speech recognition errors as in fragmentbased understanding (Zechner and Waibel, 1998; Worm, 1998).

systems by Allen et al.(1996), Zue et al.(1994) and Peckham (1993)) assume that the user makes one utterance unit in each speech push-to-talk method is used.

Although this can be considered a kind of partial parsing technique (McDonald, 1992; Lavie, 1996; Abney, 1996), the SUs obtained by ISSS are not always subsentential phrases; they are sometimes full sentences.
A92-1027
Considering the current level of speech recognition technology, system-initiative dialogue systems, which prohibit users from speaking unrestrictedly, are preferred (Walker et al., 1998).
P98-2219
Zechner and Waibel (1998) and Worm (1998) proposed understanding utterances by combining partial parses.
