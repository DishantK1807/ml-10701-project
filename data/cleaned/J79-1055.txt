40:624	A total of 212 individuals and 46 institutions who had paid for 1975 did not rene# for 1976, althouah each Mek several renewals continue to dribble in, Several reasons might be thought of for the deckine: 1.

44:624	It is hoped that the newly reactivated membership* CoKtmfttee, under the chairmanship of John liqoyne, will be able to devise creative ansNers to this chronic problem, In an organization such as Oars, where the association 1s almost entirely dependent On the payment of annual dues, even a slight drop in membership causes serious problems, This years financial situation was further exacerbated bv three additional things: ACL secretary-Treasurer s Report, h,Uctober 197b Page 8 I. he coptinued, unreal st ically low dues rare of s~O, for whipp members.

CUTTING (DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY) The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 1975 xiv + 335 pages $15.00 ISBN 0-262-11059-8 REVIEWED BY SIEB NOOTEBOOM Instituut voor Perceptie Onderzoek Postbus 513 den Dolech 2 Eindhoven 4502 The book under review contains the proceedings of a small conference (22 participants) with the same title, held in October 1973 at the Urban Life Center, Columbia, Maryland.
140:624	The conference was one in a series called "Communicating by Language", sponsored by the National.
141:624	~nstiiute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).
142:624	These are 19 papers, divided into 3 major sections, viz.
143:624	I The development of speech in man and child I1 Language without speech (dealing with sign language) I11 Phonology and language Some papers are followed by comments of one of the participants each paper or coherent group of papers is followed by a summary of fhe open discussion.
144:624	A separate IVth section of the book contains reflections on the conference by Ira J. Hirsh.
145:624	RefeThe Role of Speech in Language rences are presented at the end of each paper.
146:624	The editors have provided a name index and a subject index at the end of the book.
147:624	Many linguists and psycholinguists take it for granted that language can be studied without studying speech.
148:624	Likewise many speech researchers seem to work from rhe view that the p~oduction and perception of speech can be studied without s~udying language.
149:624	This situation leads Alvin Liberman to I I state in his "Introduction to the conference" that our topfc --the role of speech in language--is not an established one; no one has made it the direct and primary object of his research.
150:624	11 Although this statement is perhaps too categorical, it certainly is valid for most of the field.
151:624	(An obvious exception, to my mind, is among others Professor Lindblom of the University of Stockholm, who systematically explores the explanatory value of quantitative models of speech production and perception in phonology, e.g. Lindblom 1972, 1975).
152:624	The organizers of the conference, Kavanagh and Liberman, have taken care to select well-known researchers with different backgrounds and different interests to discuss the various problems which may be derived from the central question: "do we increase our understanding of language when we take into account that it is spoken"?
153:624	The resulting texts make interesting reading, although one will look in vain for a convincing answer to the initial question.
154:624	Different investigators have different opinions and the present state of knowledge does not seem to make it The RoJ~I of Speech in Language possible to settle the matter.
155:624	In most papers specialist knowledge is freely intermixed with speculation, and it is not always easy to tell the one from the other.
156:624	The discussions generally serve more to con-tinrle speculation than to criticize in detail each other's thinking.
157:624	These remarks are not meant as a criticism of the conference and its proceedings.
158:624	They intend to give an indication, however, of the style of this book, and a warhing that one will not find here a thorough discussion of empirical data or explicit, testable theories, that could be of use in more practically oriented work.
159:624	Instead one finds a number of inspiring expositions of such diverse topics as similarities and dissimilarities between human and animal communication systems, the evolutionary connections between language, speech, and tool-making, the primacy of production or perception in the phylogenesis and the ontogenesis of speech, the primacy of signs or speech in the evolution of language, the articulate structure of signs in those who have sign language as their first language, the origins of phonological change, and the parallels in phonological and other linguistic organization of language.
160:624	Below I will make a few remarks on a few selected topics: a) The evolutiorl of speech and language b) Spoken language and sign language c) Innate feature detectors d) The absence of prosody I will not attempt to cover in this review all papers in the book.
161:624	A* THE EVOLUTION OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE In a number of places in this volume attempts are made to relate results of recent empirical studies of several kinds to theoretical ideas on the evolution of speech and language in early man. So Peter Pfarler gives an interesting description of communication systems in nonhuman primates and birds.
162:624	His data on monkeys show a difference between discrete signal systems, consisting of a limited number of acoustically welldistinguished sound signals, used by monkeys living in dense forests and having little visual contact, and graded signal systems displaying continuous variation of sound signals, used by terrestrial monkeys.
163:624	The bird data on the white-crowned sparrow lead him to the concept of an innate auditory template for bird song, modifiable by a suitable external model and serving for the developmefit of vocal behavior.
164:624	In his speculations on the origin of speech Marler emphasizes the importnace of the evolution of innate but modifiable auditory templates for speech sounds, serving to distinguish between acceptable and nonacceptable models for vocal development, for classifying acceptable sounds into.subcategories and for developing speech.
165:624	He also assumes that, while categorical processing was developed as an aid in identifying sounds from memory, continuous sensory processing of sounds was retained, thus leading to an intermingling of categorical and noncategorical (discrete and graded) processing.
166:624	He finally suggests that "The substitution of categorical for continuous processing ~ht.
167:624	Role of Speech in Lanquaqe 30 of speech sounds may have directly facilitated the introduction of syntax as a radical innovation in primate communication".
168:624	There appear to be two basic assumptions underlying Marler's reasoning.
169:624	One is that comparative studies of sensory and vocal behavi~r in animals and man maxr lead to interesting theories about specific properties of the human brain underlying man's capacity for speech and language.
170:624	The other is that such studies may clarify the order in which postulated changes in vocal perception and development might have occurred in the evolution of early man. There is an important difference between these two assumptions.
171:624	Whereas the former may lead to theories or hypotheses which in ~rinciple might become testable, the latter does not, at least not within the limits of this reviewer's imagination.
172:624	Obviously this lack of testability is common to many speculations about the evolution of humari behavior.
173:624	This has in the past not kept scientists from making reasonable guesses particularly about the evolution of language and speech, and probably will not do so in the fature In this volume both Hewes in his comments on Mattingly's paper and Liberman in his own contribution relate the genesis of language to toolmaking.
174:624	Hewes observes similarities between syntactic structures and the prescribed order of the various steps necessary for the manufacture of flakes from a prepared Levallois core.
175:624	Liberman, taking the same Line of thought, states that the Levallois toolmaking technique cannot reasonably be described by means of a phrase-structure grammar.
176:624	A The Ro-E-' of Speech in Lanyuayc transformational grammar which formally incorporates a memory is necessary.
177:624	As far as I understand his reasoning this is so because in making a particular chip one has to keep two things in mind, both the last chip that has been made and the final form of the tool.
178:624	It seems to me, bwever, that in order to ~ive his argument its force it still has to be shown that 3 there is a fundamental difference in the necessary complexity of underlying mental structures between Levallois toolmaking and many forms of goal-oriented behavior we find in higher animals.
179:624	Liberman also suggests that the final crucial stage in the evolution of human language would appear to be the development of the bent two-tube supralarynge~l vocal tract of modern man, which allows its possessors to generate acoustic signals ehat (1) have very distinct acoustic properties and (2) are easy to produce, being acoustically stable.
180:624	Reconstructions from fossils tell him that the Neanderthal hominids had to do without this asset, and therefore probably retained a cormunication system with a mixed phonetic level that relied on both gestural and kocal components.
181:624	At this point the reader particularly feels the need for an expert criticism of the validity of %uch reconstructions.
182:624	Bn SPOKEN LANGUAGE AND SIGN LANGUAGE The question whether speech or gestural comunication has been more important in the evolution of human language came up several times during the conference.
183:624	In reaction to Mattingly 's The  ole of Speech i n Lanryudye idea that "speech exemplifies a thoroughly and peculiarly human kind of knowing" Hewes commented that the depigmentation of the volar skin would indicate the antiquity of nonvocal cormn~nication.
184:624	Indirect support for this supposed antiquity of gestural communication comes from some fascinating studies of American Sign Lansuage (ASL), according to Bellugi and Klima a full-fledged language of its own, and not a derivative or degenerate form of written or spoken English.
185:624	Stokoe argues for the antiquity of sign language from a possible parallel between ontogeny and phylogeny.
186:624	It appeatrs to be the.
187:624	case that the infant with deaf parents, learning ASL as its first language, begins putting wordlike signs into sentencelike struktures at an earlier age than the child making two-word or three-word sentences in speech.
188:624	Bellugi and Klima have studied sign language from historical changes in the form of signs, in short term memory experiments, by analyzing a collection of "slips of the hand1', sad by comparing American Sign Language with Chinese Signs, in all cases with profoundly deaf peaple who use sign language as their primary form of communication.
189:624	They show that signs in ASL are not simply signals which differ uniquely and hlistically from one another but are, rather, highly coded units.
190:624	They also provide evidence that grammatical processes bear the marks of the particular transmission system in which the language developed.
191:624	This seems to be donfirmed in ~uttenlocher's Thc Rol c of Speech in Lany uaqe contribution, comparing the encoding of spatial relations in ASL and natural language (= spoken American English) It is too early to draw any definite conclusions from these studies of sign language on the interdependence of natural language and speech, as the structure of sign language is only beginning to be understood.
192:624	But it is certainly of much interest to students of language behavior that the human perceptual and cognitive systems appear to be so flexible that profoundly deaf people may develop visual communication systems among themselves which, if not equal in expressive power and speed of communication to natural spoken languages, at least come close to them.
193:624	Further comparisons between the syntax of natural spoken languages and sign languages may lead to more caution in interprethg current ideas about what is and what is not innate in our linguistic abilities.
194:624	Similarly comparisons between the efficiency of speech perception and the efficiency of visual sign perception might well make us wonder whether speech perception is as special as some theorists like to make us believe.
195:624	CI INNATE FEATURE DETECTORS The idea that speech perception is mediated by, possibly innate, speech specific feature detectors was given considerable atreption in the conference.
196:624	This idea supported Marler's extrapolation from innate auditory templates in birds to.
197:624	innate auditory templates in humans.
198:624	Studdert-Kennedy provides a The Role of Speech in Lilnyuayc careful survey of the current empirical evidence concerning the perceptual processing of consonants and vowels, from which he concludes that the "human cortex is supplied with sets of acoustic detectors tuned to speech, each inhibited from output to the phonetic system in the absence of collateral response in other detectors".
199:624	Cutting and Eimas present evidence that such feature detectors are innate.
200:624	Eimas has shown that very young infants, one month bnd four months of age, can discriminate much better between different speech sounds that belong to different phonemic categories than between different speech sounds belonging to the same phonemic category in adult speech.
201:624	One ma7 concur, however, with the doubt expressed by Hirsh in his reflections on the conference whether Eimas's data are about speech or about general auditory perception.
202:624	One may feel similar doubts about the interpretation Eimas and Cutting give to the data stemming from the selective adaptation paradigm, introduced in speech perception studies by Eimas and Corbit in 1973 and since then used by an increasing number of investigators.
203:624	In selective adaptation studies it is shown that repeated stimulation with a particular acoustic configuration, for instance a syllable ba, may change the response distribution in a phoneme identification task, for instance the binary forced choice between ba and measured with stimuli.
204:624	taken from the acoustic continuum between ba and . In this case the number of Eresponses would increase at the cost of the ba-responses.
205:624	The Tho Role of Spcoch in Ldnguaye interpretation is that there are feature detectors which can be fatigued by repeated stimulation.
206:624	By carefully studying which acoustic configurations lead to shifts in particular response distributions, it would be possible to find out what information is extracted by particular feature detectors.
207:624	Cutting and Eimas argue for the existence of phonetic, speech speciiic, feature detectors.
208:624	More recent studies show that categorical perception and selective adaptation are not unique to speech perception (Cutting, Rosner and Foard 1976) . Furthermore, to my knowledge, nobody has yet seriously discussed the.
209:624	difficulties for a theory of "wired-in" feature detectors stemming from perceptual normalization experiments in which it is shown that response distributions in phoneme identification tasks may shift systematically due to the immediate environment of the test segment (e .g . Fourcin 1972) . Dm THE ABSENCE OF PROSODY The volume under review is not only remarkable for the many interesting and stimulating papers it contains but also for -what it does not con&ain.
210:624	In a collection of papers with the title "The role of speech in language" one wo~ld have expected to find at least one contribution seriously discussing the relation between speech prosody and linguistic structure.
211:624	It is ironical that the only paper in which intonational contrast is given more ateention than obligatory lip service is Stokoe's contribution "The shape of soundles~ language", dealing with The Role of Speech in Language 3G sign language Stokoe's treatment of intonation and its kinesic correlate in sign language seems to make explicit why so many speech researchers do not pay attention to speech prosody.
212:624	He suggests that intonational contrasts "are not necessarily linguistic and have more affinity with other systems that signal affect than with phonemic contrasts.
213:624	There remain then only phonemic contrasts between consonant and consonant, vowel and vowel, and tone and tone (when so used) as the ihdisputably linguistic, basic features of language".
214:624	One may fear that this undue overemphasis on phonemic contrast in speech perception research will persist until speech scientists turn away from the study of isolated CV-syllables and start wondering about the perception of normal spontaneous connected speech.

216:624	A grammar is used to characterize a parsing homomorphism which maps terminal strings to a polynomial semiring.
217:624	The image of a string under an appropriate homomorphism contains terms which specify all derivations of the string.
218:624	The work describes a spectzum of parsing techniques for each context-free grammar, ranging from a form of bottom-up to top-down procedures.
219:624	ALGEBMIC PARSING OF CONTEXT-FREE LANGUAGES I. Introduction For many years syntactic analysis and the theor;of formal languages have developed in a parallel, but not closely rel-ted, fashion.
220:624	The work described here is an effort t.0 relate these areas by applying the tools of formal power series to the p-iroblem OF parsing.
221:624	This paper presents an algebraic technique for parsing a broad class of context-free grammars.
222:624	By parsing we mean the process of determining whether a string of terminal symbols, 1, is a member of the language generated by grarnmar G i , is x e L(G))?
223:624	and, if it is, finding all derivations of x from the starting symbol of G. We hope that posing the parsing problem in purely algebraic terms will provide a basis for examination and comparison of parsfng algorithms and grammar classes.
224:624	Section 11 presents an overview of the algebraic parsing process.
225:624	It provides a general notion of how the method works without going into detail.
226:624	Section 111 contains the algebraic preliminaries and notational eonventions needed in order to describe the parsing method precisely.
227:624	The formal presentation of the parsing method and the proof of correctness form Section IVI Section V contains some interesting special cases of the theorem and presents some examples 0-f parses.
228:624	11.
229:624	Overview of the algebraic parsing, p recess The algebraic parsing formalism described here is applicable to all context-free grammars G = <vN, vT9 P, S> except those that contain producti~ns ~f the form A B where A and B are both nonterminals, or erasing rules such as A -p e. The parsing process consists first of constructing (on the basis of the grammar G); a polynomial and a function defined on polynomials.
230:624	A parse of x is obtained by repeated applications of the function to a polynomial P(x).
231:624	The process has two features worthy of note.
232:624	First, it produces all parses of x in parallel.
233:624	Second, the process of cohverting a grammar into the required algebraic form is straightforward and does not alter the structure of the grammar.
234:624	This property, the preservation of grammatical structure, is particularly important in areas such as natural language analysis where the structure that a grammar provides is as important as the language it generates.
235:624	The polynomials we will use have terms of the form (Z,A), where Z is a string aver aa extended alphabet and A represents a sequence of productions of G. The process begins with a polynomial of ordered pairs representing X, the string to be parsed.
236:624	A function is repeatedly applied to the poJvnomia1; the number of applications nacessary is bounded by.
237:624	the input length.
238:624	If the resulting polynomial contains a term (S,A) where S is the starting symbol in G, then A repLresents the production sequence used in generating x Esom S. If no such pair occurs, then x is not in L(G), and if multiple pairs I occur (S hl), (5 'A2) . . .
239:624	then x is ambiguous and the A s specify the several parses.
240:624	A precise formulation of the polynomial and the operations on it is given belaw.
241:624	111.
242:624	Algebraic preliminaqies, and notation A semigroup is formally defined as an ordered pair <S,-i where S is a set (the carrier) znd ' is an associative binary operation.
243:624	Similarly, a monoid is a triple consisting of a set, an operation and a two-sided identity (e.g. , s,) We will feel free to denote a monoid or semigroup by its cerrier.
244:624	* For any set V, V denotes the free monoid generated by V; * * + V = <V,concatenation,n>.
245:624	Similarly, V denotes the -free semigroup + generated by.
246:624	r; V+ = <V, concatenat ion).
247:624	We denote the length of a * + string X in 7 or V by 1x1.
248:624	For an arbitrary alphabet V, we define = E;~V~VI.
249:624	The free half-group generated by V, H(V), is defined to be the monoid generated by V u 9 together'with the relation aa = 1, where 1 is the monoid identity and a s any element of V. Note that in H(V) the elements of 7 are left inverses but not right inverses of the co.rresponding elements of V. We denote the extended alphabet If T = <~,*,1> and Q = <~,+,0> are monoids, we deno.te by T Q the product monoid <T y Q,@, (1;0)>.
250:624	The carrier of T Q is the cartesian product T Q and the operation @ is defined to be the component-wise operation of T and 0: A semiring is an alzebraic system <S,+,,O> such that <S,+,O> is a commutative monoid, <S,m> is a semigroup, and the operation distributes over +: am.(b+c) = a*b + aec, (a+b)*c = a-c + b*c. A semiring is commutative if the operation is commutative, A semiring with identity is a system <~,+;,0,1> where <s,+;,O) is a monoid.
251:624	The semirings used in this paper are commutati~re and have identities.
252:624	Furthermore, in each case the additive identity is a multiplicative zero: 0-x = x-0 = 0.
253:624	The boolean sem%ring B consists of the carrier {0,1] under the comrn~tat~ve operations + and *, where 1-1 = l+x = I. and 0+0 = O*x = 0 for all x E I0,l).
254:624	For an arbitrary monoid M we denote by R(M) the baniring of polynomials described as follows : 1) Each tern is of the form ca where c E B (the boolean serniring of coefficients) and rx E M. 2) Each polynomial is a formula sum (under +) of a finite number of terms.
255:624	3) Addition and multiplication of terms is defined as follows : a) bu + crx = (b -fc) a b) (ba) (cB) = (be) bP).
256:624	4) Addition a,nd multiplication of polynomials is performed in the usual manner consistent with 3).
257:624	Note that all coef iicients of R(M) arc either 1 or 0.
258:624	We wi 11 adopt the usual convention of not explicitly writing 1 for the terms with that coefficient and omitting telms with a coefficient of 0.
259:624	A --context-free grammar is a system G = <VN, VT, P, S> where VN and V are finite, disjoint, non erlpty sets denoted non-terminal and T terminal symbols respectively.
260:624	We denote by V the set V :I VT. The N symbol S is the distinguished nonterminal from which all derivations begin, and P 2s the set of productions of G. A context-free grammer is proper if it does not contain productions of thz form A -+ c (erasures) or A B where A and E are both nonterminals.
261:624	It can easily be shown that the set of Languages generated by proper context-free grammars is exactly the set of context-free languages.
262:624	In addition, an arbitrary context-free grammar can be made proper by a straightforward method which alters the structure of the grammar very little.
263:624	In this study we will deal with only proper .context-free grammars.
264:624	This guarantees that all terminal strings have a finite number of derivations in C-, and thus makes possible our goal of finding all derivations of an input.
265:624	i Productibns of G will be indexed by integers.
266:624	Thus A M denotes th that A -+ >I is the i production in P. We will deal only with leftmost deriyations.
267:624	A leftmost derivation is completely specifzed by the initial sentential form and the sequence of production indices.
268:624	If* A c_ 1 is the sequence of production indices in the leftmost derivation.
269:624	+ + C of N 6V from M c V, we rite ?I -N.
270:624	The length of a derivation D is denoted by I, and is equal to the number of production indices in L. We will use, but not formally define, the notion of height of a derivation', meaning the height of the corresponding derivation tree or the length of the longest path from the root to the frontier of the tree.
271:624	The height of a derivation C will be denoted by h(C) . ' Since derivation' will always mean 'lef tmos t derivation1 in the sequel, the following assertions hold: Assertion 1: A derivation is of height 0 if and only if it is of length 0.
272:624	A derivation is of height 1 if and only if it is of length 1.
273:624	Assertion 21 Let G be a proper context-free grammar, and G A -9M where IGliO.

277:624	The algebraic structure used in this work is the semiring of polynomials R(H I*) where H = H (v) I the free half -group generated by V, and I is the in'dex set of the set of proJuctions P. We will.

287:624	The function v is the homomorphism induced by the following: * v(a) = (a,A), a E V and fl is the identity in I . Since v is a homomorphism, v(A) = A. The function g is the homomorphism induced by defi-ning g on the generators of the domain as follows: 2i g (a, A) contains the term (a, A) ; a c V th 2ii.

304:624	Since A is a summand of p, it follows that (A,A) is a summand of k k p (A,A), and therefore A, is a summand of 6g Bk(A,h).

315:624	m Proof by induction on k, the number of applications of g. By 0 definition, g (a,I') = (I) which establishes the assertion for the value k = 0.
316:624	n+l n Assume the assertion holds for k < n and consider g a, = gq (a,?').
317:624	By the induction hypothesis, all terms of $(a,T') are of the form 8 (bfi,~~') where b aN.
318:624	Hence terms of gnfl(a,r) are of the form g(bE,Or).
319:624	Since g limited to is the identity.
320:624	.g(bi,~~) = [g(b,bT ) ] (i,,~).
321:624	By definition of g, g(b,Or ) contains only terms of the i'orm (cG, j91 ) j n't-1 where C + blf is a production.
322:624	Therefore terms of g (a,I') are of the form j F) j Q and since C -h b?l and b =s, aN it follows that C aNM.

325:624	Proof by--induction on the length of M: Basis : Let a. E V and assume k 6g Yk(a) contains (G>A).
326:624	If pi represents an arbitrary summand of p other than PL, then every k term of g Y (a) can be represented in the form k where 0 r n < k and n denotes the number of nontrivial summands of p which are factors of the term.
327:624	By const~uction, every summand of p is either A-or of the form + (B .F, j i) where Bi I: VN, P cV,jiF-T I. i i .I i and B -* P is a production in G. i i k By Lemma.
328:624	11.
329:624	every term of g ((B. , j i) is of the form: I i C * * (C .M.P,I' . j ) where Ci Vi, Mi, P cV,Ti tl ~ri 11 i k By the same lemma, it follows that every term of g (a,A) is of the form -.
330:624	I' (Cn+lMn+19 n+l ) where C E V, M 3 ll *+I c 1.n+l n+l k Hence every term of g Y(a) is of the form k r L riji I n+l where C -----" P.M. for 1 r i r n and C M i 11 n+l nC1 k By assumption there is a tern1 t of g Bk(a) such that 6[k] = (A~,A); t must be in the form indicated above.
331:624	In order for t to cancel under 4, the following must be true: C1 = A since C cannot cancel from t, 1 P =QC for 1 i I n since C 2acn+l must all cancel from t. i i i+l Therefore This cancels to (i,~) as required with =I QMQ M . Q M n+l n n n-1 n-1 11 Then by (19, C -C QM it1 i i' 15 i 5 n, and i Hence-, since C = *A, 1 and thus a A . N. This establishes the basis . * Induction; Assume that for all M V such chat IM I n, if k a 6g Yk(w) contains (AN,A) then A =-.

333:624	Let fi = Ma be a string k5 such that I~ai = n+l and 6g y (Ma) contaks (AN,&).
334:624	Because 6 g k and Y are hmornorphisms, k k Then 6g W (K) must contain a term (T A ) and 6g Y (a) must contain k is 1 k a term (T A ) such that T T = AN and h = 2' 2 12 81A2 In order f6r this tc occur, T2 must be of tahe form (BE*) r~hpre * B c(V, N2 r V, and TI just,be of the form (ANIB) where1 A E V, * I N1 E V, and N = fi1i2.
335:624	(If T and T were not of this form, 1 2 k cancellation to ~ would be impossible).
336:624	Thus 6g Yk(M) contains (AN R,Al).
337:624	, and by the induction hypothesis 1 k Also 6g Y (a) contains (B&>,A~) and by the basis k It follows that and since A = Ma and N = N2N1' which completesthe proof.
338:624	The theorem now follows from Lemmas 1 and I I1 and As~ertion 2.
339:624	The 'if' part follows from Lemma I and Assertiori 2, and the 'only if' part follows kminediately from Lemma I11 for the special case of N = A. As we have stated the theorem, the length of x is used to determine a sufficient number of applications of g and Y. Alternatively, the theorem could be foxmulated in terms of the heights of derivations of X; if A is a derivation of x of height k, then for every n 2 k, the term (S, A) will be in the polynomial .s~"Y (x) . Furthermore, it n follows from Lemma 111 that no harm is done by choosing the value of n too large, i-e.
340:624	, no 'false' derivation terms will occur.
341:624	In the flrst statement of the theorem, the derivation terms n n n are obtained from the polynomial Bg Tl,p v(x).
342:624	which can be rewritten in the form Although we have used a constant value of n (equal to the length of X) for both the powers of the map g and the polynomial p, some economy can be gained in this respect.
343:624	In fact, the poweYs 5f g and p can decrease from left to right so longas they remain large enough to perform the appropriate computations on the suffix strirlgs of X. Thus, the theorem is true (b~t considerably mora difficult to prove) if,one instead uses a parsing polynomial of the form V. Special cases of the thedrem A number of intdesting special cases occur based cln the choice of V1 and V 2' Case 1.
344:624	V1 = VT. The function g handles all productions of the form while p handles productions of the form Notice that since g is nontrivial on only V g need be used only T ' once; i-e.
345:624	, The parsing polynomial is then The special case 01 V = VT and,V2 = VN 1 results in a particularly simple form if the grammar is in Greibach no ma1 form.
346:624	The polynomial p = (A,A) and therefore has 110 effect.
347:624	Since g need only be applied once, all derivations are found in one step.

352:624	V1 = V. The entire job of parsing is now done by g, since the polynomial p is equal to (A, .'I) . Hence the parsing polynomial is Example 2: We use the same grammar and input stririg as above.

371:624	b number of statistical theories have been proposed capable of identqifying individual text words that* are most useful for the content representation of written texts and documents.
372:624	Among these are parameters based on the variance of the word-frequency distribution (NOCC/EK), and on information theoretical (signalnoise S/N) premises.
373:624	These formal parameters are reLated to practical automatic indexing techniques--most notably to the discrimination value (DV) method, capable of generating content identifiers (individual words, phrases, and word classes) that distinguish the various texts and documents from each other.
374:624	It is shown that terms with favorable formal parameters also exhibit desirable semantic characteristics in that such terms are concentrated in documents judged relevant by the respective user populations, and vice-versa for terms with unfavorable formal properties.
375:624	1.
376:624	Theories of Term Importance Automatic indexing may be considered to be a two-step process:.
377:624	first the automatic identification of linguistic entities useful for the representation of document content, and then the assignment to the prospective content identifiers of weights reflecting their importance for content description.
378:624	Since these tasks must ultimately depend on a study of the texts or documents under consideration-, a grelt deal can be learned by examining Term Value Measurements the occurrence patterns of words and other linguistic entities in the documents of a collection.
379:624	Indeed, among the theories of term importance which have been studied in recent years, the best known 'ones are based on the respective frequency distributions across a variety of written texts.
380:624	A) Variance-Based Measures The most widely used of the statistical theories' distinguishes so-called "specialty" wowds from "nonspecialtyll words by assuming that a deviation from randomiiess in the occurrence pattern of certain text words is indicative of specialization and hence of good content identifiers.
381:624	Thus the best content descriptors are terms Whose occurrence pattepns deviate most strongly from randomness.
382:624	Since a random sprinkxing of the occurrences of a given text w~d across the documents of a collection leads to wora frequency distributions which follow the Poisson model, a compa~ison of the actual freqiieiicy characteristics of a given term with the Poisson distribution leads to the appropriate distinct ion between good content words and poor.
383:624	ones.
384:624	More specifically, since the variance vk of the frequency distribution of term k is propo~tioeal to the total frequency of occurrence F~ for terms whose distribution obeys the Poisson model, a measure of term importance is k obtainable by using a formula based on the ratio of vk to F . Some typical formulas used fcr this purpose are vk/fk and n k k 2-v/F where n is the collection size.
385:624	[1,2,3] The basic mathematical formulations are collected in Table 3.

B) Signal-Noise Measure Another measwe based on the characteristics of the frequency digtribution of individual text units across the documents of a collection is the signal-noise ratio which varies with the skewness of the frequency distribution.
387:624	This measure has the form OF entropy and assigns the highest value ts those terms whose occurrence characteristics exhibit the greatest variation from one document to another; ccntrariwise low values are assigned to terms with relatively similar frequency patterns in each of the documents of a collection.
388:624	[3,4] The idea is that terms with even frequency distributions which may occur an identical number of times in each document of the collection canr~ot be used to distinguish the documents from each other; hence, their assignment for purposes of content representation is counterproductive.
389:624	The reverse obtains for terms with skewed fvequency distributions.
390:624	k The signal noise value (S/N) for term k is defined as k A1 J. I i (s/N)~ = log F C log :-A l?
391:624	E k Term Val uc Meas urcmcnt s k The negative term in expression (2) is known.as the noise N ; it is k k maximized for even distributions where fk = F /n for all f The 1 properties of the signal-noise measure are thus very similar to those described earlier for the variance-based formulas.
392:624	C) I nf ormat ion Theoret ic Considerations The for~going development leads to a distinction among the terms in k accordance with the relative sizes of the indibidual term frequencies fi k in the documents and the total collection frequency F . A question arises about the preferred size of the collection frequency F~ (or of the k document frbquency B 1 for terms that are useful as content identifiers.
393:624	This problem may be tackled by having recourse to certain information-theoretic concepts.
394:624	Consider the task of supplementing a set of existing 5ndex terms ideneifying a collection of documents by addition of a certain number of new Terms.
395:624	Each new 'term is then most effective when a) it provides maximum additional reduction in uncertainty among the documents of the collection (that is, its assignment breaks up existing subsets of documents that cannot be distinguished by the existing term assignments into substantially smaller subsets); b) it exhibits little redundancy with the previously available terms SO that its assignment does indeed optimally divide the various document sets.
396:624	The first property is obviously not fulkilled for tersms with low k document frequency B, that is, those assigned to very few documents in the collection, because their assignment provides little additional discrimination among the documents; the second property, on the other hand, does not obtain for terms of high document frequency that may be assigned to a very large number of documents, because such terms will obviously exhibit a good deal of redundancy with the already existing terms.
397:624	Term value Measurements The conclusion is that the best terms are those whose document frequency k k B, or total frequency F, i~ neither too large nor too small, and whose k ikequency distribution is skeued in that for some documents4 f is much i F~ > F~ larger than and for some others fi is much smaller than . n n D) The Discrimination Value Model The discrimination value model uses as a point of departure the retrieval capability of the various index terms; specifically, a good content-indicative term is designed to help in the retrieval of material that is wanted (thus enhancing the recall), and in the rejection of material that is extraneous (thus enhancing the precision)fi.
398:624	To produce high recall, that is to retrSeve most everything that is relevant, the terms used to 'identify documents and user queries must be fairly general in natwe; high precision, on the other hand, that is the rejection of the nonreleudat material, depends on the use of reasonably specific content identifiers.
399:624	The indexing problem then reduces to the choice of terms that are specific enough to prohuce high precision while also being general enough to produce high recall.
400:624	In the discriminatiqn value model, the assumption is aade that the best terms in this respect arc those which cause the maximum possible separation among the dobuments in the "document space".
401:624	Consider, in part idular, a collect ion of documents each identified by a set of content identifiers, or index terms.
402:624	The ?'ndex term sets for two given documents can be compared to produck a similuity coefficient measuring the closeness between the respective documents.
403:624	* Recall is the proportion of relevant material retrieved while precision is the proportion of retrieved material that is relevant.
404:624	An effective 7 retrieval system is one whlch produces the highest possible precision for a given level of recall.
405:624	Term Val uc> Mcas urcmcnts The existence of the term qets representing the various documents, and the possibility of computing similarity measures between documents can be used to define a document space For the collectioh.
406:624	In such a space two documents appear in close proximity when their similarity aoeffi~ient is large; contrariwise, documents exhibiting little similarity are widely separated in the document space.
407:624	One may then conjecture that a document space which is "bunched up", in the sense that all documents exhibit somewhat similar term sets is not u~eful for retrieval, since one document cannr*t then be distinguished *om another.
408:624	On the con;trary, a space.
409:624	Which is spread out in suchma way that the documents are widely separated from each other may provide an ideal retrieval situation since some documents may then be retrieved hopefully the relevant ones while others can be rejected.
410:624	This suggests that the value of an index term can be ascertained,by measuring the amount of spreading in the document space which occurs when that term is assigned to the documents of the collection.
411:624	Specifically ; if Q is the density of the document space without term k present among the content indicators, and Qk is the density after term k is assigned, then for a good term Q Qk > 0, since the space will have spread after term k is assigned.
412:624	ConverseSy for poor terms Q % T 0.2 [5,6] An appropriate * The density of the space might be computed, for example, as the sum of all pa:-vwise similarities between dist inct document pairs, that is where S(Di, D.), 0 < S < 1, is the similarity between documents D 3 and D i 3 Term Value Measurements measure of term importance is then the term discrimination value, DVk 3 defined as It may be of interest to inquire into the relationship between the discrimination value of a term and the statistical.
413:624	(frequency) parameters introduced earlier.
414:624	The following conclusions are reached from a study of the indexing vocabularies in several different subject areas, relating the document frequency of a term to its discrimina.tion value: [5] a) terms with yery Low documeht fiequenay that may be assigned to very feQ documents in a collection are generally poor discriminators; when the terms are arranged in decreasing order of their discriminamtion values (where rank 1 is asdgned to the best discriminator, rank 2 to the next best, and so on) such terms exhibit ranks in excess of t/2 for a total of t existing terms; b) term3 with high document frequencies, comprising those that are assigned to more than 10 percent of the documents of a collection are the worst discriminators, with average discrimination ranks (ranks in decreasing discriminatioh value order) near t; c) the best discriminators are those whose document frequency is neither QO high nor too low -with document frequencies between n/100 and n/10 for n documentq; their average discrimination ranks are generally belaw t/5 for t terms.
415:624	The vector space analysis then appear& to confirm the conclusions derived earlier from the statistical models, that terms which appear in a collection with great rarity or excessive frequency are not optimal for content description purposes.

417:624	Compariscn and Evaluation The discrimination value analysis can be used to derive an effective indexing policy: since the best terms appear to be those with medium document frequencies, such terms can be directly assigned as content identifiers without further refining transformations.
418:624	On the other hand, terms with excessively high document frequencies must be made more specific thereby decreasing the frequency of their assignment to The queries and documents of the coilection: contrariwise, terms with low document frequencies must be made more general by increasing their assignment frequencies.
419:624	[5] This can be achieved by joining two or more high frequency terms into term phrases, while assembling a number of low frequency terms into term classes.
420:624	Obviously, a term phrase exhibits a lower assignment frequency than any phrase component, and vice-versa for a term class which replaces a number of individual class elements.
421:624	It was shown earlier that the use of phrases and term classes (thesaurus) constructed in accordance with t*he frequency requirements imposed by the discrimination value theory produces substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness (recall and precision).
422:624	In the present work, additional relationships are examined between the statisticd and the vector space models.
423:624	However, instead of aotudly 'using the various term sets in a retrieval environment, an attempt is made to relate the formal frequency and vector spaee properties of the terms to the se-nantic characteristics of these terms.
424:624	Specifically, consider a collection of documents in a given subject aea and an appropriate set of user queries pertaining to that area.
425:624	For each user query, the set of documents can be partitioned into two subsets consisting of the Term Value Measutements 70 relevant set R and the rlonrelevant set I, respectively.
426:624	Relevance is assumed to be user-specified in such a way that a relevant item is assumed to be one which ig related in some sense to the infornation need expressed by the various user queries.
427:624	The linguistic, or semantic, character of a given term can now be introduced by assuming that the most valuable contentidentifiers assigned to a collectio~l of texts are those which are!
428:624	concentrated in the documents specified as relevant to the respective queries, as opposed to the.
429:624	nonrelevant ones, contrariwise, the less valuable terw will be concentbated in the nonrelevant items.
430:624	The discussion may be formalized by using the concept of term relevance TR.
431:624	[7] Consider a term k contained in query Q;.
432:624	the terBm releva~ke TR(k) may be defined as where r and hk are the number of documents containing term k that are k relevant and nonrelevant respect ively to query Q, and I R I and I I I ire the total number of relevant and nonrelevant documents for that query.'
433:624	When a term k occurs in more than one query, its term relevance may be taken as the average of the relevance values obtained for the various queries.
434:624	The mathernaticxlly undesirable situation when I RI r or when h 0 is not likely to occur in a pi-actizd envircnmegt.
435:624	k k Term Value Mcas urcmen ts It is clear from the function (4) that high values arc ~:SS~~TIC~ to those query terms which are prevalent in the relevant items and rhe in the nonrelevant, and vice-versa for thase previl3cn-t mainly %n the nonrelevant.
436:624	Furthermore, the terms falling into ;he former class ape likely,to be more useful for content representation than those in the latter.
437:624	To verify th'e relationships between the statistical models of word importance and ths vector space model, dcsument collections are used in three different subject areas, including aerodynamics (cRAN), medicine (MED) and world affairs (TIME).
438:624	The vocabularies and user populations are disjoint for these rhree areas.
439:624	Results which carry through for all three cases should be extendable to other subject fields as well.
440:624	The basic collectibn statistics are contained in Table 2.
441:624	It may be seen from the Table that the term relevance is defined for only a relatively small number of terms for each collection, namely 458, 172 and 375 for CRAN, MED, and TIME, respectively.
442:624	The reason Ls that a term relevance value is computable only for terms which occur joinaly in certain query-document pairs.
443:624	Fop small experimental collections operqting with a restricted number of queries the size of the corresponding term sets is obviously limited.
444:624	Consider now the comparison of the standard statistical term value measures with the term discrimination values obtained by the vector space transformations.
445:624	Table 3 shows the values of the NOCC/EK and S/N measures (expressions (1) and (2)) obtained for tine 50 terms with highest discrimination values and the 50 terms with lowest discrimination values for each of the three test collections.
446:624	The range of the respective values is given in each case, as well as the average values for each set of 50 terms in percent (that is, on Term Value Mcdsurcmcnts 7 2 Basic Collection Statistics Table 2 Chc:ract eristics : Subject area Nunher of documents Numb5r of cser queries Number of terms assigned to collect 5 on Number of teps occurring jointly in queries and document sets CRAid 4 34 aerodynamics 424 155 2651 458 MCU 450 medicine 450 2 I!

448:624	T test values are.also shown ~epreserlting the probability that the two sets of 50 values (for the high DV and low DV terms) could have been derived from a common probability distrihutzon by chance.
449:624	In statistical significance testing, a t-test value smaller than 0.05 is normally taken to imply a significant difference; that is, the hypothesis that the mo sets of values do in fact originate from a common distribution is rejected in such a case.
450:624	[8] It rpay be seen that the ranges of values for the statistical parameters NOCC/EK and S/?$ exhibit substantial differences for ail three colleotions.
451:624	The same is true for the corresponding average values.
452:624	Moreover the differences are in all cases statistically ssignificant.
453:624	, It is then clear that a high discrimination value reflected in the ability of a term to expand the document space upon assignment to the collection also implies, favorable statistical parameters in terms of va iance and skewed frequency distributions; the converse is true for the low discrimination values.
454:624	At the bottom of Table 3, range and average values are given for those terms among the sets of 50 terms for which the term relevar~ce is defined (that is, lhose which co-occur jointly in some query-document pair).
455:624	Again the term relevance values are substantially different for the two classes of DV terms, and these differences are statistically significant.
456:624	Also included in Table 3 are the multiplicative factors which relate the average values for the 50 high discriminators and the 50 low discrimihators for each of the three measures (that is, the factor by Term Value Measurements which the OW average value must be multiplied to obtain the high).
457:624	It may be seen that this factor is much higher for the term relevance than for either of NQCCIEK or S/N. The actual factors for the term relevance are 6.66, 80.0 and 36.33 for the CRAN, MED, and TIME collections, respectively.
458:624	Thi& indicates that the high discriminators have very much higher average term relevance than the low discriminators; alternatively expressed, there is substantial agreement between the semantic term relevance concept and the automatically derived term discrimination values.
459:624	The data already included in Table 3 are shown in term relevance order in Table 4.
460:624	The output of Table 4 contains range and average values for NOCC/EK, S/N, and DV for the 50 terms with highest term precision and the 50 terms with lowest precision for the CRAN and TIME collections, respectively.
461:624	Averages are produced for only 30 high and 30 low precision terms for the MED collection because in the medical environment the small number of available queries (24) made it possible to compute term precision values for only 172 terms in all.
462:624	It is clear from the output of Table 4 that the differences in the respective values aye substantial in all cases, and the t-test values indicate that they arc fully significant.
463:624	For the three collections under study, &he evidence indicates that terms with favorable formal parameters tend to be concentrated in documents identified as relevant by the user population, and vice-versa for terms with unfavorable formal parameters.
464:624	Also shown in 4 -k Table 4 are average document frequency (B ) and average total frequency (F ) values for tho high and low relevance terms respectively.
465:624	It may be seen that the Term Value Mcas urements high relevance terms exhibit a much lower frequency spectrum (as e~pected for good discriminators) than the low relevance terms.
466:624	Once again, it appears that the term relevance reflecting the semantic properties of the terms in their particular collection environment effects a division among the terms very si~ilar to that obtained by the discrimination value cornputat ions.
467:624	In earlier work it was shown that the discrimination value theory which leads to the assignment to queries and documents of medium frequency terms cincluding also phrases constructed from high frequency terms, and term classes made up of low frequency terms-) exhibits egfective retrieval characteristics.
468:624	[4,5,6] Typical average retrieval precision values for three different recall levels (recall of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) are shown for the three collections in Table 5.
469:624	The output shows that the use of mediumfrequency phrases and term classes improves performance by about 20 percent compared with the assignment of single terms alone.
470:624	The comparison of Tables 3 and 4 between discpimination values on the one hand, and statistical and semantic parameters on th"e other, indicates that the same theory which produces such effective retrieval characteristics also conforms to the known sta'tfstical and linguistic theories of term behavior.

478:624	SNOPAR is designed for lknguistics teaching and research.
479:624	Emphasis is placed or1 the development of small to medium grammars in a variety of languages.
480:624	The system has been used so far to develop a grammar of English for use transformational grammar course and develop small grammars of a Nigerian and an American Indian language.
481:624	Intended applications of SNOPAR are in fi'.
482:624	& linguistics and grammar model testing.
483:624	The main part of the program is the routine PARSER.
484:624	When PARSER is c'allbd with a lexicon and grammar, input* strings are parsed according to the model grammar.
485:624	The PARSER functions available for grammar developmerlt are CAT, PARSE, SETR, GETR, RESET, TESTR, GETF, GETCL, TO, BACK, FINDWRD, and BUILDS.
486:624	The function operations and descriptions of their argumerits are given in Table 1.
487:624	After a parsing, PARSER returns' control to the user permitting examination of stacks and registers at all TABLE 1 PARSER CAT PARSE SETR GETR TESTR RE SET GETF GETGL BACK looks up the word class of the current first word.in the.input string.
488:624	If the word is not in the lexicon an add routine is called which permits additions.
489:624	If CAT succeeds by matching the current word class with its argument, the word is removed fram the input string and pushed ont-o a staclc (SAVEW) . If it fails an alternate class is tested, provided chat the alternate flag is on.
490:624	Fail return leaves the surface string unaltered.
491:624	calls the function given by its argument and if successful pushes the structure returned by the function onto a stack (SAVEQ) and assigns the structure to the Q register.
492:624	sets the values of registers.
493:624	It has three arguments level, register name, and value.
494:624	Each cavil ~f SETR causes the register name specified to be placed on -3 list for the specified level.
495:624	SETR enrries are treated as stacks, providing automatic saves for recursi-ve calls.
496:624	returns the contents of the register name specified by its argument, and pops it ofk the stack saving the last value.
497:624	looks at the value of the register name specified by its argument without popping it off the stack.

509:624	In the examination stage, traces may be turned on lexioal entries may b~ examined or minor changes to the grammar may be made.
510:624	Functions available A for the examination of stacks, registers and lexicon are POP, OUT, GETR, LOOKLEX,and TRACE.
511:624	A function GETENG is also available for dictionary lookup in other languages.
512:624	PARSER requires approximately 150 lines of SNOBDL code and is currently operating on a DEC 10.
513:624	A hatch version has been tested on an ZBM 360 In order to use PARSER, a grammar and lexicon must be developed as disc: files.
514:624	Since the grammar Ls developed as a separate file different components of the grammar can be tested and put together in a variety of contigurations.
515:624	If a Lextcon is not developed as a disc Eiie prior to a parse, it may be entered fron the terminal A simple grammar which produces surface structure trees is shown in Example 1 along with a sample parsing.
516:624	A portion of the lt?xicon is shown at the bottom of the page.
517:624	Example 2 shows the use of the GETF function to handle agreement between plural adjccti.vcs and a plural, rnark~r in Angas, a Nigeticln lony,unjic.

SNOPAR The complete SNOPAR system has in add'ition to PARSER a routine for generating grammars from a .state transition graph and a register action table.
519:624	This routine called NEW guides the user through a state transition graph and register actions to produce a grammar compatible with PARSER.
520:624	Thd SNOPAR NEW routine is still in develoj~rnen~.
521:624	The current routine allows deuelopment.of small grammars.
522:624	The new developments will pro vide diagnostics of grammar errors.
523:624	SNOPAR dlso has a line editor (FIXUP) and disc 1-10 commands.
524:624	The complete system allows repetitive testing of model grammars, permits editing; and has trace capabilities fsr grammar debugging.
