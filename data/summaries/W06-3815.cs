For example, distances that incorporate Resnik’s (1995) information content (IC), a192a126a193a98a194a59a195 a5a102a196a197a5a68a198a137a199a59a200a201a198a12a202a30a196a63a203a78a13a68a13, such as those of Jiang and Conrath (1997) and Lin (1998), consider both the (lowest) common ancestor as well as the two nodes of interest in their calculation.

Since we wish to evaluate the strength of our method alone without any additional NLP effort, we bypass the issue of approximating the true distribution of the concepts via word sense disambiguation or classbased approximation methods, such as those by Li and Abe (1998) and Clark and Weir (2002).

Note that some of the most successful concept-to-concept distances proposed in the CL literature are non-additive (e.g., Lin, 1998; Resnik, 1995).
P98-2124
Finding a generalization of a profile is explored in the works of Clark and Weir (2002) and Li and Abe (1998).
J02-2003 P98-2124
This semantic distance can be as simple as the number of edges separating the concepts, or more sophisticated, such as Lin’s (1998) information-theoretic measure.
