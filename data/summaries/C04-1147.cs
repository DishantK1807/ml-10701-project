Examples of such affinities include synonyms (Terra and Clarke, 2003), verb similarities (Resnik and Diab, 2000) and word associations (Rapp, 2002).

Terra and Clarke (2003) extended Turneyâ€™s work, computing different similarity measures over a local collection of Web data using a custom search system.

The corpus used in our experiments comprises a terabyte of Web data crawled from the general web in 2001 (Clarke et al., 2002; Terra and Clarke, 2003).

Distance models use only positional information to measure co-occurrence frequency (Beeferman et al., 1997; Yuret, 1998; Rosenfeld, 1996).

Another approach to capturing lexical affinity is through the use of similarity measures (Lee, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003).

Functional models use the underlying syntactic function of words to measure co-occurrence frequency (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Niesler and Woodland, 1997; Grefenstette, 1993).

Many models incorporating contextual information use only a select group of content words and the end product is a model for sequences of adjacent words (Rosenfeld, 1996; Beeferman et al., 1997; Niesler and Woodland, 1997).

This assumption implies a different estimation procedure, since we explicitly discard what Befeerman et al.and Niesler call selftriggers (Beeferman et al., 1997; Niesler and Woodland, 1997).

Modeling term co-occurrence is important for many natural language applications, such as topic segmentation (Ferret, 2002), query expansion (Vechtomova et al., 2003), machine translation (Tanaka, 2002), language modeling (Dagan et al., 1999; Yuret, 1998), and term weighting (Hisamitsu and Niwa, 2002).

However, many researchers are recognizing the limitations of relying on the statistics provided by commercial search engines (Zhu and Rosenfeld, 2001; Keller and Lapata, 2003).
