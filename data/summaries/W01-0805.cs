The third advantage is that the combined usage of graphs and cost-functions paves the way for a natural integration of traditional rule-based approaches to generation with more recent statistical approaches (e.g., Langkilde & Knight 1998, Malouf 2000) in a single algorithm.

cost functions One of the important open questions in natural language generation is how the common, rulebased approaches to generation can be combined with recent insights from statistical NLP (see e.g., Langkilde & Knight 1998, Malouf 2000 for partial answers).

For instance, Horacek (1997) points out that an algorithm should not collect a set of properties which cannot be realized given the constraints of the grammar.

It is also an extension of the Full Brevity algorithm, since it allows for relational descriptions, as does the Dale & Haddock (1991) algorithm.

The generation of referring expressions is one of the most common tasks in natural language generation, and has been addressed by many researchers in the past two decades (including Appelt 1985, Dale 1992, Reiter 1990, Dale & Haddock 1991, Dale & Reiter 1995, Horacek 1997, Stone & Webber 1998, Krahmer & Theune 1999 and van Deemter 2000).

This is modelled by assigning salience weights to objects (basically using a version of Centering Theory (Grosz et al.1995) augmented with a recency effect), and by defining the set of distractors as the set of objects with a salience weight higher or equal than that of the target object.
