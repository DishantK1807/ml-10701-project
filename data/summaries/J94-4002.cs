Centering approaches to anaphora resolution use similar hierarchies as well (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990).

Applying the filters and ranking mechanism of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) yields two possible anchors.

Our use of "coreference" is in the spirit of Sidner's (1981) "co-specification" and Webber's (1988) "referencem".

It does not employ semantic conditions (beyond those implicit in grammatical number and gender agreement) or real-world knowledge in evaluating candidate antecedents; nor does it model intentional or global discourse structure (as in Grosz and Sidner 1986).

• A morphological filter for ruling out anaphoric dependence of a pronoun on an NP due to non-agreement of person, number, or gender features • A procedure for identifying pleonastic (semantically empty) pronouns • An anaphor binding algorithm for identifying the possible antecedent binder of a lexical anaphor (reciprocal or reflexive pronoun) within the same sentence (This algorithm is presented in Lappin and McCord 1990b).

Whereas th e hierarchy in RAP contributes to a multi-dimensional measure of the relative salience of all antecedent candidates, in Brennan et al.1987, it is used only to constrain the choice of the backward-looking center, Cb, of an utterance.
P87-1022
The backward center is a confirmation of an entity that has already been introduced into the discourse; more specifically, it must be realized in the immediately preceding utterance, Un--l" (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987, p.

Guenthner and Lehmann (1983) use a similar salience ranking of grammatical roles to formulate rules of anaphora resolution.

RAP applies to the syntactic structures of McCord's (1990, 1993, in press) Slot Grammar parser, and like the parser, it is implemented in Prolog.
H93-1025
As with Slot Grammar systems in general (McCord 1989b, 1993, in press), an architecture was adopted that "factors out" language-specific elements of the algorithm.
H93-1025 J89-1003
Thus, for example, Rich and LuperFoy (1988) propose a system that computes the global preference value of a candidate from the scores provided by a set of constraint source modules, in which each module invokes different sorts of conditions for ranking the antecedent candidate.
