According to Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986, quoted in Walker, Joshi, and Prince [1998]), a center is realized in an utterance U if it “is an element of the situation described by U or the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U” (page 4).

We follow, in general, the ordering principles for Japanese given in Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) (with some adjustments for possessive phrases as noted in example (1)): Cf ranking for Japanese: (Grammatical OR ∅) topic > empathy > subject > object2 > object > others A special member of the Cf list, the backward-looking center, or Cb, represents the “topic” 1 of U i and is the highest-ranked Cf on the Cf list of U i−1 which is realized in U i. In addition, the preferred center of U i, or Cp, is the highest-ranked Cf in U i . Given U i and U i−1, then, there are four different ways in which their Cbs and Cps may be related; each of these is defined as a type of transition state (Table 1).

Poesio et al.supplemented the identity relation with three different possible semantic relations between Cfs in the utterances: set membership, subset, and “generalized possession.” Murata, Ishara, and Nagao induced a number of possible relations between bridging reference and anchor using a verb case frame dictionary and a corpus of Japanese AnoBexpressions (where A and B are nominal arguments and the AnoBconstruction encodes a wide variety of semantic relations between the two nominal arguments [Shimazu, Naito, and Nomura 1987]).

These accounts are based upon the characterization of semantic relations among discourse elements by reference to semantic information contained in WordNet (Harabagiu 1998, 1999), thesauruses (Harabagiu 1998; Morris and Hirst 1991; Okumura and Honda 1994), or dictionaries (Kasahara et al.1996; Kozima 1993; Kozima and Furugori 1993).

Both of these steps, identifying antecedents and parsing sentences into clauses, can be completed, in theory, by automatic, computational methods (Huls, Bos, and Claassen 1995; Nakaiwa and Shirai 1996; Paul and Sumita 2001; Yamura-Takei et al.2002), but the success rate of these approaches is not high enough to rely on them for completely accurate analyses of this type of corpus at this time.

LotfipourSaedi (1997) uses lexical cohesion to develop a rigorous notion of “translation equivalence”; Boguraev and Neff (2000) to improve document summarization techniques; Sack (1999) to create “diagrams of social cohesion” for newsgroup postings; and Okumura and Honda (1994) to disambiguate word senses.

Every account in which bridging references are addressed restricts allowable relationships to a small, relatively well-defined set (Vieira and Poesio 2001; Poesio et al.2000; Murata, Isahara, and Nagao 1999; Strube and Hahn 1999).

Kozima (1993) provides an algorithm for determining where, on the graph of semantic cohesion values of words in a text, likely topic breaks occur and validates that determination against human judgment.

course it is possible to have cohesion without coherence and vice versa; Morris and Hirst (1991) give some nice examples.

1. Introduction Centering has been proposed as a model of the local attentional states of speakers and hearers involved in the mutual construction of conversation (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Grosz and Sidner 1986, 1998; Walker 1998).

Poesio et al.(2000), even after severely restricting the types of relationships to be labeled, had extremely poor interlabeler reliability on a first pass.

The usefulness of relaxing the notion of identity for Cbs has been recognized by Poesio et al.(2000) and others (Hahn, Markert, and Strube 1996; Murata, Isahara, and Nagao 1999).
J99-3001 P00-1051 W99-0205
Insights concerning conjunction types and their interactions with the processes of referent resolution have been elaborated in a number of works (Nariyama 2000; Nakaiwa and Shirai 1996; Kuno 1973) but have not been well integrated into the centering approach.

Poesio et al.(2000) report a similarly high proportion of nonexplicit Cbs in their English text corpora.

is no consensus as to the ordering of the arguments in a Japanese AnoBconstruction (roughly equivalent to possessives; Tetreault 2001; Matsui 1999; but see Fais 2002).

In the lexical chain approach (Morris and Hirst 1991), a new discourse segment is hypothesized where the chain “breaks,” that is, where subsequent entities do not bear a semantic relationship to previous entities that would allow them to be added to the chain.
