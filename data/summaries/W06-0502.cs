Such an approach was taken by the MindNet project (Richardson et al., 1998).

Useful semantic relations can be extracted from large corpora using relatively simple patterns (e.g., (Pantel et al., 2004)).

Parser (CaboCha-RMRS) For Japanese, we produce RMRS from the dependency parser Cabocha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).

The method is similar to that of Spreyer and Frank (2005), who produce RMRS from detailed German dependencies.

∃(ch,cg) : {ch ⊂ cg;ch ∈C(wh);cg ∈C(wg)} (1) To test cross-linguistically, we looked up the headwords in a translation lexicon (ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991) and EDICT (Breen, 2004)) and then did the confirmation on the set of translations ci ⊂ C(T(wi)).

Minimal Recursion Semantics Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics is a form of flat semantics which is designed to allow deep and shallow processing to use a compatible semantic representation, with fine-grained atomic components of semantic content so shallow methods can contribute just what they know, yet with enough expressive power for rich semantic content including generalized quantifiers (Frank, 2004).
