George Bush 3 In the literature (Knight and Graehl,1998; Qu et al., 2003), translating romanized Japanese or Chinese names to Chinese characters is also known as back-transliteration.

In computational linguistic literature, much effort has been devoted to phonetic transliteration, such as English-Arabic, English-Chinese (Li et al., 2004), English-Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and English-Korean.

By treating a letter/character as a word and a group of letters/characters as a phrase or token unit in SMT, one can easily apply the traditional SMT models, such as the IBM generative model (Brown et al., 1993) or the phrase-based translation model (Crego et al., 2005) to transliteration.

Some recent work (Li et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006) has attempted to introduce preference into a probabilistic framework for selection of Chinese characters in phonetic transliteration.

In the extraction of transliterations, data-driven methods are adopted to extract actual transliteration pairs from a corpus, in an effort to construct a large, upto-date transliteration lexicon (Kuo et al., 2006; Sproat et al., 2006).

The Latin-scripted personal names are always assumed to homogeneously follow the English phonic rules in automatic transliteration (Li et al., 2004).

In transliteration modeling, transliteration rules are trained from a large, bilingual transliteration lexicon (Lin and Chen, 2002; Oh and Choi, 2005), with the objective of translating unknown words on the fly in an open, general domain.

This model is conceptually similar to the joint sourcechannel model (Li et al., 2004) where the target token i t depends on not only its source token i s but also the history 1i t − and 1i s − . Each character in the target name forms a token.

As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), out of several thousand common Chinese characters, a subset of a few hundred characters tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating English names to Chinese, e.g. only 731 Chinese characters are adopted in the E-C corpus.

As a Chinese transliteration can arouse to certain connotations, the choice of Chinese characters becomes a topic of interest (Xu et al., 2006).
