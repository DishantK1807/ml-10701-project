The overall goal of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) is to annotate the million word WSJ corpus in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) with a layer of discourse annotations.

Initial work on the PDTB has been described in Miltsakaki et al.(2004a), Miltsakaki et al.(2004b), Prasad et al.(2004). The key contribution of the PDTB design framework is its bottom-up approach to discourse structure: Instead of appealing to an abstract (and arbitrary) set of discourse relations whose identification may confound multiple sources of discourse meaning, we start with the annotation of discourse connectives and their arguments, thus exposing a clearly defined level of discourse representation.

4 4 This distinction is hard to capture in an RST-based parsing framework (Marcu, 2000).

3 3 Annotation of attribution Wiebe and her colleagues have pointed out the importance of ascribing beliefs and assertions expressed in text to the agent(s) holding or making them (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003; Wiebe et al., 2004; Wiebe et al., 2005).

The parser implementation in (Bikel, 2002) was used in this experiment and it was run in a mode which emulated the Collins (1997) parser.

A preliminary report on this project was presented at the 2004 workshop on Frontiers in Corpus Annotation (Miltsakaki et al., 2004a), where we described our annotation of discourse connectives (both explicit and implicit) along with their (clausal) arguments.

of the PDTB The PDTB builds on the DLTAG approach to discourse structure (Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999; Webber et al., 2003) in which connectives are discourse-level predicates which project predicate-argument structure on a par with verbs at 29 the sentence level.
