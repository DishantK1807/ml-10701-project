The ML classifier used for this experiment is a conditional Markov model tagger which is designed for, and proved successful in, named entity recognition in newspaper and biomedical text (Klein et al., 2003; Finkel et al., 2005).

The search engine module performs language classification based on the maximum normalised score of the number of hits returned for two searches per token, one for each language (Alex, 2005).

Following Klein and Manning (2003), the parser uses an unlexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) and relies on treebank transformations to increase parsing accuracy.

In addition, we also report dependency accuracy (Dep), calculated using the approach described in Lin (1995), using the headpicking method used by Dubey (2005a).

Based upon an evaluation on the NEGRA treebank (Skut et al., 1998), using a 90%-5%-5% training-development-test split, the parser performs with an accuracy of 73.1 F-score on labelled brackets with a coverage of 99.1% (Dubey, 2005b).

The parsing experiments were performed with a state-of-the-art parser trained on the TIGER corpus which returns both phrase categories and grammatical functions (Dubey, 2005b).

Inclusion Detection Previous work reported by Alex (2006; 2005) has focused on devising a classifier that detects anglicisms and other English inclusions in text written in other languages, namely German and French.
