Since then, various shallow methods including canned text parts and some template-based techniques have been utilized, e.g. in CogentHelp \[White and Caldwell, 1997\], in the system described in \[Cawsey et al., 1995\], and in IDAS \[Reiter et al., 1995\].

Productions are used to encode grammar rules in the language TGL \[Busemann, 199611 A rule is applicable if its preconditions are met.

IR expressions are consumed by the text realizer, which is a version of the production system TG/2 described in \[Busemann, 1996\].

shortcomings of shallow generation methods A prominent example for an early shallow generation system is Ana \[Kukich, 1983\], which reports about stock market developments.

If an action fails, backtracking can be invoked flexibly and efficiently using memoization techniques (see \[Busemann, 1996\]).

shortcomings of approaches to surface realization Current approaches to surface realization are mostly in-depth, based on general, linguistically motivated, and widely reusable realization components, such as Penman \[Penman, 1989\], KPML \[Bateman, 1997\], and SURGE \[Elhadad and Robin, 1996\].
