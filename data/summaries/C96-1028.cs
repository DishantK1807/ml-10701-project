Verifying this would, for example, establish whether the copied strings need to be constituents, and this has a bearing on whether processing models designed for incremental interpretation (Milward, 1992) are the best descriptors of human performance".

Joshi et al.(1989) conjecture that there is actually a convergence in expressive power among the 'mildly context sensitive' (MCS) languages, but other work points out exceptions (Savitch, 1989; Vogel and Erjavec, 1994).

Savitch (1989) does exactly that by prese, nting the model of con> put;at|on required for the class of languages delined by augment;ing the CFLs with redut)lication: a Reduplicat;ion PDA (RPDA).
J89-4003
The family that we characterized above in terms of graInntars arc tn'operly a sullset of the languages recognized by R.PDA, a restrk:tion of RPDA languages which Savitch (1989) terlns simple R, PDA lanqu,.qes.

The method is metagrammatical and therefore akin to proposals put forward previously for handling coordination (Dahl and McCord, 1983) with logic grammars and TAGs (Shieber, 1995) or for extraposition (Milward, 1994).
J83-2002
Since the reduplication languages (Savitch, 1989) are central to the point of this paper we define them-the languages homomorphic to the set of strings {ww\[w 6 {a,b}*}.
