The annotated corpora built in the MUC contain coreference relations between NPs, which are used as a gold standard data set for machine learning-based approaches to coreference resolution by researchers suchasSoonetal.(2001)andNgandCardie(2002).

One may think of using semantic roles in textual inference as exempliﬁed by, for example, Tatu and Moldovan (2006).

data sets used in supervised techniques (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002, etc).

The PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), on the other hand, deﬁnes a set of semantic roles (labeled ARG0, ARG1, and AM-ADV, etc).

As a result of our current work, we have released an annotated corpus named the NAIST Text Corpus1, which is used as the evaluation data set in the coreference and zero-anaphora resolution tasks in Iida et al.(2005) and Iida et al.(2006). 1 Introduction Coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis has recently been a growing ﬁeld of research due to the demands from NLP application such as information extraction and machine translation.

On the other hand, the speciﬁcation of predicate-argument structure analysis has mainly been discussed in the context of the CoNLL shared task2 on the basis of the PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005).

However, van Deemter and Kibble (1999) claim that the speciﬁcation of the MUC coreference task guides us to annotate expressions that are not normally considered coreferential, such as appositive relations (e.g.

For evaluation of coreference relations, we calculated recall and precision based on the MUC score (Vilain et al., 1995).

For English, several annotation schemes have already been proposed for both coreference relation and argument structure, and annotated corpora have beendevelopedaccordingly(Hirschman, 1997; Poesio et al., 2004; Doddington et al., 2004).
