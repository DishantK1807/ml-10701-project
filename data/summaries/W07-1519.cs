The most reliable data set for Turkish is the Metu-Sabancı Turkish Treebank (Oflazer et al., 2003) consisting of 5635 sentences annotated with dependency structures.

We use the data-driven dependency parser of Nivre et al.(2006) as an external parsing guide which is shown to give the highest accuracy for Turkish and for many other languages.

This rich structure of the language has been represented in the literature (Oflazer et al., 2003; Hakkani-T¨ur et al., 2002; Eryi˘git and Oflazer, 2006) by splitting the words into inflectional groups (IGs) which are separated from each other by derivational boundaries.

The dependency structure of Turkish has been mentioned in many studies (Oflazer et al., 2003; Oflazer, 2003; Eryi˘git et al., 2006) and it is argued that for Turkish, it is not just enough to determine the relationships between words and one should also determine the relationships between inflectional groups.
