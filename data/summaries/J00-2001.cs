These include devices such as interleaving the components (McDonald 1983; Appelt 1983), backtracking on failure (Appelt 1985; Nogier 1989), allowing the linguistic component to interrogate the planner (Mann 1983; Sondheimer and Nebel 1986), and Hovy's notion of restrictive (i.e., bottom-up) planning (Hovy 1988a, 1988c).

Hovy has described another text planner that builds similar plans (Hovy 1988b).

Reiter describes a pipelined modular approach as a consensus architecture underlying most recent work in generation (Reiter 1994).

The names given to the components vary; they have been called "strategic" and "tactical" components (e.g., McKeown 1985; Thompson 1977; Danlos 1987) 1, "planning" and "realization" (e.g., McDonald 1983; Hovy 1988a), or simply "what to say" versus "how to say it" (e.g., Danlos 1987; Reithinger 1990).
P88-1020 P88-1022
In fact, Reiter has even argued in favor of this approach, claiming that the interactions are sufficiently minor to be ignored (or at least handled on an ad hoc basis) (Reiter 1994).

McDonald has even argued for extending the model to a large number of components (McDonald 1988), and several systems have indeed added an additional component between the planner and the linguistic component (Meteer 1994; Panaget 1994; Wanner 1994).

1Â° The body of a plan can be an action or sequence of actions, a goal or sequence 9 Moore and Paris also note that "a generation system must maintain the kinds of information outlined by Grosz and Sidner" (Moore and Paris 1989, 203).

This approach has occasionally been taken, as in Kantrowitz and Bates (1992) and Danlos (1987) 4 and, at least implicitly, in Paris and Scott (1994) and Delin et al.(1994); however, under this approach, all of the flexibility and simplicity of modular design is lost.

This model of text plans meshes well with the model of discourse structure developed by Grosz and Sidner (Grosz and Sidner 1985, 1986), in which the purpose of each discourse segment is an important part of the structure.

33 Something like this approach is in fact used in some systems (e.g., Elhadad and Robin 1992; PenMan 1989; Hovy 1988a).
P88-1020 P88-1022
The need to handle interactions between text planning and linguistic concerns thus seems to require either abandoning the division into separate components (e.g., Danlos 1987; Kantrowitz and Bates 1992), with the resulting increase in complexity, or foregoing the ability to handle these interactions at all (as advocated in Reiter \[1994\]).
