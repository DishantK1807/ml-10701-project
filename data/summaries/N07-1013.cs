For examples, see (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004).

Perhaps the most well-known method is maximum marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), as well as cross-sentence informational subsumption (Radev, 2000), mixture models (Zhang et al., 2002), subtopic diversity (Zhai et al., 2003), diversity penalty (Zhang et al., 2005), and others.

ROUGE metrics exist based on bigram, trigram, and 4-gram overlap, but ROUGE-1 (based on unigram matching) has been found to correlate best with human judgments (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

The states with large probabilities can be regarded as central items, an idea used in Google PageRank (Page et al., 1998) and other information retrieval systems (Kurland and Lee, 2005; Zhang et al., 2005), text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004), keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) and so on.

LexRank uses crosssentence informational subsumption (Radev, 2000) to this end, but MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) has also been widely used in the text summarization community.
