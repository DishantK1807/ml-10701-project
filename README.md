#Single Instruction of set up (Using IntelliJ as example):
1. Prerequisite: Maven, Git, Scala(could probably work if not included because we distribute compiler in pom as well), Java and a IDE (Intellij is recommended).
2. Open Intellij -> Check out from svn -> Enter the project address (copy it from your browser address bar now) -> choose a location to store it -> check out
3. In Intellij -> File -> New Project -> From External Module -> Maven -> Choose the project directory you downloaded
4. Maven will do the rest. And the project should be free of errors.
5. Have a look in bin/, run some shell scripts there to test, probably need to edit some file path to match your local machine.
