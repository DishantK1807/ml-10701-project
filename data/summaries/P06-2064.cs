We then attempttomapallinstancesofthemodiﬁerandhead noun as the heads of NPs in a transitive sentential context onto our set of constructions via lexical similarity over the verb, to arrive at an interpretation: e.g. we would hope to predict that possess is sufﬁciently similar to own that (the) family possesses (a) car would be recognised as support1With nominalizations, the head noun is deverbal, and in the case of Lapata (2002), nominalisations are assumed to be interpretable as the modiﬁer being either the subject (e.g.

Moldovan et al.(2004) used the word senses of nouns based on the domain or range of interpretation of an NC, leading to questions of scalability and portability to novel domains/NC types.

In more recent work, Barker and Szpakowicz (1998) used a semi-automatic method for NC interpretation in a ﬁxed domain.

Lapata (2002) developed a fully automatic method but focused on nominalizations, a proper subclass of NCs.1 Rosario and Marti (2001) classiﬁed the nouns in medical texts by tagging hierarchical information using neural networks.

Of the many methods implemented in WordNet::Similarity, we report on results for one path-based method (WUP, Wu and Palmer (1994)), one content-information based method (JCN, Jiang and Conrath (1998)) and two semantic relatedness methods (LESK, Banerjee and Pedersen (2003), and VECTOR, (Patwardhan, 2003)).

Recent work on the automatic/semiautomatic interpretation of NCs (e.g., Lapata (2002), Rosario and Marti (2001), Moldovan et al.(2004)andKimandBaldwin(2005))hasmadeassumptions about the scope of semantic relations or restrictedthedomainofinterpretation.

NC interpretation has been studied in the context of applications including question-answering and machine translation (Moldovan et al., 2004; Cao and Li, 2002; Baldwin and Tanaka, 2004; Lauer, 1995).

Based on the pioneering work on Levi (1979) and Finin (1980), there have been efforts in computational linguistics to arrive at largely taskspeciﬁc sets of semantic relations, driven by the annotation of a representative sample of NCs from a given corpus type (Vanderwende, 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and Marti, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004).

Rosario and Marti (2001) achieved about 60% using a neural network in a closed domain, Moldovan et al.(2004) achieved 43% using word sense disambiguation of the head noun and modiﬁer over open domain data, and Kim and Baldwin (2005) produced 53% using lexical similarities of the head noun and modiﬁer(usingthesamerelationset,butevaluated over a different dataset).

In this paper, we use the set of 20 semantic relations deﬁned by Barker and Szpakowicz (1998), rather than deﬁning a new set of relations.

Vanderwende (1994) attempted the automatic interpretation of NCs using hand-written rules, with the obvious cost of manual intervention.
