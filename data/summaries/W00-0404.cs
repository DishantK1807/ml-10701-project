A variety of approaches exist for determining the salient sentences in the text: statistical techniques based oll word distribution (Kupiec et al., 1995), (Zechner, 1996), (Salton et al., 1991), (Teufell and Moens, 1997), symbolic techniques based on discourse structure (Marcu, 1997) and semantic relations between words (Barzil~v and Elhadad, 1997).

A set of 25 target events were defined 2 All documents were tagged by the tagger (Brill, 1992).

TIPSTER Text Summarization Evaluation (SUMMAC) proposed various methods for evaluating document summarization and tasks (Mani et al., 1999).

Dependency of Words The domain dependency of words that how strongly a word features a given set of data (documents) contributes to event extraction, as we previously reported (Fukumoto et al.: 1997).

Therefore it is difficult to identi~" these information using a single-document summarizer technique (Mani and Bloedorn, 1997), (Barzilay et al., 1999).
E99-1011 P99-1071
Like Mani and Barzil~,'s techniques, our approach focuses on the problem that how to identi~" differences and similarities across documents, rather than the problem that how to form the actual summar:,, (Sparck, 1993), (McKeown and Radev, 1995), (Radev and McKeown, 1998).
