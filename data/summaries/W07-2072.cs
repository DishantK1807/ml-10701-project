Unsupervised knowledge-based methods are the preferred approach to classification of sentences into positive and negative, mostly due to the lack of adequate amounts of labeled training data (Gamon and Aue, 2005).

In order to take advantage of the special properties of WordNet glosses and relations, we developed a system that used the human-annotated adjectives from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) as a seed list and learned additional unigrams from WordNet synsets and glosses.

These methods perform particularly well when a large volume of labeled data from the same domain as the test set is available for training (Aue and Gamon, 2005).

??queries: The queries of Turney (2002) are made up of a pair of adjectives, and in our approach the query contains the content words of the headline and an emotion.

??word proximity: For the web searches, Turney (2002) uses the NEAR operator and considers only those documents that contain the adjectives within a specific proximity.

of the previous studies (Kim et al., 2004; Okanohara et al., 2006; Tzong-Han Tsai et al., 2006), features of shallow parsers had a large contribution to the performance.

Following Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) and Turney (2002), we decided to observe how often the words from the headline co-occur with each one of the six emotions.

Other important works on sentiment analysis are those of (Wilson et al., 2005) and (Wiebe et al., 2005; Wilson and Wiebe, 2005), who used linguistic information such as syntax and negations to determine polarity.

The idea of tracing polarity through adjective cooccurrence is adopted by Turney (2002) for the binary (positive and negative) classification of text reviews.

The resolution of this problem can lead to a complete, realistic and coherent analysis of the natural language, therefore major attention is drawn to the opinion, sentiment and emotion analysis, and to the identification of beliefs, thoughts, feelings and judgments (Quirk et al., 1985), (Wilson and Wiebe, 2005).

3 CLaC-NB System: Nave Bayes Supervised statistical methods have been very successful in sentiment tagging of texts and in subjectivity detection at sentence level: on movie review texts they reach an accuracy of 85-90% (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004) and up to 92% accuracy on classifying movie review snippets into subjective and objective using both Nave Bayes and SVM (Pang and Lee, 2004).
