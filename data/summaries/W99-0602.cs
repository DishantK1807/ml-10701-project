In spite of this limitation, these alignments cover the vast majority of situations encountered in real-life texts, at least at the level of sentences (Gale and Church, 1991).

For instance, the space and time complexity of the trilingual version of the Gale and Church (1991) program would be O(N3).

This definition of alignment, inspired from Kay and RSscheisen (1993), can be naturally extended to accommodate any number of versions of a text.

Bilingual alignments have so far shown that they can play multiple roles in a wide range of linguistic applications, such as computer assisted translation (Isabelle et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1990), terminology (Dagan and Church, 1994) lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Melamed, 1996), and cross-language information retrieval (Nie et al., * This research was funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (http://~.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/), via the Agence de la francophonie (http://~.

The second criterium is based on the observation by Gale and Church (1991) that good alignments usually coincide with high scoring regions of text.

However, in the experiments described here, we focus on alignment at the level of sentences, this for a number of reasons: First, sentence alignments have so far proven their usefulness in a number of applications, e.g. bilingual lexicography (Langlois, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995; Dagan and Church, 1994), automatic translation verification (Macklovitch, 1995; Macklovitch, 1996) and the automatic acquisition of knowledge about translation (Brown et al., 1993).

We have implemented a trilingual sentencealignment program called trial, based on the approach presented in Section 2 and on a bilingual sentence-alignment program called sfial, which implements a modified version of the method of Simard et al.(1992). In sfial, we essentially combine into a statistical framework two criteria: the length-similarity criterion proposed by Gale and Church (1991) and a "graphemic resemblance" criterion based on the existence of cognate words between languages.

General Method for Aligning Multiple Versions of a Text Existing alignment Mgorithms that rely on the optimality principle and dynamic programming to find the best possible sentence alignment, such as those of Gale and Church (1991), Brown et al.(1991), Simard et al.(1992), Chen (1993), Langlais and E1-B~ze (1997), Simard and Plamondon (1998), etc.

But actually, statistical alignment methods such as those derived from Gale and Church (1991) provide us with a simple solution: to find the best alignment, these methods explore different alignment hypotheses, and select the one with the highest probability with regard to a certain statistical model of translation.

Introduction While bilingual text corpora have been part of the computational linguistics scene for over ten years now, we have recently witnessed the appearance of text corpora containing versions of texts in three or more languages, such as those developed within the CRATER (McEnery et al., 1997), MULTEXT (Ide and V4ronis, 1994) and MULTEXT-EAST (Erjavec and Ide, 1998) projects.
