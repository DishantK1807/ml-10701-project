However, it is important to note that this is motivated by a commonality in linguistic function when a sufficiently abstract standpoint is taken rather than on any claims of universality; further details on the theoretical status of the shared representations are presented in Bateman (1989).

Future directions Following from earlier experiments in the integration of Machine Translation (MT) and text generation (Bateman, Kasper, Schlitz, and Steiner, 1989), we have found that the combination of two components of the Systemic-Functional Linguistic (SFL) model of language (Halliday, 1985; Matthiessen, 1987), such as are being developed for computational use within the PENMAN text generation system, significantly reduces tlhe need for structural transfer in machine translation (MT) without requiring deep modelling of specific domains.
E89-1038 H89-1022
The upper model supports specifications of sentence 'meaning' that may serve as input to a text generation system (Kasper, 1989a), or as output from an analysis component (Kasper, 1989b).

the text/grammar boundary As a final example of the generality of the mechanisms described here (for further examples, see Bateman, 1989), it is also possible to consider dependency relations defined above the clause complex as possible targets.

This is being addressed in text generation in terms of the SFL notion of register (Bateman and Paris, 1989), and its application to MT is pursued in Paris (forthcoming).
