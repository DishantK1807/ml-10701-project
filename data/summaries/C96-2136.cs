It is a natural extension of the Viteri>i algorithm (Church, 1<,)88; Cutting et al., 1992) for those languages that do not have delimiters between words, and it can generate N-best morphological analysis hypotheses, like tree trellis search (Soong and l\[uang, 1991).

It is used,as tagging mode\[ in English (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992) and morphological analysis nlodel (word segmentation and tagging) in Japanese (Nagata, 1994).

We use a statistical word model to assign a probat>ility to each subs|ring (Nagata, 1996).
