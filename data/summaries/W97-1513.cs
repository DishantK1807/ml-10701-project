• Constraint-based Categorial Grammar, with delayed evaluation of constraints (Bouma and van Noord, 1994).
C94-1039 P94-1021
Furthermore, a library is provided for the creation of 'Mellish' Prolog terms on the basis of boolean expressions over finite domains (Mellish, 1988).
J88-1004
• HPSG with lexical rules as delayed constraints (van Noord and Bouma, 1994).
C94-1039 P94-1021
• Definite-clause Grammar (Pereira and Warren, 1980) for Dutch to illustrate semantic-headdriven generation (Shieber et al., 1989), and to compare different parsers for speed (Bouma and van Noord, 1993).
E93-1010 P89-1002
The flexibility is illustrated by the fact that Hdrug has been used both for the development of grammars and parsers for practical systems (Boves et al., 1995; van Noord et al., 1996), but also as a tool to experiment with new theoretical notions and alternative processing strategies, such as those discussed by (Carpenter, 1992), (van Noord and Bouma, 1994), (van Noord, 1994).

Visualisation can be requested for various output formats, including ASCII text format, TK Canvas widget, ~TEX output, and CLiG output (Konrad et ah, 1996).
