In fact, participants in that competition from the University of Durham (Morgan et al., 1995) and from SRA (Krupka, 1995) report that gazetteers did not make that much of a difference to their system.

Nevertheless, in a recent article Cucchiarelli et al.(1998) report that one of the bottlenecks in designing NE recognition systems is the limited availability of large gazetteers, particularly gazetteers for different languages (Cucchiarelli et al.1998: 291).

In an article on the Named Entity recognition competition (part of MUC-6) Sundheim (1995) remarks that "common organization names, first names of people and location names can be handled by recourse to list lookup, although there are drawbacks" (Sundheim 1995: 16).

The basic gazetteers in the Isoquest system for MUCÂ°7 contain 110,000 names, but Krupka and Hausman (1998) show that system performance does not degrade much when the Proceedings of EACL '99 gazetteers are reduced to 25,000 and 9,000 names; conversely, they also show that the addition of an extra 42 entries to the gazetteers improves performance dramatically.

It is encouraging to note that Krupka and Hausman (1998) point out that the MUC-7 articles which we used in our experiments have less external evidence than do Wall Street Journal articles, which suggests that on Wall Street Journal articles our system might perform even better than on MUC-7 articles.

(Palmer and Day, 1997) evaluated the performance of such a minimal NE recognition system equipped with name lists derived from MUC-6 training texts.

This information goes to a pre-trained maximum entropy model (see Mikheev (1998) for more details on this aproach).
