Sproat et a1.(1996) and Wu and Fung (1994) give empirical results showing that an agreement rate between native speakers as low as 75% is common.

Brill's work provides a proof of viability of transformation-based techniques in the form of a number of processors, including a (widelydistributed) part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1994), a procedure for prepositional phrase attachment (Brill and Resnik, 1994), and a bracketing parser (Brill, 1993b).

Transformation-based learning has also been successfully applied to text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), morphological disambiguation (Oflazer and Tur, 1996), and phrase parsing (Vilain and Day, 1996).

For a discussion of recent Chinese segmentation work, see Sproat et al.(1996). frequently mentioned in segmentation papers that native speakers of a language do not always agree about the "correct" segmentation and that the same text could be segmented into several very different (and equally correct) sets of words by different native speakers.

Wu and Fung (1994) demonstrate that segmentation accuracy is significantly higher when the lexicon is constructed using the same type of corpus as the corpus on which it is tested.

It is rule-based, but relies on 2See, for example, Sproat et al.(1996). machine learning to acquire the rules, rather than expensive manual knowledge engineering.

The Chinese segmenter CHSEG developed at the Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University is a complete system for highaccuracy Chinese segmentation (Jin, 1994).
