Term variants are extracted from tagged corpora through FASTR 1, a unification-based transformational parser described in (Jacquemin et al., 1997).

In this example, a regular expression is used to under-specify the structure2; another solution would be to use quasi-trees with extended dependencies (Vijay-Shanker, 1992).

Such results confirm the relevance of non-specialized semantic links in the extraction of specialized semantic variants (Hamon et al., 1998).
P98-1082
343 In (Hamon et al., 1998), three types of semantic relations are studied: a link between the two head words, a link between the two arguments, or two parallel links between heads and arguments.
P98-1082
According to (Jacquemin et al., 1997), there are three types of syntactic variations in French: coordinations (Coot), insertions of modifiers (Modif), and compounding/decompounding (Comp).
P97-1004
It relies on previous or ongoing linguistic studies on this topic (Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Jacquemin et al., 1997; Hamon et al., 1998).
