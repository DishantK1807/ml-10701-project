The approach presented in this paper relies on a data-driven algorithm called Morfessor (Creutz and Lagus, 2002; Creutz and Lagus, 2005) which is a language independent unsupervised machine learning method to find morpheme-like units (called statistical morphs) from a large text corpus.

Finnish is also the language for which the algorithm for the unsupervised morpheme discovery (Creutz and Lagus, 2002) was originally developed.
