These translations gave rise to a number of automatically constructed linguistic resources: (1) the original 〈source,target〉 phrasal translation pairs, (2) the marker lexicon, (3) the gen11 Thanks are due to one of the anonymous reviewers for pointing out that our wEBMT system, seeded with input from multiple translation systems, with a postvalidation process via the Web (amounting to an n-gram target language model), in effect forms a multiengine MT system as described by Frederking and Nirenburg (1994), Frederking et al.(1994), and Hogan and Frederking (1998).

More specifically, the notion of the phrasal lexicon (used first by Becker 1975) has been used successfully in a number of areas: • Learnability (Zernik and Dyer 1987) • Text generation (Hovy 1988; Milosavljevic, Tulloch, and Dale 1996) • Speech generation (Rayner and Carter 1997) • Localization (Sch¨aler 1996) More recently, Simard and Langlais (2001) have proposed the exploitation of TMs at a subsentential level, while Carl, Way, and Sch¨aler (2002) and Sch¨aler, Way, and Carl (2003, pages 108–109) describe how phrasal lexicons might come to occupy a central place in a future hybrid integrated translation environment.

Other similar approaches include those of Cicekli and G ¨uvenir (1996), McTait and Trujillo (1999), Carl (1999), and Brown (2000), inter alia.

Fung and McKeown (1997) attempt to translate technical terms using word relation matrices, although the resource from which such relations are derived is a pair of nonparallel corpora.

Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto (1992) identify translationally equivalent phrasal segments and replace such equivalents with variables to generate a set of translation patterns.

Given that examples such as ’‘<DET> a : un” are likely to exist in the word-level lexicon, they may be inserted at the point indicated by the marker tag to form the correct translation un bon homme.We thus cluster on marker words to improve the coverage of our system (see Section 5 for results that show exactly how clustering on marker words helps); others (notably Brown [2000, 2003]) use clustering techniques to determine equivalence classes of individual words that can occur in the same context, and in so doing derive translation templates from individual translation examples.
