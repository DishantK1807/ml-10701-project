Dependency parsing has been actively studied in recent years (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre and Scholz, 2004; Isozaki et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Corston-Oliver et al., 2006).

Another type of WSD method uses supervised machine learning (ML) technolo41 gies (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Lee and Ng, 2002; Liu et al., 2002).

The situation is probably most dire for Bulgarian, although there have been attempts at the induction of a dependency parser from the BulTreeBank (Marinov and Nivre, 2005; Chanev et al., 2006).

Although we have so far focused exclusively on English CHILDES data, dependency schemes based on functional relationships exist for a number of languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), and the general parsing techniques used in the present work have been shown to be effective in several of them (Nivre et al., 2006).

In related work, Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) evaluate a number of constraints that have been proposed to restrict the class of dependency structures characterizing natural language with respect to two dependency treebanks: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Haji et al., 2001) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003).

Algorithm SVM is an effective learning algorithm to WSD (Lee and Ng, 2002).

See Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for the definition of edge degree.

2 TAG-induced Graph Dependencies The next two sections are intended to provide an intuition for the terms defined more formally in Bodirsky et al.(2005) and Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006).

This keeps the corresponding graph drawings within the class of structures identified by Bodirsky et al.(2005) as a model of TAG derivations, and by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) as empirically relevant.

Joshi* + *Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, and + Dept of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104-6228 {chenmain,joshi}@seas.upenn.edu Abstract Recent work identifies two properties that appear particularly relevant to the characterization of graph-based dependency models of syntactic structure 1 : the absence of interleaving substructures (well-nestedness) and a bound on a type of discontinuity (gap-degree ??1) successfully describe more than 99% of the structures in two dependency treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre 2006).

This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.(2006), but we use a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to determine parser actions, which makes parsing extremely fast.

We use Nivre et al., (2006)?s dependency parser.

If we suppose that the characterization of dependency structures as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e. the dependency structures for natural language falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree ??1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears to correspond to the wrong class of modeltheoretic dependency structures.
