While the summarization module is the same as that proposed for the Web (Fujii and Ishikawa, 2004), we modified the other modules for patent documents. Thus, we do not explain the summarization module in this paper. 2.2. Term Recognition The term recognition module searches the patent collection </context>

To extract paragraphs in patent documents, we use a tool produced for the Patent Retrieval Task at the NTCIR Workshops (Fujii et al., 2004; Fujii et al., 2006) and this process is fully automated. We also use linguistic properties for extraction purposes, because sentences in Japanese term descriptions typically contain specific pattern</context>
