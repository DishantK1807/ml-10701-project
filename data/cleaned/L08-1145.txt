<context>rl@iai.uni-sb.de Abstract We describe a set of experiments to explore statistical techniques for ranking and selecting the best translations in a graph of translation hypotheses. In a previous paper (Carl, 2007) we have described how the hypotheses graph is generated through shallow mapping and permutation rules . We have given examples of its nodes consisting of vectors representing morpho-syntactic proper</context>
<context> sentence, including, among other things, n-gram language models. In contrast to most purely statistical MT systems1 , we use rule-based methods to generate an AND/OR graph of translation hypotheses (Carl 2007) and a beam search algorithm to traverse the graph and feature functions to rank the paths, as e.g. in the MISTRAL system (Patry et 1A number of recent SMT architectures are described http://iwslt07.</context>

Comparing different language models In a previous set of experiments (Carl 2007) we compared several language models trained with the CMU language modelling toolkit4 . The CMU language modelling toolkit generates n-gram language models (LMs) from tokenized texts. The CMU toolkit</context>
<context>age models were computed, based on 20K, 100K, 1M 5M and 6M sentences, from the BNC and with: ○ n={3,4,5} for the lemma and token models ○ n={3,4,5,6,7} for the tag models In a set of experiments (cf. Carl 2007) we figured out that the orthogonal lemma-tag LM had the best performance, using a 3-gram lemma model from 5M sentences and a 7-gram tag model also from 5M sentences. These tests were run on a 200 se</context>
