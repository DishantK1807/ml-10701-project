The translation time itself did not cause significant delays compared to the input time, thanks to a very fast parsing algorithm, which is described elsewhere (Nogami et al.1988). Input sentences were typically rather short (English five to ten words, Japanese around 20 characters), and translation was generally about 0.7 seconds per word (5000 words/hour).
