It is also similar to Gildea & Jurafsky’s (2002) frame element groups, though we distinguish between different role orderings, whereas Association for Computational Linguistics for the Semantic Analysis of Text, Barcelona, Spain, July 2004 SENSEVAL-3: Third International Workshop on the Evaluation of Systems they do not.

Path to Target: Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) show that the path from a constituent node to the node corresponding to the target word is a good indicator that a constituent corresponds to a role.

To solve this problem, we will adapt the idea of null generated words from machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).

Collins. 1996.

To generate the training examples for the classifier, we generate a parse tree for every sentence in the SENSEVAL-3 training data, using the Collins (1996) statistical parser.
P96-1025
As in Gildea & Jurafsky’s (2002) approach, we determine head words from the sentence’s syntactic parse, using a simple heuristic 1 when syntactic alignment with a parse is not available.
