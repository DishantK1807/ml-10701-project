Both (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) and (Collins and Singer, 1999) present algorithms to obtain NEs from untagged corpora.

(Knight and Graehl, 1997) build a generative model for backward transliteration from Japanese to English.

For example, (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Jung et al., 2000) train English-Arabic and EnglishKorean generative transliteration models, respectively.

(Shinyama and Sekine, 2004) used the idea to discover NEs, but in a single language, English, across two news sources.

We extend our preliminary work in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006) to discover multi-word Named Entities and to take advantage of a dictionary (if one exists) to handle NEs which are partially or entirely translated.

The discriminative learning framework argued for in (Roth, 1998; Roth, 1999) as an alternative to generative models is now used widely in NLP, even in the context of word alignment (Taskar et al., 2005; Moore, 2005).
