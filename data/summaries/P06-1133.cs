There are studies on learning subjective language (Wiebe et al., 2004), identifying opinionated documents (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (Riloff et al., 2003; Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (Turney and Littman, 2003; Pang et al., 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Morinaga et al., 2002).

There are also research work on automatically classifying movie or product reviews as positive or negative (Nasukawa and Yi, 2003; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Beineke et al., 2004; Pang and Lee, 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004).

We plan to investigate more types of document collections pairs, e.g., the document collections from different text genres (Kessler et al., 1997).
P97-1005
Given a pair of document collections A and B, our goal is not to construct classifiers that can predict if a document was written from the perspective of A or B (Lin et al., 2006), but to determine if the document collection pair (A,B) convey opposing perspectives.

We utilize the subjectivity patterns automatically extracted from foreign news documents (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003), and find that the percentages of the subjective sentences in the bitterlemons corpus (see Section 4) are similar (65.6% in the Palestinian documents and 66.2% in the Israeli documents).
