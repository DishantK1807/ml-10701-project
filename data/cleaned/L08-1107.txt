A WOZ architecture can in these cases be used to induce emotions in the users of the dialog system, by directing the dialog in an emotion provoking way (Scherer et al., 2008; Strauss et al., 2008). Building a WOZ system is very time consuming and therefore costly. Thus, in this work we propose a template architecture containing a client software, a server that is linked to the client, compris</context>
