This work can also be viewed as part of a trend to perform joint inference across multiple language processing tasks (Miller et al., 2000; Roth and tau Yih, 2002; Sutton and McCallum, 2004).

Common approaches to this problem include pattern matching (Brin, 1998; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000), kernel methods (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006), logistic regression (Kambhatla, 2004), and augmented parsing (Miller et al., 2000).

This is an example of cross-document fusion or cross-document information extraction, a growing area of research transforming raw extractions into usable knowledge bases (Mann and Yarowsky, 2005; Masterson and Kushmerik, 2003).

Culotta and McCallum (2004) describe the constrained forward-backward algorithm to efficiently estimate the conditional probability that a segment of text is correctly extracted by a CRF.
