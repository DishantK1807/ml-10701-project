This work can be extended to cyclic automata (Clark and Thollard, 2004a; Clark and Thollard, 2004b), and thus the class of all regular languages, with the addition of a further parameter which bounds the expected length of a string generated from any state.

Similarly, with CFGs, (Abney et al., 1999) showed that converting between two parametrisations of stochastic Context Free languages are equivalent but that there are blow-ups in both directions.
