Linguistic Analysis: Each bunsetsu unit was automatically annotated with linguistic information using a Japanese syntactic analyzer (Kurohashi & Nagao, 1994) 2. The information was determined by asked the following questions for each bunsetsu unit.

Pushing and popping of a discourse segment (Grosz & Sidner, 1986) may also affect gesture occurrence.
J86-3001
In previous studies of multimodal generation, gestures were determined according to the instruction content (Andre, Rist, & Muller, 1999; Rickel & Johnson, 1999), the task situation in a learning environment (Lester, Stone, & Stelling, 1999), or the agent’s communicative goal in conversation (Cassell et al., 1994; Cassell, Stone, & Yan, 2000).

Contrastive relationship: Prevost (1996) reported that intonational accent is often used to mark an explicit contrast among the salient discourse entities.
P96-1039
On the basis of this finding and Kendon’s theory about the relationship between intonation phrases and gesture placements (Kendon, 1972), Cassell & Prevost (1996) developed a method for generating contrastive gestures from a semantic representation.
