Early experiments in thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994) suffered from the limited size of available corpora, but more recent experiments have used much larger corpora with greater success (Lin, 1998a).

We would also like to expand our evaluation to include direct methods used by others (Lin, 1998a) and using the extracted thesaurus in NLP tasks.
P98-2127
Other measures, such as LIN and JACCARD have previously been used for thesaurus extraction (Lin, 1998a; Grefenstette, 1994).

The weight functions LIN98A, LIN98B, and GREF94 are taken from existing systems (Lin, 1998a; Lin, 1998b; Grefenstette, 1994).

These tasks include collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), smoothing and model estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir, 2001) and text classi cation (Baker and McCallum, 1998).

X, Y and other Zs) which link synonyms and hyponyms (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).

Our previous work (Curran and Moens, 2002) has evaluated thesaurus extraction performance and ef ciency using several different context models.

Many systems extract grammatical relations using either a broad coverage parser (Lin, 1998a) or shallow statistical tools (Grefenstette, 1994; Curran and Moens, 2002).

We describe the functions evaluated in these experiments using an extension of the asterisk notation used by Lin (1998a), where an asterisk indicates a set ranging over all existing values of that variable.

term is modi ed by a prepositional phrase The relation tuple is then converted to root form using the Sussex morphological analyser (Minnen et al., 2000) and the POS tags are removed.

Most systems extract co-occurrence and syntactic information from the words surrounding the target term, which is then converted into a vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).

Curran and Moens (2002)), which would increase both number of attributes for each term and the total number of terms above the minimum cutoff, this is not nearly fast enough.
