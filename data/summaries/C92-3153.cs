One of the crucial points is that tagged text should be represented by FSA in order to be disambiguated (disambiguated texts are already in this form in Rimon and Herz 1991 and K.

Pereira and Wright 1991 and Rimon and Herz 1991 proposed such approaches, that is, algorithms that perform the construction of a finite-state automaton approximation of a phrase-structure grammar, These automata are then used as simple checkers of well-formed patterns.
