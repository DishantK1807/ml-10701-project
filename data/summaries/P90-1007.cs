In a previous paper \[Seo and Simmons 1989\] we argued that a syntactic graph -the union of all parse trees -was a superior representation for further semantic processing.

It was in this context that we \[Seo and Simmons 1989\] decided that a graph composed of the union of parse trees from an all-paths parser would form a superior representation for subsequent semantic processing.

Details of the graph form, the grammar, and the parser are given in (Seo and Simmons 1989).
