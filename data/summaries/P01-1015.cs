This is not the first such realisation: Cahill et al., (2000) describes a partial re-implementation of the ‘Caption Generation System’ (Mittal et al., 1999) which includes an objects and arrows ‘whiteboard’.

Currently, FLO supports the LinGO realiser (Carroll et al., 1999), but we are also looking at FLO modules for RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997) and FUF/SURGE (Elhadad et al., 1997).

In order to accommodate this result, a ‘process model’ was sketched which aimed to support both pipelines and more complex control regimes in a flexible but structured way (see (Cahill et al., 1999),(RAGS, 2000)).
