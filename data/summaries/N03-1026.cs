Alternatively, a single input parse could be selected by stochastic models such as the one described in Riezler et al.(2002). A separate phase of parse disambiguation, and perhaps the effects of any errors that this might introduce, can be avoided by transferring from all parses for an ambiguous sentence.

Depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence “headlines” for multi-sentence text (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Jing, 2000).

and Transfer In this project, a broad-coverage LFG grammar and parser for English was employed (see Riezler et al.(2002)). The parser produces a set of context-free constituent (c-)structures and associated functional (f-)structures for each input sentence, represented in packed form (see Maxwell and Kaplan (1989)).

This idea of computing matching scores to multiple reference examples was proposed by Alshawi et al.(1998), and later by Papineni et al.(2001) for evaluation of machine translation systems.

To overcome this problem, linguistic parsing and generation systems are used in the sentence condensation approaches of Knight and Marcu (2000) and Jing (2000).

In addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by Jing (2000).

Work on employing packing techniques not only for parsing and transfer, but also for generation and stochastic selection is currently underway (see Geman and Johnson (2002)).

Similar to stochastic disambiguation for constraint-based parsing (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2002), an exponential (a.k.a.
