105:1011	:.!ost exir;tinq programs are capable of applying context-free phrase-structure qrammars to the sentences anrl t!lc various techniciues for doinq this arc, by now, fairly well unrlcrstood.
106:1011	Ilowcvcr, this kind of grapnar is now qcnerally consitlered t6 be inadequate because it fails to revcnl t!le most important properties of the majority of sentences and becnuse it typically dctlarcs a sentence to be more amhiquous than it really is. These difficulties are overcome to some extent by context-sensitive grammars and to a large extent by transformational granmars.
107:1011	The proqram discussed in this :%emorandurn is capable of analyzinq sentences with context-sensitive qranmars and with grammars cf a class very similar to that of transformational qrammvs.
108:1011	Experimentation with tinis program is still in its very early stages, but the results reported here suqqest that the technique used may prove to he a powerful and efficient tool for language analysis.
109:1011	If so, it can hope to find application in informational retrieval, command and control.

165:1011	The secone rule ::oes what is really wanted: It constructs a phrase labeled "i\TOUiJ1' as re~uired, and leaves the sydols referred to by pointer number 2 unchanged.
166:1011	The context-sensitive rule just considered Is presumably intended to insure that singular verhs have only singular subjects.
167:1011	A second rule in tlhich "SG" is replaced by "PL" would be required for i~lural verbs.
168:1011	But, since agreements of this kind nay jell have to be specifled in other parts of the qrammar, the situation.

177:1011	The use of the symbol "NULL" is illustrated in the rule: PPH = NULL This will cause the symbol "PPH" to be deleted from any string in which occurs.

187:1011	Elements can also be specified as repeatable by writing an asterisk against the synbol, as in the follo~ving example: This says that a verb ~ahrzse nay consist of a verb followed by one or more noun phrases.

195:1011	The symbol "LNY" with on asterisk and a dollar siqn corresponds in this syste?

197:1011	Consider now the foiloy~ing rule: This will form a noun phrase from a subordinating conjunction followed by a noun phrase, provided that this dominates only the symbol "Sn.
198:1011	Any symhol on the lefthand side of the rule may be followed by an expression in parentheses specifying the stxing of charaoters that this symbol must c:ircctly c?oninntc.

208:1011	This device turns out to have ui2e utility.
209:1011	DouSle parentlleses can also be used folloving a symbol on the left-hand side of a rule, but with a different interpretation.
210:1011	Ne have seen how single parcntheses are used to specify the string immediately dominated by a given symbol.
211:1011	Double parentheses enclose a string vlhich must be a proper analysis of the, sub-tree dominated by the given symbol.
212:1011	A string is said to be a proper analysis of a sub-tree if each terminal syd~ol of the sub-tree is dominated by some member of the string.
213:1011	As usual, a symbol is taken to dominate itself.
214:1011	ns an example Of thin, consider the follovin~ rule: ART.1 S ( (>RT 17.2 ANY*) ) -1 2 = DET(1) 2 This rule applies to a string consisting of an article, a sentonce, an2 a noun.
215:1011	The sentence qust bc analysal~le, at some level, as an article follower: hy a noun, follo~led by at least one other word or phrase.
216:1011	The noun in the eml>odded sentence, and the sub-tree it clorninntas, nust be exactly matched by the noun correspondinn to the last element on the left-hand side of the rule.
217:1011	The initial article and the em1xXidea sentence 7.iill 1x2 collecteri as a phrase under the sylnhol "DP:Tt' and the final noun wlll hc left unchanged.
218:1011	The principal facilities available for writing rules have now been exemplified.
219:1011	Another kind of rule is also available ~rhich has a left-hand side like those already des&ibeA but no "equals" sign and no riqht-hand side.
220:1011	Uowever it tiill be in the best interests of clarity to defer ap explnlmtion of !low these rules are interpreted.
221:1011	The user of the program may 1.1rite rules in exactly the form we have described or may add information to control the order in ~ihich the rules are ap;~licd.
222:1011	This additional information takes the form of an expression written before the rule and separated from if by a coma.
223:1011	This expression, in its turn, takes one of the following f orns : n1 in an integer which orders t!lis rulo relative to the others.
224:1011	Sincc tl~e sane ictcqcr can Sc nssi7llcd to nore than one rule, the ordering is ~artial.

229:1011	2. PHRASE-STXUCTUPJ;: GPA!U.'A3 It will be clear from what has been said already that this program is an exceedingly powerful device capable of operating on strings and trees in a vide variety of ways.
230:1011	It would clearly be entirely edequate for analyzing sentences with a context-free phrasc-structure granmar.
231:1011	But this problem has been solvec?
232:1011	!>cfore, and much more simply.
233:1011	We have seen how the notation can be used to write context-sensitive rules, and we should therefore expect the program to be able to analyze sentences with a context-sensitive grammar.
234:1011	However in the design of parsing algorithms, as else;ihere, context-sensitive grammars turn out to be surprisingly r?.ore complicated than contr?xt-free grannars.
235:1011	The ;>ro!~lcn t:mt context-sensitive r:rarq.mars pose for this yrogran can i~e s:~oi:n i it!^ a ni?:>le exannle.
236:1011	1 Consi2er tho follovring in 5ril:xnar: ABC (1) S I3 E (S) (2) This grammar, though trivial, is \!ell behave2 in all important aays.
237:1011	The lanquage rjcnerated, though reqular and unanbiguous, is infinite.
238:1011	Furthernore, every rule is useful for some derivation.
239:1011	Since the language generated is unaml~ir~uous, the gramnar is necessarily cycle-free, in other *:~ords, it ?reduces no derivation in which the sage line occurs more than once.
240:1011	Suppose, however, that the grammar is used for analysis and is presented with the string "A D E" -not a sentence of the lanquage.
241:1011	Tho attempt to analyze this string using rules of tne gramnar results in a rewriting operation that begins as follows and continues indefinitely: '1 am indebted for this example, as for other ideas too numerous to document iridiviclually, to Susumu Kuno of IIarvard University.
242:1011	ADC A D I: (I>:?
243:1011	rule 6) utc.
244:1011	It would clearly I>@ possible, in principnl, to eciuip the program with a procedure for detecting cycles of this sort, but the timc?
245:1011	rdquirad by such a ?rocedure, and the compl'exity that it viould introduce into t!le nroqram as a whole, are sufficient to rule it out of all practical consideration.
246:1011	It might be argued that the strings which have to be analyzed in practical situations come from real texts and can he assumed to be sentences.
247:1011	The problem of distinguishing sentences from nonsentenccs is of academic ihterest.
248:1011	Rut, in natural lanquaqcs, the assignment of words to gramatical catc~ories is, as we have already remarked, notoriously a~?l~iquous and for this problem to arise it is enouqh for suitably ambiguous words to come together in the sentence.
249:1011	A sentence which t?ould be accepted by the above grammar, but which would also give rise to cycles in the analysis, might consist of words with the fol1o:iing graraaatical categories: The progran, as it stanr:~, cnntni~s :io ncc:l;lnisn which autonntically guards aqcinnt cyclcr,.
250:1011	I:o::ev~-?r, if the user !<noris tlhare thcy are li!:ely to occur or discovers then as a result of his ex;>ericnce ?ri.th t!lc,?roqrnrn, !le can include sone s;>ecial rules in his qramar :!i~ici~ will prevent them from occurring.
251:1011	These rules, v;lich 1.r~ !lave already eluded to, are formally similar to all others except that they contain no "equals" si~n and no rig!ithand side.
252:1011	1*7hen a P-marker is found to contain a string which matches the left-hand sick of one of these rules, the program arranrjes that, thence fomr~~ard, no other rule shall be allowed to apply to the [thole string.
253:1011	The cycle in this latest example could not occur if the rjramlar contained the rule: ABE We now cone to the main concern of this paper which is to discuss the extent to which the program we have been describing can be made to function as a traflsformational analyzer.
254:1011	The main purpose of the examples that have been given is to show thd great power of the program as a processor of symbol strings.
255:1011	The notion of dominance is provided for, but only in a rudinentary :iay.
256:1011	It ccrtainlxr coulcl not bc claimed that the grogram is a trcc :)rocensor in any really 11or1:ahle sense.

258:1011	IVe shall take it that a transPor11ationa1 grarnar consists of a context-Erco or context-nan:;itivc ?:lrasr?structure conponent and a set of transformations orderec!
259:1011	in some way.
260:1011	To begin !jith, very little will ?-.e lost if we assume that the triinsformational rules .arc ni:~>ly ordered.
261:1011	Consider now the first transforriation in the list.
262:1011	In general, this may he expected to introduce 1:hrases into thc P-markers to which it applies vhich could not have been generated by t!le ;>hrasc-s tructure con~onent . Let us now write some additional phrase-structure rules capable of generating t2les.e new phrases.
263:1011	Let us izscrt these rules into the gramar in~eSiataly follovinq the first transformational rule 2nd establish the convention that, when they are used in the analysis ef the strinq, their output will be used only as input to the first transformation.
264:1011	Mow treat the second transfor~~ational rule in the sane way.
265:1011	It also can I>e cxpcctc~P to crcatc new kinds of phrase and phrase-structure rules can be written which woulZ recognize these.
266:1011	It nay be that some of the phrases formed by the second rule could also be formed by the first, and in this case, it may be possible to move.the appropriate rule from its position after the first transformation to a position after thc second and to mark it as ~roviding input only for these t~lo rules.
267:1011	Notice that the rules we are proposing to construct will not constitute what has sometimes been called a surface grammar.
268:1011	The phrases they rkscribe certainly do not belong to the base ntructura and ma!ly nF thema:* not be canable of surviving unri~anyrcc: into the surfacc ntructure.

273:1011	this transformation, and many others, may ~>ro~luce phrases of indefinitely many types.
274:1011	~et us su:,?ose that, before this transformation is applied for the first tine, all possible phrases that can he dominated hy the syn~bol "B" are describable by context free phrase structurQ rules of the follotiing form: :There the ai arc' ally strinqs.
275:1011	The ;)hranc structure grammar neeAed to ckscribe all the p:lrancs thzt can cxist after the operation of this trnnsfornation !.lust contain thc follominq ruler,, or narc n~onr~atol:.
276:1011	ruln schclv.ta where the asterisk indicates one or pore repetitions of the symbol "A".
277:1011	If the left and right-hand sides of these rules are reversed and tiley are ?resented to t!le proqrnn in the proper notation, t!len t!le transformation itself can bc rc2rescnted Ly the foiloving -air of rules: Since there are no facilit?es for specifying dominance relations among elements on the right-hand sides of these rules, it is necessary to resort to su1,terfuge.
278:1011	The phrase dominated by the synbol "B" is reproduced in the output of this rule with copies of the symbol "A" removed from the right-hand end and the remainder bounded by the symbols "B+" and "+B".
279:1011	These symbols serve to delinit a part of the string which can only figure in the complete analysis of the sentence if it constitutes a phrase of typo "But.
280:1011	The second rule ro.novcs these lmundnry sy??hols from the phrase of type "R" and, since no !~ointer is assirjncd to them, they will lsAve LO tracc in the final P-marker.
281:1011	Another, and perha2s mre economical, way to tlrkt'e recopnition rul-es corresponding to this transformation involves conflating the additional phrasc-strt~cture rules withthe reverse of the transformational rulo itself to give rules of the Ebllo~~ing kind: In fact, the elementary transformation for dau~hter adjundtion thatlwe are providing for here is more general than that often allowed by transformational grammarians.
282:1011	It is common ts require that if some element 5 is adjoined as a daughter of another element then 2 must hove no daughters before the transformation takes place.
283:1011	Sister adjunctidn can be treated in an analogous manner.
284:1011	Consider the following transformation: X-A-B-Y Adjoin 2 as right sister: of 4.
285:1011	The phrases existing before this transformation is carried out, and which have "Bn as a constituent, can be thought of as being described by a set of rules as follows: IIcre the ni arc nontcrr.inn1 syrl>ols and thc ai are strin~r,, possibly null.
286:1011	The qramar y9!lich :?cscri)>o:: the phrases existing after t!le o:)crntion of t!lis tral:!:For?-ntion nust contain, in aAdition, the following rules: The reverse transformation itself can now be represented by a set of rules as follows: Notice that the strings referred to !>y the synbols "X" and "Y" in both of the above transformations are unchanged by the transformation and are therefore not mentioned at abl in the analysis rules.
287:1011	Experience shm.is that it is in fact rarely necessary to ririte a separate rule for each ai.
288:1011	In nost cases, a transformation of this kind could he 1:ancllad in the progra.rn.
289:1011	.with a rule ot the follotlinq form:.
290:1011	Tilis is one of a largc 17nrher of cascs in vhich it has hcen found that the analysis rulcs can '~c made more permissive than the orininal qrammar sugqcsts ;iithout~ introducing s2urious structurcn and without serinusly incrensing the amount of tine or si?acc 11scc1 !'y the ?rocgram.
291:1011	vrhile it is possible that tr~nsfornationdl xnalynis can be done in an interesting :.ray :.qit!~ a procjram of t!lis sort, there soems to be little :lope of finclinq an alqoritlln?
292:1011	for writing analysis rules corresponding to a given transformational grammar.
293:1011	The followinq rule also involvos sister adjunction but ~oscs nuch more serious problems than the previous example: Adjoin 2 as right sister of 4 The problem here is that a. variable "Y" intervenes between "A" and "B".
294:1011	On the face of it, the analysis rule corresponding to this transformation would have to be somewhat as follows: And in principal the program could carry out a rule of this kind.
295:1011	However the first symbol on the left-hand side of this rule will match any string \ihatsoever, so tl~ab, if the rule can bc applicc?
296:1011	at all, it can be applicd in a :?ro(iir~ious nuntxr of ::nys.
297:1011	nut, 1:ith rcal grammars, it usually turns out tllat quite a lot can he said about the part of the scntcnce covercd by the variahlc "Y" so that analysis rules can be vlrittcn which are snfficiently specific to be ~rncticablc.
298:1011	Deletions are notoriously troublcsoze in Trammars of any kind because t!lo:r can so onsily sive rise to cycles and undecidable prol>ler?s. Transfornational nrnmmarinns require that lcxical itcns silould only bc c?clateC from o P,-marker if thcrc is some other copy of thc snnc ite~ which remnins.
299:1011	This conclitioi: insurcs v:llnt t:~cy call the recoverability of thc transformation.
300:1011	ITw~cvcr, it is very important to realize that recoverability, in this sense, is a very *.ieak condition.
301:1011	The requirement is that, knowing that an itcn has been 6elctcd from a certain position in the P-mar::er, it shculd Se possil>le to tell what that item :;as.
302:1011	nut there is no rcc:uircnent that a P-marker should contain evidence that it !,as r?criveA by means of a deletion transformation or of the places in it where deletions night have taken ~lacc.
303:1011	Deletions are nore easy to cope vith in certain qituations than others.
304:1011	Considcr for exarlplc t!le followinq transformation: X-A-B-A-Y Delete 4.
305:1011	The recoverability requirement is satisfied because of the identity of the second and fourth elements in the structural index.
306:1011	The corresponding rule for the program It is liccessary to ;3rovirio ordcrinrr j.r.for?:ation vfith a rnlc of this kind !ecousc it ::nuld otllervisc Ije capal>lc of oporating on its o!.rn output and c;rclin~ indefinitel:?.

308:1011	Once again, experience shows that the grammarian alnost invarial~ly knows vorc about the cnviron~??cnt in which a delction talrcs place than is stated in the rulc, and if t!lis infor~nation is used carefully, arlalysis rul.es can :,e -,written :fhich do not lead to cycles.
309:1011	In principle the situation is oven :orsc in rulcs of the following kind: X-A-Y-A-Z Delete 4 Here the third elencnt is a variable ;i!lich con cover any number of nodes in the P maw.
310:1011	In analysis we are therefore not only without information about how many.
311:1011	times the rule may have been applied but we know nothing about where to insert new copies of the symbol "A", except that they must be to the right of the existing copy.
312:1011	The other commonly used elementary transformations (substitutions and Chomsky-adjunction) do not-present special problems.
313:1011	The main outstanding difficulty comes from the fact that transformational rules are ordered.
314:1011	We !~nve alrcacly said that the thecry of transformational qrammar is in a state of continual c!iacqe anc?
315:1011	this is particularly true of the,>art that concorns the ordering of rules.
316:1011	For this reason :.!e IIRVC PSOURO?

320:1011	S -r A (D) B C 2.
321:1011	C-DE Transformations and suppose that the program is required to analyze the string "A D B En.
322:1011	Since, in generation, the list of transformations is read from top to bottom it is reasonable to suppose that in analysis it should be read from bottom to top.
323:1011	v?e may take it that the analysis rule corresponding to the sccone tkknsformotion is somcl~hat ns follovs!
324:1011	"llis, togetllcr with the ti70 phrase-structure rules, is sufficient to give a comi~lctk analysis of tllr: strinq vith this underlying P-mar1:er : But if this is an unfierlying P-narkcr, the second transformational rule could not possibly be used to 7roduce a derived structure from it because the first transformation, which according to our assun!>tion is obligatory, can be applied to it qivinq the follo~iinrl result: It is in fact not sufficient to scan the list of transfornations from bottom to top because this procedure does not make allowance for the fact that the transformations are obligatory.
325:1011	To regard transformations as optional which were intended to be obligatory is in general to associate spurious base structures to some sentences.
326:1011	The solution for t?~e pre!cnt cjranmar is to use the follo~iing set of a11a1ysis rules: Tho first ancl t!lircl rules contain, in effect, the str~~ctaral indices from tho second a112 first trnnuforxations respectively.
327:1011	The first rulc says that no strinq is acceptable as a sentence ~;1ic:1 contains "B 3" as a substring :~ecause to, this it ~iould have l~een :?ossihle to apply transformation 2.

346:1011	The EUrrent version of the 2rogram is vrittcn in ALSOL and with very little regard for efficiency.
347:1011	But the basic algorithm is inherently a very rjrt?at Acal more efficicnt than any of its competitors.
348:1011	The various interpretations of an am!>iguous sentence, or a sentence which seems likely to be aml>iguous in the early stayes of analysis, are all worked on sinultancously.
349:1011	At no stage can the program be said to he developinq one interpretation of a sentence rather than anothat.
350:1011	If two interpretations differ only in some small part of the Pmarker, then only one complcte P-marker is stored with two versions of the ambiguous part.
351:1011	Plork done on the unambiguous portion is Aonc only once for both interpretations.
352:1011	The program, though undoubtedly very powerful, seems naive from the point of view of modern linguistic theory.
353:1011	The program embodies very little of what tie know or believe to be true about the structure of natural languages.
354:1011	It might well be said that a computer program for analyzing natural languages is only interesting to the extent that it makes a claim about the basic form of those languages.

362:1011	By the time the Report's existence came to be known to AJCL, and arrangements for reprinting were settled, the first volume of the Report had been completed and the second well begun.
363:1011	We begin with the entire back file; henceforth the Report will appear regularly in AJCL, omitting only those items that AFIPS does not permit to be reprinted (for example, on account of restrictions imposed by third-party copyright owners).
364:1011	The news from Washington may be good or bad, but is' always important to those who live as close to the Federal Government as educators and researchers, not to mention engineers, must do.

370:1011	I, No. 1 August, 1975 A MESSAGE FROM THE AFIPS PRESIDENT The first issue of this Washington Report signifies the real beginning of AFIPS activity in Washington.
371:1011	Through this medium we shall communicate to the AFIPS constituent societies and the members of these societies about computer and information processing related activities of the Federal government and about the matters to which the staff of the Washington Office is devoting particular attention.
372:1011	I am very pleased that the opening of the Wrtshington Office of AFIPS coincides so closely Mith the start of my own term as President of AFIPS.
373:1011	The establishment of this Office has been a particular interest of mine for some time; during my term as President I expect to devote a considerable amount of time to it.
374:1011	In order for the Washington Office to be a success, a number of pieces will have to fit together.
375:1011	Two of them most appropriate for mention here are: This Washington Report must develop into a useful, not to say indispensable publication to its recipients; this will happen most surely if we receive feedback from you on what you like and don't like, on what should be in the Report which is not and on what shouldn't be in the Report which is. The Washington Report is being distributed to senior officials of the AFIPS constituent societies.
376:1011	From you we solicit ideas on what the Washington Office should be involved in.
377:1011	Your suggestions on how the infonation processing comnunity can be best served by the AFIPS Washington Office are most important to us.
378:1011	Anthony Ral ston WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS DR. WILLIS H. WARE APPOINTED TO PRIVACY PROTECTION STUDY COMMISSION It was announced on June 10 that Dr. Willis H.

392:1011	EFTS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS Against the background of the broad EFTS moratorium proposed last January by Senator Proxmire in the Senate and Mr. St. Germain in the House of Representatives, two bills of lesser scdpe have recently been introduced.
393:1011	The earlier Proxmire moratorium would require that no financial institution enter into a contract involving electronic metbods of fund transfers at places of business other than financial institutions and clearinghouses.
394:1011	Senator McIntyre introduced on June 6 a bill whYch would restrict certain Federal financi a1 institutions from engaging in transactions with its customers outside the state in which the Federal institution is located, unless the laws of that state specifically authorized such transfers.
395:1011	Mr. St. Genain introduced in the House on June 18 legislation which would impose a 90 day moratorium under which no Federal regulatory agency or financial institution could approve or authorize the establishment or expa%ion of any electronic funds transfer systenls; during this period, the National Com~ission on Electronic Furid Transfers would submit a report to tile Congress wiiicl~ would contain its r~conunendations regarding further legislation.
396:1011	EFTS APPOINTMENTS REMAIN PENDING Presidential appointments to the National Coniinissioii on Electronic Fund Transfers remain pending, although the Coiiriiission was created in October, 1974 bv Act of Congress.
397:1011	Concern over the delay has bee11 voiced by Senator FlcIntyre, Chairman of the Financial Institutions Subconr~~ittee of the Senate Banking Conmittee, as well as by Inembers of the private sector.
398:1011	The Commission is to recorntend, after a thorough study and investigation, appropriate administrative and legislative action in connectio~?

403:1011	Accordingly, the OFR guidelines require in each notice: the system name; location at which records are maintained; categories of individuals on irlion~ records are maintained; type of information contained in system records; routine use of the system; title and address of the agency official responsible for system; and a [means by which an individual can gain access to and contest records.
404:1011	FORD ADMINISTRATION INTRODUCES BILL FOR WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVICE Senator Moss, in behalf of the Ford Administration, introduced on June 20 a bill to establish a science advisory mechanism in the White House.
405:1011	While there are currently several bills pending before the Congress on this subject, the administration bill (S.1987) and a bill introduced in the House by Mr. Teague (H.R.4461) are considered to be the most likely contenders for enactment.
406:1011	S.1987 would establish in the Executive Office of the President an Office of Science and Technology Policy.
407:1011	The Director of the office would be the President's chief policy advisor with respect to scientific and technological matters.

424:1011	I, No. 2 WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS September, 1975 NEW LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY ON WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVICE Representatives Teague and Mosher have introduced a new bill .(H.R. '9058)to provide for scientific advice to the President, which integrates some major features of two earlier bills introduced by Teague and the Ford Administration, respectively (Washington Report, 8/75).
425:1011	Back round.
426:1011	There have been various science advisory mechanisms in the White + ouse over the years, at times having a recognition of information processing.
427:1011	In 1957 President Eisenhower, in response to international developments.
428:1011	in mi ssile technology, appointed a Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, and a President's Science Advisory Comi ttee (PSAC) which consisted of non-government scientists and engineers; in 1959, he also established the Federal Council for Science and Technology, which was composed of representatives of the major science-oriented agencies.
429:1011	President Kennedy, in 1962, institutionalized White House involvement in science policy by creating the Office of Science and Technology (OST) in the Executive Qffice of the President.
430:1011	As of 1970 OST included a staff member for computers, Dr. A. Michael Noll.
431:1011	However, President Nixon abolished PSAC and OST in 1973, transferring OST's functions (except those relating to national security) to the Office of the Director of the National Science Foundation, Dr. H. Guyford Stever.
432:1011	While Stever was simultaneously appointed Science Advisor to the President, the post was organizationally removed to agency level, and Stever was effectively barred from White House policy level discussions during the Nixon Administration.
433:1011	The Ford Administratian, in contrast, has recenxly shown several signs of willingness to reinstate a science advisor in the White HHouse.
434:1011	,H.R. 9058 differs from earlier bills in two important respects.
435:1011	First, in contrast to the Administration bill and to Stever's present role, H.R. 9058 would specifically direct the new science advisor to render advice in the area of national security.
436:1011	Second, in lieu of the maior organizational reform proposed in the original Teague Bill (H.R. 4461) to provide a centralization of scientific research and development, the new bill would simply initiate a major study to assess the total Federal science and techology effort, devoting particular attention to organizational reform.
437:1011	Since the earlier Teague Bill would have consolidated major Federal scientific and technical information organizations, the study approach is expected to create considerably less political resistance.
438:1011	Nevertheless, the bill 's prospects for enactment remain unclear.
439:1011	Although AFIPS and other scientific societies were told by an official of the Domestic Council in a White House briefing on July 30 that the bill was perceived to be a good one, it has not yet received the public support of the Ford Administration.
440:1011	PRIV4CY COMMISSION ELECTS CHAIRMAN, APPOINTS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR The Privacy Protection Study Commission elected David F. Linowes as its chairman on July 11.
441:1011	Linowes subsequently announced on August 14 the appointment of Carole W. Parsons as executive director of the Commission.
442:1011	Mr. Linolves is an international management consultant and a certified public accountant.
443:1011	Ms. Parsons has formerly been associated with the White House DonieStic Council Committee on the Right of Privacy and the HEW Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems.
444:1011	In carrying out its statutory charter (Washington Re ort, 8 75), the Comlnission will emphasize the assessinent of privacy safeguarhe (usiness and industry sector.
445:1011	It will examine policy issues associated ~ith the interstate transfer of information, the use of personal identifiers, and information activities in areas such as employ~nent, insurance, credit, banking, health, and social service.
446:1011	It will publish a final report by June, 1977.
447:1011	Chairman Linowes has indicated "the strong desire of tlie Conaiission to receive suggestions from the public on which facets of the private sector should be given major attention;'' further, Ms. Parsons has stated that she will be looking for new ideas and lines of research to propose to the Conirnission.
448:1011	Tlie AFIPS Washington Office will endeavor to play an active role in providing assistance and input to the Commission; comments from tlie AFIPS societies are therefore of substantial importance, and are strongly solicited.

450:1011	SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW NEW CASE ON PATENT OF SOFTWARE, There is now pending before the U. S. Supreme Court a review of the software patent granted to Thomas R. Johnston.
451:1011	The Court ruled in the 1972 Benson-Tabbot case that the software patent then in question was not valid, but the Justices did not resolve the issue of software patentability in general.
452:1011	Instead, the Court deferred to the Congress for a definition of the legal protections to be afforded to software; the Congress, however, has not responded.
453:1011	In the brief for the United States filed in the pending case; Solicitor General Robert Bork has asked the Court to resolve whether a coniputer program is patentable as a machine (rather than as a process), arguing that it is unreasonable to characterize a programmed general purpose coniputer as a "new s~achine".
454:1011	MAJOR FEDERAL AGENCIES PROPOSE REGULATIONS T4 IMPLEMENT PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 Federal agencies are required by the Privacy Act of 1974 to publish, prior to August 28, 1975, proposed implementing regulations for public comment.
455:1011	Comments from the AFIPS societies may be submitted through the AFIPS i.!ashington Office.
456:1011	Major agencies which have proposed rules subject to comment during September include: Deadline for Federal Rejz Agency Comnents Citation fpr Text of Rules National Science Foundation 9/5/75 7/29/75 p. 31811 Securities Exchange Commission 9/12/95 8/15/75 p. 34417 Office of Management and Budget 9/12!75 8/14/75 p. 34165 Health, Edvcation and Welfare 9/15/75 8/14/75 D. 34129 GENERAL ACtOUNTING OFFICE REPORTS WASTE IN COMPUTER SYSTEM ACQUISTIONS UNDER RDERAL GRANTS The General Accounting Office has submitted a report to the Congress which finds that, due to the lack of appropriate Federal procedures, recipients of Federal grants for acquisition of data processing equipinent have been allowed to utilize unsatisfactory procurenlent practices.
457:1011	The report stated that grantees: obtained new computer equipment without thoroughly evaluating their needs; obtained their own computer systems witho~t adequately exploring opportunities for joint use of existing computer facilities; leased equipment for short periods of time without fully considering the savings from purchasing or long term leasing; and considered primarily mainframe manufacturers as sources of equipment supply, while giving little consideration to reduced-price sources such as leasing firms, used computer suppliers, and independent manufacturers of peripheral equipment.
458:1011	The report recomends that Federal agencies establish consistent and economical acquisition pmcedures, and that grantor agencies be required to ensure grantee cooipliance.
459:1011	New procedures may indirectly impact private (e.g. , university) as well as state and 1 ocal government grantees.
460:1011	NBS AND ADIS-TO JOINTLY DEVELOP COMPUTER INTERFACE STANDARDS The Institute for Computer Science and Technology (ICST) in the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), and the Automated Data and Telecammunications Service (ADTS) in the General Services Administration (GSA) have announced that they will jointly undertake an effort to develop computer interface standards; one desired result of the program is to facilitate the competitive Federal procurement of computer peripheral equipment.
461:1011	ICST's overall charter is to develop standards related to information processing, and ADTS is responsible for automated data processing equipment procurement throughout the Federal government.
462:1011	The NBSIGSA program will: assess Federal government,experience with multivendor computer systems and produce a report to the agencies; produce technical guide1 ines to assist Federal agencies in the planning, selection and operation of multivendor systems; analyze comparativeLy the device level interface employed in high density disk drives; and evaluate the technological and economic impact of computer interface standards in the iiternational, national and Federal sectors.
463:1011	NBS SOLICITS COMMENTS ON DATA,ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM Pursuant to its statutory authority to establish Federal ADP Standard?, the National Bureau of Standards is developing a standard data encryption algorithm to be recomnended for Federal use.
464:1011	The purpose of the algorithm is to allow for compatibility of encrypted data.
465:1011	NBS points out that cryptograghic devices implementing the standard may be covered by patellts held by IBM, which has agreed to grant non-exclusive, royal ty-free 1 icenses; and that devices re1 ating to the standard may be subject to ex~ort cont~l~ AFIPS societies may submit comments to the Associate Director for ADP Stagdards, Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, D. C. 20234, or to the AFIPS Washington Office.
466:1011	Deadline fbr receipt of comments by NBS is October 30, 1975.
467:1011	The specification for the data encryption standard may be found in the Federal Register of August 1, 1975 at p. 32395; alternatively, copies may be obtained through the AFIPS Washington Office.
468:1011	RECENT EFTS DEVELOPMENTS The bill introduced in the llouse by Rep. St. Germain (Washington Report, 8/75), which would limit installation of remote teller terminals to a financial institution's ho~ne state and within 25 miles of its headquarters or 10 miles of a branch, has apparently died in conmiittee.
469:1011	While the measure to limit installation of such ternlinals has been, therefore, essentially rejected by the Senate, a Federal district court in Washington ruled i~ July that remote teller terminals constitute branch banks and are subject to laws governing branch banking.
470:1011	The decision, if it withstands the appeal being requested in the U. S. Comptroller of the Currency, will effectively prohibit future ban< installation of such terminals, and will cause operation of existing installations to be discontinued.
471:1011	NEW BILL INTRODUCED TO CONTROL FEDERAL CRIMJ_NAL JUSTICE INJORMATION SYSTEMS Sen. Tunney and Rep. Edwards have introduced identical bills (H.R. 8227 and S. 2008) to control Federal criminal justice information systelns.
472:1011	The bill is a compromise incorporating features of legislation introduced earlier this year.
473:1011	It would allow only conviction records to be distributed without restriction to law enforcement agencies; arrest and acquittal records could be disclosed only for specific purposes (e.g. , the investigation of a specific crime] and only to authorized personnel.
474:1011	Further, the bill would create a Commission on Criminal Justice Information, composed of rnen~bers of state and local law enforcement agencies, which would implement and oversee enforcement of the act.
475:1011	I,lhile tile FBI has been attempting for some time to establish a law enforcement communicationr system interconnecting local police departments throughout the country, the Cormission would have the authority to modify or terminate the FBI plan.
476:1011	AIR FORCE DESCRIBES EMPHASIS ON SOtTWARE ENGI'NEERING General!
477:1011	Sa~n Philliijs, Air Force Systems Comn~ander, bas described a new major emphasis on software engineering in the procurement of weapotis-systems computer software by the Department of Defense.
478:1011	The approach described would require software to be engineered in niuch the same way that present procurements engineer hardware; greater effoFt would be devoted to work breakdown structures, ~nilestones, technical review of contract work, and software reliability assessment.
479:1011	FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SOURCES FOR CURRENT RESEARCH IN INFORMATION PROCESSING -AFIPS societies mould be aware of the information resources of the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange (SSIE) and the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).

503:1011	Affiliation of AFIPS with one NRC assembly does not preclude affiliation with others, such as the Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences.
504:1011	In NRC tradition, AMPS activities will consist of both direct responses to research requests initiated by Federal agencies, atid the undertaking, on its own initiative,of projects which are deemed to be of national interest.
505:1011	In making the invitation to AFIPS, AMPS Chairman Norris E. Bradbury said,"it is essential that serious consideration be given [by AMPS] to both the benefits that can accrue to the Assembly Frogram through interaction with tlie professional organizations.
506:1011	[and] contributions that the Assembly, in turn, can ~nake to these organizations".
507:1011	AFlPS SOCIETY PRESIDENTS ASKED TO DESIGNATE WINGTON OFFICE LIAISON -------AFIPS has asked its society presidents to each designate a liaison to the AFIPS Washington Office.
508:1011	Persons designated will act as a primary working contact for the Office, providing access to subject area experts within each society, providing nominees for various pamls, relaying disseminated information to appropriate points within each society, and providing feedback regarding the Office and the issues with which it deals.
509:1011	ACIIPS WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE MEETS TO CONSIDER WASHINGTON OFFICE ~ETS In responding to its fundamental charter to facilitate conimunication between the AFIPS societies and the Federal government, the AFIPS Washington Office will become involved in certain project-oriented activities.

518:1011	I, No. 3 October, 1975 WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS COMPUTER RESEARCH MAINTAINS STATUS IN NSF REORGANIZATION Computer research has maintained its status through the course of the recent major reorganization in the National Science Foundation (NSF).
519:1011	Under the new organizational structure, computer research will be conducted IR the Computer Science Section (CSS) of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and Engineering (MPE).
520:1011	The reorganization is designed to provide a more effective management structure, and to balance research activity among the new Directorates.
521:1011	Impact of the Reorganization.
522:1011	Dr. John R. Pasta, director for the former Division of Computer Research, will assume broader responsibility as the director of the new Division of Mathematlcal and Computer Sciences.
523:1011	Assuming Dr. Pasta's earlier responsibilities, Mr. Kent Curtis will become the new head of the Computer Sciences Section.
524:1011	According to Dr. Pasta, the recognition of computer science reflected In the reorganization will help to insure that it continues to be viewed as a unique discipline within NSF; the $12 million budget for research in this area will rain unaffected.
525:1011	Grants for computer research.
526:1011	NSF awards grants to support research in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Cmpl~ter Applications.
527:1011	CSS, In an effort to assess prior1 ties as seen from researchers in the field, will continue the policy of accepting unsolicited proposals from any source.
528:1011	While universities are expected to be primary recipients of grants, other organizations are ellgible for support.
529:1011	Within CSS, priorities in research funding are reflected in the various programs, and program directors are the primary decision makers in determining grants; these individuals should be considered the primary contact within NSF for researchers interested in specific grant areas: Theoretical Computer Sciences Program, Bruce H. Barnes Software and Programing Systems Program, Thmas A. Keenan Computer Systems Design Program, John R. Lehmann Networking for Science Program, Walter A. Sedelow Techniques and Systems Program, Sally Y. Sedelow Software Quality Research Program, J.

530:1011	FCC APPROVES WESTERN UNION REQUEST TO PROVIDE PACKET-SWITCHED SERVICE The FCC has approved a request from Western Union International to provide a packetswitched service between the United States and the United Kingdom, for the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) in the Oepartment of Defense.
531:1011	The service is experimental in nature, and will be the first transatlantic application of packet-switching technology.
532:1011	It will be used as a basis for gaining experience in transmitting between two packet networks (the second network being the Experimental Packet-Switched System in the United Kingdom), and to explore the use of satellites in international networks.
533:1011	NBS A~NOUNCES NEW COBOL STANOARD The Repartment of Comerce has approved a new Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 22-1, which makes Cobol-74 the new language standard applicable to all Federal agencies.
534:1011	Cobol is the only programing language for which a Federal standard has been established.
535:1011	It is maintained on a voluntary basis, and is presently used by 8 government agencies.
536:1011	The new standard will require Cobol compliers used by the Federal government to comply with the 1974 Ansi Cobol specifications, and vendors will be required to categorize their compilers within one of four NBS levels, each of which consists of a specific set of Ansi "functional processing modules".
537:1011	PROGRAM ERROR GENERATES MASSfVE SOCIAL SECURITY OVERPAYMENT The cmissioner of the Social Security Administration has testified before an oversight comittee of the House Ways and Means Comittee that Social Security overpayments of $461 million have been identified, and that the actual total may be as high as $800 million.
538:1011	The errors were made largely or entirely through the conlputer system which supports the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.
539:1011	Changes in a Complex statutory scheme have caused a haphazard development of SSI software; but the agency also admits to a lack of internal control, as well as a lack of coordination between systems or between programers working on the same system.
540:1011	The Comnissioner testified that many of the erroneous transactions are "literally beyond anybody's direct control".
541:1011	The errors have also led to concern that the system is vulnerable to fraudulent abuse by agency employees.
542:1011	PRIVACY PROTECTION STUDY COMMISSION MEETS IN WASHINGTON The Privacy Protection Study Comissioh met in Washington on September 8, with an agenda which included presentations From Federal government groups and prospective contractors.
543:1011	In response to a suggestion by chairman David Linowes, the Comnission resolved to create a conittee on Freedom of Information and Privacy, chaired by Minnesota State Sen. Robert Tennessen.
544:1011	Executive director Carole Parsons enumerated a list of areas possibly appropriate for the Comission's attention, which included: mailing lists; private sector usage of universal identifiers; valuntary private sector compliance with Federal regulations; data collection criteria; credit card and reservation systems; Freedom of Information Act litigation; health and medical records; multi-jurisdictional data systems; consumer reporting services; credit issuance and insurance; statistics and research; social services; employment and personnel matters; oversight, enforcement and remedies regarding privacy policies; international implications (including mu1 ti-national corporations) ; cost factors in imp1 ementing privacy safeguards; and the Federal-state relationship in privacy regulation.
545:1011	The Comnission directed Parsons to initially look into credit cards, mailing lists, universal identifiers and the Federal-state relationship.
546:1011	TUNNEY HEARINGS ON WHITE HOUSE COMPUTERS The Senate Subcornnittee on Constitutional Rights, chaired by Sen. John Tunney, held fact-finding hearings on September 9 to investigate computer usage (pertaining to personal data files) by the White House and'the Federal Preparedness Agency (FPA).
547:1011	Tunney indicated that the investigation could lead to legislation controlling the use of surveillance technology.
548:1011	Witnesses for the White House Office of Management and Budget, and FPA, testified that their computers were not capable of direct communications with other agency computers, and that there had been no improper use of their systems.
549:1011	Tunney nonetheless expressed concern regarding accountability and control in the use of such systems.
550:1011	In particular, he pointed to the lack of knowledge on the part of White House witnesses concerning the data base content in the FPA computers at Mt. Weather, while the director of that system had indicated that its data base content was a matter for the discretion of other agencies.
551:1011	NEWS BRIEFS The Comnerce Department has announced that U.S. Exports of computers and related equipment totalled $555 million during the first quarter of this year; imports for the same period totalled $32 million.
552:1011	The White House Office of Telecmunications Policy has released a privacy study which evaluates privacy safeguards ana proviues recmendations.

559:1011	Our next activity will be to structure a group of individuals from the AFIPS societies who are willing to make a comnitment to providing this assistance, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION BRIEFINGS The Washington Office has instituted a series of briefings to the Federal Cmicatlons Cmission, beginning with ivformal presentatioils by AFIPS experts visiting Washington.
560:1011	A near-term objective in this area is to provide a more comprehensive briefing to the Coninission, describing broadly how technological developments in, computing 'will affect communications and ultimately affect the regulatory responsibilities of that agency.
561:1011	FEDERAL COMPUTER NETWORKS AND PERSONAL DATA FILES The use or potential use of Federal computer networks to exchange personal data files has recently been the subject of attention by both Sen, Tunney's Subcommittee on~Constitu$ional Rights, and NBC Tews.
562:1011	Earlier this year, Ford Rowan of NBC produced a series of national news stories based on his investigation of Federal networks, particularly those in the defense and intelligence comnunities.
563:1011	With the objective of providing appropriate input from the computing profession, the AFIPS Washington Off~ce arranged for Mr. Rowan to interview Prof. Bernard Galler and Dr. Willis Ware; these interviews are expected to dppear on the NBC Nightly News.
564:1011	GENERAL INFORMATIONAL ACTIVITIES In addit-ion to producing the AFIPS Washington Report, recent activities have included: the development of a mechanism to disseminate NSF program solicitations froni both the Computer Science Section and the Office of Science and Information Service; providing infomation in response to individual requests from AFIPS constituents; and providing direct briefings to the AEDS and IEEE Computer Society boards which have recently met in Washington.
565:1011	In providing information to the Federal government, the Washington Office has recently responded to requests from the Federal Comnunications Comnission, the Library of Congress, and the Domestic Council Privacy Comnittee.
566:1011	PXPLORATORY ACTIVITIES An Important concept in the Washington Office charter is that the Office will function as an early warning mechanism with regard to developments in the Federal government.
567:1011	The objective is to permit AFIPS societies the opportunity to participate in such developments, rather than responding to them as faits accom lis.
568:1011	Accordingly, the Washington Office devotes substantial resources to ads hearings and meetings, and scanning on a daily basis such publications as the Federal Register, the Congressional Record and various comnercial reporting cervices.
569:1011	Recent exploratory meetings have been held with several groups which have indicated a definite interest in access to technical information through AFIPS, e.g., the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, the Air Force Systems Comnand, and the Office of Automated Data Processing Management in the General Services Administration.
570:1011	Continued liaison with congressional comnittees has permitted the Washington Office to alert AFIPS to major anticipated hearings, such as those to be held this fall by the House Committee on Science and Technology on (1) technology transfer and (2) the R & D programs of the National Science Foundation (inc1udin.g its program in computer resear h : .

573:1011	I, No. 4 November, 1975 WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS NATIONAL COMlISSION ON LIBRARIES AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ANNOUNCES GOALS The National Commission on Libraries and Information Science (NCLIS) ha$ stated its long range program in a docment recently transmitted to the House Conunittee on Education and Labor.
574:1011	NcLI.9.
575:1011	The Comission, established by statute in 1970, is chartered to advise the President and the Congress on national policy related to library and information services; its major program objectives are (1) to develop resources supportive of high quality library and information services, and (2) to form a national network of library and information facilities.
576:1011	Specific objectives are to " k]ncourage the private sector . . .
577:1011	to become an active partner in the development of the National Program," as well as to ensure adequate library and infomation services, provide adequate special services, strengthen state resources, ensure education of related personnel, coordinate Federal programs, and establish a locus of Federal responsibility for the National Program.
578:1011	Nationwide netwrk.
579:1011	The Commission envisions a nationwide network of libraries and infomation centers encompassing state networks, multistate networks, and specialized netwrks in the public and private sectors; the definition of "network" in this cmntext includes computers and computer communications, although it extend3 to cmventional telephone and teletype devices as well.
580:1011	While the Federal government would neither directly control nor operate the network, it would have responsibility for aiding the development of compatible networks, furthering comn practices, and increasing coordination between the private and public sectors; it would also "collaborate with appropriate professional societies in promulgating interstate technical standards, support the introduction of additional coyuter and telecommunications facilities as needed for interstate purposes, and help establish protocols governing the way transactions are handled by the network".
581:1011	Other Federal (as opposed to private) responsibilities identified by the Comission include developing centralized services for networking, exploring computer use, applying new forns of telecommunications, and supporting research and devel opment.
582:1011	Copies of the present National Program Document (U) may be obtained through the MIPS Washington Office; comments are, as noted above, encouraged by NCLIB.
583:1011	69 FEDERAL PRIVACY ACT IMPLEMENTATION Ihe Privacy Act of 1974 took effect on September 27, amidst certain unresolved questions as to its operation.
584:1011	lhe Department of Health, Education and Welfare has characterized itself as a single agency for purposes of the Act, allowing (barring further Congressional response) the 11 separate agencies within HEW to exchange personal data files without the disclosure records required for transfers between other Federal agencies.
585:1011	In a separate development, members of Congress expressed concern over the fact that sone agencies were interpreting the Act to preclude Congressional access to agency files of personal data.
586:1011	Members of Congress frequently request such access to aid their constituents in dealing with Federal agencies.
587:1011	The situation was resolved, temporarily at least, by an OMB memo recommending that each agency establish Congressional access as a "routine use" of a system of records under the Act; the effect on the OMB procedure will be to obviate the need for niembcrs of Congress to obtain written consent in order to access a constituent's data file.
588:1011	Finally, Sen. Kennedy has taken :I strong issue with a Justice Department opinion which operated to exempt records which an agency had exempted from public access under the Privacy Act, from access under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as well.
589:1011	In response to Kennedy's objection, the Justice Department has proposed a new regulation which would allow the FOIA to apply to records exempted from the Privacy Act, but only at an agency's discretion.
590:1011	POLITICS AND PRIVACY A number of prominent politicians have been addressing the privacy issue recently, most notably President Ford.
591:1011	In an address ((1 at Stanford Law School, Ford spoke of the need to balance the individual right of privacy with the government's legitimate need for information related to its program.
592:1011	While Ford made clear his intolerance of illegal invasions of privacy, his coments were primarily directed toward threats to privacy which result from otherwise beneficial programs; in such areas, he said, 'ke must protect every individual from excessive and unnecessary intrusions by a Big Brother bureaucracy".
593:1011	In a separate statement Ford later said that "N eeping only an essential minimum of these records is the most effective protection we have" against incursions on privacy.
594:1011	Sen. Tunney, chairman of the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights, recently reaffirmad his concern with privacy in a speech (#) on the Senate floor.
595:1011	He noted that his Subcommittee was presently moving bills which: would prohibit military spying on civilians; would provide for control of criminal records (Washington Report, 9/75); and would secure greater privacy protection for government employees.
596:1011	Turtney pointed out the need to anticipate technological threats to privacy, an endeavor in which AFIPS has already offered assistance to the Senator.
597:1011	Speaking in a recent interview in EDP Weekly, Rep. Goldwater stated that he hoped for an attitude of support and voluntary compliance with privacy protection principles in the colmPercia1 sector.
598:1011	While he feels that the business sector has an incentive to be concerned with privacy as a "good business practice," he feels that a similar incentive does not exist in the area of government; he pointed out, however, that he expects the states to enact their own privacy legislation, and that the Privacy Commission Cof which he is a member) would be looking primarily at the Federal-state relationship.
599:1011	In a speech at the recent IEEE Computer Society CWCON, Goldwater also urged the information processing community to provide technical input as a basis for reasonable legislation.
600:1011	CONTROVERSY ON,DEFENSE IR$D PROGRAM ?he Department of Defense Independent Research and Development IIRl,ll) progr~mr has been the subject of controversy in hearings before the Senate Irmed Services Subcommittee.
601:1011	The program permits defense contractors to charge part of their general R 6 D programs as overhead-on defense contracts; its cost in 1975 ros over $800 million dollars.
602:1011	Proponents of the program argued that it allows contractors to keep abreast of current technological developments, and that it allows the military to buy .tdvnnCed electronic system at a lesser cost than if developed under n. Jircctly funded R 6 D program.
603:1011	Critics of the program, however, testified that ~t allow:.
604:1011	firms to charge part of the cost of developing commercial projects to their military contracts; Admiral Hyman Rickover, heatl of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program, recornended that the program be eliminated.
605:1011	COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS RULING ENJOINED FROM IFIPLEMENTATION The Comptroller of the Currency has suspended his December, 1974 ruling (#) that Customer-Bank Comunication Terminals (CBCT's) are not branch banks within the meanipg of the laws governing national banks.
606:1011	A decision last July in the Federal District Court in Washington (Washington Report, 9/75) had enjoined fuxther implementation of the ruling, but it remained in effect while the Comptroller requested a stay of the District Court decision, pending appeal; on Octaber 10 the stay was denied and the ruling immediately suspended.
607:1011	PRESIDENT APPQIWS EFTS CCMdISSION President Ford has appointed the non-statutory members of the EFTS Commission, over one year after the enactment of the statute (t) creating the Commission.
608:1011	As a result of the delay the Commission will have less than a year to complete its work, unless the Congress passes an amendment (presently pending) which would extend its period of activity.
609:1011	William B. Widnall, former Congressman and ranking Republican on both the House Banking and Currency Committee and the Joint Economic Committee, has baen nominated as chairman; the Senate Banking Committee held brief confirmation hearings on October 23, and confirmation was expected (at press time) by Novembek 1.
610:1011	Members representing the financial sector are Richard D. Hill (First National Bank of Boston), Verne S. Atwater (Central Savings Bank of New York), and R~~ G, G~~~~ (Fidelity Federal S & L).
611:1011	State banking officials appointed were James E. Faris (Indiana) and William B. Lewis (New Jersey), and Herb Wegner was appointed as a trade association executive.
612:1011	Other nominees were Freyda P. Koplow, (former Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks), Fairfax Leary, Jr.
613:1011	(Temple University law professor); Almarin Phillips (U. of Pennsylvania) ; Gordon R. Worley (Montgomery Ward) ; George W. Waters (American Express); John J. Reynolds (Interbank Card Association); and Ralph F. Lewis (Harvard Business Review).

641:1011	The briefing to Rodgers was primarily in anticipation of a vice-presidential roundtable on Privacy and Information Policy.
642:1011	AFIPS participants were: Daniel McCracken (ACM), Charles Meadow (ASIS), Bill Moser (DPMA), and Bruce Peters (IEEE Computer Society).
643:1011	The objective of the briefing was to provide Rodgers an assessment, from the prospective of professionals in the information processing field, of issues related to Federal government information policy.
644:1011	Vice President Rockefeller, chairman of the Domestic Council Privacy Committee, 1s concerned with the development of a comprehensive policy which would view these Issues in a broad perspective, in contrast to the ad hoc fashion in which they are presently handled by the Federal government.
645:1011	COORDINATING AFIPS COWITTEES AND WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES Since several existing MIPS committees address areas of continuing interest in Washington, an effort is undexway to closely coordinate such committees with the activities of the AFIPS Washington Office and to make the facilities of the office available in connection with relevant committee work.

663:1011	DC 20037 202-296 0580 Vol.
664:1011	I, No. 5, December, 1975 WASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS FCC APPROVES DIRECT INTERCONNECTION OF TERMINAL EQUIPMENT The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled that users may directly connect terminal equipment to the telephone network without the use of carriersupplied connecting arrangements, provided they comply with FCC requirements.
665:1011	The ruling (#) is to become effective April 1, 1976.
666:1011	Impact of the decision.
667:1011	The ruling will permit users to connect computer terminal equipment to the network without the necessity of either a modem supplied by the common carrier (generally ATFjT) or a telephone company data access arrangement (DAA); the DM had previously been required if a Bell modem were not used.
668:1011	While circuitry similar to the DAA will still have to be incorporated in customersupplied equipment, it is expected to be considerably less expensive to users than present AT&T lease charges.
669:1011	Xistory.
670:1011	The FCC ruling requiring the use of telephone company connecting arrangements for user-supplied terminals has been the subject of controversey ever since its implement?tioh after the Carterfone decision (which allowed the connection of custo,mer-provided equipment) in 1968.
671:1011	The common carriers have argued that such arrhghents are necessary to protect the network against potential hams, such as those identified by a 1970 National Academy of Sciences study: hazardous valtages, excessive signal power levels, excessive longitudinal imbalance, and imp,roper network control signaling.
672:1011	Opponents maintain, however, that the telephone cmpanies have insisted on carrier-supplied access arrangements to protect their own revenues.
673:1011	Registration program.
674:1011	The FCC will allow interconnection only if it is done through either protective circuitry registered with the FCC, or directly through equipment which is itself registered.
675:1011	The Commission has also required that carrier-supplied terminal equipnient be registered (a requirement not generally imposed on comon carriers) in order to enhance network protection, insure competitive equality (between carriers and non-carriers) in the manufacture of such equipment, and to prov'i'de a "benchmark" against which to judge non-carrier applications.
676:1011	Possible appeal.
677:1011	ATBT is expected to appeal the FCC ruling, which may delay its effective date.
678:1011	Further, the ruling applies only to the technical aspects of intercomection; a separate proceeding (Docket 20003) is underway to examine the potential economic harm from competition in this area.
679:1011	A reversal of the technical ruling would appear unlikely on economic grounds, since data communications devices account for only the small portion of ATET revenues.
680:1011	7 5 OTP REPORT ON SOCIAL ISSUES IN EPTS The White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTY) has relensed a study on the non-economic implications of EFTS, entitled "Value Choices in Electronic Funds Trnnsfer Policy".
681:1011	In transmitting the study to the Vice President, OTP Acting Director John Eger said "both because of our particular mandate to evolve policy relating to the intorconncction of contputers with teleconununications, an intcrconncction which is tlie necessary foundation of any EFT system, and because of our concern for i,.formed and cffcctive formnulution of policy in the executive brdnch, DTP has begun to scrutinize closely the increasing range of Fedcral governmcnt activity in this area.
682:1011	While mnny of the aost significant economic questions have becn rarscd, critical non-ecunomic issues have not bccn addressedsuch as the desirability of unrcttered govcfnltrent acccss to pcrsonnl records either as a user or an operator of alty EFT system".
683:1011	A prim:~ry signific:lnce of the rcport is thc indication that OTP is squarely concc~ncd irith the social in~p:ict of EFTS.
684:1011	This subjctt is presently comlsidcrcd (or pl;~nncd to I)c considered) only peripherally by groups such ns the I'rivacy Cummission, the IiF'l'S Cot~~mnission, or the Fedcral Co~~~i~~nications Cu~~unission.
685:1011	IVIIITE llOUSE SCIENCE AIIVISER R1I.L PASSES HOUSE ---A new bill to cst.tblish a prcsidcntial scicnce adv~ser, 1i.R. 10230, has bccn passed (362-28) in the Ilo~~se of Reprcsentntivcs.
686:1011	The lcgislntion, draftcd cooper~tivcly by the Ford Admninistrntion and llousc scicnce lc.idcrs, is a revision of H.R. 9058 (Washinyton Report, 9/75).
687:1011	In its present form, the bill (1) cstdblishcs-a nntlon:~l polxcy for scicncc and technology, (2) establishes an Office of Scicnce 4 Technology Policy (OSI'P) in the White House, and (3) establishes a Federal Scicnce 6 l'cclinology Survcy Conunittoe (the Survey Committee) in thc White IIouse.
688:1011	The Survey Comlu~iittce rill have two years to analyze Federal science and technology cfforts .ind lcport its findings to the President, trho must subsequently review and transnut the report to Congress with his recommendations.
689:1011	The director OF OSI'P will scrve as the President's Sclence Adviser, and as chairman of the Survey Co~imittce.
690:1011	Despite the likelihood of this bill becoming l~w, thcrc rca1.1ins serious concern in the scicnce commln~unity (c.g. , llillinm C:lrey's editorial in thc Koven~ber 21 issue of Science) that science budgets may sufrcr st~bst:~mitinl cutb,~chs in Prosident Ford's program to reduce Federal cxpcndituncs by $28 million.
691:1011	NEW NSF ADVISORY GROUPS President Ford has created two new science advisory groups withln the National Science Fo,undation, to advise him on planning for tlie proposed Office of Science 4 Technology Policy (see above surmnary of H.R. 10230).
692:1011	These arc; respectively, the Anticipated Advances in Science 4 Technology Advisory Group, and the Contributions of Technology to Economic Strength Advisory Group.
693:1011	The former group, headed by Dr. William 0.
694:1011	Baker (president, Bell Labs) will advise the President on national policy implications of developments in science and engineering; the latter group, headed by Dr. Simon Ramo (board vice chairman, TRN) will advise on imitproving the utilization of technology to foster economic strength.
695:1011	In additian to the advisory group chairmen, other members related to the con~puting field include Lew Branscomb (Vice President and Chief Scientist, IBM), Joseph Charyk, (president, Comsat) and Patrick Haggerty, (board chairman, Texas Instruments).
696:1011	7 6 PRIVACY COMMISSION ACTIVITIES The Commission is presently investigating eight topical areas.
697:1011	It has thus far produced staff reports in four of these, "The Use of Mailing Lists in the Private Sector," "The Use of the Social Security Number in the Private Soctor," "Disclosure of Federal Income 'Tax Returns to Third Parties,ll and "Credit Card KccordKeeping: The InFormational Privacy Issues," and it has inunediatc plans to look into the remaining areas: consumer credit reporting, en~ployment records, social services, and statistical research.
698:1011	The Commission presently receives input from its own staff (which will be supplemented by contractual support of about $50 thousand per year), industrial groups and non-profit organizations such as AFIPS.
699:1011	The Commissioners rcccntly indicated that they will not postponc their rccommendation until their final report is due (June, 1977), but will publish proposed rccommendations for public commcnt as the Commission proceeds.

708:1011	APIPS provided two witnesses, Prof. J.C.R. Licklider of MIT and Prof. Harry Huskey of the University of California at Santa Cruz, who testified specifically on t~ansfcr of computer technology.
709:1011	Dr. Licklidor distinguished in his remdrks eight aspects of technology subject to export: hardwars, softworo, systcms, networks, services, inforn~ation, education and individual expertise.
710:1011	Ilo urged that while computer scrviccs and accqss to computing resources may be appropriate for export, that exports of computer hardware should be scrutinized for their national security implications.
711:1011	Prof. Iiuskcy pointcd out that information technology cnn be most hclpful to developing notions, and tends to have a stsblifing cffcct on these countries; he citcd the cxdmplc of Management Information Systems in food distribution.
712:1011	Ile stated further that encouraging utilization of the technology by developing nations is beneficial to the U.S. economy andstimulates do~~lcstic R F, D (which in turn maintains our relative technological advantage).
713:1011	Trsnscripts of the hearings (#) will be published in about one month.
714:1011	PRIVACY COhhlISSION REQUESTS AFIPS EXPERTISE The Privacy Protection Study Commission has lnede a request of AFIPS to provide a panel of experts familiar with certain aspects of the use of the Social Security Number (SSN) as a universal identifier.
715:1011	The Commission is interested in conuaunicating with thrce specific categories of individuals: (1) managers of record kceping systems who are familiar with current prlvate sector usage of the SSN, (2) persons directly familiar with an operation which has recently converted (perhaps in anticipation of private sector legislation) from the SSN to some other numbering system, and (3) individuals in state and local goverments familiar with the impact of Section VII of the Privacy Act, which makes it unlawful for such governments to deny benefits to individuals refusing to disclose their SSN.
716:1011	In response to this request, the APIPS lashington Office has contacted the liaison from each AFIPS society asking them to provide nominees to the AFIPS panel.
717:1011	AFIPS societies have pennission to use material in the AFIPS Washington Report for their own publications, except that where an article title appears with an " * " clearance must first be obtained from the AFIPS IVashington Office.

721:1011	The Assembly of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MIPS) in thc National \c.~Jriny of Sciences (NAS) has recently formed an ad hoc ComputerSciences l'lanning Group to consider activities which AMPS might undertake in that field.
722:1011	'Ihc L;rauli is to consider "what aspects of this rapidly growing discipline and wh~t probie~~~s rel~ted to federal and non-federal applications might benefit through special studies, particularly by [WS] ".
723:1011	The AFIPS Washington Office has confirmed that the formation of the Comliutcr Science Planning Group was precipitated in part by letters earlier this year to Dr. Philip Handler (president, NAS) from Anthony Ralston and Jean Sammet, presidents of AFIPS and ACM, respectively.
724:1011	Both Ralston and Smet urged Handler to consider organizational changes which would recognize computer science as .I separate discipline within the National Research Council [NRC -the NAS and the National Academy of Erlgineering), arguing that this recognition has already occurred within major universities and throughout most of the academic commun~ty.
725:1011	History.
726:1011	There have been a number of activities within the NRC in the last ten years which relate to computer science and engineering, most recently the Computer Science and Engineering Board (CSEB).
727:1011	The CSEB was in existence from 1968 to 1972, chartered to assess the implications of information performing technology with regard to the public and private sectors of the United States.
728:1011	The National REsearch Council generally operates by performing studies under contract to various Federal groups, and occasionally undertakes similar studies on its own initiative; there have been no studies primarily related to information processingsince the termination of the CSEB.
729:1011	While the Academies have approximately n dozen computer scientists and engineers as members, the computer science discipline has not been organizationally recognized outside of existing groups in mathematics and engineering.
730:1011	Meeting agenda.
731:1011	At its recent first meeting, the Computer Science Planning Group undertook a general discussion of areas which would be candidates for NRC attention, including (1) the impact of computers on soclety, (2) computer engineering, (3) computer science, and (4) the commercial impact of computer technology.
732:1011	Reports will be produced in these areas by early 1976.
733:1011	Outlook for a permanent group While there is apparently no consensus in the Group on how to proceed, it appears highly likely that a recommendation will be forthcoming to set up a permanent computer science group within the NRC; the principal unresolved questions relate to the structure of such a group.
734:1011	There are presently three other groups proceeding in parallel with the AMPS group, each of which will ultimately produce a report recommending NRC activities in this field, these are the Assembly of Engineering, the Assembly of Behavorial and Social Sciences, and the Connnission on Sociutczhniciil Systems.

740:1011	The scrvico is cl;~imcd to provide high quality and reliability, primarily by simultnneous transmission of data by undersca cable and satellite.
741:1011	Thc FCC approval is for one year of operation, within whicli IDDS must submit an analysis af its service.
742:1011	IDDS will be required to submit a t:~riff proposal before beginning service, based on transmission speed (from 50 hits to 9.6 kilobits per second), transmission volumc and other f:ictors.

744:1011	ITT Domcstic Transmission Systems has filed an application with thc I:CC nsking for approval of a domestic data commu~iicntions network.
745:1011	Thc proposed scrvice, to be known as Corn-Pak, is a packet-switched system which woul'd be cap.lble of servicing incompatible computers and computer terminals.
746:1011	The network would initially serve 13 cities by 1977, eventually expnnding to 24 cities.
747:1011	Like other value-added carriers (e.g. , Telenet) Com-Pak would rely on circuits leased frum common carriers.
748:1011	While computer-related transmissions on the network will generally be immeditite, a delayed-transmission service (at a lawer price) will also be available to customers for'applications such as word processing.
749:1011	Related issues.
750:1011	ITT World Comunications has bpposed the FCC authori:ation of IDDS, arguing that the FCC should conduct a techaicill inquiry on optimum methods for international digitnl data services, before g~xnting the IDDS application.
751:1011	On a separate topic, Western Union and other carriers have petitioned the United States Court of Appeals in Washington to reverse FCC approval of the proposed CML data communications satellite venture (Washington Report, 11/75), asserting that it would have monopolistic effect (such as dividing the market for satellite data communications between ATET and CMI,).
752:1011	The petitioning firms feel the monopoly conditions which might exist subsequent to CML entry into the market could not be reversed by antitrust regulation or litigation.
753:1011	COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY EFTS SURVEY While the EFTS Comission continues to organize, a recent survey released by Comptroller of the Currency, James E. Smith, indicates the extent and distribution of existing EFTS systems.
754:1011	According tb Smith: The survey, which had a response rate of 97 percent of 4,700 national banks, showed that fully 10 percent of the banks had at least one Automated Teller Machine.

821:1011	11, No. 2 February, 1976 WASHINGTON DEVEMPMENTS PRESIDBNT FORD PROPOSES RED INCREASES IN FY 1977 BUDGET Gi~e~.alZ RKD budget incrcasee.
822:1011	The $395 billion budget which President Ford has submitted to the Congress for fiscal ycar 1977 (FY 77) contains resenrch nnd dcvelopment (RED) obligations of $24.7 billion.
823:1011	While this is an 11\ increase in obsolute dollars over FY 76, real expenditures (aftor inflation) will remain about constant.
824:1011	Ilowever, even constant RED funding represents a significant priority, considering that the overall budget represents a $28 billion "reduction" fron the ordinary growth of the Federal budget from $370 billion in FY 76 to $423 billion in FY 77, and that RED is within the 25% of the total budget which is considered "discretionary" (i.e. , the remaining 75% is committed to prior obligations in varhus Federal benefit programs).
825:1011	Brcqkdm for ovemll RKD funding.
826:1011	Of the overall RGD budget, approximately $16 billion will be devoted to development (up 11% from FY 76), $6 billion to applied research (up 7%] an$ $3 billion to basic research [up 11% see chart 1).
827:1011	The budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF) was increased more than the average with an increase of 16% in overall RED to $726 million in N 77, and an increase of 20% in basic research.
828:1011	According to NSF, these increases reflect "the importance that the Administration attaches to basic research, and the fact that a very large proportion [86%] of the NSF budget is devoted to basic research".
829:1011	The Department of Defense share of the overallR&D budget will remain constant, at about 50% (see chart 2).
830:1011	llithin the NSF budget, approximately 75% is directed toward colleges and universities; the proposed FY 77 increases would result in an 18% increase in NSF research support activities in colleges and universities (see charts 5 G 41.
831:1011	Iqct on agencies funding computer research.
832:1011	The anticipated FY 77 budget for the Computer Science Section in NSF is $15.8 million, an increase of 26% over the FY 76 budget of $12.5 million.
833:1011	Mr. Kent Curtis, director of the Section, feels that computer science has fared well within NSF, ~ot 0nl.y because of steady RED budget increases in the past, but because of a shift of funding toward computer science, giving the Section an increase substantially larger than the overall NSF increase.
834:1011	The Information Processing Techniques Office in the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is anticipated to hove an FY 77 budget of $37.7 million, a 6% increase over FY 76.
835:1011	In FY 77, ARPA will have substantially reduced expenditures in its progrms relating to the ILLIAC IV, and the ARPANET (which is now treated as an operational network under the Defense Communications Agency).
836:1011	The budget of the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology in the National Bureau of Standards will remain essentially unchanged in FY 77, at $8.5 million.
837:1011	Congressional debate.
838:1011	The President's proposed budget must now go through Congressional hearings and modifications, before enactment.

845:1011	There is little disphte regarding the actual functions of the device; the argument is focused primarily on whether such functions should be characterized as data communications or data processing The fundamental issues, however, are (1) whether the data services embodied in the Dataspeed 40 should be subject to government regulation, and (2) whether a government-regulated monopoly (ATBT) should be allowed td manufacture such terminals and thus compete with the private enterprise computer industry.
846:1011	The Dataspeed 40 is a 1920 character CRT terminal and standard teletypewriter keyboard, with optional features for functions such as printing and editing.
847:1011	The computef industry opponents to AT&T all cite a 1956 consent decree which prohibits AT&T from entering an unregulated industry; further, they refer to the FCC "Computer Inquiry", which ruled that cdrmnon carriers may provide data processing services only through unregulated subsidiaries.
848:1011	The terminal manufacturers fear that the Dataspeed 40 will be priced below their competitive offerings, through cross-subsidies from othar ATGT services.
849:1011	SENATOR BYRD URGES MORATORIUM ON EXPORT OF M)hIPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO U. S .S .R'.
850:1011	In a December 18 speech (#) on the Senate floor, Sen. Robert Byrd called for a moratorium on the export of computer technology to the Soviet Union.
851:1011	He recommended that the Departments of State and Commerce take immediate steps to institute a program to reassess technology export, and to evaluate U.S. gains and losses in technology currently exchanged.
852:1011	Byrd argued that the export of.
853:1011	computer technology potentially threatens peace, rather than promotes it.
854:1011	He noted that "filhe United States has a universally unquestioned superiority in this field . . .
855:1011	From the standpoint of tefense, the edge in military potential that the United States has enjoyed is due, in large part, to our application of computer technology to military weaponry".
856:1011	Bryd described American intelligence reports that the Soviets had been acquiring computers which can be applied to military technology, and that $500 milllm worth of such equipment was acquired from the United States last year.
857:1011	IBM AND PARTNERS PROPOSE SATELLITE BUSINESS SYSTEMS IBM, Comsat and Aetna Insurance have proposed a $250 million network for satellite transmission of voice and data communications, to the Federal Communications Cdnunission (FCC).
858:1011	The new venture, Satellite Business Systems (SBS), would be equally owned by the three uartnere, thereby meeting earlier FCC restrictions on ownership (Washington Report, 11/73)).
859:1011	The network will be entirely digital, utilizing time division multiplexing.
860:1011	The satellites will transmit to rooftop receiving stations at or near customer sites, with ground communications (SBS or other) to points which could not support their own receivers.
861:1011	Access ports wilI be compatible with industry standards, in accord with SBS's stated policy of nondiscrimination in interconnection.
862:1011	OTA CREATES HIGH-LEVEL SCIENCE ADVISORY GROUP The Congressional Office of Tethnology Assessment (OTA) has organized an advisary panel on research and development policies, according to a recent issue of Science 8 buement.Rsport.
863:1011	The panel was sai'd to be organized in mid-1975; it was therefore not intended to overlap with the Administration's advisory groups which are plsnning for the new Presidential science adviser (Washington Report, 1/76).
864:1011	The OTA panel, in contrast to the Presidential advisory groups, is largely composed of academicians, including Jerome IVicsner (president, MIT and President Kennedy's science.adviser) and Donald Hornig (president, Brown University and President Johnson's science adviser).
865:1011	Two panel members are closely re1;lted to information processing: Lewis Branscomb (vice president and chief scientist, IBM) and Herbert Simon (CarneigeMellon University).
866:1011	Branscomb is one of the few members belonging to both the OTA group and the Presidential advisory groups; he will head a special study on applicatlons of science and technology.
867:1011	The panel is funded to October, 1977 at a level of $925 thousand.

879:1011	The Advisory Group, in planning for the establishment of a Presidential science adviser (Waehington Report, 12/75), is presently attempting to identify primary science policy issues.
880:1011	In describing the prospective office of the science adviser, Branscomb said that the office will be more open; he further indicated that economic issues will receive higher priority than with the predecessor office (the Office of Sciehce and Technology) and that cownerical technology will receive greater attention.
881:1011	He also noted the particular interest shown by Dr. Simon Ramo, chairman of the Advisory Group, in the application of computer technology to increase productivity.

893:1011	11, No. 3 March, 1976 AFIPS WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING On February 5, 1976, senior officials of AFIPS and its constituent societies were givenaYIhite House briefing on Federal government matters of particular relevance to the information processing comunity.
894:1011	The brienng was presented by Executive Branch spokesmen from the White House as well as from the various Federal agencies cognizant of the subject areas addressed, and was arranged through the White House OfEce of Public Liaison.
895:1011	The specific topics briefed,were selected on the basis of an advance poll taken of the AFIPS attendees.
896:1011	The material presented at the briefing, because of its general interest to AFIPS beyond the audience which could be accomodated in the Yihite House Family Theater, is described at length below.
897:1011	OFFICE OF TELECOWNICATIONS POLICY.
898:1011	John Eger, Acting Director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP), began the briefing by describing the mandate of his office to formulate policy on the relationship between the Government and private sectors in telecommunications.
899:1011	Characterizing the Federal government as a primary telecommunications user (a $50 miIlion capital investment, with annual expenditures of $10 $15 billion), Eger raised two fundamental question:.
900:1011	First, when should the Federal government provide its own computer communications, and when should it rely on the private sector?
901:1011	While the Federal government must be careful not to overburden existing common carriers, he said, it should leave as much as possible to the private sector and not become a competitor with it.
902:1011	Second, what is the proper role of the Federal government in regulation of computer conununications?
903:1011	OTP has generally been an advocate of minimal government regulation (Washington Report, 8/75), ahd is presently developing this policy in three areas: data communications, EFTS, and privqcy.
904:1011	Eger described OTP's systematic review of regulatory legislation, and their efforts to eliminate govement regulation where possible.
905:1011	Roland Homet, Chief of the Studies and Analysis Section af OTP, reviewed the OTP analysis of computer communications regulatory questions now before the Federal Communications Colmission (FCC).
906:1011	Homet noted the earlier FCC "Computer Inquiry" which distinquished between data communications and data processing, ruling that the FCC would regulate the former but not the latter; he further noted that the same fundamental distinction is now at issue in both the controversey between Telenet and p-mshare (Washington Report, 11/75), and the &aspeed 40 tariff now pending before the FCC (Washington Report, 2/76).
907:1011	He went on, however, to artirulate the critical issue underlying these controversies: should the provision of these services and goods, however they are characterized, be,subject to government regulation at all?
908:1011	While it is, true that the data communications and data processing technologies are becoming increasingly integrated, the most crucial question is whether the markets they address display the "natural monopoly" conditiqns which have traditionally been the justification for Federal economic regulation.
909:1011	aTP has formally taken the position that both the sbrvices of value-added carriers (e.g. , Telenet), and the manufacture of tenninal equipment (e.g. , the Dataspeed 40) should be deregulated.
910:1011	Charles Joyce (now OTP Special Assistant for National Security Activities and formerly Assistant Director for Government Conununications) discussed issucs relating to the Federal government as a user of computer communications.
911:1011	raising two primary is? ~cs.
912:1011	First, as the Government continues to develop networks fcr what have tradition 11ly been viewed as government services (e.g. , networks for biomedical communic;~Lions, or scientific and technical information services), when docs the Government cease providing a legitimate Federal service and begin to infringe on services .ihich should be provided by the private sector?
913:1011	Second, how Is the Pcdera1 government to treat privacy and security in its computer comm~~chtions systems?
914:1011	Joyce described the primary policy factors to be balanced as the need for privacy and security in computer networks, and the competing pressure for the cfficicnces to be achieved in nctworki~ig and resource sharing.
915:1011	Ife cite3 security tcchnology as a pdssible solution, but onewhich requires a substantial technical basis.
916:1011	Joyce called for assistance on this question from societies such as AFIPS, to suppacmont the expcrtisc OTP prcscntly draws from its own staff as voll as that of the Wllitc llouse Office of hlan;~gmment and Budget, the Nationol Bureau of St;u~Jnrds and the Cencra'l Serviccs Administration.
917:1011	Tom Keller, OTP General Counsel, addressed OTP activities related to the area of privacy.
918:1011	In addition to describing the general Federal interest in this area (e.g. , the Privacy and EFTS Commissions) he pointed out the VIP studies on current legal protections related to individual policy (by Prof. Grecnaxalt of Columbia University Law School) and on the social implications of EFTS (by Prof. Rule of SUNY).
919:1011	kellcr indicated that OTP is undertaking a follow-up study on the threats to privacy which may bc posed by a comprehensive EFT system.
920:1011	O'rP is particularly concerned about information collected by the Federal government, in that such information can (in distinction to the private sector) be compelled by legal process Kcller emphasized the OTP position that private sector costs for enforcement of privacy legislation such as H.R. 1984, and private sector alternatives to Federal government privacy protections, should be fully examined before any related Federal action is taken; ho specifically called for any empirical data which may be provided by AFIPS on the compliance costs of Federal privacy legislation.
921:1011	In closing, Mr. Bger extcidcd an invitation for AI:IPS to continue an opcn dialogue with OT9, on questions of comnputer communications.
922:1011	'me future of computer co~a~unications, he said, will dcpund I~cnvily on actions tokc11 by the Pedcml govcriimcnt, ;inJ thcso actions will in turn depend on the q~rillity and impact of this dialo~ue.
923:1011	TBCWOGY TRRNSFER IN INFORITION PROCESSING.
924:1011	Arthur Downey, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East-West Trade, began his remarks with a dcscriptioii of the co~nplcx F~deral regulatory structure, relating to the export of computer technology.
925:1011	This structure is basically tripartite, with the State Department playing a role under the blutual Security Act of 1954, the Commerce Department playing the largest role (in terms of implementation].
926:1011	under the Export Administration Act of 1969, and the Defense Department playing a major policy role as required by the same 1969 statute [the Pentagon has virtually a veto power over exports relnted to national security].
927:1011	In addition, the Trade Act of 1975 has created an oversight board for monitoring the flow of technology to socialist countries, to be known as the East-Nest Foreign Trade Board.
928:1011	Downey described "national security" controls as having the heaviest impact on the export &advanced technology to socialist countries, while adding that "foreign policy" controls may also play a role in the export of technology to specific countries (e.g. , Angola).
929:1011	While there are several working levels of control, the highest is at the cabinet level in the Export Administration Review bard, which is comprised of the Secretaries of State and Defense, who will soon be joined by the Secretary of the Treasury as well.
930:1011	aile most products are exported under a "general license" (which must be obtained only once'.lior a category of products), high technology products such as computers move under "special licenses," which must be obtained for each specific shipment.
931:1011	While not defining the terms specifically, Downey said that "scientific and educational technologyt1 is allowed to transfer,freely to all countries.
932:1011	"Industrial data" is generally allowed to move to the non-co~mnunist "free world" on the theory that the U.S. is advantaged by this flow of technology to our allies; the same technology however, when exported to communist countries, is very tightly controlled.
933:1011	In granting special licenses, several factors ara considered: (1) thc strategic or military impact of the product, (2) the end user, (3) the end use (and whether the computer system at issue is appropriately scaled to this use), and (4) the risk of diversion of the export to other users.
934:1011	The U.S. cooperates in this program of export control with its 13 NATO allies and Japan in a group called the Coordinating Committee (COCOM), which maintains an International Commodity List of items which are banned from export to social t countries.
935:1011	In particularly difficult or disputed applications for computer export licenses, the Commerce Department will establish a task force with other qgencies to examine critical factors; they often draw upon the Institute for Computer Sciences and Technology at the National Bureau of Standards, which Dswney described as a "highly respected, talented group".
936:1011	In addition, the Department has organized several technical advisory cmittees in areas such as computers and computer peripherals, to assist it in arriving at the U.S. position on export controls in the national and international contexts.
937:1011	Downey noted as particularly difficult problems (1) assessing the risks in allowing export of training and software associated with computer sales, and (2) assessing the appropriateness of systems for particular applications.
938:1011	While describing the present system as a workable one, Downey acknowledged the competing pressures from industry to relax export controls to a more "realistic" level, and from Congress, which is generally not sympathetic to decontrol of high technology exports.
939:1011	RESEARCH AND DEVEWPMENT IN INFORMATION PROCESSING.
940:1011	The research and development (RED) area was addressed in preseqtations from the two largest funding organizations of computer R&D in the Federal government, the National Science Foundation (NSF) which has a proposed budget of $15.8 million in fiscal year 1977 (FY 77) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which has a proposed FY 77 budget 6f $37.7 million.
941:1011	NSF.
942:1011	Dr. John Pasta, Director of the Division of Mathematical and Computer Sciences in NSF, described the agency's computer science budget for FY 77 in the contextaf the overall RED budget proposed by President Ford (similar figures have been described in the February Washington Retort) Pasta noted that overall R&D has declined about 30% (in 1967 dollars) from 1967 to 1975, but that research alone had remained about constant.
943:1011	In the proposed FY 77 budget, however, computer research funding is up 26% over FY 76 [an increase on the order of 15% over FY 76, even considering inflation].
944:1011	Pasta pointed out that NSF 'and AKPA will remain, under the proposed FY 77 budget, the primary contributors of Federal support for research in computer science at universities and colleges.
945:1011	The specific amounts are (in $ millions): Actual Estimated Estimated FY 75 FY 76 FY 77 NSF 8.3 9.8 13.9 ARPA 13.4 12.0 14.2 Pama also described in detail the allocation of RGD funds within the Computer Scicnce Scction in NSF for FY 77 (in $ nillions): Prbgram Acatual Estimated Estin1:ited Title FY 75 FY 76 1:Y 77 --Theoretical Computer 2.13 2.35 2.65 Science Software.

947:1011	Col. David Russell, Director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) in the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) outlined the general operations and specific program of his office.
948:1011	He describes the charter of ARPA to be working at the forefront of emerging technology, and he emphasized that ARPA is involved only in basic and exploratory research oriented toward the missions of the Department of Defense.
949:1011	ARPA endeavors to avoid research areas being addressed by industry, and will withdraw from a research area if it appears that the problem will bd solved through industrial research.
950:1011	Russell gave the following outline for proposed IPM research in FY 77 (the initial numbers correspond to standard Department of Defense research categories and the italicized categories are explained in greater detail below): 6.1 Bash research in computer and comnications sciences ($17.2 million) 6.2 Exploratory development Distributed .inforrmtiot~ systems ($11.0 million) Integmted comnd and control, and oommunicntiom systems ($9.5 million) Basic research in computer and comications sciences ($17.2 million).
951:1011	IPlU undertakes research in three areas: Imge understanding ($3.0 million).
952:1011	IPTO is departing from trnditional numerical processing of images, and moving into symbolic processing techniques adopted from the field of artificialintelligence.
953:1011	InteZZigent systems ($8.4 million).
954:1011	ARPA will continue its long-standing effort in this area (it has funded approximately 75% of all artificial intelligence research).
955:1011	The agency will focus on three areas: (1) "basic" artificial intelligence, including problem solving, natural language processing and general reasoning, (2) command and control applications, e.g., a natural language frontend processor, and an intelligent distributed data base system,,and (3) the use of intelligent terminals to help solve the manlmachine interface problem.
956:1011	Advquced memory technology ($4.8 million).
957:1011	This is a new effort for ARPA beginning in P 76, co isting of a study of hardware available to support very large (13' to lo9' bits) memories in the 1990ts, such as archival beam memories, and a related study of artificial intelligence techniques useful in manipulating very large data bases, such as inference and text summarizing.
958:1011	Distributed informtion systems ($11.0 million).
959:1011	Sofwre technology ($5.0 million).
960:1011	This research wiLl emphasize the increasing expense, and increasing reliability problems oE software.
961:1011	Speech processing ($4.1 million).
962:1011	This research represents the last year of ARPA's five.year program in computer understanding of continuous speech (presently feasible only at 100 times real time) and packet speech transmission (which would enable the ARPANET, for example, to transmit both.
963:1011	speech and digital information).
964:1011	Netuork and system security ($1.1 million).
965:1011	This work will address the problems inherent in the military multilevel classification systems, both from a design and certification standpoint.
966:1011	Integrated connnand and control, and conminicatdons systems ($9.5 million).
967:1011	Russell cited two examples of programs: Packet radio.
968:1011	A distributed net of miniprocessors connected by radio links capable of transmitting data at rates from 100 to 400 Kb/sec.
969:1011	will be investigated.
970:1011	Internetting studies.
971:1011	This program will focus on how to connect dipferent networks through various gateway schcmes and internetwork protocols, as well a$ how to integrate wire, radio and satellite packet networks.
972:1011	AFIPS COMMFNTS.
973:1011	AFIPS President Anthony Ralston closed the discussion by calling on AFIPS and its constituent societies to continue the dialogue undertaken in the briefing.
974:1011	This dialogue consists, he noted, not only of obtaining and disseminating information about Washington, but also ol the important task of providing tcchnological input to tho Federal government whore needed.
975:1011	PRIVACY COhBIISSION TOLD CREDIT CARD DATA AVAILABLE ~I>VES'TIGA'fOKS -.
976:1011	The Privacy Protcction Study Conunission was told in February hearings in New York that credit card companies routinely supply information about ~ustomcr transactidns to invest'igators, in some cases without a court order and without the customer's knowledge.
977:1011	Officials of American Express testified that the company supplied information lost year in response to about 500 subpoenas (i.e. , court orders), to Federa; agoncies and private attorneys.
978:1011	The company had not pruviously notified its customers of such Jisclosures,althouyh it announced thnt it would do so in the future, except in some felony investigations.
979:1011	Bank of America also testified that it releases customer records under subpoena, but that it notifies its customers as required by applicable (California) state law.
980:1011	Both ATET and Hertz said that they had, in certain cases, released customer records to the Federal government without being compelled by subponea.
981:1011	96 EPTS COMMISSION HOLDS INITIAL MEETING The EFTS Commission held its first meeting in Washington on February 6.
982:1011	While the Commission agreed that its primary concern would be "the broad public policy issues of EFTS" (in contrast to technical issues) the majority of the meeting was devoted to organizational matters.
983:1011	The most substantive aspect of the meeting was a discussion of the proposed amendments to Federal Reserve Regulation J, which would define the duties and liabilities of participants in the Federal Reserve's wire transfer and automated payment services, and the proposed rules for access to the Federal Reserve's electronic clearing, settlement and delivery services (automrlted clearinghouses).
984:1011	Both the Regulation J amendments and the interim guidelines for access [XI are subject to public comment until March 19.
985:1011	The Comission debated whether it should devote its resources to such interim comments on immediate issues, or whether it should work primarily toward a comprehensive report; agreement could not be reached and the matter was postponed for further discussion at the next Commission meeting (scheduled for March 12).
986:1011	The Commission indicated it would fully exploit existing EFTS research (Chairman Widnall noted in particular the Arthur D. Little study funded by the National Science Foundation, "The Consequences of Electronic Funds Transfer").
987:1011	The Commission staff has been directed to prepare a summary of the current status of EFTS within 60 days; the report is to "bring together the results from early research, both quantitative and qualitative, and to provide beginnings of a data base for the Commission's inquiry".
988:1011	Preparation of the report will draw upon government resources as well as independunt organizations puch as AFIP~ . Single copies of the Arth D. Little study may be obtained by writing to: NSF/RANN Document Center, Room 1241; 1800 G Street, N.W., Washington, D. C. 20550.
989:1011	PRIVACY COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ON TAX RETURN CONFIDENTIALITY The Privacy Comission will meet in Washington on March 11 and 12, primarily ro discuss the Commission's proposed recommendations on Federal tax return confidentiality.
990:1011	The Commission published the draft reconunendations on February 13, allowing only ten working days for written public comment.
991:1011	The recommendations (#) would amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide that the Internal Revenue Service may disclose returns to Federal and state agencies only with prior written consent to the taxpayer, except for disclosures to the Bureau of the Census for statistical purposes, to state tax agencies (under certain restrictive conditions), to the Department of Justice (in some cases without a warrant), and to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare for use in certain welfare programs.
992:1011	NEWS BRIEFS Both the Commerce Department (Deputy Assistant Secretary Arthur Downey) and the Computer and Bus5ness Equipment Manufacturers Assqciation differ with Sen. Byrd's statement (Washington Report, 2/76) that $500 million worth of computer equipment w&s exported to the Soviet Union last year; Commerce estimates the figure to be about $5 million, while CBEMA puts it at $3.5 million.
993:1011	The Federal Cbnaunications Commission (FCC) Common Carrier Bureau has ordered AT&T to delay implementation of its Dataspeed 40 tariff (Washington Report, 2/76) until March 3, while the Commission further explores the issues involved.
