The second perspective copes with incomplete knowledge of language use by exploiting the general technique of fitted parsing provided by the system fi)r handling ill-formed inpnt (Jensen et al.19831. Dictionary definitions are quite often fl)rnmlated as condensed fragments of real texts, with elidcd elements which make the definition syntactically ill-formed and interpretable only by reference to a wider context.

In this paper, we will focus on analyzing the definitions not for the genus terms, but for the semantic relations that can be extracted from the differentiae (Calzolari 1984).

Also, these semantic frames represent the appropriate level of semantic information that is needed by a semantic component that has the task of resolving the ambiguities remaining after a syntactic component has assigned an initial analysis (,see Jensen & Binot 1987, Vanderwende 1990).

Although many have accepted the use of syntactic analyses for this purpose for some time now (for example Jeosen and Binot 1987, Klavans 1990, Ravin 1990, and Vanderwende 1990, all of which use the PLNLP F~lglish Parser to provide the structural information), many others still do not.
