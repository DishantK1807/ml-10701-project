We report results on the Boston University (BU) Radio Speech Corpus (Ostendorf et al., 1995) and Boston Directions Corpus (BDC) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), two publicly available speech corpora with manual ToBI annotations intended for experiments in automatic prosody labeling.

The best prosodic label sequence is then, L∗ = argmax L nproductdisplay i P(li|Φ) (6) To estimate the conditional distribution P(li|Φ) we use the general technique of choosing the maximum entropy (maxent) distribution that estimates the average of each feature over the training data (Berger et al., 1996).

We condition prosody not only on word strings and their parts-of-speech but also on richer syntactic information encapsulated in the form of Supertags (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).

Prosody labeling on spontaneous speech corpora like Boston Directions corpus (BDC), Switchboard (SWBD) has garnered attention in (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Gregory and Altun, 2004).

Automatic prosody labeling has been achieved through various machine learning techniques, such as decision trees (Hirschberg, 1993; Wightman and Ostendorf, 1994; Ma et al., 2003), rule-based systems (Shimei and McKeown, 1999), bagging and boosting on CART (Sun, 2002), hidden markov models (Conkie et al., 1999), neural networks (Hasegawa-Johnson et al., 2005),maximum-entropy models (Brenier et al., 2005) and conditional random fields (Gregory and Altun, 2004).
P04-1086
In addition to the POS tags, we also annotate the utterance with Supertags (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).
