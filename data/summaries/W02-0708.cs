Nespole evaluations so far show a loss of cross-site reliability: intra-site evaluations are noticeably better than cross-site evaluations, as reported in (Lavie et al., 2002).

Interlinguas based on domain actions contrast with interlinguas based on lexical semantics (Dorr, 1993; Lee et al., 2001; Goodman and Nirenburg, 1991).

Language-independence of the Nespole interlingua: We do not have a numerical measure of language-independence, but we note that interlinguas based on domain actions are particularly suitable for avoiding translation mismatches (Dorr, 1994), particularly headswitching mismatches (e.g., I just arrived and Je vient dâ€™arriver where the meaning of recent past is expressed by an adverb just or a syntactic verb vient (venir)).

The C-star II database tagged with C-star II interlingua had a notag rate of 7.3% (Levin et al., 2000a).

The measure of success for the domain-action basedinterlingua(asdescribedin(Levinetal., 2000a)) is that (1) it covers the data in the Cstar II database with less than 8% no-tag rate, (2) inter-coder agreement across research sites is reasonably high: 82% for speech acts, 88% for concepts, and 65% for domain actions, and (3) end-to-end translation results using an analyzer and generator written at di erent sites were about the same as end-to-end translation results using an analyzer and generator written at the same site.

Experiments at the end of C-star II showed that cross-site evaluations were comparable to intra-site evaluations (analyzer and generator written at the same site) (Levin et al., 2000b).

We have, however, conducted crosssite evaluations (Lavie et al., 2002), in which the analyzer and generator were written at di erent sites.
