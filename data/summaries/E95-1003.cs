This is quite feasible using statistical taggers like those of Garside (1987), Church (1988) or Foster (1991) which achieve performance upwards of 97% on unrestricted text.

These measures have, in fact, been used previously in measuring term recognition (Smadja, 1993; Bourigault, 1994; Lauriston, 1994).
