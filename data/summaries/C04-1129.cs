Nenkova and McKeown (2003) avoided including parentheticals due to both the unavailability of fast and reliable identi cation and attachment of appositives and relative clauses, and theoretical issues relating to the selection of the most suitable parenthetical unit in the new summary context.

cation and Clustering We use SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999) for sentence clustering and its similarity metric to evaluate cluster quality; SimFinder outputs similarity values (simvals) between 0 and 1 for pairs of sentences, based on word overlap, synonymy and n-gram matches.

Lin (2003) concluded that pure syntaxbased compression does not improve overall summarizer performance, even though the compression algorithm performs well at the sentence level.

The experiments in Lin and Hovy (2003) show that among n-gram approaches to scoring, Rouge-1 (based on unigrams) has the highest correlation with human scores.

Chandrasekar et al.(1996) viewed text simpli cation as a preprocessing tool to improve the performance of their parser.

Since then, Jing (2000), Riezler et al.(2003) and Knight and Marcu (2000) have explored statistical models for sentence shortening that, in addition, aim at ensuring grammaticality of the shortened sentences.

Metric We evaluated our summarizer on the DUC test sets using the Rouge automatic scoring metric (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

Recently, Lin (2003) showed that statistical sentence-shortening approaches like Knight and Marcu (2000) do not improve content selection in summaries.

We automatically post-edited our summaries using a modi ed version of the module described in Nenkova and McKeown (2003).

We then cluster the simpli ed sentences with SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999).

We made use of two empirical observations made by Nenkova and McKeown (2003) based on human summaries: a rst mention is very likely to be modi ed in some way (probability of 0.76), and subsequent mentions are very unlikely to be postmodi ed (probability of 0.01 0.04).
