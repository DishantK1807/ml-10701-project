Morphological Tagging English Part of Speech (POS) tagging has been widely described in the recent past, starting with the (Church, 1988) paper, followed by numerous others using various methods: neural networks (Julian Benello and Anderson, 1989), HMM tagging (Merialdo, 1992), decision trees (Schmid, 1994), transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), and maximum entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), to select just a few.

This is the way the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) runs if one uses the binary version from the website (see the comparison in Section 5).

There have been attempts to solve this problem for some of the highly inflectional European languages ((Daelemans et al., 1996), (Erjavec et al., 1999), (Tufts, 1999), and also our own in (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1997), (Haji~ and Hladk~, 1998), see also below), but so far no method nor a tagger has been evaluated against a larger number of those languages in a similar setting, to allow for a side-byside comparison of the difficulty (or ease) of full morphological tagging of those languages.

We have chosen the Maximum Entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) for a comparison with our universal tagger, since it achieved (by a small margin) the best overall result on Slovene as reported there (86.360% on all tokens) of taggers available to us (MBT, the best overall, was not freely available to us at the time of writing).
