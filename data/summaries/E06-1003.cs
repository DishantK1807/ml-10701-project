(Lin, 1998a) and (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004)) and term categorization (e.g.

A syntactic feature is a pair: (word, syntactic relation) (Lin, 1998a).

Contextual features may be superficial (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) or syntactic (Lin, 1998a), (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004).

Unlike most of theapproacheswhichconsiderpairwisesimilarity between terms ((Cimiano and VÂ¨olker, 2005); (Lin, 1998a)), the Class-Example method considers the similarity between a term ti and a set of training examples which represent a certain class.

(Fleischman and Hovy, 2002).

Feature weights can be calculated either by Machine Learning algorithms (Fleischman and Hovy, 2002) or by statistical measures, like Point Wise Mutual Information or the Jaccard coefficient (Lin, 1998a).

We parsed about half a gigabyte of a news corpus with MiniPar (Lin, 1998b).

The model is inspired by a model presented earlier in (Szpektor et al., 2004), however our model allows more efficient construction of the representation.
