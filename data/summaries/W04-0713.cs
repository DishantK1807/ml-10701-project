es00 resolves IPAs applying Strube’s (1998) algorithm.
P98-2204
Recently two algorithms for resolving APAs and IPAs in specific English dialogues have been proposed: Eckert and Strube’s (2000) es00, Byron’s (2002) phora.

A very different strategy for resolving IPAs and APAs in spoken dialogues is proposed in (Strube and M¨uller, 2003).

We have compared the obtained results with those obtained by testing bfp (Brennan et al., 1987) and str98 (Strube, 1998).

In phora the antecedents of personal pronouns are searched for looking at their degree of salience which is implemented by word order as in (Grosz et al., 1995).

(Grosz et al., 1995), assigns the highest degree of salience to the most known (topical) entities in the discourse model, the second assigns the highest degree of salience to entities in the focal part of utterances in Information Structure terms which, often, represent new information (Hajiˇcov´a et 1dar presupposes that intrasentential anaphors are correctly resolved.

(Grosz et al., 1995), with Hajiˇcov´a et al.’s (1990) salience account which assigns the highest degree of salience to entities in the focal part of an utterance in Information Structure terms.

The reliability for the two annotation tasks (κ-statistics (Carletta, 1996)) was of 0.94 and 0.90 respectively.

Grosz et al.(1995) also suggest that continuing speaking about the same elements in a discourse segment is perceived as more coherent than shifting the focus of attention.
