Amongst the many proposals for distributional similarity measures, (Lin, 1998) is maybe the most widely used one, while (Weeds et al., 2004) provides a typical example for recent research.

For example, the pattern "NP1, a|an NP2", ranked among the top IS-A patterns by (Pantel et al., 2004), can represent both apposition (entailing) and a list of co-hyponyms (non-entailing).

Few recent attempts on related (though different) tasks were made to classify (Lin et al., 2003) and label (Pantel and Ravichandran, 2004) distributional similarity output using lexical-syntactic patterns, in a pipeline architecture.

We 583 also attempted adding Lin's (1998) similarity scores but they appeared to be redundant.

In addition to their use for learning lexical semantic relations, patterns were commonly used to learn instances of concrete semantic relations for Information Extraction (IE) and QA, as in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Yangarber et al., 2000).

used by (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).

Chklovski and Pantel (2004) used patterns to extract a set of relations between verbs, such as similarity, strength and antonymy.

This scheme utilizes the symmetric similarity measure of (Lin, 1998) to induce improved feature weights via bootstrapping.

Accordingly, the extraction module can be 1 NP1 such as NP2 2 Such NP1 as NP2 3 NP1 or other NP2 4 NP1 and other NP2 5 NP1 ADV known as NP2 6 NP1 especially NP2 7 NP1 like NP2 8 NP1 including NP2 9 NP1-sg is (a OR an) NP2-sg 10 NP1-sg (a OR an) NP2-sg 11 NP1-pl are NP2-pl Table 1: The patterns we used for entailment acquisition based on (Hearst, 1992) and (Pantel et al., 2004).

Then, additional cooccurrences of the related terms are retrieved, from which new patterns are extracted (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Pantel et al., 2004).

To obtain sufficient coverage, recent works such as (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) applied pattern-based approaches to the web.

2.2 Pattern-based Approaches Hearst (1992) pioneered the use of lexicalsyntactic patterns for automatic extraction of lexical semantic relationships.

Similar techniques were further applied to predict hyponymy and meronymy relationships using lexical or lexico-syntactic patterns (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Sundblad, 2002), and web page structure was exploited to extract hyponymy relationships by Shinzato and Torisawa (2004).
