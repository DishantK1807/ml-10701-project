We evaluated the performance by using data provided by (Li and Roth, 2002) for English and (Suzuki et al., 2003b) for Japanese question classification and followed the experimental setting used in these papers; namely we use four typical question types, LOCATION, NUMEX, ORGANIZATION, and TIME TOP for JQA, and “coarse” and “fine” classes for EQC.

Unfortunately, experiments have shown that in some cases there is a critical issue with convolution kernels, especially in NLP tasks (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Cancedda et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2003b).

Moreover, we can expand our proposals to hierarchically structured graph kernels (Suzuki et al., 2003a) by using a simple extension to cover hierarchical structures.

Since natural language data take the form of sequences of words, and are generally analyzed using discrete structures, such as trees (parsed trees) and graphs (relational graphs), discrete kernels, such as sequence kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002), tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001), and graph kernels (Suzuki et al., 2003a), have been shown to offer excellent results.

This means a fast calculation technique proposed in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003) can be simply applied to our method, which yields classification very quickly.

Examples include text categorization (Joachims, 1998), chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2001).
