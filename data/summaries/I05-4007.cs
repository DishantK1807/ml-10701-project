In our current line of work, we (Huang et al.2002) refer to low-density languages as those which do not have enough existing resources for semi-automatic construction of monolingual wordnet.

The semantic relation between an English synset and its Chinese translation is based on The English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Database (ECTED, Huang et al.2002). 2.1 The English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Databases (ECTED) The basic idea of ECTED is to provide the Chinese translation equivalents for each APPROACHI Given fully annotated monolingual wordents with synsets and LSRs Fully annotated parallel wordnet APPROACHII Given fully annotated WN of language A; and bilingual translation equivalents annotated with LSR Map LSR-annotated synsets in Language A to Language B through translation LSRs (T-LSRâ€™s) Grow LSR links among Language B synsets by using language A LSR and cross-lingual LSR inference rules Map and pair Language A and Language B synsets with cross-lingual LSRs 49 WN English synset.

However, the construction of multilingual wordnets eventually faces the challenge of low-density languages, which is dealt with in Huang, et al.(2002). Low-density languages, as opposed to high-density languages, usually refer to languages that are not spoken by a large number of people.

Therefore, in order to present such semantic relations clearly and logically, Huang (2002) proposed to use cross-lingual Lexical Semantic Relations (LSRs) to predict the semantic relations in the target language.

Huang et al (2002) claimed that LSR y can be inferred as a functional combination of the three LSRs i, x and ii.
