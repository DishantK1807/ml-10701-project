Some researchers use neural networks in their word sense disambiguation systems Because of its strong capability in classification (Waltz et al., 1985, Gallant, 1991, Leacock et al., 1993, and Mooney, 1996).

These include surrounding words (an unordered set of words surrounding a target word), local collocations (a short sequence of words near a target word, taking word order into account), syntactic relations (selectional restrictions), parts of speech, morphological forms, etc (McRoy, 1992, Ng and Zelle, 1997).
