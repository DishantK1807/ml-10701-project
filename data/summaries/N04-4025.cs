It is also anticipated that incorporating additional methods that account for syntax and discourse turns should further improve the overall performance, see also Serafin et al.(2003). Even with the limitations of the discourse tagging, our LSA-based approach demonstrates it can be applied as a method for doing automated measurement of team performance.

Given the limitations of the manual annotations, the results from the tagging portion of the study are still comparable to other efforts of automatic discourse tagging using different methods and different corpora (Stolcke et al., 2000), which found performance within 15% of the performance of human taggers.

More recently Serafin et al.(2003) used LSA for dialogue act classification, finding that LSA can effectively be used for such classification and that adding features to LSA showed promise.

In addition, LSA has been applied to a number of NLP tasks, such as text segmentation (Choi et al., 2001).
