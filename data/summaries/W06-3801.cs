To learn the parameter weights ¯α, we use a boosting method (Collins and Koo, 2005), which minimizes the following loss function on the training data: ExpLoss(¯α) =summationdisplay i lisummationdisplay j=2 e−(F(xi,1,¯α)−F(xi,j,¯α)) where xi,1 is, without loss of generality, a correct target node.

This hybrid approach has been used successfully in the past on tasks like parsing (Collins and Koo, 2005).

The Cspace corpus has been manually annotated with personal names (Minkov et al., 2005).

Other recent papers have also used walks over graphs for query expansion (Xi et al., 2005; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).

The Cspace corpus contains email messages collected from a management course conducted at Carnegie Mellon University in 1997 (Minkov et al., 2005).

We here give a short overview of the reranking approach, that is described in detail elsewhere (Collins and Koo, 2005).

This reranking approach has been used in the past for metasearch (Cohen et al., 1999) and also several natural3 language related tasks (Collins and Koo, 2005).
