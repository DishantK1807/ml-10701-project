This concept was introduced as lifting in (Kahane et al., 1998).

XDG is a descendant of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), pushing the underlying methodology further by generalizing it in two aspects: number of dimensions: two in TDG (ID and LP), arbitrary many in XDG set of principles: fixed in TDG, extensible principle library in XDG The structure of this paper is as follows: In x2, we introduce XDG and the XDG solver used for parsing and generation.

Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NP-complete problem (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002).

However, XDG of course allows the grammar writer to formulate lexical abstractions using inheritance (like in HPSG) or crossings (Candito, 1996).
