The present paper offers a similarity1With the exception of dependency-grammar-based parsers (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997; Br¨oker et al., 1994; Lesmo and Lombardo, 2000), where functional labels are treated as first-class citizens as relations between words, and recent work on a semi-automatic method for treebank construction (Brants et al., 1997), little has been reported on based algorithm for assigning functional labels such as subject, object, head, complement, etc.

Automatic assignment of function-argument structure has long been recognized as a desideratum beyond pure syntactic labeling (Marcus et al., 1994)1.

Previous applications of 5Memory-based learning has recently been applied to a variety of NLP classification tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase chunking, grapheme-phoneme conversion, word sense disambiguation, and PP attachment (see (Daelemans et al., 1999; Veenstra et al., 2000; Zavrel et al., 1997) for details).

The tree construction level is similar to the DOP approach (Bod, 1998; Bod, 2000) in that it uses complete tree structures instead of rules.
