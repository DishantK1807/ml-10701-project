by Nagata (1994).
C94-1032
The early studies by Nagata and Morimoto (1994) and Reithinger and Maier (1995) showed the possibility of predicting dialogue act tags for next utterances with statistical methods.
C94-1032 P95-1016
Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) showed that prosodic information helps human discourse segmentation.
P96-1038
Previous studies like (Litman and Passonneau, 1995) have pointed out that the use of a multiple information source can contribute to better segmentation and tagging, and so our statistical model integrates linguistic, acoustic and situational information.

Litman and Passonneau (1995) addressed the usefulness of a "multiple knowledge source" in human and automatic discourse segmentation.
P95-1015
Discourse segmentation in linguistics, whether manual or automatic, has also received keen attention because such segmentation provides the foundation of higher discourse structures (Grosz and Sidnet, 1986).
