So far wehave used a weighted string edit distance matcher and experimented with dierent substitution weights including ones based on measures of statistical similaritybetween words such as the one described byPereira et al.(1993). The output of the matcher is a real number (the distance) and a distortion mapping represented as a sequence of edit operations (Wagner and Fischer, 1974).

The recordings are then transcribed and annotated with semantic information relating to the domain;; the transcriptions and annotations can then be used to create a statistical understanding model (Miller et al., 1998) or used as guidance for manual grammar development (Aust et al., 1995).

Our approach thus provides an even more extreme version of automatic con rmation generation than that used byChu-Carroll and Carpenter (1999) where only a small eort is required by the developer.
