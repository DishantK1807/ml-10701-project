Note that this notion of semantic lexicon acquisition is distinct from work on learning selectional restrictions (Manning, 1993; Brent, 1991) and learning clusters of semantically similar words (Riloff and Sheperd, 1997).

Although a few others (Siskind, 1996; Hastings and Lytinen, 1994; Brent, 1991) have presented systems for semantic lexicon acquisition, this work is unique in combining several features.
P91-1027
Manning (1993) and Brent (1991) acquire subcategorization information for verbs.
P91-1027 P93-1032
This work also has ties to the work on automatic construction of translation lexicons (Wu and Xia, 1995; Melamed, 1995; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Catizone et al., 1993: Gale and Church, 1991).
C94-1009 H91-1026 W95-0115
Experiments in this domain were presented in Thompson (1995).
P95-1055
This approach can dramatically reduce the amount of annotated data required to achieve a desired accuracy (Engelson and Dagan, 1996).
P96-1042
