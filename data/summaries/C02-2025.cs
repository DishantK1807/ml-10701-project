Abney (1997) notes important problems with the soundness of the approach when a unification-based grammar is actually determining the derivations, motivating the use of log-linear models (Agresti, 1990) for parse ranking that Johnson and colleagues further developed (Johnson, Geman, Canon, Chi, & Riezler, 1999).

(i) as a derivation tree composed of identifiers of lexical items and constructions used to build the analysis, (ii) as a traditional phrase structure tree labeled with an inventory of some fifty atomic labels (of the type ‘S’, ‘NP’, ‘VP’ et al.), and (iii) as an underspecified MRS (Copestake, Lascarides, & Flickinger, 2001) meaning representation.

Using a pre-existing tree comparison tool in the LKB (similar in kind to the SRI Cambridge TreeBanker; Carter, 1997), annotators can quickly navigate through the parse forest and identify the correct or preferred analysis in the current context (or, in rare cases, reject all analyses proposed by the grammar).

Most probabilistic parsing research – including, for example, work by by Collins (1997), and Charniak (1997) – is based on branching process models (Harris, 1963).

Nevertheless, the naive PCFG approach has the advantage of simplicity, so we pursue it and the tagging approach to parse ranking in these proof-of-concept experiments (more recently, we have begun work on building log-linear models over HPSG signs (Toutanova & Manning, 2002)).

Johnson et al.(1999) estimate a Stochastic Unification Based Grammar (SUBG) using a log-linear model.
