Poesio@ed. ac.uk Abstract we present an implelnented system for processing definite descriptions.
The system is based on the results of a corpus analysis previously reported, which showed how common discourse-new descriptions are in newspaper corpora, and identified several problems to be dealt with when developing computational methods for interpreting bridging descriptions.
The annotated corpus produced in this earlicr work was used to extensively evaluate the proposed techniques for matchiug delinite descriptions with their antecedents, discourse segmentation, recognizing discourse-new descriptions, and suggesting anchors for bridging descriptions.
1 Motivation
In previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we reported the results of corpus annotation experiments in which the subjects were asked to classify lhe uses of delinite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal articles according to a scheme derived from work by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981 ) and including three classes: I)III'~CT ANAPltORA, I)ISCOURSENEW, and I~RIDGING DESCIII'TION (Clark, 1977).
This study showed that about half of the time, delinite descriptions are used to introduce a new entity in the discourse, rather than to refer to an object already mentioned.
We also observed that our subjects didn't always agree on the classification of a given delinite; the problem was especially acute for bridging descriptions.
In this paper, we present an implemented system for processing delinite descriptions based on the resuits of that earlier study.
In our system, techniques for recognising discourse-new descriptions play a role as ilnportant as techniques for identifying the antecedent of anaphoric ones.
The system also incorporates robust techniques for processing bridging descriptions.
A fundamental characteristic of our system is that it was developed so that its perfomlance could be evaluated using the annotated corpus.
In the papm; we discuss how we arrived at the optimal version of the system by measuring the performance of each method in this way.
Because of the problems observed in our previous study concerning agreement between annotators, we evaluated the system both by measnring precision/recall against a 'gold standard' and by meastu'ing the agreement between the annotation it produces and the mmotators.
2 General
Overview At the moment, the only systems engaged in semantic interpretation whose performance can be evaluated on l'aMy unrestricted text such as the Wall Street Journal articles are based on a shallowprocessing approach, i.e., that do not rely on extensive amounts of hand-coded commonsense knowledge (Carter, 1987; Appelt, 1995; Humphreys et al., 1998).
I Our system is of this type: it only relies on structural information, on the infommtion provided by pre-existing lexical sources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), on minimal amouuts of general hand-coded iuformation, and on information that can be acquired automatically from a corpus.
Although we believe that quantitative ewduations of the performance of a systeln on a large number of examples are the only true assessment of its performance, and therefore a shallow processing approach is virtually unavoidable for implemented systems until better sources of commonsense knowledge become available, we do know that this approach lilnits the performance of a system on those instances of definite descriptions which do require commonsense knowledge for their resolution.
(We grouped these in what we call the 'bridging' chtss).
We I Most systems participating in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations are customized to specific donmins by adding hand-coded commonsense knowledge.

Our system attempts to classify each delinitc description as either I)IRIX:T ANAI'ItORA, I)IS('.()UI~,SIT,-NI';W, all(t IgRII)GING I)lv.S(21II'TION.
The lirsl chlss includes deihfite descriptions whose head is identical to thai o1' their antecedent, as in a Iiouse...
lhe house° The second includes del L inile descriptions that refer to objects not alma@ mentioned in the text and,lot rclated to any such object.
(Some of these definite descriptions refer to objects whose existence is widely known, such as discourse-initial references to lhe i)ot;e; other instances of discourse-new descriptions refer to o1:> jects thai can be assumed to bc unique, even if unfa~ miliar, such as lhe.filwl woman lo climb all Scollish Mum'os).
lqnally, we classify as bridging descriptions all dclinitc descriptions whose resolution de-.
pen(Is on knowledge of relalions between objects, such as delinite descriptions thai refer to an object rehlted 1o an entity ah'eady introduced in the dis-com'se by a relation other than identity (Prince's 'inlerrables'), as in the flat.., the living, room; and de/tulle descriptions that refer an object aheady m troduced, but using a different predicate, as in Ihe car...lhe vehicle, hi addition to this chlssiticalion, the system iries to identify the antecedents of anaphoric descriptions and the anchors (Fraurud, 1990) of bridging ones.
Accordingly, we developed three types of heuristics:, for resolving directly anaphoric descriptions.
These iuclude heuristics for dealing with seementation and to handle modificatiou.
• for identifying discourse-new descriptions.
Some of these heuristics attempt to recognize semantically lunctional definite descriptions (Hawkins, 1978; Loebner, 1987), whereas others try to recognize definite descriptions that are anchored via their modification (Clark and Marshall, 1981; Prince, 11981).,, for identifying the anchor of a bridging description and the semantic relation between the bridging description and its anchor.
WordNet is accessed, and heuristics for named entity recognition were also developed.
The final configuration of the system was arrived at on the basis of an extensive ewfluation of the hemislics using Ihe corpus annotated in our previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).
The evaluation was used both io detemfine whMl version o1' each heuristic worked belier, and to identify the best o1", der in which to try them.

be nested (see, e.g., (Rcichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Fox, 1987)).
E.g., in our corpus we found that about 10% of direct anal~horic detinite descriptions have more than one possible antecedent if segmentalion is nol taken into account (Vieira and Poesio, 1999).
Recognizing the hierarchical structure of segments in a text is, howevm; still pretty umch an open problem, kS it involves reasoning about intentions; 2 better results have been achieved on the simpler task of 'chtlnking' the text into approximate segments, generally by means of lexical density measures (Hearst, 1997) In fact, the lnethods Io limit the lifespan of discourse entity we considered for our system were even simplel: One type of heuristics we looked at are window-based techniques, i.e., considering as potential antecedents only the discourse entities within fixed-size windows of previous sentences, allowing however for some discourse entities to take a longer life span: we call this method LOOSE SEGMENTATION.
More specifically, a discourse entity is considered as potential antecedent for a definite 2See, howeve,, (Marcu, 1999).

3.2 Heuristics
for Recognizing Discourse-New Descriptions As mentioned above, a central characteristic of our system is that it also includes heuristics for recognising discourse-new descriptions (i.e., definite descriptions that introduce new discourse entities) on the basis of syntactic and lexical features of the noun phrase.
Our heuristics are based on the discussion by Hawkins (1978), who identified a number of correlations between certain types of syntactic structure and discourse-new descriptions, particularly those that he called 'unfamiliar' definites (i.e., those whose existence cannot be expected to be known ou the basis of generally shared knowledge), including: • the presence of 'special predicates':4 the occurrence of pre-modifiers such as first or best when accompanied with full relatives, e.g., the .\[irs't peJwon to sail to America (Hawkius calls these 'unexplanatory modifiers'; Loebner (1987) showed how these predicates may license the use of definite descriptions in an account of definite descriptions based on functionality); a head noun taking a complement such as the fact that there is li\['e on Earth (Hawkins calls this subclass 'Nt' complements'); • the presence of restrictive modification, as in the inequities of the current land-ownership system.
Our system attempts to recognize these syntactic patterus; in addition, it considers as unfamiliar some definites occurring in 4This list was developed by hand; more recently, Bean and Riloff (1999) proposed methods for autolnatically extracting fl'om a corpus such special predicates, i.e., heads that correlate well with discourse novelty.
• appositive coustructions (e.g., Glenn Cox, the president of Phillips Petroleum Co.); * copular constructions (e.g.,the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named David Dinkins).
In our corpus study (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we found that our subjects did better at ideutifying discourse-new descriptions all together (K=.68) than they did at distinguish 'unfamiliar' from 'larger situation' (Hawkins, 1978) cases (K = .63).
This finding was confirmed by our implementation: although each of the heuristics is designed, in principle, to identify only one of the uses (larger situation or unfamiliar), they work better when used all together to the class of discourse new descriptions.
The overall recall and precision results for the heuristics for identifying discourse new descriptions are shown in Table 3.
In this Table we do not distinguish between the two types of discourse-new descriptions, 'unfamiliar' and 'larger-situation'.
The column headed by (#) represents the number of cases of descriptions classified as discourse new in the standard annotation; + indicates the total number of discourse-new descriptions correctly identified; the nmnber of errors.
These results are for the version of the system (version 1) that uses the best version of the heuristics for dealing with anaphoric descriptions discussed above, and that doesn't attempt to resolve bridging descriptions.

We knew from the start that in general, a system can only resolve certain types of bridging descriptions when supplied with an adequate kuowledge base; in fact, the typical way of implementing a system for resolving bridging references has been to restrict tim domain and feed the system with hand-coded world knowledge (see, e.g., (Siduei; 1979) and especially (Carter, 1987)).
902 Furthermore, the relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex (Clark, 1977; Sidnm; 1979; Prince, 1981; Strand, 1996) and our own results indicate that the stone description may relate to different anchors in a text, which makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).
Nevertheless, we feel that trying to process these definite descriptions is the only way to discover which types of commonsense knowledge are actually needed..
We began by developing a classilication of bridging descriptions according to the kind of information needed to resolve them, rather than on the basis of the possible relations between descriptions and their anchors as usually done in the literature (Vieira, 1998).
This allowed us to get an idea of what types of bridging descriptions our system might be able to resolve.
We classified definite descriptions as follows: • cases based on well-delined lexical relations, such as synonymy, hypernymy and meronymy, that can be found in a lexical database such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)-as in theflat.., lhe living room; • bridging descriptions in which the antecedent is a proper name and the description a common noun, whose resolution requires some way o1' recognizing the type of object denoted by the proper name (as in Bach ...
the composer); • cases in which the anchor is not the head noun but a noun modifying an antecedent, as in the compaw has been selling discount packages ...
the discounts • cases in which the antecedent (anchor) is not introduced by an NP but by a vl', as in Kadane oil is currently drilling two oil wells.
The activity... • descriptions whose the antecedent is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but is implicitly available because it is a discourse topic-e.g., the industo, in a text referring to oil coml)anies; • cases in which the relation with the anchor is based on more general commonsense knowledge, e.g., about cause-consequence relations.
We developed heuristics for handling the first three of these classes: lexical bridges, bridges based on names, and bridges to entities introduced by nonhead nouns in a compound nominal.
We refer the reader to (Vieira, 1998) for discussion of the heuristics for this last class.
Our system attempts to resolve lexical bridges by consulting WordNet to determine if there is a semantic relation between the head noun of the description and the head noun of one of the NI'S in the previous five sentences.
The results of this search for our training corpus, in which 204 descriptions are classified as bridging, are shown in Table 4.
It is interesting to note that the semantic relations found in this automatic semch were not always those observed in our manual analysis.
Bridging Class Synonimy Hyponimy Meronimy Sister Relations Found 11 59 30 Total 106 30 Right % Anchors Right 4 36% 18 30% 2 33% 6 20% 28% Table 4: Ewduation of the search for anchors using WordNet We developed a simple heuristic method for assigning types to named entities.
Our method identitied entity types for 66% (535/814) of all names in the corpus (organizations, persons and locations).
The precision was 95%.
We could have had a better recall if we had adopted more comprehensive lists of cue words, or consulted dictionaries of names as done for the systems participating in MUC-6.
There, recall in the named entity task varies t'rom 82% to 96%, and precision l'rom 89% to 97%.
5 4 Overall Evaluation of the System The order of application of heuristics is as impof tant as the heuristics themselves.
The final order of application was also arrived at on the basis of an extensive evaluation (Vieira, 1998), and is based on the l'ollowing strategy: 6 5A more recent version o1' the system using the named entity recognition software developed by ItCRC for the MUC-7 competition (Mikheev el al., 1999) is discussed in (Isbikawa, 1998).
aWe also attempted to learn the best order of application of the heuristics automatically by means of decision tree learning algorithms (Quinlan, 1993), without however observing a signflicant difference in pcrfommnce.
See (Vieira, 1998) for details.
