(Danieli and Gerbino, 1995) measure the dialogue module's ability to recover from partial failures of recognition or understanding (i.e., implicit recovery) and inappropriate utterance ratio; (Simpson and Fraser, 1993) discuss applying turn correction ratio, transaction success, and contextual appropriateness to dialogue evaluations, and (Hirschman et ah, 1990) discuss using task completion time as a black box evaluation metric.

Evaluation methods independent of dialogue strategy have focused on measuring the extent to which systems for interactive problem solving aid users via log-file evaluations (Polifroni et al., 1992), quantifying repair attempts via turn correction ratio, tracking user detection and correction of system errors (Hirschman and Pao, 1993), and considering transaction success (Shriberg et al., 1992).
