In its emphasis on description-based techniques, our approach shares some fundamental features with the one proposed by Kay (1984), but we use an explicit projection mechanism to separate out and organize the intraand inter-language components.

Although we have split up the different equations among several projections for conceptual clarity, computationally we can consider them to define one big attribute value structure with X and z as special attributes, so the generation problem in this framework reduces to the problem of generating from attribute-value structures which are formally of the same type as f-structures (see Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), Wedekind (1988), and Momma and D6rre (1987) for discussion).

Second, Kaplan (1988) and Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988) discuss other methods for deriving the descriptions necessary to determine these abstract structures.

For example, Kaplan and Maxwell (1988a) exploit this capability to describe semantic structures for coordinate constructions which necessarily contain the logical conjunction appropriate to the string even though there is no reasonable place for that conjunction to be marked in the f-structure.

Let us assume that relative clauses can be analyzed by the following slightly simplified phrase structure rules, making use of functional uncertainty (see Kaplan and Maxwell 1988b for a technical discussion of functional uncertainty) to capture the non-local dependency of the relativized phrase (equations on the head NP are ignored): (12) NP ~ NP S' ( I' RELADJ)= S t ..~ XP S (1' REL-TOPIC) = J, 1' = ~, ( 1` XCOMP* GF) = ~, We can achieve the desired correspondence between the source and the target by augmenting the first rule with the following transfer equations: (13) NP --* NP S ! ( 1` RELADJ) = â€¢ ~( 1` RELADJ) = (z i' RELADJ) z( ~ REL-TOPIC)ffi (~ ~ REL-TOPIC) The effect of this rule is that the ~ value of the relativized phrase (REL-TOPIC) in the source language is identified with the relativized phrase in the target language.

We also achieve modularity of a more basic sort: our correspondence mechanism permits contrastive transfer rules that depend on but do not duplicate the specifications of independently motivated grammars of the source and target languages (Isabelle and Macklovitch, 1986; Netter and Wedekind, 1986).

This approach relies mainly on codescription, and thus it is different from other aFG-based approaches that use a 280description-by-analysis mechanism to relate the f-structure of a source language to the f-structure of a target language (see for example Kudo and Nomura, 1986).

Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), for example, discuss a level of semantic structure that encodes predicate-argument relations and quantifier scope, information that does not enter into the kinds of syntactic generalizations that the f-structure supports.

First, this framework has been generalized to additional kinds of structures that represent other subsystems of linguistic information (Kaplan, 1987; Halvorsen, 1988).
