Carsim (Egges et al., 2001; Dupuy et al., 2001) is a program that analyzes texts describing car accidents and visualizes them in a 3D environment.
W01-1301
We started from a first incomplete model (Dupuy et al., 2001) and we manually constructed the representation of about 50 texts until we had reached a sufficient degree of expressivity.

Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) describe an algorithm to label automatically semantic roles in a general context.
J02-3001
We are implementing and adapting algorithms such as the one described in (Soon et al., 2001) to handle this.

NALIG (Adorni et al., 1984; Manzo et al., 1986) is an early example of them that was aimed at recreating static 2D scenes.
P84-1106
They use the semantic frames and associated roles defined in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and train their classifier on the FrameNet corpus.
