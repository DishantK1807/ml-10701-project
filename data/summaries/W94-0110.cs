Speech Recognition For several years, the best performing speech recognition systems have been based on statistical pattern matching techniques (Pallett et al.1990, Pallett 1991, Pallett et al.1992, Pallett et al.1993, Pallett et al.1994). These models are constrained to various degrees by "knowledge" about speech and language (e.g., the topology of the models, the units modeled, the pronunciations modeled, etc.).

Examples of N-best interfaces include: Veilleux and Ostendorf 1993, Rayner 1994.

As argued in Price and Ostendorf (1994), the increasingly popular classification and regression trees, or decision trees (see, e.g., Breiman et at.

Other systems, however, claim improved performance through the selection of units or combination of units determined automatically or semiautomatically (see, e.g., Bahl et al.1991). â€¢ Language Modeling.

There is also much current work using other pattern matching techniques (see, e.g., Ostendorf and Roukos 1989, Zue et al.1992), including neural network-based approaches (see e.g., Hampshire and Weibel 1990) and hybrid HMM/neural network approaches (see e.g., Abrash et al.1994). One can think of the models as representing the linguistic or other knowledge (e.g., what are the units? how are they determined? what aspects need to be represented explicitly? what features will represent the data?).

Typically, grammars either accept a sentence or reject it, although grammars that degrade more gracefully in the face of spontaneous speech and recognition errors are being developed (see, e.g., Hindle 1992).

The results can be disastrous for applications, since when a recognizer misrecognizes, a common reaction is to hyperarticulate (Shriberg et al 1992).

However, the integration gives rise to some new areas as well: how can an NL component deal with spontaneous speech effects such as false starts and repairs and how can a speech component send information l.o help the NL component (see e.g., Bear et al.19.q2, Shriberg et al.1992), how can techniques from the two component areas be effectively combined, and how can prosodic information be effectively communicated between the two components (see, e.g., Price and Ostendorf 1994 for survey).

Although things are changing rapidly, and many factors will affect just how well a system will perform, examining recent benchmark evaluations can give an idea of the relative difficulty of various aspects of speech (see e.g., Pallett et al.1994). These areas could be those in which increased linguistic knowledge could improve performance.

As argued in Price and Ostendorf (1994), the representatives of knowledge-based approaches and of approaches based on statistical pattern matching may view each other with suspicion -if they are aware of each other's work.

The speech understanding community is quite active in refining evaluation measures and in developing new ones (see e.g., Price et al.1992, Hirschman et al.1993, Dahl et al.1994). because the evaluation measures guide the research directions, it is important to choose the right measures, 82 Discussion and Summary This audience should not require motivation of symbolic and traditionally linguistic knowledge sources, although some may have hesitation about statistically based engineering approaches.

Examples of the use of this tool are numerous: e.g., Hirschberg 1993, Ostendorf and Veilleux 1993, Wang and Hirschberg 1991, and Withgott and Chen 1993.

Although statistical models are far from the only tool for investigating speech and language, as argued in Price and Ostendorf (1994) they do provide several important features: they can be trained automatically, they can provide a systematic way to combine multiple knowledge sources, they can express the more continuous properties of speech and language, they make it easier to deal with large corpora, they provide a means for assessing incomplete knowledge, and they provide a means for acquiring knowledge about speech and language.
