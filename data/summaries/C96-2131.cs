At the first stage the parser constructs fragments containing 'high-l)rnbability' links; as a result, on average 70 80% of all syntactic links of a sentence are established (for details see Mitjushin 1992).

The parser intensively exploits the idea of syntactic preference used in a wide range of systems based on various principles (see, for example, Tsejtin 1975; Kulagina 1987, 1990; Tsujii et al.1988; llobbs and Bear 1990).

In our case, these structures are directed trees whose nodes represent the words of a sentence, and whose arcs are labelled with names of syntactic relations (see Mel'~uk 1974; Mel'~uk and Pertsov 1987; Apresjan et al.1992). The corrector is based on the general idea widely used in this kind of systems: if an input sentence is syntactically ill-formed, i.e. it cannot be assigned a syntactic structure (SyntS), the system considers minimal changes that enable it to construct a SyntS, and presents them as possible corrections (see, for example, Carbonell and Hayes 1983; Jensen et al.1983; Weiscbedel and Sondheimer 1983; Mellish 1989; Bolioli et al.1992). A segment of a sentence is called 'syntactically connected' if a well-formed dependency tree can be constructed on it.
