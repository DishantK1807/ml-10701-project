c©2005 Association for Computational Linguistics Morphology and Reranking for the Statistical Parsing of Spanish Brooke Cowan MIT CSAIL brooke@csail.mit.edu Michael Collins MIT CSAIL mcollins@csail.mit.edu Abstract We present two methods for incorporating detailed features in a Spanish parser, building on a baseline model that is a lexicalized PCFG.
The first method exploits Spanish morphology, and achieves an F1 constituency score of 83.6%.
This is an improvement over 81.2% accuracy for the baseline, which makes little or no use of morphological information.
The second model uses a reranking approach to add arbitrary global features of parse trees to the morphological model.
The reranking model reaches 85.1% F1 accuracy on the Spanish parsing task.
The resulting model for Spanish parsing combines an approach that specifically targets morphological information with an approach that makes use of general structural features.
1 Introduction
Initial methods for statistical parsing were mainly developed through experimentation on English data sets.
Subsequent research has focused on applying these methods to other languages.
There has been widespread evidence that new languages exhibit linguistic phenomena that pose considerable challenges to techniques originally developed for English; because of this, an important area of current research concerns how to model these phenomena more accurately within statistical approaches.
In this paper, we investigate this question within the context of parsing Spanish.
We describe two methods for incorporating detailed features in a Spanish parser, building on a baseline model that is a lexicalized PCFG originally developed for English.
Our first model uses morphology to improve the performance of the baseline model.
English is a morphologically-impoverished language, while most of the world’s languages exhibit far richer morphologies.
Spanish is one of these languages.
For instance, the forms of Spanish nouns, determiners, and adjectives reflect both number and gender; pronouns reflect gender, number, person, and case.
Furthermore, morphological constraints may be manifested at the syntactic level: certain constituents of a noun phrase are constrained to agree in number and gender, and a verb is constrained to agree in number and person with its subject.
Hence, morphology gives us important structural cues about how the words in a Spanish sentence relate to one another.
The mechanism we employ for incorporating morphology into the PCFG model (the Model 1 parser in (Collins, 1999)) is the modification of its part-ofspeech (POS) tagset; in this paper, we explain how this mechanism allows the parser to better capture morphological constraints.
All of the experiments in this paper are carried out using a freely-available Spanish treebank produced by the 3LB project (Navarro et al., 2003).
This resource contains around 3,500 hand-annotated trees encoding ample morphological information.
We could not use all of this information and adequately train the resulting parameters due to limited training data.
Hence, we used development data to test the performance of several models, each incorporating a subset of morphological information.
The highest-accuracy model on the development set uses the mode and number of verbs, as well as the number of adjectives, determiners, nouns, and pronouns.
On test data, it reaches F1 accuracy of 83.6%/83.9%/79.4% for labeled constituents, unlabeled dependencies, and labeled dependencies, respectively.
The baseline model, which makes almost no use of morphology, achieves 81.2%/82.5%/77.0% in these same measures.
We use the morphological model from the aforementioned experiments as a base parser in a second set of experiments.
Here we investigate the efficacy of a reranking approach for parsing Spanish by using 795 arbitrary structural features.
Previous work in statistical parsing (Collins and Koo, 2005) has shown that applying reranking techniques to the n-best output of a base parser can improve parsing performance.
Applying an exponentiated gradient reranking algorithm (Bartlett et al., 2004) to the n-best output of our morphologically-informed Spanish parsing model gives us similar improvements.
Using the reranking model combined with the morphological model raises performance to 85.1%/84.7%/80.2% F1 accuracy for labeled constituents, unlabeled dependencies, and labeled dependencies.
2 Related
Work The statistical parsing of English has surpassed 90% accuracy in the precision and recall of labeled constituents (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak and Johnson, 2005)).
A recent proliferation of treebanks in various languages has fueled research in the parsing of other languages.
For instance, work has been done in Chinese using the Penn Chinese Treebank (Levy and Manning, 2003; Chiang and Bikel, 2002), in Czech using the Prague Dependency Treebank (Collins et al., 1999), in French using the French Treebank (Arun and Keller, 2005), in German using the Negra Treebank (Dubey, 2005; Dubey and Keller, 2003), and in Spanish using the UAM Spanish Treebank (Moreno et al., 2000).
The bestreported F1 constituency scores from this work for each language are 79.9% (Chinese (Chiang and Bikel, 2002)), 81.0% (French (Arun and Keller, 2005), 76.2% (German (Dubey, 2005)), and 73.8% (Spanish (Moreno et al., 2000)).
The authors in (Collins et al., 1999) describe an approach that gives 80% accuracy in recovering unlabeled dependencies in Czech.1 The project that is arguably most akin to the work presented in this paper is that on Spanish parsing (Moreno et al., 2000).
However, a direct comparison of scores is complicated by the fact that we have used a different corpus as well as larger training and test sets (2,800vs.
1,500-sentence training sets, and 700vs.
40-sentence test sets).
1Note that cross-linguistic comparison of results is complicated: in addition to differences in corpus annotation schemes and sizes, there may be significant differences in linguistic characteristics.

For brevity, we only list attributes with at least two values.
See (Civit, 2000) for a comprehensive list of the morphological attributes included in the Spanish treebank.
3 Models
This section details our two approaches for adding features to a baseline parsing model.
First, we describe how morphological information can be added to a parsing model by modifying the POS tagset.
Second, we describe an approach that reranks the n-best output of the morphologically-rich parser, using arbitrary, general features of the parse trees as additional information.
3.1 Adding
Morphological Information The mechanism we employ for incorporating morphological information is the modification of the POS tagset of a lexicalized PCFG2 — the Model 1 parser described in (Collins, 1999) (hereafter Model 1).
Each POS tagset can be thought of as a particular morphological model or a subset of morphological attributes.
Table 1 shows the complete set of morphological features we considered for Spanish.
There are 22 morphological features in total in this table; different POS sets can be created by deciding whether or not to include each of these 22 features; hence, there are 222 different morphological models we could have created.
For instance, one particular model might capture the modal information of verbs.
In this model, there would be six POS tags for verbs (one for each of indicative, subjunctive, imperative, infinitive, gerund, and participle) instead of just one.
A model that captured both the number and mode of verbs would have 18 verbal POS tags, assuming three values (singular, plural, and neutral) for the number feature.
The Effect of the Tagset on Model 1 Modifying the POS tagset allows Model 1 to better distinguish 2Hand-crafted head rules are used to lexicalize the trees.

events that are unlikely from those that are likely, on the basis of morphological evidence.
An example will help to illustrate this point.
Model 1 relies on statistics conditioned on lexical headwords for practically all parameters in the model.
This sensitivity to headwords is achieved by propagating lexical heads and POS tags to the nonterminals in the parse tree.
Thus, any statistic based on headwords may also be sensitive to the associated POS tag.
For instance, consider the subtree in Figure 1.
Note that this structure is ungrammatical because the subject, gatos (cats), is plural, but the verb, corri´o (ran), is singular.
In Model 1, the probability of generating the noun phrase (NP) with headword gatos and headtag noun (n) is defined as follows:3 P(gatos, n, NP | corri´o, v, S, VP) = P1(n, NP | corri´o, v, S, VP)× P2(gatos | n, NP, corri´o, v, S, VP) The parser smooths parameter values using backedoff statistics, and in particular smooths statistics based on headwords with coarser statistics based on POS tags alone.
This allows the parser to effectively use POS tags as a way of separating different lexical items into subsets or classes depending on their syntactic behavior.
In our example, each term is estimated as follows: P1(n, NP | corri´o, v, S, VP) = λ1,1 ˆP1,1(n, NP | corri´o, v, S, VP) + λ1,2 ˆP1,2(n, NP | v, S, VP) + λ1,3 ˆP1,3(n, NP | S, VP) and P2(gatos | n, NP, corri´o, v, S, VP) = λ2,1 ˆP2,1(gatos | n, NP, corri´o, v, S, VP) + λ2,2 ˆP2,2(gatos | n, NP, v, S, VP) + λ2,3 ˆP2,3(gatos | n) 3Note that the parsing model includes other features such as distance which we omit from the parameter definition for the sake of brevity.
Here the ˆPi,j terms are maximum likelihood estimates derived directly from counts in the training data.
The λi,j parameters are defined so that λ1,1+λ1,2+λ1,3 = λ2,1+λ2,2+λ2,3 = 1.
They control the relative contribution of each level of back-off to the final estimate.
Note that thus far our example has not included any morphological information in the POS tags.
Because of this, we will see that there is a danger of the estimates P1 and P2 both being high, in spite of the dependency being ungrammatical.
P1 will be high because all three estimates ˆP1,1, ˆP1,2 and ˆP1,3 will most likely be high.
Next, consider P2.
Of the three estimates ˆP2,1, ˆP2,2, and ˆP2,3, only ˆP2,1 retains the information that the noun is plural and the verb is singular.
Thus P2 will be sensitive to the morphological clash between gatos and corri´o only if λ2,1 is high, reflecting a high level of confidence in the estimate of ˆP2,3.
This will only happen if the context 〈corri´o, v, S, VP〉 is seen frequently enough for λ2,1 to take a high value.
This is unlikely, given that this context is quite specific.
In summary, the impoverished model can only capture morphological restrictions through lexically-specific estimates based on extremely sparse statistics.
Now consider a model that incorporates morphological information — in particular, number information — in the noun and verb POS tags.
gatos will have the POS pn, signifying a plural noun; corri´o will have the POS sv, signifying a singular verb.
All estimates in the previous equations will reflect these POS changes.
For example, P1 will now be estimated as follows: P1(pn, NP | corri´o, sv, S, VP) = λ1,1 ˆP1,1(pn, NP | corri´o, sv, S, VP) + λ1,2 ˆP1,2(pn, NP | sv, S, VP) + λ1,3 ˆP1,3(pn, NP | S, VP) Note that the two estimates ˆP1,1 and ˆP1,2 include an (unlikely) dependency between the POS tags pn and sv.
Both of these estimates will be 0, assuming that a plural noun is never seen as the subject of a singular verb.
At the very least, the context 〈sv, S, VP〉 will be frequent enough for ˆP1,2 to be a reliable estimate.
The value for λ1,2 will therefore be high, leading to a low estimate for P1, thus correctly assigning low probability to the ungrammatical de797 pendency.
In summary, the morphologically-rich model can make use of non-lexical statistics such as ˆP1,2(pn, NP | sv, S, VP) which contain dependencies between POS tags and which will most likely be estimated reliably by the model.
3.2 The
Reranking Model In the reranking model, we use an n-best version of the morphologically-rich parser to generate a number of candidate parse trees for each sentence in training and test data.
These parse trees are then represented through a combination of the log probability under the initial model, together with a large number of global features.
A reranking model uses the information from these features to derive a new ranking of the n-best parses, with the hope of improving upon the baseline model.
Previous approaches (e.g., (Collins and Koo, 2005)) have used a linear model to combine the log probability under a base parser with arbitrary features derived from parse trees.
There are a variety of methods for training the parameters of the model.
In this work, we use the algorithm described in (Bartlett et al., 2004), which applies the large-margin training criterion of support vector machines (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) to the reranking problem.
The motivation for the reranking model is that a wide variety of features, which can essentially be sensitive to arbitrary context in the parse trees, can be incorporated into the model.
In our work, we included all features described in (Collins and Koo, 2005).
As far as we are aware, this is the first time that a reranking model has been applied to parsing a language other than English.
One goal was to investigate whether the improvements seen on English parsing can be carried across to another language.
We have found that features in (Collins and Koo, 2005), initially developed for English parsing, also give appreciable gains in accuracy when applied to Spanish.
4 Data
The Spanish 3LB treebank is a freely-available resource with about 3,500 sentence/tree pairs that we have used to train our models.
The average sentence length is 28 tokens.
The data is taken from 38 complete articles and short texts.

of the texts are news articles, 27% scientific articles, 14% narrative, 11% commentary, 11% sports articles, 6% essays, and 5% articles from weekly magazines.
The trees contain information about both constituency structure and syntactic functions.
4.1 Preprocessing
It is well-known that tree representation influences parsing performance (Johnson, 1998).
Prior to training our models, we made some systematic modifications to the corpus trees in an effort to make it easier for Model 1 to represent the linguistic phenomena present in the trees.
For the convenience of the reader, Table 2 gives a key to the non-terminal labels in the 3LB treebank that are used in this section and the remainder of the paper.
Relative and Subordinate Clauses Cases of relative and subordinate clauses appearing in the corpus trees have the basic structure of the example in Figure 2a.
Figure 2b shows the modifications we impose on such structures.
The modified structure has the advantage that the SBAR selects the CP node as its head, making the relative pronoun que the headword for the root of the subtree.
This change allows, for example, better modeling of verbs that select for particular complementizers.
In addition, the new subtree rooted at the S node now looks like a toplevel sentence, making sentence types more uniform in structure and easier to model statistically.
Additionally, the new structure differentiates phrases em798 RELATIU−CP a pquien SP−CP spsPREP−CP considerabanv GV todos SNGRUP p CP SBAR−SS todos PREPsps a SNGRUP p considerabanv GV S SPRELATIU pquien (a) (b) Figure 2: Figure (a) is the original structure from the 3LB treebank for the phrase a quien todos consideraban or whom everyone considered.
We transform structures like (a) into (b) by insertingSBARandCPnodes, and by marking all non-terminals below the CP with a -CP tag.
bedded in the complementizers ofSBARs from those used in other contexts, allowing relative pronouns like quien in Figure 2 to surface as lexical headwords when embedded in larger phrases beneath the CP node.4 Coordination In the treebank, coordinated constituents and their coordinating conjunction are placed as sister nodes in a flat structure.
We enhance the structure of such subtrees, as in Figure 3.
Our structure helps to rule out unlikely phrases such as cats and dogs and; the model trained with the original treebank structures will assign non-zero probability to ill-formed structures such as these.
5 Experiments
Our models were trained using a training set consisting of 80% of the data (2,801 sentence/tree pairs, 75,372 words) available to us in the 3LB treebank.
We reserved the remaining 20% (692 sentences, 19,343 words) to use as unseen data in a test set.
We selected these subsets with two criteria in mind: first, respecting the boundaries of the texts by placing articles in their entirety into either one subset or the other; and second, maintaining, in each subset, the same proportion of genres found in the original set of trees.
During development, we used a cross4This is achieved through our head rules.

validation approach on the training set to test different models.
We divided the 2,800 training data trees into 14 different development data sets, where each of these data sets consisted of 2,600 training sentences and 200 development sentences.
We took the average over the results of the 14 splits to gauge the effectiveness of the model being tested.
To evaluate our models, we considered the recovery of labeled and unlabeled dependencies as well as labeled constituents.
Unlabeled dependencies capture how the words in a sentence depend on one another.
Formally, they are tuples {headchild index, modifier index}, where the indices indicate position in the sentence.
Labeled dependencies include the labels of the modifier, headchild, and parent nonterminals as well.
The root of the tree has a special dependency: {head index} in the unlabeled case and {TOP, headchild index, root non-terminal} in the labeled case.
The labeled constituents in a tree are all of the non-terminals and, for each, the positions of the words it spans.
We use the standard definitions of precision, recall, and F-measure.5 5When extracting dependencies, we replaced all nonpunctuation POS labels with a generic label TAG to avoid conflating tagging errors with dependency errors.
We also included the structural changes that we imposed during preprocessing.
Results for constituent precision and recall were computed after we restored the trees to the original treebank structure.

5.1 The
Effects of Morphology In our first experiments, we trained over 50 models, incorporating different morphological information into each in the way described in Section 3.1.
Prior to running the parsers, we trained the POS tagger described in (Collins, 2002).
The output from the tagger was used to assign a POS label for unknown words.
We only attempted to parse sentences under 70 words in length.
Table 3 describes some of the models we tried during development and gives results for each.
Our baseline model, which we used to evaluate the effects of using morphology, was Model 1 (Collins, 1999) with a simple POS tagset containing almost no morphological information.
The morphological models we show are meant to be representative of both the highest-scoring models and the performance of various morphological features.
For instance, we found that, in general, gender had only a slight impact on the performance of the parser.
Note that gender is not a morphological attribute of Spanish verbs, and that the inclusion of verbal features, particularly number, mode, and person, generated the strongest-performing models in our experiments.
Table 4 shows the results of running two models on the test set: the baseline model and the bestperforming morphological model from the development stage.
This model uses the number and mode of verbs, as well as the number of adjectives, determiners, nouns, and pronouns.
The results in Tables 3 and 4 show that adding some amount of morphological information to a parsing model is beneficial.
We found, however, that adding more information does not always lead to improved performance (see, for example, rows 11 and 13 in Table 3).
Presumably this is because the tagset grows too large.
Table 5 takes a closer look at the performance 800 of the best-performing morphological model in the recovery of particular labeled dependencies.
The breakdown shows the top 15 dependencies in the gold-standard trees across the entire training set.
Collectively, these dependencies represent around 72% of the dependencies seen in this data.
We see an extraordinary gain in the recovery of some of these dependencies when we add morphological information.
Among these are the two involving postmodifiers to verbs.
When examining the output of the morphological model, we found that much of this gain is due to the fact that there are two non-terminal labels used in the treebank that specify modal information of verbs they dominate (infinitivals and gerunds): with insufficient morphological information, the baseline parser was unable to distinguish regular verb phrases from these more specific verb phrases.
Some dependencies are particularly difficult for the parser, such as that in which SBAR modifies a noun ({GRUP TAG SBAR R}).
We found that around 20% of cases of this type in the training set involve structures like el proceso de negociones que (in English the process of negotiation that).
This type of structure is inherently difficult to disambiguate.
In Spanish, such structures may be more common than in English, since phrases involving nominal modifiers to nouns, like negotiation process, are always formed as noun + de + noun.
5.2 Experiments
with Reranking In the reranking experiments, we follow the procedure described in (Collins and Koo, 2005) for creation of a training set with n-best parses for each sentence.
This method involves jack-knifing the data: the training set of 2,800 sentences was parsed in 200-sentence chunks by an n-best morphological parser trained on the remaining 2,600 sentences.
This ensured that each sentence in the training data had n-best output from a baseline model that was not trained on that sentence.
We used the optimal morphological model (n(A,D,N,V,P)+m(V)) to generate the n-best lists, and we used the feature set described in (Collins and Koo, 2005).
The test results are given in Table 4.6 6Note that we also created development sets for development of the reranking approach, and for cross-validation of the single parameter C in approach of (Bartlett et al., 2004).

The model BL is the baseline, and M is the morphological model n(A,D,N,V,P)+m(V).
5.3 Statistical
Significance We tested the significance of the labeled precision and recall results in Table 4 using the sign test.
When applying the sign test, for each sentence in the test data we calculate the sentence-level F1 constituent score for the two parses being compared.
This indicates whether one model performs better on that sentence than the other model, or whether the two models perform equally well, information used by the sign test.
All differences were found to be statistically significant at the level p = 0.01.7 7When comparing the baseline model to the morphological model on the 692 test sentences, F1 scores improved on 314 sentences, and became worse on 164 sentences.
When comparing the baseline model to the reranked model, 358/157 sen801 6 Conclusions and Future Work We have developed a statistical parsing model for Spanish that performs at 85.1% F1 constituency accuracy.
We find that an approach that explicitly represents some of the particular features of Spanish (i.e., its morphology) does indeed help in parsing.
Moreover, this approach is compatible with the reranking approach, which uses general features that were first developed for use in an English parser.
In fact, our best parsing model combines both the language-specific morphological features and the non-specific reranking features.
The morphological features are local, being restricted to dependencies between words in the parse tree; the reranking features are more global, relying on larger portions of parse structures.
Thus, we see our final model as combining the strengths of two complementary approaches.
We are curious to know the extent to which a close analysis of the dependency errors made by the baseline parser can be corrected by the development of features tailored to addressing these problems.
Some preliminary investigation of this suggests that we see much higher gains when using generic features than these more specific ones, but we leave a thorough investigation of this to future work.
Another avenue for future investigation is to try using a more sophisticated baseline model such as Collins’ Model 2, which incorporates both subcategorization and complement/adjunct information.
Finally, we would like to use the Spanish parser in an application such as machine translation.
