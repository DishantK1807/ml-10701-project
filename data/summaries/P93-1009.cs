A second question is how this conception of discourse processing may be integrated with theories of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Scha and Polanyi, 1988; Webber, 1991).

Syntactic accounts (Fiengo and May, 1990; Hgik, 1987; Hellan, 1988; Hestvik, 1993; Lappin, 1993; Lappin and McCord, 1990) claim that syntactic material is copied from the antecedent clause and reconstructed in the elided clause, whereas semantic accounts (Dalrymple, 1991; Dalrymple et al., 1991; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Hardt, 1992; Kehler, 1993; Klein, 1987) claim this material is retrieved from semantic representations.

For example, the Centering framework of Grosz et al.(1986) utilizes grammatical role information in specifying the accessibility of potential referents on an ordered forward-looking center list.

For resolution in the discourse model, we will use the event representation and resolution algorithm defined in (Kehler, 1993).
