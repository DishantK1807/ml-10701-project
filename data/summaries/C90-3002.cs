In CLG(2) this facility has been extended in a fashion akin to UD (Johnson & Rosner, 1989) to include reeursive user defined relations.

Except for the more simple, although not unproblematic, extensions to PATR-II like the ones proposed by Karttunen (1984), most of these efforts have their root in the work by Rounds, Kasper and Moshier (Rounds & Kasper, 1986; Moshier & Rounds 1987), who give the proof of the existence of a sound, although non classical, logical interPretation for disjunctive and negative feature specifications.

The following is a detail of the syntactic feature hierarchy used for one type of linguistic sign in one of the grammars implemented in CLG(2): Sign = ( phon, syn, sem,dtrs); phon = word list; syn = ( local, bind); local = ( head, compls, funhead, select, lex ); head = ( vform, inv, agr, tense); vform = {fin, bse, psp, prp, pas, inf, ger }; inv= {-,+ }; agr = ( num, prs ); num= { sg, pl }; prs = { fst, snd, thrd }; tense = { past, pre}; compls = Sign list; lex = (+,-}; bind = (slash, subj, wh); slash = Sign list; subj = Sign list; wh = {rei, que}; dtrs = (head._dtr,compl_dtrs) head._dtr = Sign ; compl..dtrs = Sign list; Other systems require typing information, including HPSG (Pollard & Sag 1987) and UCG (Moens et al.1989). Type information is used in CLG(2) both to structure the grammatical information and to achieve a more efficient implementation.

Although Kasper (1987) has proposed an algorithm for handling grammars with disjunctive feature specifications, the computational tractability of complex constraints in unification based formalism remains an open problem (Pereira 1987).
