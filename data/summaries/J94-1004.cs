In previous work (Shieber and Schabes 1990), the definition of synchronous TAG derivation is given in a manner that requires multiple adjunctions at a single node.

This implementation was directly based on the inference-based TAG parser mentioned in Section 6.5 and presented in full elsewhere (Schabes and Shieber 1992).

The idea is formulated in its modern variant as selective-adjoining constraints (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1985).

The parsing algorithm can be seen as a tabular parsing method based on deduction of items, as in Earley deduction (Pereira and Warren 1983).

would account 4 The formulation of derivation for tree-adjoining grammars is also of significance for other grammatical formalisms based on weaker forms of adjunction such as lexicalized context-free grammar (Schabes and Waters 1993a) and its stochastic extension (Schabes and Waters 1993b), though we do not discuss these arguments here.

A synchronous TAG whose source TAG is a grammar for a fragment of English and whose target TAG is a grammar for a logical form language may be used to generate logical forms for each sentence of English that the source grammar admits (Shieber and Schabes 1990).
C90-3045
Adjoining constraints can also be implemented using feature structure equations (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1988).
C88-2147
Statistical Parameters In a similar vein, the statistical parameters of a stochastic lexicalized TAG (SLTAG) (Resnik 1992; Schabes 1992) specify the probability of adjunction of a given auxiliary tree at a specific node in another tree.
