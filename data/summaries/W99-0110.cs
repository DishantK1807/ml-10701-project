Research on the success of algorithms for pronoun resolution (Lappin & Leass, 1994) shows that syntactic factors (such as being a subject, being a direct object, and not being contained within another noun phrase) contribute to the likelihood that an expression is the antecedent of a subsequent pronoun.

The principle modifications are: (1) The construction rules for proper names and definite descriptions introduce entities into the discourse model as they do in Kamp and Reyle (1993), but the construction rule for pronouns interprets pronouns as referring directly to entities in the discourse model which is not how the rule works in Kamp and Reyle (1993); (2) Discourse entities in the model are ranked in terms of prominence (an idea that derives from the set of forward-looking centers in Centering Theory, Grosz, et al.1995) which influences the way in which coreference is established.

The pattern of" coreference that is observed with these three types of measures (intuitive judgments, reading time, and frequency in a corpus) is accounted for by a model (Gordon & Hendricl~ 1998) that incorporates aspects of Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, & Weinstein, 1995) into Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp & Reyle, 1993).

The model that is developed Discourse Prominence Theory (DPT) -integrates and elaborates on three theoretical sources: Discourse Representation Theory (DRT, Kamp & Reyle, 1993), Centering Theory (Grosz, et al.1995), and the Binding Theory (Chomsky, 1986).
