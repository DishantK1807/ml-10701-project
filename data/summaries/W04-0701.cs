+web +name +over +sem (all feats) % C o rre ct Following Ng and Cardie (2002), we address this problem by clustering each set of concept-instance pairs with identical names, using a form of groupaverage agglomerative clustering, in which the similarity score between instances is just the probability output by the model.

Bagga and Baldwin (1998) also present an examination of multi-document person name resolution.

Ent). models implement the intuition that the best model will be the one that is consistent with the set of constrains imposed by the evidence, but otherwise is as uniform as possible (Berger et al., 1996).

We chose not to test on artificially generated test examples (such as the pseudo-names described in Mann and Yarowsky, 2003) because of our reliance on name orthography in feature generation (see section 3.2).

Mann and Yarowsky (2003) are amongst the few who have examined this problem.

Entropy Model 3.1 Data Fleischman et al.(2003) describe a dataset of concept-instance pairs extracted automatically from a very large corpus of newspaper articles.

Mann and Yarowsky (2003) report results on two types of evaluations: using hand-annotated webpages returned from truly ambiguous searches, they report precision/recall scores of 0.88/0.73; using “psuedonames” 1 they report an accuracy of 86.4%. 1 Borrowing from techniques in word sense disambiguation, they create a test set of 28 “pseudonames” by ranWhile Mann and Yarowsky (2003) describe a number of useful features for multi-document person name resolution, their technique is limited by only allowing a set number of referent clusters.
