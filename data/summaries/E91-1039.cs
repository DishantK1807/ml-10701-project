The initial results described here suggest many more experiments, some of which are already u~nderway (see Brent and Berwick, 1991).

These methods, in combination with pure collocational methods like those of \[Hindle, 1990\] and \[Smadja and McKeown, 1990\], may eventually yield substantial progress toward automatic acquisition of word meaning, or some aspects thereof, by language using devices.

These observations have led ~everal researchers, including Hindle (1990) and Smadja and McKeown (1990), to begin investigating automatic acquisition of semantics.
