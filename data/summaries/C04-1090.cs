We used the word-alignment algorithm in (Lin&Cherry 2003a), which enforces a cohesion constraint that guarantees that if two spans overlap one must be fully contained in the other.

However, (Koehn et al 2003) found that it is actually harmful to restrict phrases to constituents in parse trees, because the restriction would cause the system to miss many reliable translations, such as the correspondence between “there is” in English and “es gibt” (“it gives”) in German.

In (Yamada&Knight 2001), for example, the translation model applies three operations (re-order, insert, and translate) to an English parse tree to produce its Chinese translation.

In word-based models, such as IBM Model 1-5 (Brown et al 1993), the probability P(T|S) is decomposed into statistical parameters involving words.

We then performed word-align on the parsed corpus with the ProAlign system (Cherry&Lin 2003, Lin&Cherry 2003b).

There have been many recent proposals to acquire transfer rules automatically from word-aligned corpus (Carbonell et al 2002, Lavoie et al 2002, Richardson et al 2001).

Examples of transfer rules extracted from a word-aligned corpus 3.1 Spans The rule extraction algorithm makes use of the notion of spans (Fox 2002, Lin&Cherry 2003).

In the second type of phrase-based SMT models, phrases are defined as a block in a word aligned corpus such that words within the block are aligned with words inside the block (Och et al 1999, Marcu&Wong 2002).
