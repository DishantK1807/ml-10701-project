In the experiments, we used WordNet1.6 (Miller et al., 1993a) as a dictionary that supplies all the possible semantic senses for a given word.

The unsupervised methods are Relevant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al., 2003) and the CIAOSENSO WSD system which is based on Conceptual Density (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), frequency of WordNet (Miller et al., 1993a) senses and WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000).

Domains This is an unsupervised WSD method based on the WordNet Domains lexical resource (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000).

ME have been also applied to WSD (van Halteren et al., 2001; Montoyo and Su´arez, 2001; Su´arez and Palomar, 2002), and as meta-learner in (Ilhan et al., 2001).

The supervised methods are based on Maximum Entropy (ME) (Lau et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998), neural network using the Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (Kohonen, 1995) and Specialized Hidden Markov Models (Pla, 2000).

This resource has already been used on Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strapparava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses information.
