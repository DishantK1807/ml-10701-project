We use two publicly available and widely used unsupervised morphological learning systems -Goldsmith s (2001) Linguistica11 and Creutz and Lagus s (2005) Morphessor 1.012 -as our baseline systems.

This frequency disparity can be an important clue to determining that there is no morphological relation between candidate and candid . Similar observation is also made by Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), who successfully employ relative frequency similarity or disparity to rank candidate VBD/VB pairs (e.g.

Creutz (2003) proposes a probabilistic maximum a posteriori formulation that uses prior distributions of morpheme length and frequency to measure the goodness of an induced morpheme, achieving better results for Finnish but worse results for English in comparison to Goldsmith s Linguistica.

Goldsmith (2001) also adopts the MDL approach, providing a new compression system that incorporates signatures when measuring the length of the morphological grammar.

For example, ent, en and t all are valid suffixes in English, but ent is not a 2 The dependence on frequency and length is motivated by the observation that less-frequent and shorter affixes (especially those of length 1) are more likely to be erroneous (see Goldsmith (2001)).

Many existing morphological parsers incorrectly segment candidate as candid + ate, since they fail to identify that the morpheme ate should not attach to the word candid. Schone and Jurafsky s (2001) work represents one of the few attempts to address this inappropriate morpheme attachment problem, introducing a method that exploits the semantic relatedness between word pairs.

Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) propose an interesting algorithm that employs four similarity measures to successfully identify the most probable root of a highly irregular word.

Second, it exhibits robust performance even when inducing morphemes from a very large vocabulary, whereas Goldsmith s (2001) and Freitag s (2005) morphological analyzers perform well only when a small vocabulary is employed, showing deteriorating performance as the vocabulary size increases.

Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm across languages: it not only outperforms Goldsmith s (2001) Linguistica and Creutz and Lagus s (2005) Morphessor for English and Bengali, but also compares favorably to the bestperforming PASCAL morphological parsers when evaluated on all three datasets in the Challenge.
