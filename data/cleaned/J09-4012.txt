Language Engineering?

One of the most thought-provoking proposals I have heard recently came from Lori
Levin during the discussion that concluded the EACL 2009 WorkshopontheInteraction
between Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Lori proposed that we should form
an ACL Special Interest Group on Linguistics. At ﬁrst blush, I found the idea weird:
Isn’t it a little like the American Academy of Pediatrics forming a SIG on Medicine (or
on Children)? Second thoughts, however, revealed the appropriateness of the idea: In
essence,linguisticsisaltogethermissingincontemporarynaturallanguageengineering
research. In the following pages I want to call for the return of linguistics to computa-
tional linguistics.
The last two decades were marked by a complete paradigm shift in computational
linguistics.Frustratedbytheinabilityofapplicationsbasedonexplicitlinguisticknowl-
edge to scale up to real-world needs, and, perhaps more deeply, frustrated with the
dominating theories in formal linguistics, we looked instead to corpora that reﬂect lan-
guage use as our sources of (implicit) knowledge. With the shift in methodology came
a subtle change in the goals of our entire enterprise. Two decades ago, a computational
linguist could be interested in developing NLP applications; or in formalizing (and
reasoning about) linguistic processes. These days, it is the former only. A superﬁcial
look at the papers presented in our main conferences reveals that the vast majority of
them are engineering papers, discussing engineering solutions to practical problems.
Virtually none addresses fundamental issues in linguistics.
There’s nothing wrong with engineering work, of course. Every school of tech-
nology has departments of engineering in areas as diverse as Chemical Engineering,
Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, or Biomedical Engineering; there’s
no reason why there shouldn’t also be a discipline of Natural Language Engineering.
But in the more established disciplines, engineering departments conduct research
that is informed by some well-deﬁned branch of science. Chemical engineers study
chemistry; electrical engineers study physics; aeronautical engineers study dynamics;
and biomedical engineers study biology, physiology, medical sciences, and so on.
The success of engineering is also in part due to the choice of the “right” mathe-
matics. The theoretical development of several scientiﬁc areas, notably physics, went
alongside mathematical developments. Physics could not have accounted for natural
phenomena without such mathematical infrastructure. For example, the development
of (partial) differential equations went hand in hand with some of the greatest achieve-
ment in physics, and this branch of mathematics later turned out to be applicable also
to chemistry, electrical engineering, and economics, among many other scientiﬁc ﬁelds.

What branch of science, then, underlies Natural Language Engineering? What is
the theoretical infrastructure on which we build our applications? And what kind of
mathematics is necessary for reasoning about human languages?
Consider some of the greatest achievements of natural language engineering since
the data-oriented revolution. The Penn Treebank, for example, whose annotation has
been used for training numerous POS taggers and parsers since its ﬁrst release in 1992:
What theory underlies its annotation? In what sense is this annotation “correct”?
Could any other annotation scheme be just as good? What criteria do we have for
evaluatingthequalityofthisresource?Andwhatbranchofscienceshouldsuchcriteria
be embedded in?
Ortakemachinetranslation,theholygrailofnaturallanguageprocessingforhalfa
century.Wenowhavestatisticalmachinetranslationsystemsthatperformwellenough
to be usable for a variety of applications, and Google provides free machine translation
services between any pair of over 40 languages, so one can translate automatically
between Albanian and Vietnamese. This is probably the greatest achievement of our
ﬁeld; what branch of science is it based on? What theory underlies it?
I could go on and on. Word sense disambiguation, stochastic parsing, text cate-
gorization, question answering, semantic role labeling, speech recognition, ontology
development, whatever your favorite application is: What branch of science underlies
it?What are its theoretical underpinnings?
In the Old Days this used to be linguistics. Morphological analyzers reﬂected the
accumulated wisdom of researchers in morphology and phonology. The ﬁrst parsing
algorithms were informed by syntactic theory. Dialog systems were based on research
in semantics and discourse theory. Why is this no longer the case?
One reason, obviously, is that applications that were based on explicit linguistic
knowledge didn’t scale up well. A more subtle reason has to do with the way science
is funded: Funding agencies (mainly in the U.S.) are motivated by short-term practical
goals, and are less patient with long-term, infrastructural basic research. Other areas of
computer science shift from foundational, theory-based research to engineering appli-
cation forthe same reason.
But there is a deeper reason. Linguistics, as a discipline, went astray: It focused
mainly on syntax (and predominantly on English); and its theory became so obscure,
so baroque, and so self-centered, that it became virtually impenetrable to researchers
from other disciplines. To use the terminology of Evans and Levinson (in press), “the
relevant literature is forbiddingly opaque to outsiders”; or, in the words of Tomasello
(1995, page 136), linguistic theories are “described in linguistically speciﬁc terms such
that it is very difﬁcult to relate them to cognition in other psychological domains.” Or
to computational implementation, for that matter.
Sowewerefrustratedwithlinguistics,andinourfrustrationwetotallyabandoned
it,andwereleftwithstatisticsandprobabilitytheory.Butsurelycomputationallinguis-
tics cannot be a branch of applied statistics. For if this were the case, nothing could
distinguish natural languages from other, non-linguistic, string manipulation systems,
such as DNA sequences or music score sheets or transcripts of chess games. Surely
there’s something unique to the strings that our systems manipulate, something that
can be theorized about and can be scientiﬁcally investigated. What makes our systems
special is the fact that they manipulate natural languages, and the only scientiﬁc ﬁeld
that can inform our work is linguistics.
And the truth is that there’s much new in the world of linguistics, much that
should interest us computational linguists. The tight grip of generative syntax on the
world of theoretical linguistics has long been released, and there are several excellent

research directions that could greatly beneﬁt from a more formal, mathematical, and
computational investigation. Let me illustrate using just a fewexamples.
The most prominent example is psycholinguistics. Several researchers with a gen-
uineinterestinlanguage,butwithtraininginthecognitivesciences,addresslinguistics
in a more general, cognitive context, and bring to the investigation promising scientiﬁc
methodologies. Consider CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000), a vast computational corpus
transcribing linguistic interactions between children and their caretakers, in over 25
languages, collected over more than 20 years by dozens of researchers. These data are
for the most part annotated morphologically (and, to some extent, also syntactically).
They have been used in over 1,500 scientiﬁc papers for investigating and evaluat-
ing diverse issues in language development. They provide an invaluable resource for
computationallydrivenresearchinlinguistics:psycholinguistics,theoreticallinguistics,
cognitive linguistics and, yes, also computational linguistics.
Psycholinguistics provides not only resources and research methodologies, but
also theories that we, as computational linguists, should be able to inspect, evaluate,
and elaborate on. Researchers including MacWhinney (1987, 1998, 1999, 2004a, 2004b),
Tomasello(1998,2003,2006),orBybee(2001,2006,2007),tomentionjustafew,produce
exciting theories that are backed up by experimentation. Interestingly enough, these
linguistic theories hint at the kind of mathematics that we need to develop in order to
understand and reason about natural languages: They emphasize language use over
abstract “competence” and direct us from formal grammars and logic to statistics and
probabilitytheory.Mostimportantly,suchtheoriesareinprinciplefalsiﬁable(Tomasello
2004);canweimprovethemusingourown,mathematicalandcomputational,method-
ologies? Can we use them to build better systems?
Exciting linguistic research, which is grounded in more general, philosophical, bio-
logical, cognitive, and computational insights, is also performed in language evolution
(Christiansen and Kirby 2003), in historical linguistics (Warnow 1997; Nakhleh, Ringe,
and Warnow 2005), and also in the more traditionally central areas of morphology and
syntax(Goldberg1995;PrinceandSmolensky1997;Pullum2007).Wemustbeawareof
this work.
But we can go much further. Not only should we be more aware of linguistic
research that can improve our engineering work, we should also be directly involved
insuchresearch.Ourformalmathematicalandcomputationaltrainingisinvaluablefor
research in the life sciences and the humanities, and can shed new light on phenomena
thattraditionalapproachesfailtoaccountfor.Wecanbringrefreshinginsightsandnew
points of view to all branches of linguistics. Computational linguistics can, in essence,
be asub-ﬁeld oflinguistics.
In fact, some ﬁrst attempts in this direction have already seen their way into our
main conferences. For example, Ellison and Kirby (2006, page 273) propose a com-
putational method for constructing genetic language taxonomies, which they claim
“coheres better with current thinking in linguistics and psycholinguistics.” Daum´e III
and Campbell (2007) use a computational methodology, applied to the World Atlas of
Language Structures (a large database of various properties of over 2,000 languages),
to discover linguistic universals, in the form of typological implications. In both of
these examples, novel computational techniques are used to assist in exactly the type
of research that traditional linguists have always been interested in, and both cases are
success stories.
Such examples, unfortunately, are still few and far between. But they demonstrate
what computational linguistics can achieve when it is backed up and informed by lin-
guistic theory. Whether such theoretical research is guaranteed to improve engineering

projects I cannot tell; but in all areas of the natural sciences this has been the case.
Language engineering should not be different.
More importantly, our community is able to be a major force behind contemporary
research in linguistics. Many of us were drawn to this ﬁeld by our love for language;
we can now follow our hearts and go back to exploring language in all its beauty,
rather than (okay, in addition to) harnessing it to our practical needs. Let us be part
of linguistics. Or do some of us really have to settle for being refugees in an ACL SIG?
