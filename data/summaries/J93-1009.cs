Wedekind 1988; Shieber et al.1990). The lack of a consistent answer to the question of the generator's source has been at the heart of the problem of how to make research on generation intelligible and engaging for the rest of the computational linguistics community, and has complicated efforts to evaluate alternative treatments even for people in the field.

Given such architectures, the move to properly reversible rules awaits only a declarative statement of the few .~'emaining parts of these systems where the mappin~ s have been formulated procedurally--a project that is already well advanced (McDonald 1991, 1992b).

Some researchers, this author included, take the end point to be an elaboration of an already existing semantic model whereby some new individuals are added and new relations established between them and other individuals (Martin and Riesbeck 1986; McDonald 1992a).

Examples of these tasks include construing the speaker's situation in realizable terms given the available vocabulary and syntactic resources (an especially important task when the source is raw data, e.g., precisely what points of the compass make the wind "easterly," \[Bourbeau et al.1990\]); selecting the information to include in the utterance and deciding whether it should be stated explicitly or left for inference; distributing the information into sentences and giving it an organization that reflects the intended rhetorical force, coherence, and necessary cohesion given the prior discourse; and finding a mapping of the information to linguistic resources that is collectively expressible (i.e., has a surface realization; see Meteer 1992).
