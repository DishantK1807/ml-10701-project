A similar technique is used by \[Guthrie et al., 1991\] except that they define neighbourhoods according to subject categories (i.e engineering, economic etc).

In most of the cases \[Hearst, 1991; McDonald et al., 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Guthrie et al., 1992\], the number of test sentences is rather small (less than 50) so that no exact comparison between different methods can be done.

Several researchers have been experimented with lexical disambiguation using MRDs, including \[Lesk, 1986; Wilks et al., 1989; McDonald et al., 1990; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Guthrie et al., 1992\].

Methods based on co-occurence statistics have been used by \[Wilks et al., 1989; McDonald et ai., 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991\].

Our tests included a set of 20 sentences, from sentences cited in an NLP textbook \[Harris, 1985\] (used to illustrate non-MRD-based semantic disambiguation techniques) example sentences cited in \[Guthrie et al., 1992; Lesk, 1986; Hearst, 1991\] (for comparison between different lexical disambiguation routines) and examples taken from LDOCE (to assess the algorithm's performance with example sentences of particular senses in the dictionary-this might also be a way of testing the consistency of the relationship between different senses and their corresponding examples of a word in LDOCE).
