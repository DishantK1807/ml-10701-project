Both constraints have been shown to be in very good fit with data from dependency treebanks (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006).

Lately, they have also been used in many computational tasks, such as relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), parsing (McDonald et al., 2005), and machine translation (Quirk et al., 2005).

The number of components in the order-annotation, and hence, the gap-degree of the resulting dependency language, corresponds to the fan-out of the function: the highest number of components among the arguments of the function (Satta, 1992).1 A technical difficulty is caused by the fact that lcfrs can swap components: f.hx11;x21i/Dhax21;x11i.

In search of a balance between structural flexibility and computational complexity, several authors have proposed constraints to identify classes of non-projective dependency structures that are computationally well-behaved (Bodirsky et al., 2005; Nivre, 2006).

This gives rise to a notion of regular dependency languages, and allows us to establish a formal relation between the structural constraints and mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms (Joshi, 1985): We show that regular dependency languages correspond to the sets of derivations of lexicalized Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (lcfrs) (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987), and that the gap-degree measure is the structural correspondent of the concept of ‘fan-out’ in this formalism (Satta, 1992).

Data-driven dependency parsing with non-projective structures is quadratic when all attachment decisions are assumed to be independent of one another (McDonald et al., 2005), but becomes intractable when this assumption is abandoned (McDonald and Pereira, 2006).

A dependency structure is projective, if each of its yields forms an interval with respect to the precedence order (Kuhlmann and Nivre, 2006).

Unfortunately, most formal results on non-projectivity are discouraging: While grammar-driven dependency parsers that are restricted to projective structures can be as efficient as parsers for lexicalized context-free grammar (Eisner and Satta, 1999), parsing is prohibitively expensive when unrestricted forms of non-projectivity are permitted (Neuhaus and Bröker, 1997).

LinearContext-FreeRewritingSystems Gap-restricted dependency languages are closely related to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (lcfrs) (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987), a class of formal systems that generalizes several mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms.
