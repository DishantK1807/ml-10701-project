Other researchers have proposed corpusbased approaches to acquiring lexical aspect information with varying data coverage: Klavans and Chodorow (1992) focus on the event-state distinction in verbs and predicates; Light (1996) considers the aspectual properties of verbs and affixes; and McKeown and Siegel (1996) describe an algorithm for classifying sentences according to lexical aspect.

Some have proposed, in fact, that aspectual classes are gradient categories (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), or that aspect should be evaluated only at the clausal or sentential level (asp.

The ability to determine lexical aspect, on a large scale and in the sentential context, therefore yields an important source of constraints for corpus analysis and psycholinguistic experimentation, as well as for NLP applications such as machine translation (Dorr et al., 1995b) and foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995a; Sams.

Such cases arise, e.g., in the context of foreign language tutoring (Dorr et al., 1995b; Sams, 1995; Weinberg et al., 1995), where a a 'bounded' interpretation for an atelic verb, e.g., march, may be introduced by a path PP to the bridge or across the field or by a NP the length of the field: (1) The soldier marched to the bridge.

Knowledge of lexical aspect--how verbs denote situations as developing or holding in time--is required for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse, 1994), describing allowable alternations and their semantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and for selecting tense and lexical items for natural language generation ((Dorr and Olsen.

The assignment of aspectual features to the classes in Levin was done by hand inspection of the semantic effect of the alternations described in Part I of Levin (Olsen, 1996), with automatic coindexing to the verb classes (see (Dorr and Olsen, 1996)).
