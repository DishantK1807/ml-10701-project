In Yarowsky's experiment (Yarowsky, 1995), an average of 3936 examples were used to disambiguate between two senses.

The likelihood ratio is obtained by treating word and Ic as a bigram and computed with the formula in (Dunning, 1993).

5.1 Related Work The Step C in Section 3.2 is similar to Resnik's noun group disambiguation (Resnik, 1995a), although he did not address the question of the creation of noun groups.

This implements the "one sense per discourse" heuristic advocated in (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1992).

The probabilities are estimated by the frequency of concepts in SemCor (Miller et al., 1994), a sense-tagged subset of the Brown corpus.

between Two Concepts There have been several proposed measures for similarity between two concepts (Lee, Kim, and Lee, 1989; Kada et al., 1989; Resnik, 1995b; Wu and Palmer, 1994).

We used a subset of the SemCor (Miller et al., 1994) to evaluate our algorithm.

In several recent proposals (Hearst, 1991; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Leacock, Towwell, and Voorhees, 1996; Ng and Lee, 1996; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1994), statistical and machine learning techniques were used to extract classifiers from hand-tagged corpus.
C92-2070 P94-1013 P94-1020 P96-1006
Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1995) proposed an unsupervised method that used heuristics to obtain seed classifications and expanded the results to the other parts of the corpus, thus avoided the need to hand-annotate any examples.
