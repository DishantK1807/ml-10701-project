Finally, the top four candidates for the Telic role are kill, slit, cut and slice, whereby cut corresponds to the ideal filler of the qualia structure for knife as mentioned in (Johnston and Busa, 1996).

We evaluate our approach for the lexical elements knife, beer, book, which are also discussed in (Johnston and 31 Busa, 1996) or (Pustejovsky, 1991), as well as computer, an abstract noun, i.e. conversation, as well as two very specific multi-term words, i.e. natural language processing and data mining.

Further, it has also been argued that qualia structures and lexical semantic relations in general have applications in information retrieval (Voorhees, 1994; Pustejovsky et al., 1993).

Qualia Structures have been originally introduced by (Pustejovsky, 1991) and are used for a variety of purposes in Natural Language processing such as the analysis of compounds (Johnston and Busa, 1996), co-composition and coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991) as well as for bridging reference resolution (Bos et al., 1995).

Considering the results for the Formal role, the elements drink (1st), alcohol (2nd) and beverage (4th) are much more specific than liquid as given in (Pustejovsky, 1991), while thing at the 3rd position is certainly too general.

Our approach to learning qualia structures from the Web is on the one hand based on the assumption that instances of a certain semantic relation can be learned by matching certain lexico-syntactic patterns more or less reliably conveying the relation of interest in line with the seminal work of (Hearst, 1992), who defined the following patterns conveying a hypernym relation: (1) a1a3a2a5a4 such as a1a6a2a8a7, a1a3a2a10a9,..., a1a3a2a10a11a13a12a14a7 (anda15or) a1a3a2a10a11 2 (2) such a1a3a2a5a4 as a1a3a2a8a7, a1a3a2a10a9, ...

In general it is important to mention that by this approach we are not able to detect and separate multiple meanings of words, i.e. to handle polysemy, which is appropriately accounted for in the framework of the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991).

Finally, (Pustejovsky et al., 1993) present an interesting framework for the acquisition of semantic relations from corpora not only relying on statistics, but guided by theoretical lexicon principles.

After some initial experiments we decided not to use the patterns ’X is Y’ and ’X is a kind of Y’ such as in a book is an item or a book is a kind of publication 30 as well as the pattern ’Y, including X’ (compare (Hearst, 1992)) as we found that in our settings they delivered quite spurious results.

It seems that give is emphasizing the role of a book as a gift, read is referring to the most obvious purpose of a book as specified in the ideal qualia structures of (Pustejovsky, 1991) as well as (Johnston and Busa, 1996) and purchase denotes the more general purpose of a book, i.e. to be bought.

The fillers of the Agentive role produce, make and create seem all appropriate, whereby make corresponds exactly to the ideal filler for the Agentive role as mentioned in (Johnston and Busa, 1996).

For book, the first four candidates of the Formal role, i.e. product, item, publication and document are very appropriate, but alluding to the physical object meaning of book as opposed to the meaning in the sense of information container (compare (Pustejovsky, 1991).

Hearst’s idea has been reapplied by different researchers with either slight variations in the patterns used (Iwanska et al., 2000), to acquire knowledge for anaphora resolution (Poesio et al., 2002), or to discover other kinds of semantic relations such as part-of relations (Charniak and Berland, 1999) or causation relations (Girju and Moldovan, 2002).

In fact he introduced so called Qualia Structures by which the meaning of a lexical element is described in terms of four roles: a0 Constitutive: describing physical properties of an object, i.e. its weight, material as well as parts and components a0 Agentive: describing factors involved in the bringing about of an object, i.e. its creator or the causal chain leading to its creation a0 Formal: describing that properties which distinguish an object in a larger domain, i.e. orientation, magnitude, shape and dimensionality a0 Telic: describing the purpose or function of an object Most of the qualia structures used in (Pustejovsky, 1991) however seem to have a more restricted interpretation.
J91-4003
These approaches are in essence a combination of the usage of lexico-syntactic pattens conveying a certain relation of interest such as in (Hearst, 1992), (Charniak and Berland, 1999), (Iwanska et al., 2000) or (Poesio et al., 2002) with the idea of using the web as a big corpus (Resnik and Smith, 2003), (Grefenstette, 1999), (Keller et al., 2002).
