Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

This is because identical words occur more often in coordinate head words than in other lexical dependencies (there were 43 pairs with identical words in the coordination set, compared to 3 such pairs in the 150 SimTest ncoord xcoord SDcoord nnonCoord xnonCoord SDnonCoord 95% CI p-value coordDistrib 503 0.11 0.13 485 0.06 0.09 [0.04 0.07] 0.000 (Resnik, 1995) 444 3.19 2.33 396 2.43 2.10 [0.46 1.06] 0.000 (Lin, 1998) 444 0.27 0.26 396 0.19 0.22 [0.04 0.11] 0.000 (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) 444 0.13 0.65 395 0.07 0.08 [-0.01 0.11] 0.083 (Wu and Palmer, 1994) 444 0.63 0.19 396 0.55 0.19 [0.06 0.11] 0.000 (Leacock and Chodorow, 1998) 444 1.72 0.51 396 1.52 0.47 [0.13 0.27] 0.000 (Hirst and St-Onge, 1998) 459 1.599 2.03 447 1.09 1.87 [0.25 0.76] 0.000 (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003) 451 114.12 317.18 436 82.20 168.21 [-1.08 64.92] 0.058 (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006) 459 0.67 0.18 447 0.66 0.2 [-0.02 0.03] 0.545 random 483 0.89 0.17 447 0.88 0.18 [-0.02 0.02] 0.859 Table 1: Summary statistics for 9 different word similarity measures (plus one random measure):ncoord and nnonCoord are the sample sizes for the coordinate and non-coordinate noun pairs samples, respectively; xcoord, SDcoord and xnonCoord, SDnonCoord are the sample means and standard deviations for the two sets.

Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994).

A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).

For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence between certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994).

They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel corpus.

3 WordNet-Based Similarity Measures We also examine the following measures of semantic similarity which are WordNet-based.3 Wu and Palmer (1994) propose a measure of similarity of two concepts c1 and c2 based on the depth of concepts in the WordNet hierarchy.

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.
