As has been noted by others (see, for example, \[Reiter et al 1992\] and \[Moore 1989\]), the dynamic generation of hypertext also permits the user to effectively drive the text generation system, alleviating from the system some of the responsibility of reasoning about what to present to the user.

Again, a similar philosophy underpins the use of precomputed lists of preferred attributes in the work on the generation of referring expressions reported in \[Reiter and Dale, 1992\].

Our current solution to these problems is to sidestep them entirely: for each entity that has a potential confusor--for example, sheep and goats--we specify this explicitly in the 4There are clearly ideas we might use here in McCoy's \[1988\] work on correcting a user's misconceptions; however, the real issue here lies in determining whether such a misconception might arise from a generated comparison (see Zukerman and McConachy \[1993, 1995\] for some work in this area).
