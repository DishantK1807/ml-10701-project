Pointers, in various forms, allow one to efficiently represent infinite circular references, either directly (Goodman 1999), or indirectly (Goodman 1998).
J99-4004
More recent work (Pereira and Warren 1983; Pereira and Shieber 1987) demonstrates how to use deduction engines for parsing.
P83-1021
Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) showed how to compute some of the infinite summations in the inside semiring, those needed to compute the prefix probabilities of PCFGs in CNF.
J91-3004
wn. Jelinek and Lafferty (1991) and Stolcke (1993) both give algorithms for computing these prefix probabilities.
J91-3004
This uniform method of specifying grammar transformations is similar to, but clearer than, similar techniques used with covering grammars (Nijholt 1980; Leermakers 1989).
P89-1017
Outside probabilities have many uses, including for reestimating grammar probabilities (Baker 1979), for improving parser performance on some criteria (Goodman 1996b), for speeding parsing in some formalisms, such as data-oriented parsing (Goodman 1996a), and for good thresholding algorithms (Goodman 1997).
