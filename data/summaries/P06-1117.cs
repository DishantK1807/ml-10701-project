The sentences were processed using Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000) to generate parse trees automatically.

The same problem was again highlighted by the results obtained with and without the frame information in the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski, 2004) of FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2003) role labeling task.

Based on our observation and previous studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume that each ILC has a distinct frequency distribution of roles on different grammatical slots.

Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see (Litkowski, 2004) for more details).

Also, we considered some of the features designed by (Pradhan et al., 2005): First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, Subcategorization, Head Word of Prepositional Phrases and the Syntactic Frame feature from (Xue and Palmer, 2004).
W04-3212
The kernel that we employed in our experiments is based on the SCF structure devised in (Moschitti, 2004).

This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin’s classification, called Intersective Levin classes (ILCs) (Dang et al., 1998).
P98-1046
Therefore, we should rely on a semantic context alternative to the frame (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004).

A very recent example in this sense was provided by the CONLL 2005 shared task (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) on PropBank (PB) (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) role labeling.

(Baker and Ruppenhofer, 2002; Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004; Shi and Mihalcea, 2005).

We used support vector ma929 chines (Vapnik, 1995) with (a) polynomial kernels to learn the semantic role classification and (b) Tree Kernels (Moschitti, 2004) for learning both frame and ILC classification.

These are the initial features adopted by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (henceforth G&J) for both frame element identification and role classification.
J02-3001
A very good candidate seems to be the Intersective Levin class (ILC) (Dang et al., 1998) that can be found as well in other predicate resources like PB and VerbNet (VN) (Kipper et al., 2000).
P98-1046
This insight justifies the attempt to use ILCs instead of the frame feature when classifying FN semantic roles (Giuglea and Moschitti, 2004).
P04-1043
Several models have been developed for the automatic detection of the frame elements based on the FN corpus (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003; Litkowski, 2004).
