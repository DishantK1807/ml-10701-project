Cues In order to see whether our easily-computable surface cues are comparable in power to the structural cues used in Karlgren and Cutting (1994), we also ran LR with the cues used in their experiment.
C94-2174
These cues are not much discussed in the traditional literature on genre, but have come to the fore in recent work (Biber, 1995; Karlgren and Cutting, 1994).
C94-2174
An important and more relevant set of experiments, which deserves careful attention, is presented in Karlgren and Cutting {1994).
