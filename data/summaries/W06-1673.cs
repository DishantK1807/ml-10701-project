Passing on a k-best list gives useful improvements (e.g., in Koomen et al.(2005)), but efficiently enumerating k-best lists often requires very substantial cognitive and engineering effort, e.g., in (Huang and Chiang, 2005; Toutanova et al., 2005).

Although we use a PCFG for parsing, it is the grammar of (Klein and Manning, 2003), which uses extensive statesplitting, and so there is again a many-to-one correspondence between derivations and parses, and we use an algorithm similar to Goodmanâ€™s in our work.

It is therefore disappointing, but not surprising, that F-measures on SRL drop more than 10% when switching from gold parses to automatic parses (for instance, from 91.2 to 80.0 for the joint model of Toutanova (2005)).

Description MacCartney et al.(2006) describe a system for doing robust textual inference.

Nevertheless, for some models, such as most parsing models, these exponential labelings can be compactly represented in a packed form, e.g., (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1995; Crouch, 2005), and subsequent stages can be reengineered to work over these packed representations, e.g., (Geman and Johnson, 2002).

To generate sampled parses, we used the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003).

A common improvement on this architecture is to pass k-best lists between processing stages, for example (Sutton and McCallum, 2005; Wellner et al., 2004).

Parses Bod (1995) discusses parsing with probabilistic tree substitution grammars, which, unlike simple PCFGs, do not have a one-to-one mapping between output parse trees and a derivation (a bag of rules) that produced it, and hence the most-likely derivation may not correspond to the most likely parse tree.

Role Labeling For the past two years CoNLL has had shared tasks on SRL (Carreras and M`arquez (2004) and Carreras and M`arquez (2005)).

Unfortunately, we did not have enough time modify the code of (Haghighi et al., 2005) accordingly, so the k-best structure remained.

Description We modified the system described in Haghighi et al.(2005) and Toutanova et al.(2005) to test our method.
