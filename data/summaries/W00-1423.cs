We use the SPUD generator ("Sentence Planning Using Description") introduced in (Stone and Doran, 1997) to carry out this task for REA.

For example, multimodal managers have been described to allocate an underlying content representation for generation of text and graphics (Wahlster et al., 1991; Green et al., 1998).

Meanwhile, (Johnston et al., 1997; Johnston, 1998) describe a formalism for tightly-coupled interpretation which uses a grammar and semantic constraints to analyze input from speech and pen.

Our model of prominence is a simple local one similar to (Strube, 1998).
P98-2204
Once the user's words have been interpreted, a layer of production rules constructs obligations for response (Traum and Allen, 1994); then, a second layer plans to meet these obligations by deciding to present a specified kind of information about a specified object.
P94-1001
The semantic and pragmatic compatibility seen in the gesturespeech relationship recalls the interaction of words and graphics in multimodal presentations (Feiner and McKeown, 1991; Green et al., 1998; Wahlster et al., 1991 ).
W98-0210
Our generation framework adopts a goal-directed view of generation and casts knowledge about communicative action in the form of a grammar that specifies how forms combine, what interpretive effects they impart and in what contexts they are appropriate (Appelt, 1985; Moore, 1994; Dale, 1992; Stone and Doran, 1997).
