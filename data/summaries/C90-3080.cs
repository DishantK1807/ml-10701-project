Parser of QPATR The parser is based on a left-comer algorithm with backtracking for context-free grammars (cf Kilbury 1988 and Pereira/Shieber 1987: 179fO.

FSMs themselves are represented internally as a PROLOG list of feature-value pairs with a variable 382 remainder list (ef Eisele/D0rre 1986: 551; Oazdar/MeUish 1989: 228).

The unification package (2) uses techniques introduced by Eisele and D5rre (1986) and described by Gazdar and Mellish (1989) to implement the unification of FSMs with the term unification of PROLOG.
C86-1129
FSMs are described in QPATR with a logic generally based on that developed by Kasper and Rounds (1986).
