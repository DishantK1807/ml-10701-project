work 3.1 The knowledge acquisition bottleneck Brown et al.(1991) and Gale et al.(1992) used the translations of the ambiguous word in a bilingual corpus as sense tags.

Using MRDs for WSD was suggested in (Lesk, 1986); several researchers subsequently continued and improved this line of work (Krovetz and Croft, 1989; Guthrie et al., 1991; Veronis and Ide, 1990).

This can be done by smoothing the observed frequencies (Church and Mercer, 1993), or by class-based methods (Brown et al., 1991; Pereira and Tishby, 1992; Pereira et ah, 1993; Hirschman, 1986; Resnik, 1992; Brill et ah, 1990; Dagan et al., 1993).

In comparison, (Yarowsky, 1995) achieved 48 Table 1: A summary of the experimental results on four polysemous words.

Recently, Yarowsky (1995) combined a MIlD and a corpus in a bootstrapping process.

S Dagan and Itai (1991) used a bilingual lexicon and a monolingual corpus, to save the need for translating the corpus.

Many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993).

Another problem that affects the corpus-based WSD methods is the sparseness of data: these methods typically rely on the statistics of cooccurrences of words, while many of the possible cooccurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993).
J93-1001
Yarowsky (1992) learned discriminators for each Roget's category, saving the need to separate SMRD's are, of course, also constructed manually, but, unlike bilingual corpora, these are existing resources, made for general use.

The original training set (before the addition of the feedback sets) consisted of a few dozen examples, in comparison to thousands of examples needed in other corpus-based methods (Schutze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).
