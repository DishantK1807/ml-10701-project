Inverted semrel structure from a definition of motorist Researchers who produced spreading activation networks from MRDs, including Veronis and Ide (1990) and Kozima and Furugori (1993), typically only implemented forward links (from headwords to their definition words) in those networks.

This deficiency limits the characterization of word pairs such as river~bank (Wilks et al.1996) and write~pen (Veronis and Ide 1990) to simple relatedness, whereas the labeled relations of MindNet specify precisely the relations river---Part-->bank and write---Means--->pen.

Equivalent to the use of similarity determination in corpus-based approaches to infer absent n-grams or triples (e.g., Dagan et al.1994, Grishman and Sterling 1994), an inference procedure has been developed which allows semantic relations not presently in MindNet to be inferred from those that are.

There have been many other attempts to process dictionary definitions using heuristic pattern matching (e.g., Chodorow et al.1985), specially constructed definition parsers (e.g., Wilks et al.1996, Vossen 1995), and even general coverage syntactic parsers (e.g., Briscoe and Carroll 1993).

Syntagmatic strategies for determining similarity have often been based on statistical analyses of large corpora that yield clusters of words occurring in similar bigram and trigram contexts (e.g., Brown et al.1992, Yarowsky 1992), as well as in similar predicateargument structure contexts (e.g., Grishman and Sterling 1994).

For example, paradigmatic relations in WordNet have been used by many to determine similarity, including Li et al.(1995) and Agirre and Rigau (1996).
C96-1005
There have been a number of attempts to combine paradigmatic and syntagmatic similarity strategies (e.g., Hearst and Grefenstette 1992, Resnik 1995).

Current set of semantic relation types m MindNet These relation types may be contrasted with simple co-occurrence statistics used to create network structures from dictionaries by researchers including Veronis and Ide (1990), Kozima and Furugori (1993), and Wilks et al.(1996). Labeled relations, while more difficult to obtain, provide greater power for resolving both structural attachment and word sense ambiguities.

The massive network of inverted semrel structures contained in MindNet invalidates the criticism leveled against dictionary-based methods by Yarowsky (1992) and Ide and Veronis (1993) that LKBs created from MRDs provide spotty coverage of a language at best.
