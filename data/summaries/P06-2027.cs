Templates were used in the main IE competitions, the Message Understanding Conferences (Hobbs and Israel, 1994; Onyshkevych, 1994; Marsh and Perzanowski, 1997).

A response to a question about a terrorist attack might include the event, victims, perpetrator and date as the templates designed for the Message Understanding Conferences (Radev and McKeown, 1998; White et al., 2001) predicted.

A biography, for example, might contain the date of birth, occupation, or nationality of the person in question (Duboue and McKeown, 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Weischedel et al., 2004; Filatova and Prager, 2005).

Sudo et al.(2003) evaluated how well their IE patterns captured named entities of three predefined types.

In other closely related work, Sudo et al.(2003) use frequent dependency subtrees as measured by TF*IDF to identify named entities and IE patterns important for a given domain.

Here is a part of the slot structure we get for the verb killed after crossexamination of the terrorist attack instances: killed (NUMBER) (NNS people) (PERSON) killed (NN suicide) killed Slot structures are similar to verb frames, which are manually created for the PropBank annotation (Palmer et al., 2005).6 An example of the PropBank frame for the verb to kill is: Roleset kill.01 ”cause to die”: Arg0:killerArg1:corpse Arg2:instrument The difference between the slot structure extracted by our algorithm and the PropBank frame slots is that the frame slots assign a semantic role to each slot, while our algorithm gives either the type of the named entity that should fill in this slot or puts a particular noun into the slot (e.g., ORGANIZATION, earthquake, people).

Following (Sudo et al., 2003) we are interested only in the lexemes which are near neighbors of the most frequent verbs.

In the Conceptual Case Frame Acquisition project (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), extraction patterns, a domain semantic lexicon, and a list of conceptual roles and associated semantic categories for the domain are used to produce multiple-slot case frames with selectional restrictions.

The procedure of substituting named entities with their respective tags previously proved to be useful for various tasks (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al., 2003; Filatova and Prager, 2005).

Huttunen et al.(2002) analyze how component subevents of the domain are linked together and discuss the factors which contribute to the domain complexity.

In contrast to deep semantic analysis (Fillmore and Baker, 2001; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Harabagiu and L˘ac˘atus¸u, 2005; Palmer et al., 2005) we rely only on corpus statistics.

Many of the current approaches of domain modeling collapse together different instances and make the decision on what information is important for a domain based on this generalized corpus (Collier, 1998; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Sudo et al., 2003).

Deciding what slots to include in the template, and what restrictions to place on their potential fillers, is a knowledge representation problem (Hobbs and Israel, 1994).
