5. Integration of a focus module into speech synthesis systems FDA, presented here on the basis of an operable definition of focus, enables the integration of a focus module into speech synthesis system; specifically, the output of FDA, i.e., the focus pattern of the message conveyed by the utterance, may be fed into a subsequent accent assignment module, one in the spirit of the Focus-Accent Theory of Dirksen (1992) and Dirksen & Quene (1993).
