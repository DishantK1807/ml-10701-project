Vauquois and Boitet (1985), Nagao et al.(1985), Alshawi et al.(1991), AUegranza et al.(1991) presupposes a language-pair specific module that transforms a structure which is the output of analysis into one that is the input to generation.

In fact, much recent linguistic work assumes exactly this conception of a grammar see e.g Uszkoreit (1986), Karttunen (1989), Pollard and Sag (1987), Zeevat et al.(1987), Baschung et al.(1987), Gunji (1987), Whitelock (1991b).

The transfer approach is preferable in this respect, but it suffers from the difficulty of formulating declarative statements of complex equivalences, such as those discussed by Kaplan et al.(1989), Odijk (1989), Sadler et al.(1989, 1990), Sadler and Thompson (1991).

Space precludes discussion of our treatment for such cases, which is based on the use of sorted LF variables as described in Moens et al.(1989). Assuming equivalences such as (4) for proper names, translation between (5a) and (Sb) will be mediated by the equivalence between bags shown in (6), in which signs are abbreviated by their citation values.

At minimum, equivalent words may have overlapping or properly subsuming senses rather than identical senses (see e.g Tsujii and Fujita (1991)), but more radical, structural differences are commonplace.

Uchida and Sugiyama (1980), Lytinen and Shank (1982), R6sner (1986), Nirenburg et al.(1991)) is characterised by the assumption that the output of analysis and the input to generation are isomorphic structures.

The appropriate preposition (<cite> = L I), is an element with 'identity semantics' (Calder et al.1989), so its index is equated in the monolingual lexicon with that of its syntactic object.

But as Ramsay (1991) points out, only a fraction of the possible sentences of a semantic representation language will correspond directly to natural language expressions.

Brown et al.(1990)). Since Shake-and-Bake generation is an NPcomplete problem (see Brew, this conference), there is no tractable general algorithm.

23.28. 1992 inference needed to compute one from the other is clearly undecidable in the general case for logics rich enough to represent linguistic meaning (Shieber, 1988), and intractable even in the simplest cases, with associativity and commutativity of conjunction (Calder et al.1989). Heuristics to guide such inference can only be specific to the languages in the system, since it is these which determine the logical forms that actually occur.
