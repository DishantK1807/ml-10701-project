As a lower bound, parsing strategies with discontinuous spans in both dimensions can take time Ω(|G|Nc√n) for unfriendly permutations (Satta and Peserico, 2005).

Previous work on this problem has been presented in Zhang et al.(2006), where a method is provided for casting an SCFG to a form with rank k = 2.

CFGs and permutation trees We begin by describing the synchronous CFG formalism, which is more rigorously de ned by Aho and Ullman (1972) and Satta and Peserico (2005).
H05-1101
Variations of SCFGs go back to Aho and Ullman (1972)’s Syntax-Directed Translation Schemata, but also include the Inversion Transduction Grammars in Wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in Chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the Multitext Grammars in Melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as Yamada and Knight (2001) and Galley et al.(2004). When viewed as a rewriting system, an SCFG generates a set of string pairs, representing some translation relation.
