In Figure I we show a fragment from the hand crafted lexicon developed as part of the morphology project (Russell et al., 1986).

as OEquL Finally, verb senses containing a \[T2\], \[T3\] or iT4\] code, or an \[I2\], \[13\] or \[I4\] code are classified as SEquL Below we give examples of each type; for a detailed description see Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).

Indeed, we have demonstrated the feasibility (Alshawi et al., 1985) of driving a parsing system directly from the information av~lable in LDOCE by constructing dictionary entries for the PATR-H system (Shieber, 1984).

We have mounted the dictionary on-line and, following its conversion into a flexible lexical knowledge base (as described in Boguraev et M., 1987), a range of experiments have since been carried out with the aim of establishing LDOCE's appropriateness to the task of deriving a word list with associated grammatical definitions indexed to the analyser grammar.

Arguably, these errors ~o derive mostly from errors in the dictionary, rather than a defect of the rule; see Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) for further discussion.
