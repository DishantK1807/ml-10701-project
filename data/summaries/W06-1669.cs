In preliminary work (Agirre et al., 2006), we have shown that HyperLex compares favorably to other unsupervised systems.

In (Agirre et al., 2006) we tuned the parameters using the mapping strategy for evaluation.

as supervised WSD: mapping hubs to senses (Agirre et al., 2006) presents a straightforward framework that uses hand-tagged material in order to map the induced senses into the senses used in a gold standard . The WSD system rst tags the training part of some hand-annotated corpus with the induced hubs.

S3LS-best stands for the the winner of S3LS (Mihalcea et al., 2004), which is 8.3 points over our method.

More recently, tagged corpora have been used to map the induced senses, and then compare the systems over publicly available benchmarks (Puran587 dare and Pedersen, 2004; Niu et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2006), which offers the advantage of comparing to other systems, but converts the whole system into semi-supervised.

Existing hand-annotated corpora like SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), which is annotated with WordNet senses (Fellbaum, 1998) allow for a small improvement over the simple most frequent sense heuristic, as attested in the all-words track of the last Senseval competition (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).

The last 5 rows of Table 2 show several unsupervised systems, all of which except Cymfony (Niu et al., 2005) and (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) participated in S3LS (check (Mihalcea et al., 2004) for further details on the systems).

Another system similar to ours is (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004), which unfortunately was evaluated on Senseval 2 data and is not included in the table.

These hubs are used as a representation of the senses induced by the system, the same way that clusters of examples are used to represent senses in clustering approaches to WSD (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004).

the words occurring in the context), and the induced senses are either clusters of examples (Schcurrency1utze, 1998; Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) or clusters of words (Pantel and Lin, 2002).

Graph-based methods have gained attention in several areas of NLP, including knowledge-based WSD (Mihalcea, 2005; Navigli and Velardi, 2005) and summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).

Given the scarce amount of training data available in Semcor (Miller et al., 1993), supervised systems barely improve upon the simple most frequent heuristic.

The system coming closer to ours is that described in (Niu et al., 2005).
