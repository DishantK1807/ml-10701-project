3Clark (1997) presents a term "discourse topic" as concept equivalent to focus space in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), and call their transition "discourse transition".

First, discourse structure is indispensable for selecting cue phrase as claimed in previous studies (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Eugenio et al., 1997).

In (Moser and Moore, 1995a; Moser and Moore, 1995b), the relationship between placement and selection of cue phrases was investigated using the core:contributor relations among units within a segment (Moser and Moore, 1995a).

Moser and Moore (1995a) and Moser and Moore (1995b) investigated the relationship between cue placement and selection.

From this point of view, task structure is expected to be effective because discourse structure strongly reflects task structure in task oriented dialogue (Grosz, 1977; Guindon, 1986).
J86-3001 P86-1034
We define discourse segment (or simply segment) as chunks of utterances that have a coherent goal (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Nakatani et al., 1995; Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

Cohen's Kappa ~ (Bakeman and Gottman, 1986; Carletta, 1996).

As the result of classifying these 31 cue phrases based on the classification of Japanese connectives (Ichikawa, 1978; Moriyama, 1997) and cue phrase classification in Enghsh (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Knott and Dale, 1994; Moser and Moore, 1995b), 20 cue phrases, which occurred total of 848 times, were classified into three classes: changeover, such as soredeha, deha ("now", "now then" in English), conjunctive, such as sore.de, de ("and", "and then"), and ordinal, such as mazu, tsugini ("first", "next").

They signal topic shifts and changes in attentional state (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) as well as expressing the relation between the individual units of discourse (Moore, 1995; RSsner and Stede, 1992).

As indicated in (Eugenio et al., 1997), in terms of natural language generation, cue usage consists of three problems, occurrence: whether or not a cue should be included, placement: where the cue should be placed, and selection: what cue should be used.

pop, push), the taxonomies of cue phrases have been presented (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Cohen, 1984; Schiffrin, 1987).

In terms of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1987), it is considered that the basic structure of such kind of discourse is constructed by connecting segments that refer to goals or primitive actions with "sequence" relation (RSsner and Stede, 1992; Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994).

While the empirical approach of this study is close to that of (Eugenio et al., 1997), they apply a machine learning technique to predicating cue occurrence and placement, not cue phrase selection.

Elhadad and McKeown (1990), on the other hand, has presented a model for distinguishing connectives, which link two propositions, using some pragmatic constraints.

In addition, in order to get an intuitive feel of overall performance, we also calculated the sum of the deviation from ideal values in each metric as in (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).
