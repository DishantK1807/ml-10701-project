Collins (1996) proposed a statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree.

Li and Abe (1996) also studied a method for learning dependencies between case slots and evaluated the discovered dependencies in the syntactic disambiguation task.

We have already applied the maximum entropy methods(Pietra, Pietra, and Lafferty, 1995; Berger, Pietra, and Pietra, 1996) to this task(Utsuro, Miyata, and Matsumoto, 1997) and are also planning to evaluate the effectiveness of the MDL principle(Rissanen, 1989) when combining with the maximum entropy method.

Y~) Now, the problem of learning probabilistic subcategorization preference is stated as: for every verb-noun collocation e in C, estimating the probability distribution P((fl, 6Resnik (1993) applys the idea of the KL distance to measuring the association of a verb v and its object noun class c.

As lexical/semantic information, Black (1993) used about 50 semantic categories, while Magerman (1995) used lexicai forms of words.

For example, in the context of syntactic disambiguation, Black (1993) and Magerman (1995) proposed statistical parsing models based-on decisiontree learning techniques, which incorporated not only syntactic but also lexical/semantic information in the decision-trees.

The details of the experimental results are available in Utsuro and Matsumoto (1997).

Resnik (1993) and Li and Abe (1995) studied how to find an optimal abstraction level of an argument noun in a treestructured thesaurus.

7Another related measure is Dunning (1993)'s likelihood ratio tests for binomial and multinomial distributions, which are claimed to be effective even with very much smaller volumes of text than is necessary for other tests based on assumed normal distributions.

5In Utsuro and Matsumoto (1997), we defined another subcategorization preference function ev which is based4.1 Nominal Parts of (Partial) Subcategorization Frames First, let fp, fpl,'",fpn be the nominal parts of (partial) subcategorization fl'ames f, fl,-.., fn in the equations (2) and (4), respectively: fp = Pk : Ck$ fP = fPl A"" Afp.
