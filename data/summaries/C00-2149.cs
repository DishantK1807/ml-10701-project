More recently, techniques have been appearing for the generation from packed structures (Shemtov, 1997), the transfer between packed structures (Emele and Dorna, 1998; Rayner and Bouillon, 1995), and the integration of such mechanisms into the whole translation process (Kay, 1999; Frank, 1999).
P98-1060
The method proposed is related to those of (Emele and Dorna, 1998) and (Kay, 1999).
P98-1060
The representations of (Emele and Dorna, 1998) and (Kay, 1999) arc based on a notion of propositional contexts (see (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1991)), where each possible non-ambiguous reading included ill the packed source representation is extracted by selecting the value (true or false) of a certain number of propositional variables that index elements of the labelled source graph.
