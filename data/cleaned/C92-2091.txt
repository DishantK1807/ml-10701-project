cam. ac .uk Abstract A novel approach to Machine Translation (MT), called Shake-and-Bake, is presented, which exploits recent advances iLL Computational Linguistics in terms of tile increased spread of lexicMist unification-based grammar theories.
It is argued that it overcomes some difficulties encountered by transfer and interfingual methods.
It offers a greater modularity of the monolingual components, which can be written with independence of each other, using purely monofinguM considerations.
These are put into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon.
The Shake-and-Bake approach for MT consists of parsing the Source Language in any usual way, then looking up the words in the bilinguM lexicon, and finally generating from tile set of translations of these words, but allowing the Target Language grammar to instantiate tile relative word ordering, taking advantage of the fact that the parse produces lexical and phrasal signs which are highly constrained (specifically in the semantics).
TILe main algorithm presented for generation is a variation on the well-known CKY one used for parsing.
A toy bidirectional MT system was written to translate between Spanish and Enghsh, and some of the entries are shown.
1 Motivation
'l/he research reported here was motivated by the desire to exploit recent trends in Computational *The work reported here was carried out at the University of Edinburgh under the support of a studentship from the Science and Engineering Research Council.
Thanks to Ann Copestake, Mark Ilepple, Antonio Sanfilippo, Arturo Trujillo, Pete Whitelock and the anonymous reviewers for their colnlltents, Any error8 relnaJn lay own.
Linguistics, such as tile appearance of lexicalist unification-ba~sed grammar formalisms for the purposes of machine translation, in an attempt to overcoine what are perceived to be some of tile major shortcomings of transfer and inter\]ingual at~proaches.
With a transfer-based MT system, the transfer component is very imcch language-pair specific, and must be written bearing very closely in mind both monofingual components in order to ensure compatibifity.
Depending on how much work is clone by the analysis and generation components, the tasks carried out by the transfer element may vary, but iLL gener',d this module is very idiosyncratic and will involve several hundred transfer rules.
Writing these transfer rules is the most time-consmning aspect of the design of a transferbased system, as it nlust be consistent with hoth nlonolingual grammars.
The process is therefore error-prone, and the result is not very portable, since the consequences of making changes to the monolingual components may be far-reaching as far as the transfer rules are concerned.
One of the mMu difficulties with interlingual approaches is what Laudsbergen \[Landsbergen 87\] refers to as the subset problem.
If the system is to be robust, it is essential to guarantee that any interlingual formula derived from ally Source Language (SL) expression is amenable to generation into tile Target Language (TL).
If the interlingua is powerful enough to represent all the meanings in all tile languages involved, there will be several t probably iatlnitely many) formulae in that inter ingua which are logically equivalent to the one produced by the analyser.
It cannot then be guaranteed that this fornmla comes under the coverage or the TL generator, unless we can draw logical inferences in the interfingua.
The complexity of this task may be eompntationMly daunting, since suh-problems of this (such as satistiability and non-tautology) are known to be Nl'-complete (\[Garey and Johnson 1979\]).
The approach presented here bears some similarity with that of \[Alshawi et al 91\], which uses AcrEs DE COLING-92, NAIVI'~.

23-28, 1992 the algorithm of \[Shieber et al.90\] for generation from quasi-logical forms.
On the other hand, generation here takes place from a set of TL lexical items, with instantiated semantics, which makes the task easier.
This approach was tested with independentlywritten grammars for small yet linguistically interesting fragments of Spanish and English, which are used both for parsing and generation.
These are put into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon containing the kind of information one might expect to find in an ordinary bilingual dictionary.
2 The
grammar formalism A version of Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (\[Calder et al.88\]) is used.
Like many other current grammatical formalisms (\[Shieber 86\], \[Pollard and Sag 87\], \[Uszkoreit 86D, it represents linguistic objects by sets of feature (or attribute)-value pairs, called signs.
The values of these signs may be atomic, variables or further sets feature-value pairs.
They can therefore be represented as directed acyclic graphs or as attribute-value matrices using the PATR-II notation of \[Shieber 86\].
The notion of unification is then used to combine these.
The main features used in the signs are ORTHOGRAPHY, CAT (the categorial grammar syntax), OItDER (the directionality of the "slash", which specifies linear ordering), FEATS (a set of syntactic features), CASES (a case-assignment mechanism built on top of standard UCG), and SEM, a unification-based semantics with a neoDavidsonian treatment of roles (\[Parsons 80, Dowty 89\]).
The semantics of an expression is of the form I:P, where lis a variable for the semantic index of the whole expression, and P is a conjunction of propositions in which that index appears.
In addition, features called ARGO, ARG\] and so on provide useful "handles" for allowing the bilingual lexicon to access the semantic indices, but they are not strictly necessary for the grammars The signs presented are only shorthand abbreviations of the full ones used, and the interested reader is referred to \[Beaven 92\] for a more complete view.
The PATR-II notation will be used, with the Prolog convention that names starting with upper case stand for variables.
In addition, for the sake of clarity and brevity, the nonessential features will be omitted, as will be their names when these are are obvious.
The grammar rules used subsume both functional application and composition, but for the examples given here, only functional application will be necessary.
An important feature of this approach is that this will make it possible to have an MT system in which no meaningful elements in the translation relation are introduced syncategorematically (in the form of transfer rules or operations with interlingual representations).
In particular, assuming we have very rich lexicai entries (which contain information about various dimensions of the language, such as orthography, syntax and semantics), all that is needed is a correspondence between the lexieai entries, supplied by a bilingual lexicon, together with a set of constraints for each correspondence.
The design of such a translation system will therefore involve three components: two monolingual lexicons for the languages concerned, and a bilingual lexicon.
The Spanish and English components were designed using purely monolingual considerations, and as a consequences the treatments of English and Spanish grammars are quite different.
The basics of the grammar will be explained by presenting the monolingual lexical entries required for the Spanish sentence Maria visit6 Madrid, which corresponds to the English Mary visited Madrid.
More linguistically interesting sentences will be offered at a later stage.
2.1 The
Spanish Grammar The Spanish grammar is somewhat an unconventional version of UCG, in that VPs are treated as sentences (S), and NPs as sentence modifiers (S/S in the eategorial notation).
The reasons for this decision have to do with accounting for subject pro-drop, and are discussed in \[Whitehick 88\] and \[\[leaven 92\].
A ease-assignment mechanism is added to standard UCG.
Amongst other uses, it provides a coverage of clitic placement.
NPs are sentence modifiers.
The following one, for instance, looks for a sentence with semantics 11: Seml, and returns another sentence, in which the semantics have been modified to state that F3 (an index standing for Maria), plays a certain (unspecified) role in the semantics of 11.
The operation U stands for set union, and "all the propositions in the semantics are interpreted here as being conjoined.
(1) (c RTItO 'M a(ia' \] AT s/ s I1 : Seml SEM II: (\[role(I1,_R1,F3),'~ U Seml IS A !,name(F3,maria)J " no0 F3 Since intransitive verbs axe sentences, a transitive verb must be a sentence looking for its object NP (now S/S), which makes sure that this object gets identified with index Y (which fills tile patient AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 not~r 1992 6 0 4 Paoc, OF COLING-92, NANTES, AUG.
23-28, 1992 role).
This is carried out by the case-assignment mechanism, not shown here.
The following entry for tim transitive verb will be derived from the base form and abstract tense morphemes (see below).
(2) ORTHO visit6 fvisitar(E), ) (rolc(E,pat,Y) J J \[Sem SEM Sem ARGO E ARG1 X ARG2 Y The third NP used just parallels tim first one: sentence: (5) ORTHO Maria visit6 Madrid CAT S SEM E : ARGO E AUG1 F3 ARG2 L3 visitar(E), role(E,agt,F3), name(F3,maria), role(E,pat,L3), name(L3,madrid) Since Spanish word order is relatively free (and in particular since the OVS ordering is possible), the verb does not put tight constraints on the directionality of the NPs.
The case-assignment mechanism, which identifies the indices of the NPs, can be used to interact with the ORDER feature if this is desired.
In tim above example, the only thing that prevents the assignment of agent role to Madrid and patient role to Maria are constraints on the semantic types of the arguments of the verb.
(3) A RTIIO 'Mairid' \] CAT s/ s 13 : Sem3 s~M I3: ({role0a,_m,L3), \] U Sere3 \[name(L3,madrid)J RG0 L3 Signs (2) and (3) combine by means of function application to produce the following sentence: (4) ORTUO visit6 Madrid CAT s \[visitar(E), ~ro|e(E,agt,Xl), SEM E : /role(E,pat,L3~, I.name(L3,madrid) ARGO E ARol X3 ARG2 L3 It does not subcategorize for anything, but it may be modiIied by the NP (3) to give the following 2.2 The English Grammar The English grammar is virtually taken "off the shelf" and closely resembles that of \[Calder et al.88\], with only the addition of a case-assignment mechanism (not shown here).
A simple NP is as follows: (6) Ii RTtl O 'Mary' 1 CAT nil SEM G3: { ......
(G3 ..... y)} R(~0 G3 J A transitive verb subcategorizes for its object and its subject NPs.
Again, the following one is derived from that of the base form and abstract inflectional morphemes: (7) ORTHO visited ~A~ s / /X2:Sem4/ / /fvisiting(E2), /~ SEM E2: |(role(E2,pat,Y2) J \u Seml o Sem2 / ARGO E2 ARG1 X2 ARG~ Y2 ACqES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AO~I" 1992 6 0 5 PROC.

23-28, 1992 The remaining NP is: the semantic indices of the two monolinguM signs.
(s) li RTH O 'Madrid' \] CAT np s~ v3: {n~me(V3,m~y)} R°0 F3 J 2.3 Structure of the bilingual lexicon Tile bilingual lexicon merely puts into correspom dence pairs of monolingual lexieM entries.
In other words, each entry in the bilingual lexicon will contain a pair of pointers to monolingual em tries in each of the languages translated.
These monolingual entries are very rich signs, and the bilingual entries may add constraints for their monolingual signs to be in the translation relation.
For instance, if a word has more than one translation depending on how various semantic featnres become instantiated, the bilinguM lexical entries may express these restrictions.
The bilingual lexicon writer needs to be aware of what the monolingual lexicons look like, in order to encode the restrictions that the bilingual sign imposes on the monollngual entries.
As long as some broad conventions are followed, this task becomes very straightforward.
Most bilingual correspondences are very simple, and merely require some semantic indices in the monolingual signs to be unified.
Provided these indices are made easily available in predictable places of tile monolingum signs, the task of writing the corresponding lexical entries is very simple.
When some semantic constraints need to be put on these indices, again it is a straightforward task.
It is only on the occasions when syntactic constraints have to be included that the monollnguM signs need to be examined more closely, in order to determine how that syntactic information is encoded.
This results in a great modularity in the system.
Any monolingual component may easily be changed, without affecting to any significant extent the bilingual lexicon, and certainly not tile monollngual components for any other language.
At the same time, the simplicity of the bilingual component makes it practicable to write multilanguage systems, since all the hard work goes into the monolingual lexicons which may be reused for many language pairs, and the languagepair-specific information is concisely kept in the bilingual lexicon.
The following examples represent entries in the bilingual lexicon.
Such an entry consists of pointers to monolingual signs (for instance, (9) pnts signs (1) and (6)into correspondence), together with constraints about the semantic indices contalned in these signs.
Thus example (9) identifies (9) (10) \[AnG0 E SPANISH \[~ \[AItG1 X\] L An°2 ENGI~ISlI \[~ IhnG1 LARG2 (The above is not exactly the entry as it appears ill the billngnai lexicon, since correspondences between morphemes are used, but it clarifies the exposition).
(11) SPANISII ~ \[;EM \[AnGO F3 Ill this very simple example, there was a oneto-one correspondence between monolinguM entries.
More generally, tile hilinguM lexicon will encode correspondences between sets of nlonolingual entries, with appropriate constraints on them (which allows us to enter idioms in the bilingual lexicon).
Most of the time these will be singletons, but they may occasiomflly contain several elements or indeed one of them may be empty (if a word in one language corresponds to the empty string in the other, as will sometimes occur with function words).
3 Shake-and-Bake A new algorithm for generation, developcd by Pete Whitelock and Mike Reape, and known as Shake-and-Bake is presented (see \[Whitelock 92\] for further discussion).
It can be outlined as follows: first of all the SL expression is parsed using the SL (monolingual) grammar.
After the parse is complete the variables in the semantic indices are Skolemised, and lexical entries are looked up in the bilingual lexicon and replaced with their TL equivalents.
Generation then takes place starting from the bag of TL lexical entries, which have their semantic indices instantiated as a result of the parsing and look-up process.
Two well-known parsing algorithms (shift-reduce and CKY) have been adapted to do this kind of ACTES DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 AO~" 1992 6 0 6 PROC.
OF COLING-92, NAtCrEs, AUG.
23-28. 1992 generation instead.
Generation in tiffs context can be seen ms a variation of parsing, in which we let ttm syntactic constraints instantiate the word order rather than letting the word order drive the parsing process.
The CKY parsing algorithm may be eharacterised a~ follows: it uses a chart or table where all well-formed substrings (WFSs) that are found are recorded, together with their position (i.e.
the words that they span in the string).
The table is initialised with tile n words of the input string.
The algorithm builds parses by tinding the shorter WFSs before the longer ones.
For all integers j between 2 attd n, it records all WFSs of length j by looking for two adjacent strings of length k and j k recorded on the table.
If they may combine hy means of a grammar rule, the result is recorded on the table.
The algorithm may be modified for generating strings from a bag of lexical entries.
The table here no longer records the position of WFSs, but just the WFSs with the set of entries from the bag that they are made from.
It is initialised by recording first all the well-formed strings of length 1 (the lexieal entries).
Then, for all integers j from 2 to n (the cardinality of the bag), it looks for two disjoint WFSs of length k and j k recorded in the table.
If they combine by means of an (unordered) grammar rule, the resulting string (with orthography specified hy the direction of the combination) is recorded on the table, together with the set of entries it involves (the union of the sets of the two components): Starting from the bag of TL signs above, this algorithm would first put the verb and object together into a component, and then combine the result of that with the subject of the sentence.
Linear ordering is determined hy tile TL grammar and the fact that the semantic indices a~'e instantiated by the tinm generation takes place.
4 Morphology
and Further examples Finally we shall see how Shake-and-Bake handles more interesting examples, in particular those involving argument switching and head switching.
Entries for verbs such as the ones shown above are derived from the base forms and single morphemes.
\]~br instance, visitedis derived from morphemes for visit, 3sg and past.
A similar thing is clone for Spanish, and the bilingual lexicon actually puts into correspondence the hase forms and the separate morphemes.
Correspondences between morphemes will be used from here on.
4.1 Argument
switching Argument switching, such as John likes Mary, which translates into Spanish as Maria gusta a Juan (literally Mary pleases John can be covered in a very simple manner.
The monolingual verbs closely resemble (2) and (7).
Their essential features are just: (12) I :)RTttO like \] flike(E1), \]\[ SEM El: ~role(Ei,experi .......
X1),~/ \[,role(E 1,stimulus,Y 1) J/ ARC,(} \[;1 J { xnG1 X1 LARG2 Y1 (13) IAttTIIO gust\[gustar(E2), \]\] SEM E2: ~role(E2,stimuh,s,X2), 7| \[role(E2,experiencer,Y2) J | nG 0 E2 / 1 \]AUG l X2 \[AU¢;2 Y2 The hilingual entry merely needs to cross-identify the semantic indices: (14) qI'ANISH ENGLISh \[~ i \[ARGO i\] \] \[ARG2 ARGO E EM {ARG1 LARG2 4.2 Head switching A harder example is when the head word in one language corresponds to a non-head in the other, such as Mary swam across the river, which translates as Mama cruz6 el rio nadando (literally Mary crossed the river swimming).
This can be solved by putting into correspondence across with the stem cruzas a possible translation pair, together with the base form swim with nadando.

5 Conclusion
I hope to have shown how lexically-driven Machine Translation makes it possible to write modern, unification-based monolingual grammars with great independence from each other, and to put them into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon of a similar degree of complexity as one might expect to find in a commonly available bilingual dictionary, which could make it easier to automate its construction.
These points were demonstrated by constructing two monolingual Unification Categorial Grammars for small fragments of Spanish and English, which nevertheless included some lingnistically interesting phenoinena.
They were written independently, and with purely monolingual considerations in mind, which led to some noticeable differences in the grammar design.
The monolim gual components were put into correspondence by means of a bilingual lexicon, and algorithms for parsing, doing bilingual lookup and generation were suggested, which together constitute what has been named Shake-and-Bake Translation.
While the process of Shake and Bake generation itself is NP-complete, it is likely that average case complexity may be reasonable (\[Brew 92\]).
In this sense, Shake and Bake may address issues raised by the Landsbergen's subset problem, since inference in an interlingua may not even be decidable.
