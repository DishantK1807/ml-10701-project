After experimenting with several tagging methods, we concluded that the approach presented in Walker and Whittaker (1990) adopted from (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988) best captured the aspects of the dialogue we were interested in and, as with the DAs, could be tagged reliably on our data.

We are pursuing another line of research which looks at automatic error detection, described in (Aberdeen et al., 2001).
