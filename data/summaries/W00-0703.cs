This view is clearly shared by other workers who are actively developing analogical methods for natural language processing tasks (Pirrelli and Federici, 1995; Jones, 1996; Yvon, 1996; 1997; Bagshaw, 1998; Pirrelli and Yvon, 1999).

Recent Improvements: The implementation used here features several enhancements over the original Dedina and Nusbaum (D&N) system (Marchand and Damper, 2000).

The simulations were obtained for a model with damage in the third and fourth multistrategies (see Marchand and Damper, 2000, for detailed specification) and only substrings of length between 2 and 4 can be segmented in pattern matching.

We have previously developed pronunciation by analogy (PbA) as a model of reading aloud and as a method for automatic phonemisation in text-to-speech synthesis (Sullivan and Damper, 1993; Damper and Eastmond, 1997; Marchand and Damper, 2000).
