We extend the similar work that we have done (Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006) by proposing an alternative algorithm for cognate transfer that effectively projects the Spanish emission probabilities into Portuguese.

Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) create a dictionary of regular inflectional affix changes and their associated POS and on the basis of it, generate hypothesized inflected forms following the regular paradigms.

7.1 Resource-light approaches to Romance languages Cucerzan and Yarowsky (2002) present a method for bootstrapping a fine-grained, broad coverage POS tagger in a new language using only one person-day of data acquisition effort.

Some have assumed only partially tagged training corpora (Merialdo, 1994); some have begun with small tagged seed wordlists (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) for named-entity tagging, while others have exploited the automatic transfer of an already existing annotated resource in a min e-even e-cognates Tag: 56.9 77.2 82.1 POS: 65.3 84.2 87.6 SubPOS: 61.7 83.3 86.9 gender: 70.4 87.3 90.2 number: 78.3 95.3 96.0 case: 93.8 96.8 97.2 possessor’s num: 85.4 96.7 97.0 form: 92.9 99.2 99.2 person: 74.5 91.2 92.7 tense: 90.7 95.1 96.1 mood: 91.5 95.0 96.0 participle: 99.9 100.0 100.0 Table 4: Tagging Brazilian Portuguese different genres or a different language (e.g.

Similarly to Mann and Yarowsky (2001), we show that languages are often close enough to others within their language family so that cognate pairs between the two are common, and significant portions of the translation lexicon can be induced with high accuracy where no bilingual dictionary or parallel corpora may exist.
H01-1035 N01-1020 N01-1026
Similarly as Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), we assume that, in any language, vowels are more mutable in inflection than consonants, thus for example replacing a for i is cheaper that replacing s by r.

Mann and Yarowsky (2001) present a method for inducing translation lexicons based on trasduction modules of cognate pairs via bridge languages.
