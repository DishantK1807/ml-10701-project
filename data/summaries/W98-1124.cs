However, in the discourse formalization proposed by Marcu ( 1996; 1997c), it is assumed that whenever a discourse relation holds between two textual spans, that relation also holds between the salient units (nuclei) associated with those spans.

According to the shape-based metric, we consider that a discourse tree A is "better" than another discourse tree B if A is more skewed to the right than B (see Marcu (1997c) for a mathematical formulation of the notion of skewedness).

The only disambiguation metric that we used in our previous work (Marcu, 1997b) was the shape-based metric, according to which the "best" trees are those that are skewed to the right.

This result outperforms significantly the previous 52.77% recall and 50.00% precision figures that were obtained by Marcu using only the shape-based heuristic (1997c; 1997a).

For example, when the text shown in (1), below, is given as input to the rhetorical parsing algorithm that is discussed in detail by Marcu (1997b; 1997c), it is broken into ten elementary units (those surrounded by square brackets).

The second corpus consisted of five Scientific American texts whose elementary textual units (clause-like units) were labelled by 13 human judges as being very important, somewhat important, or unimportant (see (Marcu, 1997c) for the details of the experiment).

Some of them assume that important sentences are located at the beginning or end of paragraphs (Baxendale, 1958) or at positions that can be determined through training for each particular text genre (Lin and Hovy, 1997).

Other systems assume that important sentences in texts contain "bonus" words and phrases, such as significant, important, in conclusion and In this paper we show, while unimportant sentences contain "stigma" words such as hardly and impossible (Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1997).

The similarity is computed using a traditional cosine metric, in the style of Hearst (1997).

And, yet, others assume that important sentences and clauses are derivable from a discourse representation of texts (Ono et al., 1994; Marcu, 1997a; Marcu, 1997c).

Research in summarization (Baxendale, 1958; Edmundson, 1968; Kupiec et al., 1995; Lin and Hovy, 1997) has shown that, in genres with stereotypical structure, important sentences are often located at the beginning or end of paragraphs/documents.

By applying this algorithm, Marcu (1997a; 1997c) has built a summarization system that recalled 52.77% (with precision 50.00%) of the clause-like units that were considered important by human judges in a collection of:five texts.
