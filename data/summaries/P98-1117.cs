For instance, to produce sentence alignments, Brown et al.(1991) and Gale and Church (1991) both proposed methods that completely ignored the lexical content of the texts and both reported accuracy levels exceeding 98%.

Once the search space is reduced, the system aligns the sentences using the well-known sentence-length model described in (Gale and Church, 1991).

In addition, most research efforts were directed towards the easiest problem, that of sentence-to-sentence alignment (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Debili, 1992; Kay and l~scheisen, 1993; Simard et al., 1992; Simard and Plamondon, 1996).

Alignment at the word and term level, which is extremely useful for applications such as lexieal resource extraction, is still a largely unexplored research area(Melamed, 1997).
P97-1039
Such a tool has proved extremely useful not only for translators, but also for bilingual lexicographers (Langlois, 1996) and terminologists (Dagan and Church, 1994).

RALI/Sallgn The second method proposed by RALI is based on a dynamic programming scheme which uses a score function derived from a translation model similar to that of (Brown et al., 1990).
