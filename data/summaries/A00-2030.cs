Structure In our statistical model, trees are generated according to a process similar to that described in (Collins 1996, 1997).

Since 1995, a few statistical parsing algorithms (Magerman, 1995; Collins, 1996 and 1997; Charniak, 1997; Rathnaparki, 1997) demonstrated a breakthrough in parsing accuracy, as measured against the University of Pennsylvania TREEBANK as a gold standard.

We were already using a generative statistical model for part-of-speech tagging (Weischedel et al.1993), and more recently, had begun using a generative statistical model for name finding (Bikel et al.1997). Finally, our newly constructed parser, like that of (Collins 1997), was based on a generative statistical model.

For purposes of pruning, and only for purposes of pruning, the prior probability of each constituent category is multiplied by the generative probability of that constituent (Goodman, 1997).

Word features are introduced primarily to help with unknown words, as in (Weischedel et al.1993). We illustrate the generation process by walking through a few of the steps of the parse shown in Figure 3.
