(\].()00) alld Buchholz et al.(1999) both describe learning systems to find GRs.

(1999) GR finder used the GRs annotated in the Penn 3~'eelmnk (Marcus el; al., 1993)), one will have to either manually write rules to find tile GIs or mmotate a training corpus tbr the desired set.

(1.999) on finding GIls to verbs 1 by retraining the memory-based learner with tile data used in Ferro et al.(1999). We find that the transformation versus memory-based difference only seems to cause a small difference in the results.

For exmnple, Ferro et al.(1999) is interested in semantic interpretation, and needs to differentiate between time, location and other modifiers.

rl'he former (TI) uses transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill and Resnik, 1994) aim the latter (MB) uses lnemory-bascd learning (l)aelemans et al., 1999).
C94-2195
Also, having less differentiation of tile modifiers can make it, easier to find them (Ferro et al., 1999).
W99-0706
This paper reports on a comparison between the transforination-based error-driven learner described in Ferro et al.(1999) and the lnemory-based learner for GRs described in Buchholz et M.
