1. Mutual Information Church and Hanks (1989) discussed the use of the mutual information statistic in order to identify a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntacfic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word).

Attempts to automatically derive these hierarchies for words from existing dictionaries have been only partially successful (Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985).

We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as Church (1988) or DeRose (1988), and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to~in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to~to.
