Quasi-Logical Forms (QLF) (Crouch, 1995) and the Constraint Language for Lambda Structures (CLLS) (Egg et al., 2001).

For task 2 we adopt the substitutional approach advocated by Crouch (1995): The semantic representation of the target a7 a15 is a copy of the source a7 a8 where target parallel elements have been substituted for source parallel elements (a7 a15a25a24 a7 a8a17a26 a9 a8 a36a28a27 a9a18a15 a36a29a10a11a12a11a12a11a12a13a10 a9 a8 a14 a27 a9a18a15 a14a31a30 ).

(Asher, 1993; Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001), can readily derive the reading.

For the implementation of classes, we take our cues from Prolog (Erbach, 1995; Mellish, 1988).

The QLF approach (Crouch, 1995) gives an interesting answer to this question: It uses re-entrancy to propagate scope decisions among parallel structures.

In contrast to previous work (Crouch, 1995) l7: revise( x, y ) l7: revise( x, y ) l1: x teacher(x) l4: y paper(y,z) l3: z z=x l1: x John(x) l8: before( l9, l9 ) l7: revise( x, y ) l1: x teacher(x) l7: revise( x, y ) l8: before( l9, l9 ) l0 l10: and( l11, l11) l4: y paper(y,z) paper(y,z) l4: yl1: x Bill(x) l3: zz=x paper(y,z) l4: y X 1 X=[1] l3[] z=z[] l3: z Z Z=[2|X] Y Y=[2] 1 l3: z z=z(X) 2 l3(X) Figure 7: UDRS for sentence (15) (Egg et al., 2001) the proposed underspecified representation facilitates the resolution of anaphora by providing explicit representations of potential antecedents.

It is argued that the approach improves on previous proposals to integrate ellipsis resolution and scope underspecification (Crouch, 1995; Egg et al., 2001) in that application processes like anaphora resolution do not require full disambiguation but can work directly on the underspecified representation.

Crouch (1995) considers ordersensitivity of interpretation a serious drawback.
