Other research, such as Yarowsky's into accent restoration in Spanish and French (1994), which reports accuracy levels of 90%99%, is again at a more rough-grained level, in this case that of distinguished unaccented and accented word forms.

Ng and Lee (1996) have found only 57% agreement when comparing the same texts tagged according to the same dictionary senses by different (human)! research groups.

Cowie, Guthrie and Guthrie (1992) have reported 72% correct assignment at the LDOCE homograph level (and a much lower level for individual sense assignment).

Probabilities can be derived from training corpora, but it is acknowledged that these can vary enormously from corpus to corpus, e.g. on grounds of register (Biber 1993).
