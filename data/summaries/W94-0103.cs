Pustejovsky confronted with the problem of automatic acquisition more extensively in \[Pustejovsky et al.1993\]. The experiment described, besides producing limited results (as remarked by the author itself), is hardly reproducible on a large scale, since it presupposes the identification of an appropriate conceptual schema that generalises the semantics of the word being studied.

linguistic patterns that were never, or rarely found) has not been analyzed appropriately in most papers, as convincingly demonstrated in \[Dunning, 1993\].

Other methods that seem applicable to the problem at hand have been presented in the literature \[Yarowsky 1992\].

We have shown in \[Basili et al, 1992a\] that in sub languages there are many unintuitive ways of relating concepts to each other, that would have been very hard to find without the help of an automatic procedure.

The knowledge based methods are morphosyntactic processing \[Basili et al, 1992b\] and some shallow level of semantic categorisation.

\[Grishman 1992\] generalises automatically acquired word triples using a manually prepared full word taxonomy.

The theory of qualia has been presented in several papers, but the reader may refer to \[Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993\], for a rather complete and recent account of this research.
