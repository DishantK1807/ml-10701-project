extraction methods NN compounds were extracted from the WSJ by first tagging the data with fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001) and then simply taking noun bigrams (adjoined on both sides by non-nouns to assure the bigram is not part of a larger compound nominal).

Indeed, Schone and Jurafsky (2001) provide evidence that suggests that WordNet is as effective an evaluation resource as the web for MWE detection methods, despite its inherent size limitations and static nature.

McCarthy et al.(2003) also targeted verb-particles for a study on compositionality, and judged compositionality according to the degree of overlap in the N most similar words to the verbparticle and head verb, e.g., to determine compositionality.

This combination of technologies was also used to good effect by Widdows (2003): an example of the contribution of part-of-speech information to extracting semantic neighbours of the word fire is shown in Table 1.

Lin (1998c) also employs the idea of corpusderived information content, and defines the similarity between two concepts in the following way: sim(C1; C2) = 2 log P(C0)log P(C 1) + log P(C2) (1) where C0 is the lowest class in the hierarchy that subsumes both classes.

Melamed (1997)), there has been little work on detecting “non-compositional” (i.e.

Analysis of the semantic correlation between the constituent parts and whole of an MWE is perhaps more commonly discussed under the banner of compositionality (Nunberg et al., 1994; Lin, 1999).

Extraction of the verb-particles was considerably more involved, and drew on the method of Baldwin and Villavicencio (2002).

Essentially, we used a POS tagger and chunker (both built using fnTBL 1.0 (Ngai and Florian, 2001)) to first (re)tag the BNC.

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) applied LSA to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way of rescoring MWEs extracted from a corpus.

Bannard et al.(2003) extended this research in looking explicitly at the task of classifying verb-particles as being compositional or not.

These “expressions that are similar to [their] literal meaning” are found by substituting each of the words in the expression with the 10 most similar words according to a corpus derived thesaurus (Lin, 1998a).

The expressions he uses are taken from a collocation database (Lin, 1998b).

One interesting exception is Lin (1999), whose approach is explained as follows: The intuitive idea behind the method is that the metaphorical usage of a noncompositional expression causes it to have a different distributional characteristic than expressions that are similar to its literal meaning.
