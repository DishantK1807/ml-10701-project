These three classes are all optionally intransitive but assign different semantic roles to their arguments (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001).

On the other hand, in contrast to Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002), we demonstrated that accurate subcategorizationstatistics are unnecessary (see also Sarkar and Tripasai, 2002).

These are the same tasks performed in the supervised setting of Joanis and Stevenson (2003).

Classes and Verbs We use the same classes and example verbs as in the supervised experiments of Joanis and Stevenson (2003) to enable a comparison between the performance of the unsupervised and supervised methods.

We have previously shown that a broad set of 220 noisy features performs well in supervised verb classification (Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).

Currently, our only such feature is an extension of the animacy feature of Merlo and Stevenson (2001).
J01-3003
In contrast to Merlo and Stevenson (2001), we confirmed that a set of general features can be successfully used, without the need for manually determining the relevant features for distinguishing particular classes (cf.

Tense, Voice, and Aspect Features (24 features) Verb meaning, and therefore class membership, interacts in interesting ways with voice, tense, and aspect (Levin, 1993; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001).

Feature Space Like others, we have assumed lexical semantic classes of verbs as defined in Levin (1993) (hereafter Levin), which have served as a gold standard in computational linguistics research (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Kipper et al., 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).

Verb Clustering Work Using the same a22a24a23a25a23 measure as ours, Stevenson and Merlo (1999) achieved performance in clustering very close to that of their supervised classification.

A number of supervised learning approaches have extracted such informationabout verbs from corpora, including their argument roles (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), selectional preferences (Resnik, 1996), and lexical semantic classification (i.e., grouping verbs according to their argument structure properties) (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Joanis and Stevenson, 2003).

Of these verbs, 20 from each class were randomly selected to use as trainingdata for our supervised experiments in Joanis and Stevenson (2003).

Unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches have been successful as well, but have tended to be more restrictive, in relying on human filtering of the results (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998), on the handselection of features (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), or on the use of an extensive grammar (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).
E99-1007 W98-1106
Here we briefly describe the features that comprise our feature space, and refer the interested reader to Joanis and Stevenson (2003) for details.
E03-1040
We focus here on extending the applicability of unsupervised methods, as in (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999), to the lexical semantic classification of verbs.
E99-1007
Following Joanis and Stevenson (2003), for each class, we systematically identified the subset of features 4These results differ slightly from those reported in Joanis and Stevenson(2003), because of our slight changes in verb sets, discussed in Section 3.2.
