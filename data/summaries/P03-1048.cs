Utility Relative Utility (RU) (Radev et al., 2000) is tested on a large corpus for the first time in this project.

Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) is an evaluation measure which is increasingly used in NLP annotation work (Krippendorff, 1980; Carletta, 1996).

MEAD (Radev et al., 2000): MEAD is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence.
W00-0403
As in (Radev et al., 2000), in order to create an extract of a certain length, we simply extract the top scoring sentences that add up to that length.

Co-selection measures include precision and recall of co-selected sentences, relative utility (Radev et al., 2000), and Kappa (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996).

ALGN (alignment-based): We ran a sentence alignment algorithm (Gale and Church, 1993) for each pair of English and Chinese stories.
J93-1004
Content-based similarity measures do not require the target summary to be a subset of sentences from the source document, thus, content evaluation based on similarity measures can be done using summaries published with the source documents which are in many cases available (Teufel and Moens, 1997; Saggion, 2000).
