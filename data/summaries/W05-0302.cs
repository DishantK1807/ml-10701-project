Indeed, the dividing line between support constructions and idioms is difficult to draw (Meyers 2004b).

Researchers at Essex were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al, 1999; Poesio, 2004a) and have annotated corpora using this scheme including a subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a).

1. Introduction The creation of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) and the word sense-annotated SEMCOR (Fellbaum, 1997) have shown how even limited amounts of annotated data can result in major improvements in complex natural language understanding systems.

Researchers at Essex (UK) were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al, 1999; Poesio, 2004a), partially implemented in the annotation tool MMAX and now proposed as an ISO standard; and have been responsible for the creation of two small, but commonly used anaphorically annotated corpora – the Vieira / Poesio subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a).

Discourse Treebank: The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b) is based on the idea that discourse connectives are predicates with associated argument structure (for details see (Miltsakaki et al 2004a, Miltsakaki et al 2004b).

For example, the NomBank project assumes the following definition of a support verb (Meyers, et.al., 2004b): “… a verb which takes at least two arguments NP 1 and XP 2 such that XP 2 is an argument of the head of NP 1. For example, in John took a walk, a support verb (took) shares one of its arguments (John) with the head of its other argument (walk).” The easiest way to apply this definition is without exception, so it will include idiomatic expressions such as keep tabs on, take place, pull strings.

The Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al 2004a/b) treats discourse connectives as predicates and the sentences being joined as arguments.
