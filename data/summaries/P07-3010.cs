Heeringa et al.(2006) present several modifications of the Levenshtein distance that approximate linguistic intuitions better.

Mann and Yarowsky (2001) use variants of Levenshteindistanceasastaticmetric, andaHidden Markov Model (HMM) and a stochastic transducer trained with the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithmasadaptivemetrics.
N01-1020
Mann and Yarowsky (2001) distinguish between static metrics, which are sufficiently general to be applied to any language pair, and adaptive metrics, which are adapted to a specific language pair.

Kondrak and Sherif (2006) use phonetic similarity models for cognate word identification.

Work Our work is inspired by Mann and Yarowsky (2001).
N01-1020
Mann and Yarowsky (2001) consider a word pair as cognate if the Levenshtein distance between the two words is less than 3.
N01-1020
This finding is consistent with the results of Mann and Yarowsky (2001), although our experimentsshowmoreclear-cutdifferences.
N01-1020
Using the same models, Mann and Yarowsky (2001) induced over 90% of the Spanish-Portuguese cognate vocabulary.

Similarity measures can be based on any level of linguistic analysis: semantic similarity relies on context vectors(Rapp, 1999), whilesyntacticsimilarityisbased on the alignment of parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003 P99-1067
Rapp (1999) extends an existing bilingual lexicon with the help of non-parallel corpora, assuming that corresponding words share cooccurrence patterns.
P99-1067
Nevertheless, Schafer and Yarowsky (2002) have shown that these two techniquescanbecombinedefficiently.
