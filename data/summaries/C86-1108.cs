The current prototype of TELI, which runs on a Symbolics Lisp Machine, derives from work at Duke University on the LDC project (Ballard, 1982; Ballard, 1984; Ballard, Lusth, and Tinkharn, 1984; Ballard and Tinkham, 1984).

For example, the system will in effect ask What does it mean for Bob to work with Jill? at which point the user might say the dept of Bob is equal to the dept of Jill 10, Related Work Some of the systems which, like TELI, seek to provide for user customization within the context of database query are ASK (Thompson and Thompson 1983, 1985), formerly REL (Thompson and Thompson, 1975), from Caltech; INTELLECT, formerly Robot (Harris, 1977), marketed by Artificial Intelligence Corporation; IRUS (Bates and Bobrow, 1983; Bates, Moser, and Stallard 1984), from BBN Laboratories; TQA (Damerau, 1985), formerly REQUEST (Plath, 1976), from IBM Yorktown Heights; TEAM (Martin et al, 1983; Grosz et al, 1985), from SRI International; and USL (Lehmann, 1978), from IBM Heidleberg.

Due to the space limitations endemic to conference papers, we refer the reader to Ballard and Stumberger (1986) for some substantive comparisons, largely related to semantic issues, between TELl and each of TEAM, IRUS, TQA, and ASK.

2. The Importance of Case Frame Information Following Ballard and Tinkham (1984), TELI seeks to enable domain-independent English processing by maintaining detailed case frame information about the phrase types provided for by the system.
