Selection Following Commitment Extraction, we used an word alignment technique first introduced in (Taskar et al., 2005b) in order to select the commitment extracted from t (henceforth, ct) which represents the best alignment for each of the commitments extracted from h (henceforth, ch).

In our system, text-hypothesis (t-h) pairs are initially submitted to a Preprocessing module which (1) syntactic parses each passage (using an implementation of the (Collins, 1999) parser), (2) identifies semantic dependencies (using a semantic dependency parser trained on PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004)), (3) annotates named entities (using LCC’s CiceroLite named entity recognition system), (4) resolves instances of pronominal and nominal coreference (using a system based on (Luo et al., 2004)), and (5) normalizes temporal and spatial expressions to fully-resolved instances (using a technique first introduced in (Aarseth et al., 2006)).

⋄2⋄ UNALIGNED CHUNK: This feature represents the number of chunks in one text that are not aligned with a chunk from the other ⋄3⋄ LEXICAL ENTAILMENT PROBABILITY: Defined as in (Glickman and Dagan, 2005).

We assume that the alignment of two discourse commitments can be cast as a maximum weighted matching problem in which each pair of words (ti,hj) in an commitment pair (ct,ch) is assigned a score sij(t,h) corresponding to the likelihood that ti is aligned to hj.1 As with (Taskar et al., 2005b), we use the large-margin structured prediction model 1In order to ensure that content from the h is reflected in the t, we assume that each word from the h is aligned to exactly one or zero words from the t.

Systems participating in the previous two PASCAL Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) Challenges (Bar-Haimetal., 2006)havesuccessfully employed a variety of “shallow” techniques in order to recognize instances of textual entailment, including methods based on: (1) sets of heuristics (Vanderwende et al., 2006), (2) measures of term overlap (Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), (3) the alignment of graphs created fromsyntactic orsemantic dependencies (Haghighi et al., 2005), or (4) statistical classifierswhich leverage awiderangeoffeatures, including the output of paraphrase generation (Hickl et al., 2006) or model building systems (Bos and Markert, 2006).

173 introduced in (Taskar et al., 2005a) in order to compute aset of parameters w (computed with respect to a set of features f) which maximize the number of correct alignment predictions (¯yi) made given a set of training examples (xi), as in Equation (1).

(Details of our commitment extraction approach are presented in Section 3.) Commitments are then sent to a Commitment Selection module, which uses a weighted bipartite matching algorithm first described in (Taskar et al., 2005b) in order to identify the commitment from the twhich features the best alignment for each commitment extracted from the h.
