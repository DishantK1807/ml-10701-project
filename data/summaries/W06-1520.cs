The problem is that we would need rules of the kind below (using context-free rules for short see (Prolo, 2002) for TAGs).

The latter is partly due to the fact that large scale annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994; Bies et al., 1995) give primacy to syntactic categories.

Large scale handcrafted grammars for many languages have been built based on this paradigm (Joshi, 2001; XTAG Research Group, 2001; Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Abeill·e and Candito, 2000; Candito, 1998; Becker, 1993; Frank, 2002; Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Abeill·e and Rambow, 2000) as well as grammars extracted from corpora (Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000; Hwa, 1999; Xia et al., 2001; Xia, 2001).

Although we can think of simply inserting functional labels in elementary trees or use them in a meta-level to generate the grammar, such as in (Candito, 1998; Kinyon, 2000; Cl·ement and Kinyon, 2003), such tags are generally not seen as an essential part of the derivational process.

This has been noticed for TAGs in (Prolo, 2002).

139 their realizations is an important issue here, and is also feasible (see (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002)).
