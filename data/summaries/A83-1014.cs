In data base access, the system might inform the user of the false presupposition and suggest alternative queries (Kaplan, 1978), since the user does not usually benefit from the empty set as a response.

Waltz (1978) and Schank, et al.(1980) have taken this approach for a large class of syntactic constraints.

generating well-formed messages from ill-formed and incomplete ones (Granger, et al., 1983) and intelligent computer-assisted language instruction (Weiachedel, et al., 1978).

Granger, et al.(1983) and Allen, et al.(1983) both report progress on using pragmatic information to deal with fragmentary input.

Application area and responding to ill-formedness Ill-formedness processing has been examined in many ~pplication areas, including data base access (Hendrix, et al., 1978), building a data base (Marsh, 1983), grammar checking (Jensen and Heidorn, 1983),.
A83-1015 A83-1016
Though use of conjunction is clearly grammatical, a number of individuals (Sager, 1973; Woods, 1973; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981) have argued that it should not be included in the normative grammar, but rather should be processed via a recovery strategy.

Because control is such an important issue, thorough, rigorous empirical studies are Many alternatives exist for these decisions; an overview of them appears in Sondheimer and Weischedel (1980).
C80-1008
Sondheimer and Weischedel (1980) identify two general classes of input appearing ill-formed to a normative system.
C80-1008
If one includes telegraphic and elliptical constructions in the class of absolute ill-formedness, then case s~udies reported in Thompson (1980) and Eastman and McLean (1981) indicate that as much as 25% of queries to questionanswering systems are absolutely illformed.
