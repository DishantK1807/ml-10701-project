(Moldovan et al., 2004; Girju et al., 2005) gave the annotators an example of each phrase in a sentence along with WordNet senses and position of arguments.

The recognition of textual entailment (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005) is an example of successful use of this type of deeper analysis in high-end NLP applications.

The classifiers for each type were built from annotated examples using supervised machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees (DT)1, Support Vector Machines (SVM) 2, Semantic Scattering (SS) (Moldovan and Badulescu, 2005), Iterative Semantic Specialization (ISS) (Girju, Badulescu, and Moldovan, 2006), Nave Bayes (NB) 3 and Maximum Entropy (ME)4.

(Rosario and Hearst, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2004; Kim and Baldwin, 2005) use supervised methods and explore classification features from a simple structured type hierarchy.

The approach we present here is inspired by (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso et al.2005; Dagan et al.2006; McCarthy 2002).
