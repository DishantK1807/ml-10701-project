Various means of extending this methodology for evaluating context-dependent queries have been proposed, and some of them have been implemented in the ATIS evaluations (Boisen et al.(1989), Hirschman et al.(1990), Bates and Ayuso (1991), Pallett (1991)).

For the ATIS evaluations, several different methods of data collection, including a method called "Wizard scenarios", were used to collect raw data, both speech and transcribed text (Hemphill, 1990).

Special provision is made for single element answers, sc that a scalar REF and a HYP which is a table containing a single element are judged to be equivalent That is, a scalar REF will match either a scalar or a single elemenl 1The first implementation of this software was by Lance Ramshaw (Boisen et al., 19891.

Evaluation Methodologies This approach to evaluation shares many characteristics with the methods used for the DARPA-sponsored Message Understanding Conferences (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991).

Rome Laboratory has also sponsored a recent effort to define another approach to evaluating NL systems (Neal et al., 1991; Walter, 1992).

The content of this reference answer is determined both by domainindependent linguistic principles (Boisen et al., 1989) and domain-specific stipulation.

These evaluations are probably the only NL evaluations other than the series of Message Understanding Conferences (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991).

Although some recent work has suggested promising approaches (Black e, al., 1991), system-internal representations are hard to com.
