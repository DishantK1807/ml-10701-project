Thls s~me report, in slightly different form, was published by Rome Air Uevnlopment Center, Griffiss Air Porce Base, ;Jew York, as 9ADC-Td-74-271 (October 1974).
Central to the vlew of t~.~~rls~utlon that w111 be preqented here 1s the notlon of ~rbahzatlon, Verb illzntlnn 1s the ~ppl~cntlon of processes by whlch som?! hollstxc conceptual chunk, recalled from memory, 1s converted into sentences and words-lnco a phonetically or gra3hlcallg comunlcable llngulstlc representatlon.
buch a notlon assumes that the underlying content of what 1s belng communicated 1s hot, or need a3t be, In verb31 form to begln wltH.
At the very least it nay be a complex sjrszern of dlscrete elements and rel,~tlons, represen able perhips as a network of nodes aria arcs.
It may also lnvolve m im7ortant nondlscrete or analog component, representable only m some other terms.
o or excellent swarles of both sldes of thlparticular lssue see Pylyshyn 1913 and Palvlo 1977).
ahatever may turn out to be the case here, lt seems clear that some sorts of processes must be apphed m order to transform the orlglnal fom of storage Into a verbs1 output: that tbe stored materl 1 must be verbqllzed.
Xn any partlcuIar instance of trs~slatlon there are tdo Instances of verballzatlon.
One Ts the orleln 11 verbahzatlon nprformed by the crr~tor of the source language text.
The vther 1s the verballzatxon r~roduced in the tzr~et 1ani:uq:e by th? tl mslatqr.
3esides belng In dlfferent l.ngune;es, these two verb~hzatlons are fundamentally different in one other respect.
2he source language wrballzatlon is, we mlght say, autononous.
It. 1s freely produced by the spaken or wrlter in any way he decldes is alproFrl :te to the content md the occaslos, provlded he adhere.
to the rules of hls culture aqd the langu Re he is uslnR.
e tarmet language vcrbnlizntlon, on thc other hnnd, 1s parnoltlc on the source Imguage one.
Not only must the translator adhere to the rules of hls own language, he must also produce a verballzatlon that commun~cates, so f lr as posslble, the srme underlyrng content or knowledge thnt was communicated by the source language verballzatlon.
?he verb?l~zatlon Ln the target language is thus subject to thls special klnd of constra~nt, Its producer is not free to "say what he wants," but must insofar as posslble say the same thlng as the producer of the source language text.
bde suggested In an earlier report that there are two chrnensl~ns of high quallty translstlqn, whnch we termed naturalnes-s and fldelltg, Naturalness 1s achleved when the tuget language verbal~zat~on adheres to all the constralnts of that language; the output w~ll then sound "natural".
Fldel~ty 1s achleved to the extent that the tzrget language verbal~zat~on communicates the same content as the source langusge one.
Vesbdlzat~on In general, as we see ~t, conslsts of a mixture of two klnds of orocesses: those wh~ch necessitate creatlve declslons on the nart of the verbCdlzer and those which do not, semg governed by the constraints lrnlmsed by the lmfruage.
e rnlght sneak of creqtlve nrocessec and al~orlthmic processes.
Sreatlve processes are ultlnately ~ovsrned by the content whlch underlies the verballzatlan; the verb llzer has to declde how best to verbalize that content.
Normally a range of cholces wlll be onen to him, and he must declde what will most effectively convey what he has In rnlnd.
After he has made ssch cholces, there are often automatic consequences whlch follow from them because of the pnrticula rules of the 1:mp;ungc (hut which RTB themselves likely to leiid to the necessity of further crentivc choices).
'de can Say, then, with respect to the two vcrbalizat~ons involved in a t$anslation, that the producer of the source language, verl~alizat~on, has applied both creative and a1p;orithmic processes, wherehs in the target lwguoge verbalization only algorithmic processes are autonomously applied, the necessary creative choices belng determined by the choices that were made in the source lan(.ufq;e verbalization.
Thus the naturalness of the f lnal translation depends largely on adherence to the algorithmic processes of the target language, while its fidelity depends on the extent to whlch the translation has been able to incorporate qreatlve cl~oices that correspond to those originally applied in the source language.
In a11 probability there are cases where exact correspondence in these choices Is not possible, and where a ceqtain mount of autonomous creativity has to be introduced lnto the target verb lizat~on s well.
These are the cases where automatic translation becomes nost problematic.
One useful goal of machine translation research can be to determine precisely the nature and extent of such cases.
We are led, then, to the general picture of translation which is shown in Figure 1.
The two vertlcill columns represent the two verbalizations whlch are involved: .In the left the source languasge verbalizatlon and on the right the target verbalization.
zhe lnpEzt to a to a translation procedure, of course, is an already produced verbal output or text in the source language.
The first major component of the translation procedure will have to be the reconstruction from that text of the verbalizatlon nrocesses by which it w:l,c, prorlllced, r) k i lid of "ci~~c .bml i z~.tion", he 1 rof cs to this nn the pnrsinPL com)~n;:nb, nlthou(;h it in cJnorlg difbfdr.cnt froa c';~nvontionnl pnrnine.

Uur project concentrated mor of its attqntion an verbnlizntion itself than on parsing or tpmslation, slnce both of the latter depend on a prior understanding of verbalization.
Any other ordermiof priorities would be putt in^ the cart before the horse.
Any detailed investigation of the parsing comnonent wolild be futzle lf we dld not know what sort of output we would expect thnt con:~onent to ~roduce: target language Figure 1 the proccnnes thnt went into EI p?rt.iairlnr verbalizatinn.
The kr-nn8lation comannent is R ve~b~li~ation,, thpr1p;h one of R sneciaL sort, and there a~ain a detailed understmrlinp; of verbnlizntion processes is necezsary.
This report, then, will be most cr)ncerned wi.th the nature of verbalization.
We will also devote considera7~le space to the nature of that speci-al sort of verba1iz:rtion which in trnnslation.
'We will have the least to say about parsinc.
Examples will be cited from English and Japanese.
For bout the last nine months of the project we were concerned with the development of :m intxrnct ive computer pro,p;ram thnt would implement the verbalization nrocesses we hy-potheslzed.
f~lthoup-h ti prQy;ram remained primitive, the intention was that it would ~raduall~ achieve increased sophistication in its abilltg to simulate verb: lization, translation, and garsing.
As it presently simulates the Drocesses of verbalization, it beeins with an item that represents the initial holistic idea which the sneaker or writer of a text wishes o c~)nmunicate.
It then asks the user, seated at a tele$tyne, to make the series of creative choices that are hecessnry kn the production of the fanal text.
lit the same time it attempts to anilly on its own the al~orlfhmic processes w%ich a-e called for.
It knows when cre:ltlve choices are necessary, but must ask the user what choices to make.
Ideally it shol~ld be able to anply the aleorithmic processes wlthout help.
As it simulates translation it should likewise be able to apply the algorithmic Drocesses of the targt:t lan~uage automatically, and also to apply certain creative processes on its own by looking at the source 1onp;uaf;e vnrbalizatit~n to see wnat creative choices were made there.
hhenever j.t is not able to make a creative choicb, the prop;r:un asks the user to do so.
e find that this kind of machine-user inter &ion wovides a valuable research technique.
Taking as ouiultimate god the eventual eliminnti on of the user from the translation Rrogram altogether, we start with a situation in which the u6t.r fntervenes at many points.
As we learn more we can graaually give the machlne mope to do and tne user less.
This technique can be followed not only in verbalization, but also in parsing 'ulhetner r;he user will eventually dis sppear from the ~icture altogether is uncertain.
However that nay be, the goal a1 a pro.ram in which the conti-ibution of the user is significantly diminished in relation to that of the nachine seems worsable.
Short of the final goal of eliminating tne user altogether, an intermediate goal identifiable as 'human-iided" machine translation can more easily be foreseen.
Here the machine will do the many things for which it is suited; but a human brain will be introduced =at those points where the machine has reached its limits.
This intermediate goal has, we believe, significant p-~actical as well as theoretical value.
Funding for this project ceased in June 1974.
The report mubt be read, therefore, as a s:mmary of work thnt was interrupted in mid-course, and-as a partial blueprint Tor further work should the necessary funding ever materialize.
At this point, six months after the termination of the project, the need for varlbus modlflcations is already evident.
It seems best, howeven, to document consistently how things stood at the time of interruption, without trying to i+ntroduce now and untested material.
11, Subconcept ualizhtion nle assume that a speuer or writer begins with a sin~le, unita~yj holistia concentual chunk that he has recalled from memory and has decided, for some reason to communicate.
Thus he may nave ir mind some incident in which he was involved, something of interest he was previously told about or read about, some experiment he wishes to report on, or whatever.
de label such a chU, as well as the smnllmer chunks into which it will be analyzed, with tlie prefix CC (for "conceptual chunk") followed by a fourd igif uber.
he first digit indicates the lanrruwe in which verbalization is to take place ("1" for English and "2" for Japanese), and the remaiaing three digits constituts an arbitrary index--for the particu-lar chunk.
'fhl*s -e%1001 might be the name given to some p&rticular chunk of this sort that is about to be verbalized in xnglish.
We assume.
futhermore, that while this chunk is from one point of view a wit, from ahother point of view it has a more or less rich contentn, <aIrd that 1.C is tl-L~S content which t71e spsaker.wishes to convey to his audience.
Sometimes, though not in most cases, the initial chunk itself may have a linguistic label.
If it is a folktale, for example, it may have a name like "Cihderella" or 'lThe Three Bears".
But someone who has decided to tell a story is not likely to say ju'st "Cinderella" and let it go at that.
(One is reminded of the old story about a convention of comedians at which people said thirigs like "h9" OF "178" and elicited laughter aach time because everyone knew the jokes these numbers stood for).
Normally it is necessary j nstead for the speaker to get inside the content of this initial unit--to analyee it into smaller chunks.
This kind of process can be pictured as shown in Figure 2, where the initial chunk CC-1001 has Seen, as we say, subconceptualized into chunks CZ-l002-&1nd Cd-1003.
In a text of any size each of these smaller chunks will be further broken down into still smaller ones, and sp on, so that a hierarchical structure of successively smaller subconceptualizations emerges.
Subconce~tualization belongsto the class of verbalization processes which are creative.
Normally a chunk does not automatically determine a particular subconceptual breakdown, but the speaker must creatively choose how to subconceptualize each one.
It is useful to think of the content of each chunk--each circle in Figure 2--as if it were a mountai~ous landscape, with the most salient aspects .-tanding out in bold relief and the less salient appearing as only minor hills.
kll other t?ings being equal, the more salient sople aspect of the total content is, the more likely the speaker is to express it when he subcoaceptualizes.
Re is not likely to make exactly the same subconceptual breakdown each time he communicates the sane initial chunk, partly because he may judge different things 50 be salient in different contexts and pwtly because the landscape itself may change over time, the relative salience of its different ~LSD~C~S being modified in long-term memory.
IJe assume that any particular subconceptualization necessarily leaves out part of the content of what is being subconceptl~r;lized, as suggest-ed by the area that lies within the l*lr~er circle but outside the two smaller circlcs in Pieurq 2.
Subconceptuulization, that is, is necessarily a select'i-ve [~rocess.
No one ever says everything he could say about what he has in mind.
~~bconceptualization of R parkicular chunk, say GJ-1001, produces two or more hew chunks., say CC-1002 and CC-1003.
These new Chunks, furthermore, are conceivy.d of as related to each other in It some way.
For example, 3;-1002 might be the reason" for 2C-1003.
Suppose the entire text consisted of -the sentences, "I bouqht a bi-ke yesterday.
I decided I need more exerci~e".
Let us ssy that the first sentence is a verbzlization of ZC-1003 and the second sentence of CC-1002.
de can say that 5s-1002 is the reason for CC-1003.
de write a subcon~eptudizati~fl process of this kind in r;he following way: 1) JC-1001 S> CJ-KE'ASON (CC-1002, 32-1003) This statement says that the initial chunk, CZ-1001, is subconceptualized (S>) into the chunks CC-1002 and CX-1003, and thyt th'ese two new chunks nre related by the predicate labeled CJ-:1EAiLilN, The prefix JJ stands for "conjunctionf1 (derived fron the ~rmrnatical, 7('( ( not the logical use of this tern).
my rel~tion between Yd s is labeled with this prefix.
'VY'e use a different notation to repreyent each of the various stages in the verb-lization process.
-r~ the outset, in thls example the initial chunk JC-1001 was all that was present.
This initial representation, before any verbnlizati~n processes had beer] a~jplied, was siaply: 2) ca-1001 After the subconce~tualizatl~n soecified in 1) was applied, the Subconce~tu6lization processes ore +;bus 'rewrite rules, wh'ich replace one stace in a verh:jliant~on with a subsequent stage, The formnt wt,;e to represent sdch stn(;es, as in 3), shoiJs predicates with their arguments written indented below thenl* In simulating verbalization our program ppesently aokls the usm to specify all the creatlve choices, restricting its own contribution to the application of nll;orithnic nrocgsses determined by the crammar of discourse, sentences, and words in the lanq-uage involved.

VAT will now apply txn al~orithmic or, an we say, syntactic "l process triggered by the presence of ZJ-REASON in 3).
lhe process applied is of a type tha) is also not clcariy understood, but We may view what we do at pre~ent a first approximation.
\Ji'i't the moment VAT simply takes the twb ZCs related by 3'-REXSOIJ and orders them so that the second will be express'ed beigre the first.
That is, for exam't~le, if SC-1002 is eventu:~lly going to he verbalizes as "I decided I need more exercise" -md 2C-1003 as "I bought a b~ke yesterday", we want the two sentences to be expressed, with C2-1003 preceding CC-1002.
Thus VAT will automatically change the representatiofl in 3) to the following: 'Phis kind of ~epresentation, in which no predicate is shown aoove the two CGs, indicates that they (or their eventual verbalimti1,ns) are to occur in the final text in the order.
shown, with dz-1803 pre-ceding CC-1002.
In Japaese the corresponalng syntactic process will tyoically lead to the attachnent of CJ-"KAdk" at the end of th6 second sentence.
phus if a representation like that in 3) were produced in a Japanese vorb:ilization VAT would automatically cl~ange it to: The quotatlnn marks around indicate that this is an item which will actually appear as a word in the text.
l~otation marks are used for iterho th~t have EI ~urf~ce Lexical reprentlntation.
The reprefleptrition in 9) i.s deficient j.n that it flails to show that CJ-"KAiiAt' will be part of tht: same sentence as CC-1002, whereas "v-1003 will (or is likely to) form a different seotence.
Sle indic~ate sentence boundaries with the notation CJ" . ", 'since the period will a.ipear in the final text.
Th~s fulLer vnrgil~ns of 8) and 7) are re~~rect ivelys The crentiofl ~f these :)eriods is r* hi>usekeepinp; task that rleed not be described in detayl here.
Given a representatiar like thnt in lo), VAT wlll ::o on to ask about the subconcer~tunl-iznti1,n of fhe first dz in the ordering.
?he general princiqle foliowed here is one of "de;~th firstr', in the sense that egrlier itlsms.
in the text are Tom letely vc?rS ~lized bi:fore tile verbalizatl ~n of later items is belvn.
his procedl~re :,robably 11ns some ~s:~chological vnl idity; th:lt is, a speCaker is li~ely to ttnnk of later parts of what he is rroing to sny only in terns of the most general chunks, while he is elaborating the earlier narts ln detnil.
Only after ne has finished the verb:~lizat'ion of these earlier parts will he turn his attention-to a full verbalization of tne later ones.
Thus, ositting varlous considerations not bq get discussed, subconceptualization procr:eds interac ki vcly Ln the following fashion: 12) V: LJ1ii1T VAT TASK DO Y'dU J,,NT PERI;'Ol(MiSD?
U: VERBALIZE CC-1001 (VAT creates the following representabion: ) Vs HOW IS CC-1081 SUBZONCi'li'TUfiI ZED?
(VAT creates first the following representation:) C J-REASON CC-1002 CC-1003 (and immediately applies a scored syntactic alf~orithm that changes it to:) V: HOW IS dC-1003 SUBCONCEPTUALIZED? etc.
In this fashion a su~conceptual hierarchy of any degree of complexity can be constn~cted and expressed.
The organization of a text may not, be entirely hierarchical.
however. Not only does a speaker break down larger chunks into I I smaller chunks--larger concepts" into subconcepts; one chunk may also remind him of another, so that the organization which results may be in part conc-atenative.
de have been viewing concatenation in tepms of excursions away from the main hierarchy, ad hn-ve been calling such excurshm 9ressions.
In some discourse, however, there is no necessary constraint that the main hierarchy Se returned to, and the result may be a rambling text in which digression is added to digression.
In a more tightly organized text digressions are more likely to appear as parenthetical remarks: brief Sidepaths which quickly return to the main hierarchy.
We uoc the tern parentheeis for this brief and transient kind of digression.
If subconceptual.ization be rcpresepted in terms of a tree diagram (which does not, however, provide a convenient mean$ of showing the relations between subcoqcepts, like CJ-BEASON), then digressions can be pictured as subtroes attached to the main tree at one point or another, as sur;gestod in Figure .3.
One other important modification of the strictly hierarchical model of.
subco~ceptualization results from the common occurrence of summarization.
It is frequently the case in verbnlizat~on tnnt an iditid chunk will be subject to tyo ~ep~3rate hi-erarchies of sul)concepttdi~ation, one of which can be identified 3s a summary of the other.
It is ch'aracteristic of :r summary th.4 its subconceptllal ization prclcesses nevw proceed beyond some relatively large chunks--cnunks which package a relatively large content.
e can contrast a subconceptu~lization hierarchy which is a summary with a hierarchy which constitutes the body of the text and consists of subconceptualization processes thxt produce a lar.:cr number of chunks of smaller size.
A surlrnary is ty-pically expressed at the beginning or end of a text; thst is, preceding or following the body.
Various conventions for summaries are associated with dif'o ent genres of writing.
Por example, a scientific article may begin with the eel$-conscious kind of summary that is called an abstract; a news report typically contains an opening par3graph telling wllu, whqt, where, and when; a fable is likely to end with a moral, and so on.
Our program at present simylf asks, for the initial CC, whether it has an initial surnmnry (one cxprosr.ed at the be~inninpj of thc text).
If the answer i~ yes it asks first for subconce~tunlizatio11 of tho summary, and moves on to ask about the body of the toxt only after the summary has been completely verbalized.
nt the end of the text it asks whether there is a final summary.
Cwativity within a discourse is likely to be limited by the genre to whlch the discourse belongs.
It would a.jpear that there is a continuum ranging from mnximally storeoty-ped to mcmimnlly creative discourse.
Plost stereotyped are those forms of discourse, such as rituals, in which the speaker has very little choice as to what he is going to say or how he is goinf: to say it.
llith weir discourse the "grammar" of the genre provides many of the answers to the questions VAT would otherwise have to ask the use-r.
In other words, VAT should be able to produce ritual texts with mininurr recourse to creative decisions.
Kt the other extreme xre forms of discourse such os descriptions of uniauc + personal exncriences whicn have never been described before, where the speaker 1s relatively free to lake a 'reat variety of creative docislons.
\lie believe it would be of considerable interest to incorporate into the verbalization process the constrnlnts iln;~osed by several different genres, but we have not as yet donr: this.
As it now stands ow program does ask JIAT Is' '2B < GZlu?i?? as soon as it has established that a verbalization is to be performed.
Possible answers that we mld like to implement in the future are, for example, S 0 'rSY 2:IOLOGY IL.TI~LE, Fk?BL3, and the like.
rn exrunple of these procedure8 ar: anplied to a roal text can be based on the following United Press report trrken, sl ightly condensed, from the em Francisco Chroniclo of May 16, 19743 13) 1.
An 11-ye:lr-old boy using a new "super-glue" 2.
acciirenfally glued his eye shut 3.
while building a model irlae, 4.
and a doctor had to renpen the eye surgically.
nike Harris said 6.
he rubbed his left eye 7.
after several drops of the glue squirted into it last Sunday 8.
and found his eyelid would not move.
9. An eye surgeon debated briefly about 10.
using a super glue solvent 11.

It is a-:proximately the case that each of the nunbered lines in this text expresses a terminal subconcept (see below).
:ie assume that the text contains a nllmber of intermediate subconcepts as well, which need to be eltlcidated in a subcnnceptual hierarchy.
Let UB SU~POBB th:& the wmbinntion of VAT and the uner are attempting to simulate the verbnlizatioh proces::es that went into the ~roduction of this text.
For the moment we &re concerned oqly with subconceptualizati~n processes (and, associated syntactic algorithms).
limy of the user's answers in the following conversation with VAT1 are intuitively based.
'lfhe success of our eventual parsing component will depend on the extent to which these intuitive answers can be predicted from the text together with whatever items of background knowledge we relevant.
ihe example will be carried only far enough to sup;gest the nntyre of the procedure.
n he exchanre be6ins in the usual way: VAT creates the follo~ing representat ion, including a text-f ins1 period: VAT's next question seeks to establish what genre constraints apply in this text: 6 v: A!l*lT Iii ?Hi2 GJ22TRd2 U: E3VL L~C~'OHT VAT will now assume that the text is a typical ncws re~ort which begirls with a sll:runar:r.
Its first questions wilL deal wlth the subconce~tua~ization of the smary (expressed in the text in sentences 1L4) : 17) V: HOU I:] CC-1001 SWC,NGEPTGhLIi;ED IN Ti12 dU;iMjiliY?
UYISLI, (CC-10~2, 3C-1003) the user has answered that ;he fi:*st breakdown of the summary i@ into two subconcepts; CC-1002 (to be expressed as "fh 11-year-UL~ boy using a new I'm* zlue" Bccitientally clued his eye shut while building a model irplane") and CC-1003 (to be expressed as "a doctor had to reoTen the eye surgically").
Furthermore the relation betireen these two JCs has Seen identified as one laSzled YILLD, in which the first ZC "leads to It or '\rsstGLts dn" the second.
YIELD di ffers from another, similar relation which is lsbelmd CAU65 in that the event conceptualized by the secmd CC is not a necessary consequence of the first.
-It is, however, something that presumablp 1,-' would not have happened if the event conceptualized by the flrst J~ had not taen plhce.
(Zvidentls YI3L3 can be equated with I~<ITIAIZ as this term is used by Humelhart 1974, the relationship between an external event and the willful reaction of an ;mthropomorohized being to that event.
3chank 1974 uses 1:JLTIAICE differently).
As a result of the user's answ-?r in 17) VAT first creates the -.-epresent at ion: C J-YIELD and immediately apr.lies syntactic Qrocesses which Changes it to: 'Fhnt is, the two 32s are to he expressed with tte "pielderl' preceding the "yielded", and they are to be connected with coma followed by the word "LJD".
This is gat the only way which YIXLD can be realized, but for the,sake of the example we may re gard it as such.
VAT will now proceed to ask a out the subconceptuali~ation of the earliest CC in 19): 20) V: WOW IS CC-1002 CUDGONCISlJTOALIZED IN TI143 C\JMMkd?Y?
The user has answered that CC-1002 is broken down into t,wo CGs, CC-1004 ("buildir~g a model airplane") and CC-1005 ("An 11-yearold boy using a new "super-glue" accidently glued his eye shut").
They are related by PKAMSU, a temporal relation in which Tie first CC occupies s time period larger than rind including the tirne period of the second.
In oth9r words the time period of 3C-1004 includes that of CC-1005.
VAT creates, sequentially, th: following two representations: Although there may be several possibilities forq the e~pressiop ~f Fm, viLT has assumed h~t: that two factors ape involved: an oraering of the two CZs so that the "framertt precedes the "framed", and a prefixing of the word "LfiIL..~" to the first 122.
(In this [l /Y example the ordering Of these two AS will be reversed in a s~bsequent operlation).
If PIAME may be expressed in other ways, wt: assume (gratuitously, for the moment) that subtle :onceptual dif ferences are involved; that there is not, in bther words, free variation among possible syntactic algorithms.
This remains for low an article of faith.
We would expect VAT to ask next about the subconceptllaliz~tion )f CC-1004, but by a meand not yet discussed VAT will discover that is is a terminal CC (one not further suoconceptualized).
If I1 It I' AND", VAT would proceed to :C-1004 were followed by . or by, n ~sk questions directed at the comalete verbalization of this uC.
3ut since CC-10u4 is not followed by one qf these boundaries, 2ttention is -ne*t focused on CC-1005: 23) V: HOW IS CC-1005 SUBCoNGEPTUALIZ5lJ IN THE SIlMMAriY?
VAT creates the following represcntation: 24) SJ-'~~WSILE~ CC-1004 CJ-PHAME CG-1006 cc-1007 C J-", AND" cc-1003 It I4 CJThe user has said that CG-1006 ("an 11-year-old boy using a new 1 (1 "super-qlue"") occupies a time period which includes 1007 ("hccidently glued his eye shut").
So f~r we w uld expect tV1i.s second instance of PRfiE to be expresrxd by prefixing the word "liilllL.<" to 25-1006, as was done in 22).
Let us suppose, how-t>~rer 9 h:.lt I~':tAPiL actually triggers a more complex algorithm which says in effect that one "WHILE" in a sentence is enough, and that a sec-~nd instanc of PHJWIE will lead to a different ex~ression.
Here the second 1nsr;ance leads to the creation of a relative clause which will modify one of the conetituents of CC-1007.
Furthemore, the alre~dy created "WHILE" clause will be moved to a position aftv ':G-lOO7.
(This orderine; of the CCs does appear to maximally natural.
It would be slightly less desirable, for example, tn produce "While he tl WR~ building a model airplane an ll-,yenr-old boy, using a new supeI glue", eye shut.
I1 Certainly, the differences in thia area are very subtle).
We will i.ndiLate the relative clause status of CC-1006, to be embedded wiatkln the expression with slash notation: The representation in 25) will be discove-red to be the final one in the subconceptualization of the summm, which h~s been found to co'nsist of four CCs (ultimately four clauses) joined together in the manner indicatild.
VAT will now proceed to verbalize the summary comoletely, making use of othen kinds of processes.
Wnen that has been done, it will ssy: SUB",NCEPTUALIZi3D?
U: YIELD (GC~O~P, GC-1003) This is, of course, the same answer that wag :;iven to the corresponding questlon in 17).

Ult iniat ely CC-1002, Phich was expressed in sentences 1-3 of the Summarvwill be expressed in the bna;~ of the Bext in sentences 5-8.

Wb will not repeat herethe ~per~tions involved in.
the subconcepr;ualizati~n of the bpdy of the text.
They ape for the most pert similar to those ill:^^ trated above.

The first of th'ece involves an alternative that is rejected in favor of the alternative conceptualized in the second; thus, the relation rnq,e labeled Ii:I:JE3::3-ILI-PAVOROl' 'n'ithin ZC-1015 there is a relatim of 3 ;;N? td;;L;IOI'I (denial of expeetation) becwsen 32-1017 ("~n eye susKeon debnted 'brief lk about using a suner glue solvent"') and 22-1018 ("decided ag.ii.nst it for II ' fear it night dam?ge the boy's'eye.

?he second ba6eman then threw the bllL to the first base.17 man before the batter could reach first.
J-hus his hit caused two outs to be made".
rresumably a language makes available packaging at var ous leves of s~bconceptualizCtion according to predominant communicative needs within the ~ulture of its sqeakers.
How are col~~entual chqnks communicated?
One way to approach this question is by looktng :it the spatial and temporal properties of such chunks.
chunk is ty~ically either event ("He rubbed his left eye") or 2 situation ("The glue was next to the lampu) 20th events and situations have a particulsr 1uc;us i2 sp::ce and time (the difference being that an event involves sorle spatial change throu~h time, whereas a situation does not).
wch chunks.
then", can be reqwded as assignable to particular coordinates In both a s~atial and a temporal continuum.
(de omit consider tion here of generic chunks, expressed -in #sentences like "Dof:s chase catsIr or "The hf~usa had two chimneys", where -p:~rtlc llarity is @sent Genericness calls or extended discussion that wuld take us too fzr afield af tnis point).
If we assume that aost of the chunks a speaker wants to find linguistic expression for are evenzs or situ .tions, ad thus hsve both spatial and temporal parti~ularity, it is not r;ur;~riisin,~ that langu,i~;e falls to provide direct l8bels for them.
.ie cmnot, in the course of nubconceptualizntiqn, arrive nt aomethin~ like CC-1011 then remember thnt the name for this chunk is "BLUi4GH, md comdunicat(? it by uftk~ing th% aforcl.

The way in which a speaker djecldes thnt a particular J2 can be categorized as an lnstance of so:ne LJC is of c mrse a fl~ndi2n.mtal psychological quest on.
dne thing that seems clear is t znt some Xs are more easily categorized khan others; ease of catecorizabilitg has been called "codability" (~rorm and Lenneberq 1).

Zach of xhese items evj dently conmunicates a conceat that is different in nature from a 2C.
'rLis other kind of zoncept we label a PI (for "particular individual").
The chief difference between a PI and a Gz seems to have to ao with temporal psrticularity.
A CC is conceived of as odcupying a specific and usually fairly limited perlod of tine.
The time perlod oxupied b:y, say, 8.
Brown is much less ~r~ocific, and ia not likely to be nomething we are vsry interested in when we utter a pentence like 28) In other worrls, although a~Pl may have temporal particu1;lrit;y in the nense of a lifespan or total time of existence, such R time period tends to be of a different order of magnitude from that occupied by a 3C, and more often than not is of little relevance when the PI is communicated.
Furthermore, any one 1 may participate in an indeterminate rlumber of different 03s.
(Mrs. Brown has done many other things besides that which was reported in 28) h'hy do PIS play a necessary role in the communication of a CG2 'Phe answer may have something to do wSth the necessity for providing gnchor points in the addressee's mind.
Because of its lack of temporal psrticularity, the concept of a PI is a relatively stzible concept, ana one which is liable +a enter consclousn-:ss again and again 'dth respect to a wlde vririety of 3:s.
Thus, the only bray s s:)e.lker cm effectively install the content of a JC in the addressee s mind is to tie it to one or more PIS alrcady known to the addwssee.
That iq, the ununl way LII communic~tin~ information is by brin(prig one or #\ore PI nodes into the addressee's conscioushess, and by predicating 3omethi.n~ of these nodes.

VAT than looks into the lexicon and, on the basis of the last line in 29), r+places 32) with: Two other consideration:: are relevant at this palnt.

Our easiest recourse at present is to have VAT ask the user about cxh iJL: whereupon VAT will.

:le hope gradually to teach VAT to discover such aswers for itself whenever nossible.
A second consider ltlon at this point 5s to estab! ish which PI is the subject or topic, the PI on which the sr>eaker lntends the addressee' a attention to be focusod and concerning -{/hich something will be asserted.

If thq verbalization is In a topic-prominent language V~LT will -:,sk instead abdut the topic ('Li 1974).
In Enr~lish this may be the ~oint at which functloonal relations such as af;ent, beneficiary, and patient shoilld be rer~laced .& by surf,ice syntactic roles like subject, lndifect object, and direct object.

Again, the identity of the topic will often be deriv;lble from the* context.
For example, $11 other th-~ngs being equal, topics have a tendency to remain constant from one clzuse to the next, arpnts are mom likely to be topics than patients, and so on..
Gonsiderable empirical work will be necessary before all such factors hatre Seen sorted out.
If the codability of 3C-1053 had been somewhat Iwcr and the modified categorization exemplified in 28) had been chosen, the representahon at: t:lis stage woc~ld include an advsrh (AV): The lexicnlization of C3-1053, then, has involved cate!-orizw tion, possibly modification, inflection, ;md framing.
The next step in verbalization is to lexicalizethe sevrral 1'1s whizh rve contained in a reopesentation like 78) or 39).
We will see that the lexicalization of a Fr involves categori~atic~n, possibly modification, and inflection.
Yrarnlng is for the most part restricted to the lexicaslizatl:~n of a CG.
A PI is the concept of n concrete object, be it animate of inanimate, or of 3n abstraction which has been reif ied and is being treated linguistically in w.&ys ~~~O~~OIIS to the treatment of physical objects.
The supface linguistic representamon of a PI may be a proper noun, a conmon noun, a pronoun, or nothing at all.
Further-more, blr agreement processes certain features of the PI rnay be incorporated into the verb with w9ich it 1s associated.
.hch language has its own idiosyncrasies in he treatment of PIS.
Some, like Japanese, arie especially fond of deletiny: the PI a1toc;ether whepevdr it is predictable from context.

For illustrative -1urpose8 we will canllne oxrselves in thls section -t;o the rnain outlines bf how a :'I is lexicalized in English.

Brown cme over from next door'! and we are c.)ncerned with the lexicalization of PI-1234 wlthin the sentence "PI-1231 I;ave Tommy a cookie", FPre g-iyexxess of PI-1234 will result in its lexicalization as IISHEII . \Je can actually go a fair distance in establishing the givemess of a PI on this Baais alone, but the question ~i' how else givenness is estabLlahed, including its introduction from knowledge external to the linguistic text altogether, cdls for extensive further work.
Let us assuae first that the answer to LO) has been yes, in which case English is likely to lexicalize PI-1234 with a or0noun.
This is not always the case; sometimes a PI that is given will not be pron~minallzed.
The principal criterion here se~ms to be whether pronominalization will produce mbit;uitg, and ultimately VAT -will need to deci6e whether ambiguity will result.
For now, however, we proceed on the assumation that a PI which f3 ajvcn will automatically be pronominalized.
The procedure we are currently using for prononinalization in English asks first: 4-1) L: IS PI-1234 'PIE ~irUDil 1 l:>(-im T:? i JA>~),Lu.
T:lis question is asked first because the pronoun "YOU" does not distinguish nuniber, and if the answer to 41) is yes bt will not be necessary for VAT to do anyth3:ng beyand lexicalizing PI-123'1 as NN-"YOU"' (N~J, of course, for "noun").
If., on the other h;;nd, the answer to 1) fs no, then VAT must ask: 42'9 V: WIIAT' IS TTIO Z/\IIDI"tlAlrTTY OIP PI-12341 1Je assume that.
a LJI i~ from one point of view the concept of s set of objecbs, md that me cardinality of the set is relevant In establishing expressions of singularity and plurality, among other things.
Actually the d.istinction between one and more than one as possible answers to 42) is all that is relevant at the moment.
More interesting questions do arise-in this area.
For examnie, with cardinalities up to ahout five there is likely to be a need for distihguis%ing each member of th? set with a specific PI number, ~~vheress with lrlrger cardinalities the set is likely to be conceived of sin )ly as containing "a n~unber of'! or "many" members.
If we assume first that the answ8:r to f+2) is one, then 'JA'P will ask : 43) V: IS PI-1234 THE GPExKjlR1 If the answer is yes, then PI-12.34 is lexicalized as I?!itII" . If no, then we are dealing with a third person rererent and VAT must determine its gender: 44) V: IS PI-1234 hVT'180!30?I:)i!l?IIZ?
This classif lc;ltif3n includes human beings, but also nadled animals such as pets.
If the answhr to 4) is no, VAT will lexicalize PI-1234 as NN-"I'P".
Otherwise it rnust find the sex of this refere~lt: 't5) ' V: IS PI-123 IMALE OR P9IlLLE1 md lexicalize it as IJTd-"HiS" or EN-"6:IZ" accordingly.
If the mswr to 42) was a n:lnber greater than one, VAT must decidz between "~~~" and "TilEY", the pronouns 7,dhich are explicitly plural.
d~sefitially it must ask: '1.6) V: It *,"1!3 Lj .'Mi,11 h IuIJ?: JE!t OP .171-123LC2 If yes, it will q~rotlr~ce tho 1exitbnlization AN''5IE" ~nd if no, ;3,-y' lsytt ?here are +gain.

From the rlrst ~oint of view we c:m say that once we know that a-particu1.m CC has been categorized as an instance of UC-"GITJE", for ex:un~le, the lexicon tells us a number of othei thin;$ that we must know about this CC.

The 1exiz:~l entry for U2-"LIII'T", insof-lr as it cny~t~~rcs t;i:lr; much Infurnn-t;~.on, is written as follows: 51) CC-h C> UZ-"LIE'Ttf i3> 25-4 P> VU-"Ll" PTt!

The second Pine under i3> says that it is alternatively possible to subconce;~tl:alize CC-A in e certain way, wnich aruou~~ts to a :)araphr,:se.
That is., a1thoufl;h the sptt ak hr has c 1oL-n not to subconce~tualize dC-A further (bresuriably because the c'loice of 1% "LIFTt' has heen Judged to ~rovide the right packaining for C:-hj, if he had decided to subconceptualize f~rther he could have done it in the manner specified in thi~ line, where two new s, and lc-2, are joined by CZ-3hUsE.In othez words SAD is c,:nceived of as ceusing CC-L.
The tiLird line under ii> sags sornetiliqg about the content of JC-I), namely ',hat it lnvolves -ah act by PI-R.
(It may be noted that the absence of q~lotes around h2T in VU-ACT indicates that this is not a conceptual unit that will lead to a direct surface structure represent ition, as will VB-"ZITI"' . j Jhe fourth line r1-T under z> says that UL-2, which is caused by this act, cm be subconcestualized into.

The Last line eluciikates ZC-II stating that the new location (PL-J) is above the old location (P.LF1).
Thus 51) hag captured formally the several bits of knowleuce ab'lut CC-A that were sl~rnmerized discursively at the beg inn in^ of this paragraph.
Let us PQW turn to a more comnlicated exmr>le.
'Phis exImple came up initially 8s a result of the absepati~n that the Japanese verb kasu can be translated into dnp;lish as either rent (out) or lend.
In other words this verb is rlonspecific as to whether the ap;ent does or does nr~t recive money for the ~c)ods OP servi~es he psov~des.
LJe were interested in how a translatif>n from Jsnanese int 3 English would decide wliether to use rent or lend where the Ja~anese had used kasu.
This problem led us to consider lexic;-dl entries for several verbs involviug transfers and t~ans:~~ ti-f)ns, 2nd we arrived at a System of cross-referencing and embedding within lexical entsie s th;;t captures the content of abstract notions (such as transfer and transaction) at the same time tha-b it links ~nt~ies one tr mothe?? in a way that 1s renerally useful.
vle may bepn by defining a transfer.
bL'e lassume a cate~7ory UC'y~l which, since 2 t does not cont ;~ln cluot atior~ mnrCks, is understood to be ambstr;i,ct ;-,nd not lrnmediately convertlhle into a surf ace st-ructune verb.
The lexical entry rr>ads as follows.: 52) CC-A C> UC-I~~ANSPEH E> CC-A IS> CJ-CIIANGE (CC-B, CC-C) $2-B F> VB-ILiVE (PI-D, PI-E) dc-C F> VB-HAVE (PI-F, PI-E) Discursively, a CC-A which has been categorized as on instance of UC ?RiU;BFZR can alternatively be s~tbconoeptualized (or .in helms of a change from i3G-B to GO-G, whe~e the former involves PID "having"E-d, and the latter involves another party, PI-I?, having PI-6.
In other words, a transfer in~rolvus a change in the having of some object (PI-3) from one indiviaual to anotTl?w The English word _I_ have of course performs a variety of semantic functions; our use ofit in this formalism is meant to include at least two varieties of hav5ng--ownership, wh ch we will label HAVE-OidN, and having the use of something, wt-ich we will call HAVE-USS.
Simple HAV3, as in 52), is meant to be nonspecific a$ to wt~ich of these varieties of having is involved, as may be accounted for with the following two statements: 55) CG-A C> UC-HlLE-OUN E> ZC-A C> UC-IIAVZ '1 rl A C> UC-EIAV$:-UGS E> CS-A C> UC-HAVE One examnle of a transfer is the kind whish is cate:;orizab.be with UC-"GIVE", whose lexical entry can be ~iven as follo~s: 54) CC-A S> UG-"GIVE" E> ZC-A F> VB"GIVZ" (PI-B~AGT, CC-A.
C> UC-TMJSFXT PI-D = PI-B '1 = PI-c PI= PI-D That is, a CC which has been categorized as an instance of UC-"GTVX:,".
has tho case fr~me nhown in the firnt line undor &>.
The question nark before the heneflcimy indicates that it is opt ianal; one c~n say "Hoger gave n book" without nentionin~ 9 beneficiary.
The second line under E> shows that this Cz can also be categorized :I$ an instrmce of UC-Tt.1ANSZI'::h.
is fact means that the '2 also has the ent-ilments listed in 52).
Since the variables within exh 'V lexical entry are arbitrarily labeled A, B, s, otc., it i8 riecessary now to state equivi~lencr?~ between the v~rl&bles in the ontry for rn UC-ftGIV6" and those in the entry for UZ-TIIR!::~YLA~hese oc4uivalences are listed, indented, in the last three lines of 54).
They vle to be read, "1'1-I> of the T;i~T3F.1i,lentry is qulvnlent Lo i31-I3 of the ItGIVEH entry (the giver); 1'1-b' of the TBl;!JSPER entry is eqllivalent to PI-C of the "(;IUEt' entry (the glvee)* aqd 11-E of the ".iA.idp.ia entry is equivalent to PI-U of the "GIVX" entry (the given).
In this way 54) and 52) are brought into the correct ali~nznent.
Anotker, more cornllicated kind of transf r 1s that involved in the cat eaory ij3-"LX:IDt' 55) 2s-A c> VC-~IL 4:r~~n E> f7" YVAF> VB-"L:II(D" A 13 J'I-Uf r 'AT) -Ar 23 US-,.\HiGSb~PSlr PI-I) = 1'1-13 i~1-P .l*r-z 71-2 pr-13 2= GC-3, j7lY CCIZ 7 Ju-3' Zb d~-kiAVe3-Z,,I2 2s-F Qb J~-~~4:V~-U~~ VB-HAVJ$~.~JY (21-3, i 1-D) 3C-i~ * -C> TTC-T&LT+ISASTION The first seven li~egof this nntry are entirely parallel to the entry for UG-"GI-VE" in 54).
It then becomes necessary to refer.
to the earlier ma lrlter states, X-13 :md CJ-J, of the T.~! entry.
These are equated with JC-B and JC-F of the "LE:UD1' entry.
It is said that both of these states involve IIAVZ-JAE.
ihat is, when X lends an object to Y, in the earlier state X has use of the oh~ect and Jn the late1 stste Y does.
The n-xt to last line s3ys that PI-B, the awnt of the lending; maintains ownership of PI-I-) thx>uughout.
Phe last line says that 3-x cannot be categorizeu 3s a transaction, as explained b?low.
Svidently the only di fference between 55) ant: the entry for U:-''~AL-'!
( kasu) in Jan#!ncse is that for the latter the last lin~ of 55) ims miss~ns.
Ihus, knsu leaves it unaecidnd whether a transaction was involved or not.
w'hat, then, is a :ransactio~~! dnsen~lally it is a lid-cing of two trmsfsrs, where one of th? transfers iz for thc purpose of the other.
In buying, for examele, a tbypicel truli;act~on.
the buyer gives aoney to the sr?.llf:r so that the sellv will zive him some object in retm rl.
14Jith bu~ina,,-, chanqe of o~nt?rshin in involved in both tmnsfers, but that neerl nqt Se the, csse.
'w;i-tl~ r?ntinc, for example, theze is a ch3.nr.e of awnerstli,~ of the aodey, tut only A cha.ril;e of use of the r,bject.
We define amtranaact;ion as follows: 56) CC-A G> UU-T~IANSACTI~X E> CC-A 6> CJ-iURP0L;Ji (CC-B, CC-B C> TJC-TRJLNS~!'~~~~ PI-D = PI-D PI-15 = 12E-X PI-F = L)I-$' S C -C C> U",-'PLIAN~J.~'E~I I = PZdD PI-5 = IJI-G PI-D = 111-F The first line under E> states that X-.A can be paraphrased in terms of CC-I3 and CC-2, -the former being for the purvose of $he latter.
CC-B-j $ a tr inafer in which PI-D (e.Re Dhe buyer) transfers PI-E (e.:p;.
money) to PI-P (e.p;.
the seller).
CC-C is a transfer in which t'he roles of PI-D and PI-P (and hence their relation to the variables in 52)) are reversed.
Furthermore, the object transferred (e.ge the thing bought) is a different one--here PI-G,.
Besides buying and sglling, anather typical ~ransact~on is renting.
The Xnglish word rent is ambiguous, an(: wewill illustrate here the ent~y for what we call U'3-ffR,1:;IT-2ff, whlch is renting out 57) CC-A C> UC-"RENT-2" E> CC-A F> VB-"QI!XVTt' (I?I-B~AGT, ?PI-CtBEN, 'I PI-D~MBH; PI-E PAT) CC-A C> UC-Z'lWSACTION ~'1-F = PI-B PT-D = I~I-G I = PI-D I = PI-E CC-B = CC-F qfl fl uu-v = CC-G CC-F C> UC-T3lilILFiSR CC-B = CC-H CC-C = CC-I CG-G S>* US-T!

The second line under 2> says that ZC-A is a transaction; ~t thus conforms to 56) and it is necessary to state the equivalences between the PIS in 5)? and those in 56).
Below these PI equiv:llences it is also stated that the JC-B of the WANSACTION delinition (the transfer of money) is equivalent to CC-F of the 'RENT-2" definition, while CZ-C of the TLCLN~ACTIOIY definition (the transf ar of the objec*) is equival'ent to Cc-G of "REiTT-2".
The twu bbdbes of the f.i rst TRANSFXH are named CC-H and CC-I, whlle xhe two states of the second TLLINSFER are named ZC-J and CC-K.
It is then sald that the measure, PI-D, must be some-thing categorizable as a MilDIUM-OF-EXSWSJGi--nomally money, but potentially anything that would perform this function.
The two states of the fir& ERfl!JXYI:H are then both said to be instances of UC-IIAVl3-OWN, since the money actually changes ownership.
The two states of the second tr'msfer, on the other hand, are instances of UC-HAW-USP, since the object does not change ownership, but only use.
The last line, like the next to last line of 55) says that the agent of the rentina; retains ownership of the obje'ct.
It was mentioned that the lexical entry for Japanese TJC-J'K,Sis the same 3s that for Zngliah U3-!IL:iXD1', as ill 55), except that the Japanese entry laCks the last line of 55) in which it is stipulated that lend in^ cannot be a transactisn, It can now be jeen thar; UC-"KAS-I' is conoatible with both 55) and 57,.
we thus have a formal explanation for the fact thnt kasu may be translated as either lend or rent.
In order to decide between the two translations, it is necessary to searoh the context in which this CG occurs to discover whet he^ it is or is not a transaction, We will return to this matter in our discussion of trcmsl~t;ion in section VIII, Lexic 1 entries for cztegorles whose lnstmces are 1'1s are designed to elucidate t'he know1edf:e which is entailed by the assignment of a partic llnr P1 to some c.itegor-y.
Such entries do not contain a ctbse frame, but .ire otherwise similar in format to the entries for categories whose ins-t;ancqs qre GCs, as described above.
As a simple examnle, we nay note, that wheh a PI is categorized as ~JI instance of UG-"C;LK1' th is nn entailment that t'lls PI will "have" a trunk.
~'hls kind of having is different from those discussed In connection with €rczns~ers ?nd transactions in the last section; we represent it with iIiiVE-AS-PMlT: 58) PI-A C> UC-"CNI" E> VB-HAVE-AS-PART (PI-A, PI-B) PI-B i:> UG" THUliK" It is useful here.
(and elsewhere in the lexicon) to distinpish between necessary entailments and e~pected entailments or default options.
The latter constitute knowledge that is normally entailed by the category, but not necesswily so.
We indicate entailments of this sort with a prefixed "E:".
As an example we m:iy note that some thing which has been categorizeti as a MEDIm-OF-XXCLIiLYGE (cf . 57)) is normally expected to be money, althou[~;l-In some circumstances it might be cowry shells or wampum: 59) PI-A C> UC-rUDY~-oF-lZ2~&lJSE E> Et PI-A C> UC-"MdNEY" A more com2lex example involves the categorization of a PI as an instance of UC-"BEnGLEtt.
In this case we Know that the PI is also sategorizable as an instance of UC-"DOG", that.
we may ex~ect that it will have a tail (although some dogs do mt), that it will bm, ana that it will chase cuts: 60) PI-A O> UG-"BEA(;Li.," L'> y1-A 3> UC-ltD()GH E: VBLHAT~-AS-PIL~~T (IPI-B) PI-B z> uC-t'T.ti.zj-btt E: VB-BARK (YI-A) E: VB-3&dB (11-A, PI-<) PI-c C> T~c-t~dji~tl It nay be that E: should be expressed as a probab~lity; s~at is, that there is a ao~tinuous range over which we nay expect ~omething to be entailed, with necessary entailnrent being one extreme.
kt least for practicd purposes, however, it proves useful to make a three-way distinction ~etwoen necessary ent.iilments (unmarked;, default expectations (: and a third type which we call optional ent~ilments an8 mark with "0:" These last represent a lowcr degree of probability; they are entailments which are neither necessary por expected, but which nrs easj ly possible.
5or example, a bicycle need not have a bnsket and is not expected to have a basket, but it may very well have one: The distincton between necersary or expcxtea and opt onal entailments is of interest when it cones to the assignment of definiteness, as discussed in the following section.
VT.TZ, vl$rz:ourse Inf omation and i3ead.iustmen-t~ A si~eaker needs access to three major c1;isses of informatim in order to verb.!lize su~cessfuhlg.
First, of course, he :nust hare an Idea of what he w,mts to talk abmt: the content of the v~~lbaliza~ion.
Second, hc must have access to general knowledge that i s relevant, the kind of knowledge thlt we are attennting to characterize in the lexicon.

dhen, during a 1::ter sentence, VjiT coaos to the nuestion: 68) V: DOLS US-"HJY 2,;" P131:NTIE'Y kJ1-19873 as in 50) above, it is in a position to provide sts own answer without recourse to the user.
Thus it will, on its initibtive, lexicalize PI-1987 with the definite article: 81q31 ; i~;~dtl H THE 11, '~t is in waxs such as tiiis that we .CC~? attempting tb increase VAT s ability to answer its own questions.
As in the the arises whgn a stritement concerning identifiability like 6) should be deleted from the stare of discourse informati~n.
A11 that i.s clear now is that such statements generally last longer than SjA-GIVEN statements, and for the moment we do* not delete SP-IDETJTIFISS statements before the end of the discourse.
It is undoubtedly the case, however, thzt some of them should be deleted sometimes, and it will be necessmy also to deal eventually with discourses in which there are multiple instances of the sme catep;ory: "the first bicycle, the second bicycle, etc.
11 The
presence of Lexical information of the type that was described at the end of section VI has an interesting and desirable effect on ~eadjustments, snaclficdlly with respect to statements like 67).
As aq example,.
we might have a lexical entry for UC't31CY"JLE" which includes: That is, something cate~orized as an instrance of UC-'tBICYZLLu has as a necessary p.mt something categoriz-able as i*n instan~e of U3'4FHAPE1', . & also has as an opt-ional part something cat egorizable as an inatance of UJ-"'dd569.P".
Now, it may be noted that the second line under, which deals with the categorizatinn of PI-B, is a statement like that .in 66) above.
After a sentence like !'I bought a bicycle yesterday'' has bezn produced, this line will therefore trigger a readjustment proces:: which creates the statement: 70) 8P-IDENTIFI'4:E (UC-"PHM!IE",.
lal'-1'~68) (with whatever number it is appropr~nte to assign to thia PI 1.
As a cchxsequuence, if PI-$468 occurs in a subsequbnt sentence it will be lexicalieed with the definite article, as in "The frbe is extra large.
" Thus, as 1s.
aes~raolo. definite nnss is c'reatea not' only fort instances of the category ftrst rnedtioned, but also through entailments of that cntegory.
It -should also .be noted that in this context it-is a little odd to say "The basket: is extra large", talking aboot.
PI-C.. One would be,nore likely to say "It has a basket which is extca large", or in some other way to introduce the basket explicitly.
In other words the process just described works.
better for necessarv arts than &for optional parts of the firstmentioned obja~t <PI-A).
We therefore exclude from this readjustdent process PISO that hrve .been introduced through opt lonal entailment s.
The general nature of the $ranslatinn procedure was oatlined in section I, and dia~ramed in Figure 1.
1'0 summarize aeain, '/AT will start with a text in the eource language, will re con st;^-uct the verbalization processes which produced that text, and will then itself produce a.
paralleLl. v'erbalization in the target language During this last procedure it will agply sptactic processes anapropriate to the target lmgua~e whenever it can, but at each of Chose.
many points where it must make a choice of some kind it will look across to the.

B-quate that choice (lirectly with a correspondinp; choice in the target language.
If no direct correspondence is available, it will compare the lexicons gf the two languages to determinebwhat correspondences are possible, and will then sewch the conf ext . to decide which of them shozxld.
bc: chosen.
b:e will be particularly concerned in his section with illustrat-ing a case in which such a qon~lex choice must be made-in which the zigzag arrows in F'i~ure 1 haveconsiderable content.
First, however; it may be useful to provide a fPmework by i~lustratdng a relatively simple case where the corresodndencos ore more direct.
We will use as our first example the Yollowinq brief text f rnm Japanese': 71) Reizooko o utta.
Okqe ga hituyoo datta kara.
ref rigelator sold money needed was because \ie wlL1 want to consider sone of the arocedures VAL? will follow ~ri translatins this sentence into hglish: 72) I sold the rezriger &or.
I needed the money.
Actually our attention in this example will focus on the first sentence, since we will later want to consider the comvlic~ti~ns that are added by changing the verb in the first sen'tence from utta 'sold' to kasita 'rented' or 'leht Let us first revi3w the manner in whic'h 'J1i'I' will reconstruc-t the original verbalization of the Japanese text.
Since our eventual pwsing' corn!~onent will follow a kind of''analys~s by synthesis" procedure; we will also be suggesting-here the steps of the parsing program.
The only difference, md of course it is a big one, is that for the moment VATwill ask that: decisions.
be---made hy the usinstead of itself deriving them from the t6xt together with its own knowlodge of the world.
The conversation wikh the uoer will.
procaod as follows: 1.
V: WiIAT VAT TAU DO YUU WANT P.FCI-(E'OlIMEDZ 2, U: VERBALIZE CC-%UUL 5.
V: CAN CC-2001 BE: 38TZGORIZED1 As explained for example 9) in section 11, and with the proper insertion of periods, VAT's reprerlentstion now is: Vat's representation, as explained for example 32) in section IV, now includes: Vzt finds UC-''UH-'' in the Japanese 1-exicon.
The first three lines of this entry are: CC-A C> UC-"UH-" am* As in example 34) in section IV, VAT createsthe representation: Since the beneficiary and measure PIS are optional, VAT rlext asks: 17.
V: IS THE WPSU~E EXPLICIT?
The next two questions are: 19.
V: WIIAT IS THZ AG~T? 21.
V: WIIAT 'IS T33 Z'ATIENla VAT now has the.
following represe~tation (cf.
36) above: VB" UR'1 / ll~~~~lf PI-2001t1GT PI-2003'l PAT CJ-".
It cc-2002 c g ~~K:~IIAII tI It 2JVAT next asks-: whereupon for Japanese.
it creques the structure: It 11 CJCC-2002 CJ-"K@IA" tr ti CJ. VM is.now at a point where it can lexicalige PI-2001 and PI-2003.
Beginpling with PI-2~01, it might ask fir~t: 25.
V: IS PI-2001 GIVEN?
In fact, however, we assume that the speaker (and addressee) are latnmtically given, so that VAT contains a general entailment to the effect that: Since by convention PI-2001qis the s~eaker, the follorirink is already stored as discourse informa~lon: Thus VAT w;:s nble to ~ive an affirmative answer to guestton 25 above without asking the user.
Pronominalization in Ja~mese is a complex matter, deaendin~ in !)art on social lela'tionships, and we have not: 7s yet c,List"ruoted a procedure to introduce the correct pronoun for a PI that is given.
We have,' however, taken advantage of the simple fact that given PIS are very often deleted, with no surf ace representation at all.
In theh present example, anti in many others, the slm~le deletion of such a PI produces the correct result, SQ that an affiqative answer t,o question 25 leads to the recresent ation: VB" UR'!
/ tlph~tl 'PI-2003 I "0" %J-".
t I CC-2002 CJ-''rn" CJ-" . II VAT now turns its attention to PI-2003: 27.
V: IS -PI--2003 GIVEN? -29.
V: DOES PI-2003 HAVE A NAPEJ 31 V: HOW IS PI-2003.
CATEGOBIZED'I (We omit here considerations of cardindli-tg).
The renresentation now is: VBI'TJRI' */ rlYAST I' NN-"~IZOOL15>" / "0" II tr SJ. CG-2002 c ~-!tmd CJ-".
11 The
first three lines of the above are xtually as far as we go at the present time in the surfrice representation of a sentence.
'rle try to include in such a representation everything that is needed to a:-rive at a correct linear sequence of words.
In this case the combination VB-"UH-" / "EASTft will yield the surf ace word -3 utta which will be placed in sentence-final positlon (followed by the peribd).
That leaves .reizookd o as the first words in the sentenhe.
VAT, would.
next ask about CC-2002, but we will not c&ry the verb lization process furt-her here.
he are interested in how just this much of -the text will-be translated into English.
By and 1-mge VAT will askthe same .questions it asked in the course of the Japanese verbalization.
It will look for the answers in the answers thpt were 3ive.n there, and when possible will ~pply corvasponding answers in .English.
Along the way, whenever aopropPiate, it will appzy syntactic processes that,are called for by the strupture of English.
The translation, then, begins with the same question that beg:in the verbalizatton' in Japanese: V: WHAT VAT Tr.rSK DO YOU WATIJT L''t3tZFORMLUil The answer given in line 2 above wtas V!IRBALIBE GC-2001.
The English translation must use its own four digit numbers; in what follows we will simply substitute the English digit "1" for 'the Japanese digit Of course here as elsewhere this question is not actua1,ly asked of the user, but is answered internally by VAT.
The next questionsexactly parallel lines 3-8 above: V: ITAAT IS THE GzNRE'2 V: CAN CC-1001 BE CI~T3~GOKIZkZD?
We assume that English would not in this case use the word because, but simply juxtapose the two sentences, as in example 8) in section 11.
Thus *the represenr;aT;lon now is: Lines 9-13 of the Japanese verbalization have a direct correspondence: V: CAN CC-1003 DE CBTEGOHIZ CDS U: NO V: HOW IS CC-1003 C~ITEGORIZEU?
At this point the Japanese was UH-.
That is, the categorization was in terms of the Japanese category UG-"UR-".
It is necessary to ffnd an English catep;ory that corresponds.
The procEdure at this point is to look flrst in a stored list of bilingual category bqu&?alences wl-rich we call interlingua.
The entries in interlingua are of the following s~rt: URSELL That is, the list contains pairs of categories, where the members of each pair are assumed to categorize what is, for all practical purposes, identical content.
The assumption is that if a CC can be categorized as an instance of UCI~UR-U in Japanese it can also be categorized as an instance of UC-"SELLtt in English, arid vice versa.
Similarly, Japanese UC-"HUN-If and Znglish UC"BOOK" are equivalent categaries.
As a general strategy we expect that pairs wlL1 gradually be.removed from interlingua as differences between the paired categories are discovered.
Lingustic research has not yet progresse,d to the point thr:t we can siy with complete certainty that aAy tpo categories from two different 1anp;uaf:es embrace exactly the same content.
At the outset, however, it is iiseful at Least to pretend tha,t .UC-lJUH-lt and UC-"SELL" are equivalent, and probably thprp we at least some pairs in interlingua that will remain viable for some time.
The present eTample w8s chosen because the answer to the last question above Gan be found in interlingua.
Later we will consider a case where it cannot.
At this polnt VKY answers its own question with: tha looks at the 1exic:il entry ror UG-~~SELL'~ (which we assume does not differ -'ran that for UCr"Ulf-"j, and creates the representation:' VBSELI;~' V"STH PI-B~GT ?PI-~?BEN '2 PI~D~MSH PI -E?PAT CJ-I' . I I CC-1002 J11 . The questions and answers which parallel llnes 15-22 of the Japanese verbal-izatim are atrnightforward; V: S TI1 LC EXPLICIT t V: kJHkT IS THE AGENT?
V: GjTIkT IS TIE i':LTIdn7T?
The rer~resantation now is: The next exchm~e is: which creates the represent at ion: With the lexicalizat~on of PI-1001 the procedure is different in English, since tbis item cannot siqnly be deleted as in the Japanese.
We follow the questions illustrated in examples 40) through 43) in section V: V: Is 1-1001 GIVEN?
Thus the repr-~entati~on now is: Now corne.8 the lexicalization of the direct object, EL'-1003.
The initi~~l question's parallel lines 27-31 of.
the Japanesd verbalization: V: 12 PI-1003 GIVSN?
V: DO26 PI-1003 HAVE A NAMX?
The Javanese answer was HEIZOOKO; VAT' will-now look in interlin~ua to see whether that item is there, and we asoumc that it will be f omd paired with English HEFHIG~HATOH.
Although *Japanese was able to terminate the verbalization of PI~2003 at this point, English must ask the qIlestion introduced in exmple 50) pf section V: The answer deoends on the context, but let us asdurne thqk it is yes.
The representation now is: bt 'de now have the kind of re~rcsantation of the first sentence that is our current goal..
~~ormal Enel-ish word order will put the subject first, the verb second, ic~d the direct object last to yield the final representation '"1 sola the refrigerator" of 72).
The above example was chosen to il1ustr:tte a mmlmally simple case of translation: one in which, in particuln~, the answers to all questions about cross-lanquage ~~ategorization could be founcl in interlingua.
Phe intereeting cases, ~QW~V~T, arc those in which interlingua does not proylde dl the answers.
It is in these cases that the zigzag arrows of Figure 1 muat be further elaborated.
The general method of elaboration is suggested in Figure 4.
Assume that we are producing .a verbalization in the t<=get language and, coming down from the upper righthand corner, we arrive at a point where a CC or PI needs to be categorized.
follow in^: arrow 1, we look across to the source language verbalization to find that the correspondln'g ZC or PI was categorized in a csrtain wqy, let us say as an instance of category A.
We look next at interlingua (arrow 2) If A were there, we would take the .target language category paired with it (such as SELL and Ri.:F!iIGE:IATQR in the exam~~le above), intFoduce it the target language verbdization, and proceed.
Now, however, xe are considering those cases in which A is not found in ivte-lingua.
The next step, following arrow 3, is to look at the entailments of A in the source languaye lexicon.
de next follow arrow 4 to search the target lanp;uap;e lexicon for entries khose entailbents are coa~atible with tho-e of A.
(This search procedure is likely to present chall-enging prob1t:ms when the source language lexicon reachany interesting size.
It io, howwer, facilitated by the Tlresence of abstract features like TRANSFER hd T'IUSACTION which can be used zo limit the domain of search).
Suppose that we find tw~ gntries in the target language lexicon, 3 mi3 C, both bf whose ent~ilments are compatible with the entailments of A.
Ue then look to see how the entailment-s of 3 a~d C differ and find, -let US say, that 3 contains entailmb:nt(s) X while r: contains entailment(s) Y.
de then follow arrow 5 back to tne aource 80urce intertarget target language lapguage 1 ingua lan u~ge f language verbal!,Ilexican Lax can verbalization w *ion choice of -category needed $haice of category A -+ Ai19t found interlook at /,in,, entaf 1ment~ of\ A find categories B and C whose entailmentsare Both compatible wish entailments of A, B and C differ with respect .to entailments X and Y.
is X or Y compatible with source languap text' \ choice of B or C accordingly Figure 4 source lan~ua~e vorbalizntion, hoping to find sometfling in it that will allow us to choose between X and Y.
(~e;ain there are chal.lenging problems in searching the aaurce language text for the answer).
Let us now assune that we find something in the source language text that is corn~~atible with X but not with Y.
We are then able to choose B as the correct target langusge catetl;ory.
We int-rocfuce that category into the target 1angua~;e verbalization via arrow 6 and proceed.
In those cases where the choice between X and Y (and hence between B and C) cannot be made--where the source language texb does nat proviae the answer-LVAT must resort to sskine; the user for the correcs caGegorlzaslon.
We will illustrate this procedure with the brieuf Japanese text: 73) Rnizooko o kasita.
Jkane ga hikuyoo datta .kua.
refrigerator r6nted money needed was because We will want VA:? to translate these two sentences into English: 74) I rented the rented the refrigerator.
I needed the moneyWe are no$ concerned in thls example with the fact that the first English sentence is amil-ji~llmls between rented (to someone) and rented .(from someone).
but with the fact that the first Jarmnese sentence is amb@ous between rented and lent.
In both ceises, it seems, the second sentence serves to dislmibif;uate.
dhat we are interested in now is the fact thilt V~Tkl.nunt ~omehow-choose between ~~ and LEND as the pr0pe.r coon'esponaent for Jananese Kiib~.
'de can ssume that nost of the verbalization in both lvlguagas proceeds 'along the lines already exemplified, since 71) and 73) sre minimally different.
Imaginq, then, thqt we have carrived at the point in the English verbalization where the au.estion is: Vt HOW 1;; CG-1003 CATECrOLlTZEU?
We are now in tho upper right of Pi~;ure/rC, and we follow arrow 1 to find that the corresponding Gc; in the ~'apanese verbalization wag categorized in terms of UC-"ICAU-'I.
We then follow arrow 7, and find that KASis not in interlingua.
'vle look next via arrow 3 at the 3ntailment.s of UC-"KM-" and find thnt they are 11s specified in example 55), section v'I above., but without the last line of thnt example : 75) CCAA J> U~~~"IQ~?:" VE> C F> n-ltKASdH (PI-B~AGT, ?i21-C~BLIJ, IJI-DTPAT) GC-A C> UC-TIfiUJ;<FEl?
PI'D = 1'1-B r* iT-F = .L I-b = PI-j).
CC-B = CC-E CC-C = CC-F Substituting four digit numbers for the %varinbles, we8 obtain: 76) CC-2003 C> U3-1tF&b-'1 I> CS-2003 F> VtL ( -20 A, ?L I-~~o;,VMD, PI-2003?i'kT; CC-2003 C > U2-=TT<A~TS~~;311 LJI-D = J'l-2001 PI-F = jJI-2902 (PL29O2, CC-2905, dnd CS-2906 Lave been inserted here as arbitrary numbers.
It i.s ouite possible, however, that these are items whicl show up ex$licir;ly elsewhere in the Jananese verbalizati >n.
For example, 21-2902, the one who receives the refrii?:rator, might well bs mentioned elsevhere in the text).
Since. CC-2003 inv~lves a tr~sf er, Vlrl must also ~s~ign numbers within the definition of UC-TH~~~FEII, given in sectiw VI akove ae example 52) : Thus there.
is a change from the renter or lender (PI-2001) Having the ob~ect (~~1-2003) to the rentee or borrower (Pr-2902) hai7ing it.
The last three lines of 76) made it clear that this was not a chwc in owdership but only a change in use, and that PI-2001 retains omm-sh5p throughbut.
Following arrow 4, we carr-y these entailments across to the English lexicon and search for entries whose entailments are compatible with 76).
Compatibility means that these entries will contain what is in what is 76), but may also contain more.
Let us say that we find two such entries, one for the category UC-"LENDt1, which was given.
in 55) above, and one for UC-"HENT-2", which was given in 57).
The next step is to isol-7te thf: differences between UC-"LEND" and UC-l'RjQFJ~-2" ' Uc-"~i$f~ff, as mentioned, differs from 75) in containing an additional final line: 78) CC-A -C> UC-TRIiNSACTIOIl That is, CC-A cannot be categorized as a -tran&action.

First, there must be a person who does he rentin@ out (0 1, a nerson who receives the rented object (PI-l9Ol), the money that is paid in rent (PI-1902), and the rented object itself (PI-1003).
Furtherinore, CG-1003 "is said to be a transaction, and certain equivalences are stated between the RENT-2 definition and the 'THMLACTI h def ini Lion.
VAT must ther*efore assign these particul-w PI and dC numbers withln the definition of u~-TRA.NSAGTION' which was givenx as example 56) in saction VI abouet 81) c;l-loo3 a> UC-IRANSACTIOR Er CC-1003 S> CJ-PURPOSE (CC-1901, CC-1902) CC-1901 C> UC-TlIiWGFEH PIrD a PI-1901 P1m.Z PI-1902 1= PI-1001 CC-1902 C> U2-TWANSFEl2 PI-F PI-1901 PI-E = 21-1003 PI-I) = l-1-1001 This says that 30-1003 can be nf7raphrased as two transfers, CC-1.901 and CC-1902, the first of which was for the mixrpose of the second.
(CC-1901 is the transfer of money, and CC-lq02 the transfer of the rented object).
VAT must, therefore, look also at the definition of UC-TRAIiSm~, ~iven in section VI above as example 52), and i~ltrgduce-eghin the proper and CG n'mbers for each of these particular trasfers.
The first of them-wlli be represented as: 82) CC-1901 C> UC-THAXSP3d E>, zs-1901 s> CJ-CHANGE (CC-1903, .':C-1904) CG71g03 F> ' W-HAVE ' (PI-1901 PI-1902) cc-1904 F> VB-HAVE ((PI-oo1-, I~I-1902) That is, the first 'transfer involves a.
chanae from ZS-1903 to 3C-1904.
In CC-1903 the rentee (1'1-1301) has the money (21-1902), and in CC-194 the renter (PI-10~1) has it.
The second trxnsfer is represented as:.
Here there is a change from CG-1905 to CC21906.
In CG-1905 the renter (PI-1901) has the obje-ct to be rentec!
(PI-100j), and in ~~-19dcj --the rentee (PI-1901) has it.
In 80) it is also stated thnt 1'2-lr302 can be catep;orized as an instance of MEDIUM-OE;l5XSIlUG,E, in all probability therefore an instance of UC-"M\JNEY'' (see exLmplo' 59) in section VI above).
'FurtAeknore it is stated that tpe change in the having of the.money (from :C-1903 to OCn1904) inyolves a change m ownership, whereas the :hange 1~1 the havina; of the rented object (from C;J-1905 to CC-1906) involves a change in the use.
Finally, it; ir; stated that the renter (PI-1001) retain3 ownership of the rented object throughout.
What VAT wants to find out, then, is whetlzer these thinas that.
must be true if CC-1003 is to be an $nnstdjnce of U'~~"ltLi~-2'~ are indeed true, or whether the bottom.lin6 in the entailments of 'JC"LElUD", exmpJe ) is fulfilled instead.
'VAT tries to decide-this bv followiny, arrow 5 to the v~rb?lizqtion of the Ja~anese text.
Of course -there aresnany ways in whhh the answer might appear in that verbaJ,ization, if it appears at all.
If VAT is unswccessfui .in its search it will have to ask the user directly? 84) V: IS CC-1003 CK'PEGOIIIZED 1;s LAND dd f1EI?IT?
In 73), however; we have made things easy .by supnlying a context which ought to decide the question..
It wil t)e remembered :hat the second sentence in 733 expresses C3-2002, whicn is the R9nS0n for CC-2005.
or what is expressed in tho first sen.teiice.
PTow, C;i-,2002 is categorized in the Japanese as an i-nctance of UJ-"AITriYOC, DA" which means something like "be nee'dedl'.
Let us assume that the Jap-anese lexicon c~ntains an entry for this categorytwhich incrludes the following: 85) CC-A C> U~'-llBITljYOO DL E> CC-A P> VB-"fIITIJYGO DAtt (pI-B+BEN, PI-z~PA'P) cE> vB-~~~,IQ (PI-B,' l;c-D) CC-D P> V13-IIAVE (PI-8, PT-C) . . Ihe case frameb immediate3y under the E> identifies 1'1-B as the beneficiary, the pe.rson. who needs something, while the thing needed .is labeledT PIX.
The second link under the E> says that an alternative framingis possible in terms of an abstract verb WNYT, wherein PI-B wants GC-D, and CC;D is then characterized in terms of PI-B hming PI-C.
In other words, when one nt?edsdsoaething, one warns to have it.
(If this is not alwqys true., at least it is the expected entailment.
) If 853 is -going to Drovlcie an answer to 84), there must also be a general prin'ciple of some kind which relates what is entailed, by CC-2002 to whak is entaiied by-CC-2003.
This general principle cw be stated as fbllows: 86) CC-A I?> V;B-WMCP (PI-B, CC-C) cc-D F> . VB-IIE~ (PI-B~AGT) 3J-RZASON (CC-A, CC-D) B> GC-D E> CC-C The first line says 'that PI-B wants CC-C.
The second line says that PI-B does something.
The third line says Ahat his wanting CC-C is the reason he does somet~ling.
All af this together is then said, $0 entail that his doing "something entails what he wants, or CC-C.
In other words,.
if one wants something and does somhethlng because of Mat.
then what one does must entail whqt one wants.
During the verbalization of X-2002 as part of the verballzation of the Japanese text, VLd will nzve recorded the lact that C2-2002 was categorized as an instance of UG-"HIT;JYOO A, and will hrtve entered the following statements in accordance with 85): 37) CC-2002 C> UC-"HITUYOO DA" E> CC-2002 F> VB-"1IIf UY00DA" (PI-200UREN, PI-2902~~~1) CC-2002 F> VB-WANT (PI-2001 9 ~~12904 CC-2904 F> VB-HAVE (PI-2001, PIn-2902 At tths point VAT also has all the particulars needed for principle 86), which can be f i-lled .out a9 fol lows: 88) GC-2002 F> VH-WANT.
(1'1-'2001, CC-2904) CC-2003 F> VB-tlKAS-lt (PI-20019 AGT) SJ-REASON (CC-2002,.
GC-2003) E> C.C-2003 E> CC-2904 The first line of 88) was obtaified from 87).
The second line was obtained from 76).
The third line comes from line B of, the Japanese verbalization set forth ab the beginning o.1 this section.
idhat we are interested in now is the last line of 881, which says in effect thab CC-2003 is categorized in such a way that CC-2904 is trbe, an? loo~ling back to 87) we see that (2':-2904 lnvolves 21-2001 having PI2902, or the agent Of kasu having okane 'money' . making the necessary correspondences in English, this means that CC-1005 must be cntegorized in such a way that CC-1904 is true., where: 'This is exactly what VAT finds as the last line of 82).
Since 82) is entailed by UC-"H:CNT-2" but r10t.b-y UC-"LEND", th'e question in 841 has been answered, and the avow labeled 6 in Figure 4 carries back the choice of UG-"HMT-~" into the English verbalization, which then proceeds as it did in the translation illustrated earlier.
By this .complex proce-ss involving comparisons of entailments within and across languages, as well as the general principle stated in 86), VAT has been able to make the correct*choice.
So long as the answer to 84) was derivable from sometr~ing discoverable within the Jepaflese verbalization, VAT could in pri-nciple succeed.
It is clear, howevet that .the route to the answer cbould be extremely complex, involvin~ chains of entajlments of unforeseeribW1en~;th.
There is no doubt that such procedures are necessary to mder such questions, and that they present an e~traordi~ary challel~ge to our techniques for information storage -and<search.
IX. Miscellaneous Problems in Translation Since we have spent considera1)le time looking into various specific translation problems beyond those illustrated above, we pres,ent here a few additional examplesox me sorts of things that will have to be takeb into account during the implementation of machine translation along the lines suggested above.
Two of these examples will, like those in the last sect?or,, involve the choice of a category in the target \language rhen that, chbice is not directly provided by interlingua.
One has to do with the translation of Japanese osieru.
into English; the othGr, the translation of English @ve into Japanese.
A third example will illustrate the 15ind of probkem that arises at the st age of subconceptualizat ion qnd sentence formation.
The following three sentences illustrate three possible English translations of the Japanese verb osierx 90) Gaido Va Kookyo,ga doko nl.
aru ka osiete kuremwlta.
guide imperial Palace where is showed Soko kara tookyoo tawaa e ikimasita.
there from Tokyo tower to went The guide chowed us where the bperial Palace was.
From there we^ went to the Tokyo Tower.
91) Gaido wa Kooky-o ga doko, no aru ka osiete kursmasita gui de Imperial Palace where is told ga watasitati ga soko e itta toki ni moo simatte but we there to 'went when already closed imasit a.
was The guide told us whem the Imperial Palace was, but when we got there it was already closed.
92) Kimatu siken no tame ni sensei wa senester-final exam of for the purpose teacher Kookyo ga doko ni aru ka osiete kud~saimnsita.
Impgrial Palace where is taught For the final exam the teacher taught us where the Imperial Palace was.
xach of these,extunples contains the phrase: 93) Kookyo-ga doko ni aru ka osiete which is translated in three diffe~ent ways, determined by the context in 90): show where the Imperial Palace is in 91): tell where the lImpe~7ial Palace is in 92): teach where the 1m~eria.l Pal .m is The difference is localized in the translation of osiete, a participial !form of the verb osieru.
This verb may "be transla-ked into Englirqh as -9 show tell, or _teach according to the coqntext, and the problem is to Identify what the determnlng rzctors atre.
The Japanese category UC-"OdIE-If -1s well as the English categories UC-"SiIOW", UC-"TELL" 9 and UC','TZACH" are all included within the more abstract cl:tegory UJ-CONWNICBTION, which can be defined as follows: 94) CC-A O> UCTC~P'lTIUNICATLON E> I1 "U CC-A F> VBTINTEND (PI-U, vb-c) GO-C ;j> CJ-OAU& (03-D, X7X) c:-u F> VB-ACT (PI-H) + ;;> 2 JIG ( F, 4 r2r3 gv-G) 3;:-E Y> -VB-+=KWU'Fi (?.I-11, CC-I) :C-G F> 'VB-K~:O:I (PI-H, 3C-I) entails that soneone (Iintends sornethlnp; -) and that whnt .-Y+l 1 he intends, is that 21 cause .

But how is it, foiexomplc, that-the context in 90) restricts the transltition of "OJIiS-" to ":JI1OW"'I The second sentence in 90) says thnt we went from there (ooko), whose referent is thr: location of the Imperial I'alace.
Thus, nt the time of the comunic:~tive event, we must have been at the Imporial Palace.
Prow, thero is evidently a generax principle, like 86) in the last sectfgn, which says that a vnrbtil act is not ujed to ccxnrnunic:ite where riomethin~ is when the beneficiary of the act is already at that place.
i'here is evidently no such restriction on direct in^^; visual attentson tc whc?re it is, hence UC-"SH\;W1' is preferred to U~:-"T;IJL".
hnce there is no thin^ in the context of 90) to su1:~ent thnt teaching methods were involved, UJ-"Y;IDW1' is left as the only crm?ldate.
In 91) the situation is otherwise.
The second clause mikes it clear through the phrase translated "when we r~;ot the~e" th t we were nl)t at the lrnp 1~iaL Palace at the time of the c~~~rnzm~c:~tlve act.
Another ~enernl principle says th~t vld~~aZ attention cm be I i directed only at thn~s within visu~1 rY:lnpe.
