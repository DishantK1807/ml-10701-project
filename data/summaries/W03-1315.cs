A large number of name extraction methods proposed in this specialized domain have focused on extracting protein names only (Fukuda et al., 1998; Franzen et al., 2002; Tanabe et al., 2002).

For the former we made use Decision Lists similar to Yarowsky’s method for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Yarowsky, 1995).

Similar to the approaches of name classification of (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999), we investigate both name internal and external clues.

This approach has also been adopted for the biomedical domain as illustrated in the work of (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001; Narayanaswamy et al., 2003; Casta˜no et al., 2002) 2. In the WSD work involving the use of context, we can find two approaches: one that uses few strong contextual evidences for disambiguation purposes, as exemplified by (Yarowsky, 1995); and the other that uses weaker evidences but considers a combination of a number of them, as exemplified by (Gale et al., 1992).
P95-1026
There are at least two efforts (Narayanaswamy et al., 2003; Kazama et al., 2002) that consider the recognition of names of different classes of biomedical relevance.

For this reason, name classification has been studied in solving the named entity extraction task in the NLP and information extraction communities (see, for example, (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) and various approaches reported in the MUC conferences (MUC-6, 1995)).

Using context has been widely used for WSD and has also been applied to name classification (for example, in (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999)).
