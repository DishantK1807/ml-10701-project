In addition, the basic implementation of Nunberg's punctuation linguistics seems untenable, certainly on a computational level, since it stipulates that punctuation phenomena should be treated on a seperate level to the lexical words in the sentence (Jones, 1994).

The major problem of the ewduatory studies, (Dale (199l), Jones (1994), and to a far lesser: extent Briscoe & Carroll (1995)), was that their coverage and use of pun<:tuation was rather poor, being necessarily based on human intuitions and possible idiosyncrasies.

In the field of syntax Jones (1994) has shown, through a comparison of the performance of a grammar that uses punctuation and one which does not, that for the more complex sentences of real language, parsing with a punctuated grammar yields around two orders of magnitude fewer parses than parsing with an nnpunctuated grammar, and that additionally the punctuated parses better reflect the linguistic structure of the sentences.

However, as pointed out by Jones (1994), it is difficult to see how this would be feasible in practice and there is little linguistic or psychological motivation for such a separation of lexicM text and punctuation.

They also point out some fundamental problems of the approach adopted by Jones (1994).
