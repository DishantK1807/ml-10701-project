The procedure to find examples from the web was the following: for each target word all possible morphological declensions were automatically generated, searched in a searchengine, documents retrieved, automatically lemmatized (Aduriz et al.2000), filtered using some heuristics to ensure quality of context, and finally filtered for PoS mismatches.

In addition to the usual release, the training and testing data were also provided in a lemmatized version (Aduriz et al.2000) which included lemma, PoS and case information.
