Abstract 
The realization of singular count nouns 
without an acompanying determiner in-
side a P (determinerless P, bare P, 
Preposition-Noun Combination) has re-
cently attracted some interest in computa-
tional linguistics. Yet, the relevant factors 
for determiner omision remain unclear, 
and conditions for determiner omision 
vary from language to language. We pre-
sent a logistic regresion model of deter-
miner omision in German based on data 
obtained by applying annotation mining 
to a large, automatically and manually 
annotated corpus.  
1 The
problem and how to deal with it 
Preposition-Noun Combinations (PNCs, some-
times called determinerles Ps or bare Ps) 
minimaly consist of a preposition and a count 
noun in the singular that – despite requirements 
formulated elsewhere in the gramar of the re-
spective language – apears without a detr-
miner. The noun in a PNC can be extended 
through prenominal modification (1) and post-
nominal complementation (2). Stil, a determiner 
is missing. The folowing examples are given 
from German. 
(1) auf parlamentarische Anfrage (‘after being 
asked in parliament’), mit beladenem Ruck-
sack (‘with loaded backpack’), unter sanfter 
Androhung (‘under gentle threat’)  
(2) Er wehrt sich gegen die Forderung nach 
he defies REFL against the demand for 
Stillegung einer Verbrennungsanlage. 
closedown an incineration plant 
‘He defies the demand for closing an inciner-
ation plant.’ 
PNCs ocur in a wide range of languages 
(Himelman, 198); the conditions for deter-
miner omision, however, have not ben detected 
yet, and conditions applying to one language do 
not cary over to other languages. In adition, 
speakers only reluctantly judge the aceptability 
of newly coined PNCs, so that reliance to intro-
spective judgments canot be assumed. 
For English, Stvan (198) and Baldwin et al. 
(206) have claimed that either the semantics of 
the preposition or of the noun play a major role 
in determining whether a singular count noun 
may apear without a determiner in a PNC. 
Stvan (198) asumes that nouns determine the 
wel-formednes of PNCs (3) if the denotation of 
the noun ocurs in a particular semantic field, 
while Baldwin et al. (206) asume that certain 
prepositions impose selection restrictions o 
their nominal coplements that alow for detr-
miner omision (4). 
(3) from schol, at schol, in jail, from jail, … 
(4) by train, by plane, by bus, by pogo stick, by 
hydro-foil … 
Interestingly, Le Bruyn et al. (2009) have ob-
served that basic assumptions of Stvan’s analysis 
do not apply to Dutch, French, or Norwegian. 
With regard to German, we observe that neither 
the pattern in (3) nor in (4) is productive. Con-
structions like (4) canot be realized as PNCs in 
German, but require ful Ps. 
In the folowing, we propose an analysis of 
PNCs that combines corpus anotation, anota-
tion mining (Chiarcos et al., 208), and logistic 
regresion modeling (Harel, 201). Anotation 
mining asumes that linguistically relevant gen-
eralizations can be derived in a botom-up fash-
ion from a suitably anotated corpus. Relevant 
hits in the corpus are mapped into a feature vec-
tor that serves as input for logistic regresion 
classification. In the present case, the input con-
561
sists of sentences containing either PNCs or PPs. 
Binary logistic regresion suggests itself as a 
classification method since the problem of PNCs 
can be rephrased as the folowing question: Un-
der which conditions can an otherwise obligatory 
determiner be omited? 
The majority of required anotations can be 
derived automaticaly, but there are no available 
systems for the automatic determination of 
preposition senses in Geran, so preposition 
sense anotation has to be caried out manualy 
and requires a language-specific tagset for prepo-
sition senses. 
While our initial analysis is based on German 
data, the general methodology can be applied to 
other languages, provided that corpora receive 
proper annotation.   
2 Corpus
anotation 
2.1 General
characteristics 
The present analysis is based on a newspaper 
corpus of the Swis-German newspaper Neue 
Zürcher Zeitung from 193 to 199, comprising 
approx. 230 milion words. The annotation is 
based on an XML-stand-off format. MMAX2 
(Müler and Strube, 206) is used for manual 
annotation. Annotations are caried out both for 
PNCs and for ful-fledged Ps. For each prepo-
sition, the following data is considered: PNCs, 
where N is a count noun; coresponding PPs with 
the same count noun; and Ps containing count 
nouns not appearing inside PNCs. 
The folowing anotations are provided for 
each dataset in the corpus: 
Lexical level: pat-of-spech, inflectional 
morphology, derivational morphology of nouns, 
count/mass distinction of nouns, interpretation of 
nouns, interpretation of prepositions, noun com-
pounding. 
Syntactic level: mode of embeding of the 
phrase (adjunct or complement), syntactic de-
pendents of the noun, modification of the noun. 
Global level: Is the phrase contained in a 
headline, title, or quotation? Is the phrase idio-
matic? Headlines, titles, and quotations are par-
ticularly prone to text truncation and PNCs oc-
curing here might not be the result of syntactic 
operations. Similarly, idiomatic PNCs and PPs 
might folow combination rules that difer from 
the general modes of combination. Hence, the 
annotations may serve to exclude these cases 
from general clasification. 
2.2 Automatic
annotation  
The folowing tols are employed for automatic 
annotation: Regression Forest Tagger (Schmid 
and Laws, 208) for POS tagging and morpho-
logical analysis (the tager contains the SMOR 
component for morphological analysis, cf. 
Schmid, 204), and Tre Tager (Schmid, 195) 
for chunk parsing.  
To determine noun meanings, we make use of 
two resources. The first resource is GermaNet 
(Kunze and Lemnitzer, 202), the Geran ver-
sion of WordNet. We employ 23 top-level cate-
gories, and each noun is annotated with every 
top-level category it belongs to.
1
 Secondly, we 
use the computer lexicon HaGenLex (Hartrumpf 
et al., 203), which ofers specifc sortal infor-
mation derived from a formal ontology for each 
noun. Finaly, we employ a clasifier for the 
count/mass distinction. The clasifier combines 
lexical statistics, expresed in terms of a decision 
tre clasifier, with contextual information, 
which is handled by Naïve Bayes clasification 
(cf. Stadtfeld 2010). The clasification is based 
on the fine-grained distinctions first introduced 
in Allan (1980), but we employ a reduced set of 
five instead of eight clases. The classifier is 
type-based as it makes use of the relation be-
twen singular and plural realizations of noun 
lemas, but takes the immediate context of the 
lema into acount.   
Nouns are only asigned to a particular clas if 
both clasifiers come to the same result w.r.t. 
this clas asignment. While this leads to some 
nouns being excluded from the count/mas dis-
tinction, the resulting clases show a high degree 
of precision.  
2.3 Manual
annotation of preposition senses 
Prepositions are highly polysemous. What is 
more, the relation betwen a preposition and its 
senses has to be determined in a language-
                                                
1
 Nouns that are asigned to more than one top-level cate-
gory are presumably homonymous or polysemous. We do 
not disambiguate the nouns. The reason is that individual 
features wil be evaluated for their effect in a logistic model, 
and an ambiguous noun wil receive a value in each feature. 
Hence, we can be sure that a significant semantic feature 
wil be included in the clasification. 
562
specific maner. While the Preposition Project 
forms a basis for preposition sense anotation in 
English (cf. Litkowski and Hargraves 205, 
2007), little attention has ben paid to specialized 
annotation schemata for prepositon sense in 
German, which form the first prerequisite for a 
classification of preposition senses.  
Based on four usage-based gramars and dic-
tionaries of German (Duden 202, Helbig and 
Buscha 201, Durel and Brée 193, Schröder 
1986), we have developed an anotation schema 
with a hierarchical structure, alowing for sub-
tres of preposition senses that require a fine-
grained clasification (such as TEMPORAL, SPA-
TIAL, CAUSAL, and PRESENCE). For temporal and 
spatial interpretations, the anotation is further 
facilitated by the use of decision tres.
2
 
Altogether, the anotation schema includes the 
folowing list of top-level categories: MODAL, 
CAUSAL, PRESENCE, SPATIAL, TEMPORAL, STATE, 
COMITATIVE, AG, REDUCTIN/EXTENSION, 
PARTICIPATION, SUBORINAO, RECIPET, 
AFFILIATION, C/INTERACTION, 
TRANSGRESSION, ORDER, THEME, SUBSIUE, 
EXCHANGE, CMPAISON, RESTRICTIVE, COPU-
LATIVE, ADVERSTIVE, DIIBUI, STAE-
MENT/OPINION, CENTRE OF REFERENCE, and RE-
ALISATION. 
Based on an extension of the weighted kapa 
statistic we have reached an overal kapa value 
(κ
w
)
 
of 0.657 and values betwen 0.551 and 
0.860 for individual features (cf. Müller et al. 
2010a). Two properties of the anotation schema 
prohibit the application of a standard kappa sta-
tistic: First, the schema allows subsorts, and sec-
ondly, a preposition may receive more than one 
annotation if its sense cannot be fuly disambigu-
ated. The values reported in Müler et al. (2010) 
for maximal subtypes such as SPATIAL (κ
w
 = 
0.709) and TEMPORAL (κ
w
 = 0.860) can be 
equated to aggregate values in standard kapa 
statistics.  
In the models presnted below, we employ 
top-level categories only and have aggregated 
more specific sense annotations.

 The schema does not directly distinguish betwen local 
and directional senses, but makes use of cross-classification 
to deal with the distinction. Cf. Müller et al. (2010b).   
3 Preparing
logistic regresion models 
for ohne (‘without’) and unter (‘un-
der’, ‘below’) 
The problem of PNCs, i.e. why a determiner is 
omited in a construction which otherwise re-
quires the realization of the determiner, can be 
rephrased as a problem for binary logistic regres-
sion and classification. 
While binary logistic regresion does not pro-
hibit monocausal explanations, typical models 
for binary logistic regresion employ more than 
one factor, and the value of the coeficients mod-
els the relative influence of the individual fac-
tors. Logistic regresion thus does not only help 
to identify factors for determiner omission, but 
also reveals the interplay of multiple licensing 
conditions – thus posibly acountig for the 
relative dificulty to distinguish aceptable from 
inaceptable PNCs. 
We are aiming at a description of PNCs in 
German for the 22 prepositions listed in (5). 
(5) an, auf, bei, dank, durch, für, gegen, gemäß, 
hinter, in, mit, mitels, nach, neben, ohne, seit, 
über, um, unter, vor, während, wegen 
These prepositons have been chosen on the 
basis of the following two asumptions: a) they 
appear in PNCs and Ps, and b) their ‘typical’ 
object is an NP.  
We present logistic regresion models of de-
terminer realization for two prepositions: ohne 
(‘without’) and unter (‘under’, ‘below’). The first 
preposition, ohne, is the only preposition that 
appears more often in PNCs than in Ps. The 
second preposition, unter, belongs to the clas of 
highly polysemous prepositions. In fact, it is the 
preposition with the second largest number of 
senses (10 senses), only surpased by mit (‘with’) 
(11 senses), which however appears much more 
often than unter in the corpus and thus requires 
further anotation. The folowing table suma-
rizes the distribution of PNCs and Ps for both 
prepositions, after tokens that had been annotated 
as belonging to headlines, quotations, telegram 
style sentences, or as being idiomatic wer ex-
cluded from the data. With regard to the first 
group (headlines etc.), the elimination mostly 
applies to PNCs, but among the Ps we found 
many idiomatic expresions and fixed phrases, 
which have also ben excluded from odeling.

Table 1. Data Distribution of PNCs and Ps 
 
The analysis has ben caried out in R (R De-
velopment Core Team, 2010) and makes exten-
sive use of Harel’s DESIGN package (Harel, 
2001). 
The feature vector consists of the dependent 
variable – the factor DET with its levels no and 
yes – and of relvant classificatory features rep-
resenting the interpretation of the preposition (in 
terms of the features presented in section 2), the 
internal syntactic structure of the nominal projec-
tion (prenominal modification of N, syntactic 
arguments of N, internal structure of N as a com-
pound, derivational status of N), the external 
syntactic embeding of the PNC or P, and the 
interpretation of the noun.  
Features starting with DEP signify syntactic 
arguments of the noun (DEP-S a sentential com-
plement, DEP-NP an NP complement, etc.); the 
feature ADJA signifes the presnce of one or 
more modifying adjectives; the feature COM-
POUND indicates whether the noun in question is 
a compound. The feature GOVERNED indicates 
whether a noun or a verb governs the phrase. The 
feature NOMINALIZATION provides information 
about the derivational structure of the noun, in 
particular it indicates whether a noun is derived 
from a verb by use of the suffix –ung. 
Features starting with GN are GermaNet top-
level categories, features starting with HL are 
HaGenLex ontological sorts; both describe the 
interpretation of the noun.  
The statistical modeling started with the as-
sumption that each feature is relevant, so that an 
initial feature set of 92 features was considered. 
Feature elimination took place through fast 
backwards elimination (Lawles and Singhal, 
1978) and manual inspection. The results of fast 
backwards elimination were not followed blindly. 
Folowing Harel’s (201:56) suggestion, we 
have kept factors despite their low significance 
levels. In most cases, however, manual inspec-
tion and fast backwards elimination sugested 
the same results. The resulting models were sub-
jected to bootstrap validation to identify posible 
overfiting (cf. section 5.1).   
The value DET = no is taken to be the default 
value in the following models. As a consequence, 
negative values for coeficients indicate rising 
probability for an omision of a determiner, 
while positive coeficients shift ods in favor of 
a realization of the determiner. 
4 Logistic
models for the omision of a 
determiner with ohne and unter 
The logistic regresion models developed for the 
prepositions ohne and unter make use of 13 and 
2 features, respectively. In each case, we have 
started with a ful model fit (Harel, 201:58f.), 
evaluated the ful model and eliminated factors 
through manual inspection and fast backwards 
elimination. The coefficients for the models for 
ohne and unter are reported in tables 2 and 3.

Table 4. Model Quality. 
4.1 The
model for ohne 
Starting with the model in table 2, we can iden-
tify several groups of factors: 
The first group comprises the interpretation of 
the preposition. The group discriminates betwen 
determiner omision and realization. The seman-
tic features CAUSAL, COMITATIVE, and PARTICI-
PATION show positive coefficients, sugesting 
that prepositions receiving the aforementioned 
interpretations tend to favor an ‘ordinary’ NP 
including a determiner. The interpretation PRES-
ENCE, on the other hand, shows a negative coef-
ficient and thus sugests the omision of a de-
terminer. There are further senses of ohne, which 
do not have a significant effect on detrminer 
omision/realization.  
Turning to the representation of syntactic ar-
gument structure of the noun, we find that the 
coefficients of DEP-S, DEP-NP, and DEP-PP re-
ceive positive values throughout. The presence 
of syntactic complements thus shifts ods in fa-
vor of determiner realization. There is a strong 
preference against determiner omision with 
DEP-S, and somewhat weaker values for Dep-NP 
and Dep-PP, respectively. A comparison of in-
terpretation and complement realization offers a 
general asesment of PNCs. As ohne and unter 
share only a few senses, we do not necessarily 
expect that the discerning senses relevant for a 
realization of a PNC with ohne cary over to un-
ter; but we do expect that features pertaining to 
the syntactic structure of the nominal comple-
ment play a role not only for ohne, but for unter 
(or for prepositions admiting PNCs in general) 
as well. And this prediction is actually borne out 
in the model for unter. The model thus already 
offers interesting insights not only w.r.t. the re-
alization conditions of PNCs and Ps headed by 
ohne, but for broader analyses of PNCs as well.  
We wil return to the role and value of the fea-
tures ADJA and NOMINALIZATION in section 4.3. 
The last group comprises the semantic charac-
teristics of nouns derived from GermaNet. If a 
noun is clasifed as belonging to the relvant 
GermaNet top-level categories, determiner omi-
ssion is favored. 
4.2 The
model for unter 
A first glance at the model for unter shows that it 
requires a larger set of predictors than the model 
for ohne. In part, this is due to the higher degre 
of polysemy of unter: with more senses, we ex-
pect more semantic predictors to enter the dis-
crimination. In adition, a wider range of senses 
565
also allows for a wider range of selection restric-
tions, and hence for a larger number of diferent 
sortal specifications for selected nouns.  The 
higher complexity of the model, however, should 
not conceal a peculiarity of this model that casts 
serious doubt on the idea that PNCs are mono-
causally licensed by particular senses of a prepo-
sition: the model selects five senses from the ten 
top level interpretations of unter, but the coefi-
cients are unsigned. Thus, the model indicates 
that the senses SPATIAL, CAUSAL, SUBORDINA-
TION, ORDER, and TRANSGRESION block the 
omision of a determiner. What we do not find 
are senses that favor the omision of a deter-
miner. 
The features DEP-S, DEP-NP, and DEP-PP 
again favor the realization of a determiner. A 
comparison of the coefficient of DEP-S to the 
coefficients of DEP-NP and DEP-PP shows, how-
ever, that the presence of a sentential comple-
ment has a strong influence on determiner reali-
zation, while NPand PP-complements may stil 
occur in PNCs, as their coeficients are relatively 
low (also in comparison to the coeficients of 
these values for ohne).
4
 
In more general terms, we suspect a general 
mechanism relating sentential complementation 
to the realization of the determiner, a topic to be 
addressed in future research.  
It should also be noted that the external syn-
tactic realization of the phrase plays a role for 
unter. The feature GOVERNED did not play a role 
for ohne, but suggests the realization of a deter-
miner for unter. The reason might be that few 
verbs or nouns govern the prepositon ohne. 
Prepositional objects headed by unter, however, 
are more comon. Prepositional objects headed 
by ohne make up only 1.2 % of the ocurences 
of ohne in the present corpus, while the share of 
prepositional objects headed by unter is thre 
times larger: 3.6 %. 
Finaly, we note that a variety of sortal classi-
fications for nouns sugest either an omision or 
realization of the determiner, suporting the as-
                                                
4
 One could argue against the inclusion of the coeficient for 
DEP-PP altogether, as it does not seem to be significant (p > 
0.05) in the first place. However, we have followed Har-
rel’s (201) advice that blind exclusion of semingly insig-
nificant factors may not lead to model improvement. In fact, 
models for unter including Dep-PP outperform odels ex-
cluding this feature. 
sumption that in adition to the preposition’s 
meaning, the meaning of the noun plays a role. 
GermaNet top-level categories were already dis-
criminating in the model for ohne; but the model 
for unter also makes use of HaGenLex sortal 
categories (HL-AD and HL-AS). The predictors 
stand for dynamic and static concepts that both 
receive an abstract interpretation. Their inclusion 
is particularly interesting, as it is sometimes 
claimed (e.g. Bale and Barner, 209) that ‘ab-
stract’ nouns are never to be clasified as count 
nouns. 
4.3 General
asesment of the models 
Both models show that the realization of syntac-
tic complements, of sentential complements in 
particular, sems to impede determiner omision. 
That syntactic complexity does not sem to play 
a role per se, can be deduced from the coefi-
cients for the factor ADJA: While ADJA favors 
determiner realization with ohne, it prohibits de-
terminer realization with unter. 
The role of morphological derivation through 
–ung, as represented by the factor NOMINALIZA-
TION, is the same in both models: derived nomi-
nals shift odds in favor of determiner omision. 
While the derivational structure might be consid-
ered a formal property of the construction, it 
might also reflect an underlying denotational dis-
tinction betwen events and objects, which has to 
be clarified in future work. 
It is a striking feature of the model for unter 
that we do not find interpretational features of 
the preposition unter that favor determiner omis-
sion. Taken together with the other factors in the 
two models presented, the analysis sugests a 
picture rather diferent from the (more or les) 
monocausal analyses of Stvan (198) and 
Baldwin et al. (206). With regard to unter a 
model in the sense of Baldwin et al. (206) could 
only provide negative rules of the form “if P 
does not mean this, its nominal complement may 
be realized without a determiner”, but such a 
model would lead to les precision than the mul-
ticausal model presented here. 
5 Validation
of the models 
5.1 Bootstrap
validation 
Logistic regresion models may sufer from 
overfiting the data. We have thus carried out a 
566
bootstrap validation of both models and aplied 
penalized maximum likelihood estimation (Har-
rel, 201) to the models. The results of the ini-
tial (non-penalized) models are reported in Table 
5 and Table 6, where we report values for D
xy
 
and the average maximal error of the model. 
Bootstrap validation makes use of sampling with 
replacement. The training samples for evaluation 
thus may contain certain instances many times, 
but some original data wil never be sampled and 
can thus be used for testing the models. Bot-
strap validation is caried out 200 times, the re-
sults being averaged. The overfiting of the mod-
els is determined by the optimism derived from 
the botstrap evaluation.

5.2 Representing
the influence of factors in 
a nomogram 
The respective influence of individual factors can 
be read of a nomogram (Banks, 1985) derived 
from the models presented above (we make use 
of a tabular presentation for reasons of legibil-
ity). The nomogram for ohne consits of the ta-
bles 9 and 10. Table 9 lists the individual scores 
for the factors in the model for ohne, were 0 in-
dicates that the pertinent property is not present 
and 1 indicates that the property is present. Table 
10 maps the sum to probability of determiner 
omision.

NOMINALIZATION  27  0

points to probability of determiner omision. 
 
As an ilustration, consider pairs of ohne and a 
noun with the values in (6) and (7). 
(6) NOMINALIZATION = 1, ADJA = 1, COMITA-
TIVE = 1, all other senses including PRESENCE 
= 0, all GN features = 0, DEP features = 0. 
(7) NOMINALIZATION = 0, ADJA = 1, PRESENCE = 
1, all other senses = 0, GN-ATTRIBUTE = 1, al 
other GN features = 0, DEP features = 0. 
Given the individual scores for the factors in 
table 9, the total number of points for the combi-
nation in (6) is 144, leading to a probability of 
0.7 that a determiner will be omited in the con-
struction. In other words, a determiner omision 
is likely with the feature set given in (6). In (7), 
we reach a total of 92 only, so that the likelihod 
of determiner omision rises above 0.9. 
6 Summary
and prospects 
The models presented suport the general as-
sumption that the realization or omission of a 
determiner in a prepositional phrase should be 
analyzed as a multicausal phenomenon. The lo-
gistic regresion analysis presents evidence for 
the asumption that the senses of the preposition 
and the interpretation of the noun (posibly gov-
erned by selection restrictions of the preposition) 
as well as the syntactic complexity of the em-
bedded nominal projection are major factors in 
determining whether an article can be dropped or 
not. 
With regard to the complexity of the nominal 
projection, the two models presented here indi-
cate that it is not complexity per se, but that the 
realization of a complement of the noun, in par-
ticular of a sentential complement, clearly raises 
the probability of article realization. While this is 
a speculation, based on the models presented 
here, it might very wel be that this dependency 
reflects a deper referential requirement. 
In developing further models for prepositions, 
we expect that the realization of a complement of 
the noun will establish itself as a comon factor, 
but this has to await further research and model 
development.
