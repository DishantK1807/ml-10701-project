Although mining specific semantic relations and subcategorization information from free-text has been successfully carried out in the past (Hearst, 1999; Manning, 1993), automatically extracting lexical resources (including terminological definitions) from text in special domains has been a field less explored, but recent experiences (Klavans et al., 2001; Rodríguez, 2001; Cartier, 1998) show that compiling the extensive resources that modern scientific and technical disciplines need in order to manage the explosive growth of their knowledge, is both feasible and practical.

Although our test runs using only collocations showed initially that structural regulari6 With a ß factor of 1.0, and within the sociology document set 7 see Ratnaparkhi (1997) and Berger et al.(1996) for a formal description of these algorithms ties would perform well, both with our restricted lemma cluster and with our wider set of verbs and markers, our intuitions about improvement with more features (more positions to the right of left of the markers) or a more controlled and grammatically restricted environment (a finite set of surrounding POS tags), turned out to be overly optimistic.

Gathering knowledge from unstructured text often requires manually crafting knowledgeengineering rules both complex and deeply dependent of the domain at hand, although some successful experiences using learning algorithms have been reported (Fisher et al., 1995; Chieu et al., 2003).
