Our restriction is fundamentally different from those in (Schabes and Waters, 1993; Schabes and Waters, 1995) and (Rogers, 1994), in that we allow wrapping auxiliary trees to nest inside each other an unbounded number of times, so long as they only adjoin at one place in each others' spines.

A careful inspection of the proof provided in (Satta, 1994) reveals that the source of the claimed computational complexity of TAG parsing resides in the fact that auxiliary trees can get adjunctions at (at least) two distinct nodes in their spine (the path connecting the root and the foot nodes).

Although asymptotically faster methods can be constructed, as discussed in (Rajasekaran and Yooseph, 1995), these methods are not of practical interest, due to large hidden constants.
P95-1023
Several restrictions on the adjunction operation for TAG have been proposed in the literature (Schabes and Waters, 1993; Schabes and Waters, 1995) (Rogers, 1994).

Rogers' regular form restriction (Rogers, 1994), we can cite verb-raised complement auxiliary trees in Dutch as in Figure 5 (Kroch and Santorini, 1991).

More generally, in (Satta, 1994) it has been argued that methods for TAG parsing running in time asymptotically faster than O(n 6) are unlikely to have small hidden constants.

of Coverage In contrast to the formalisms of Schabes and Waters (Schabes and Waters, 1993; Schabes and Waters, 1995), our restriction allows wrapping complement auxiliaries as in Figure 4 (Schabes and Waters, 1995).
