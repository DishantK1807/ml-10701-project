It has been shown that local collocations and morphology of target word play important roles in word sense disambiguation or discrimination (Leacock et al., 1998; Widdows, 2003).

In (Leacock et al., 1998), they used Bayesian approach for sense disambiguation of three ambiguous words, “hard”, “line”, and “serve”, based on cues from topical and local context.

In (Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999), a term weight learning algorithm was proposed for verb sense disambiguation, which can automatically extract nouns co-occurring with verbs and identify the number of senses of an ambiguous verb.

The algorithm in (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) represented target noun word, its neighbors and their relationships using a graph in which each node denoted a noun and two nodes had an edge between them if they co-occurred with more than a given number of times.

Work Besides the two works (Pantel and Lin, 2002; Sch¨utze, 1998), there are other related efforts on word sense discrimination (Dorow and Widdows, 2003; Fukumoto and Suzuki, 1999; Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).

Another application of word sense learning is to help enriching or even constructing semantic lexicons (Widdows, 2003).
N03-1036
In (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), they described an experimental comparison of three clustering algorithms for word sense discrimination.

Sense disambiguation is essential for many language applications such as machine translation, information retrieval, and speech processing (Ide and V´eronis, 1998).
