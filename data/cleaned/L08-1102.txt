GPHIN is a multilingual Internet-based early warning system that gathers preliminary reports with potential public-health significance on a nearly real-time basis (Blench 2007). GPHIN continuously gathers and disseminates multilingual information from newswire and web sites, which requires several MT sub-systems or ‘engines’, which were carefully selected to ensure the suc</context>

The evaluators’ interface helps to generate MT evaluation plans based on a given context of use, offering signific</context>

Therefore, the influence of the intended context of use on the quality model is represented formally as a matrix, called a generic contextual quality model or GCQM (Popescu-Belis et al. 2006). Each row of the FEMTI GCQM represents a quality characteristic of Part II, and each column is a context characteristic from Part I.
