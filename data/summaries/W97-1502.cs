The examples given here are in fact all for Englis\]h, but the TreeBanker has also successfully been used for Swedish and French customizations of the CLE (GambÂ£ck and Rayner, 1992; Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1996).
P96-1030
Given an input string, N-best list or lattice, the CLE applies unification-based syntactic rules and their corresponding semantic rules to create zero or more quasi-logical form (QLF, described below; Alshawi, 1992; Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) analyses of it; disambiguation is then a matter of selecting the correct (or at least, the best available) QLF.
P92-1005
Engelson and Dagan (1996) present a scheme for selecting corpus sentences whose judging is likely to provide useful new information, rather than those that merely repeat old patterns.
P96-1042
Linguistic processing in the SLT system is carried out by the Core Language Engine (CLE; Alshawi, 1992).
P92-1005
Many mainstream systems and formalisms would satisfy these criteria, including ones such as the University of Pennsylvania Treebank (Marcus et al, 1993) which are purely syntactic (though of course, only syntactic properties could then be extracted).

Those properties that hold for some analyses of a particular utterance but not for others I will refer to as discriminants (Dagan and ltai, 1994; Yarowsky, 1994).
