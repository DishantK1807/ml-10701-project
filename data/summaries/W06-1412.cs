Algorithms developed according to the centering framework use discourse coherence to make decisions about pronominalization (Grosz et al., 1995), where coherence is measured in terms of topical continuity from one sentence to the next.

Examples include hand-held tourist information portals (Johnston et al., 2002) campus tour guides (Yang et al., 1999; Long et al., 1996; Striegnitz et al., 2005), direction-giving avatars for visitors to a building (Cassell et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2005), in-car driving direction systems (Dale et al., 2003; Wahlster et al., 2001), and pedestrian navigation systems (Muller, 2002).

We plan to incorporate the results of this study in an extension of (Reiter and Dale, 1992) algorithm that would take into account other types of properties of the objects like visual salience, temporal attributes (for example time elapsed between mentions), if it participated in an action (like the case of a door opening, or a button being pushed) or its importance to the overall task completion.

In natural language generation, the process of generating referring expressions occurs in stages (Reiter and Dale, 1992).

The items mentioned in each unit were ranked according to thematic roles, using the ranking {AGENT > PATIENT > COMP > ADJUNCT}, and excluding references to the speakers themselves, which often appear in AGENT position (Byron and Stent, 1998).

Another related study in statistical NP generation (Cheng et al., 2001) focuses on choosing the modifiers to be included.
