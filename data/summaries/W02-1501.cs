Since the beginning of work on broadcoverage parsing (Jensen 1988a, 1988b), the key issue has been how to make effective use of lexical information.

Automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames allows systems to access highly context dependent constructions, to fill in possible lexical gaps and eventually rely on frequency information to tune the relative impact of specific frames (Carroll et al.1998). Lexicon coverage is usually regarded as the main parameter affecting use of lexical information for parsing.

Important examples are LDOCE (Procter 1987), ComLex (Grishman et al.1994), PAROLE (Ruimy et al.1998). These lexicons are basically hand-crafted by expert lexicographers, and their natural purpose is to provide general purpose, domain-independent syntactic information, covering the most frequent entries and frames.
