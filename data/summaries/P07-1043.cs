goals In order to use the planner as a surface realization algorithm for TAG along the lines of Koller and Striegnitz (2002), we attach semantic content to each elementary tree and require that the sentence achieves a certain communicative goal.

However, this problem is NP-complete, by reduction of Hamiltonian Cycle – unsurprisingly, given that it encompasses realization, and the very similar realization problem in Koller and Striegnitz (2002) is NP-hard.

Unlike some approaches (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), we do not have to distinguish between generating NPs and expressions of other syntactic categories.

In a scenario that involves multiple rabbits, multiple hats, and multiple individuals that are inside other individuals, but only one pair of a rabbit r inside a hat h, the expression “X takes the rabbit from the hat” is sufficient to refer uniquely to r and h (Stone and Webber, 1998).
W98-1419
While there have been previous systems that encode generation as planning (Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Appelt, 1985; Heeman and Hirst, 1995), our approach is distinguished from these systems by its focus on the grammatically specified contributions of each individual word (and the TAG tree it anchors) to syntax, semantics, and local pragmatics (Hobbs et al., 1993).
