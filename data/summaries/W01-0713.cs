Pereira and Schabes(1992) use partially bracketed corpora and Carroll and Charniak(1992) restrict the set of non-terminals that may appear on the right hand side of rules with a given left hand side.

The work of van Zaanen (2000) does not have this problem, and appears to perform well on small data sets, but it is not clear whether it will scale up to large data sets.

Work Preliminary experiments with tags derived automatically using distributional clustering (Clark, 2000), have shown essentially the same results.

Two of these, a16a18a9a11a8a13a12 and a20a6a9a11a8a19a12 are just the prefix and suffix probability distributions for the symbol(Stolcke, 1995): the probabilities that the string derived from a8 begins (or ends) with a particular tag.

Pereira and Schabes (1992) establish that evaluation according to the bracketing accuracy and evaluation according to perplexity or crossentropy are very different.
P92-1017
This naturally suggests a minimum description length (MDL) or Bayesian approach (Stolcke, 1994; Chen, 1995).

Table 6 presents the results of the evaluation on the ATIS corpus, with the results on this algorithm (CDC) compared against two other algorithms, EMILE (Adriaans et al., 2000) and ABL (van Zaanen, 2000).
