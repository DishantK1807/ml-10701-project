Our entity extraction subsystem and the tokenizer were adapted from PennBioTagger (McDonald et al, 2005; Jin et al, 2005; Lerman et al, 2006).

Other improvements we may incorporate in future include augmenting the parser’s dictionary to include biomedical terms (Slozovits, 2003), pre-processing so as to split long and complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones (Ding et al, 2003), modifying the grammar to handle with unknown constructs, and changing the link parser’s ranking system (Pyysalo, 2004).

Overall, the extraction of both entities and single-sentence-embodied inter-entity relationships has proved far more difficult in the biomedical domain than in other domains such as newspaper text (Nédellec, 2005; Jing et al, 2003; Pyysalo, 2004).

Substituting un109 common and multi-word entity names with simple noun identifiers (a suggestion we drew from Pyysalo, 2004) reduced the error rate significantly, via bypassing problems related to wrong guessing of unknown words, improper handling of parentheses, and excessive possible-parse production.

Systems extracting these sorts of relationships from text have been developed using a variety of technologies, including support vector machines (Donaldson et al, 2003), maximum entropy models and graph algorithms (McDonald, 2005), Markov models and first order logic (Riedel, 2005) and finite state automata (Hakenberg, 2005).

Another is that biomedical text has many features that are quite uncommon or even nonexistent in newspaper text (Pyysalo, 2004), such as numerical post-modifiers of nouns (Serine 38), non-capitalized entity names (…ftsY is solely expressed during...), hyphenated verbs (X cross-links Y), nominalizations, and uncommon usage of parentheses (sigma(H)-dependent expression of spo0A).
