Then, we extract all the occurrences of these pairs found within the semantic tagged corpus formed with the 179 texts from SemCor(Miller et al., 1993).
H93-1061
(Gonzalo et al., 1998) performed experiments in sense based indexing: they used the SMART retrieval system and a manually disambiguated collection (Semcor).
W98-0705
A pseudo-word is an artificially created ambiguous word, like for example "banana-door" (pseudo-words have been introduced for the first time in (Yarowsky, 1993), as means of testing WSD accuracy without the costs associated with the acquisition of sense tagged corpora).
H93-1052
The part-of-speech tagging task is performed with high accuracy using an improved version of Brill's tagger (Brill, 1992).
A92-1021
One of the largest studies regarding the applicability of word semantics to IR is reported by Krovetz (Krovetz and Croft, 1993), (Krovetz, 1997).
