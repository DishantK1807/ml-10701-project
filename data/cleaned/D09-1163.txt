Abstract 
 
The problem of re-ranking initial retrieval re-
sults exploring the intrinsic structure of docu-
ments is widely researched in information re-
trieval (IR) and has attracted a considerable 
amount of time and study. However, one of 
the drawbacks is that those algorithms treat 
queries and documents separately.  Further-
more, most of the approaches are predomi-
nantly built upon graph-based methods, which 
may ignore some hidden information among 
the retrieval set.   
This paper proposes a novel document re-
ranking method based on Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (LDA) which exploits the implicit 
structure of the documents with respect to 
original queries. Rather than relying on graph-
based techniques to identify the internal struc-
ture, the approach tries to find the latent struc-
ture of ‚Äútopics‚Äù or ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù in the initial re-
trieval set. Then we compute the distance be-
tween queries and initial retrieval results based 
on latent semantic information deduced. Em-
pirical results demonstrate that the method can 
comfortably achieve significant improvement 
over various baseline systems.  
1 Introduction

Consider a traditional IR problem, where there 
exists a set of documents ùîª  in the collection. In 
response to an information need (as expressed in 
a query ùëû ), the system determines a best fit be-
tween the query and the documents and returns a 
list of retrieval results, sorted in a decreasing or-
der of their relevancy. In practice, high precision 
at the top rankings of the returned results is of 
particular interest. Generally, there are two ways 
to automatically assist in achieving this ultimate 
goal after an initial retrieval process (Baeza-
Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999): document re-
ranking and query expansion/re-weighting. Since 
the latter normally need a second round of re-
trieval process, our method focuses on the docu-
ment re-ranking approach.  We will focus on ad-
justing the ranking positions directly over initial 
retrieval results set ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë° .  
Recently, there is a trend of exploring the hid-
den structure of documents to re-rank results. 
Some of the approaches represent the document 
entities as a connected graph ùê∫ . It is usually con-
structed by links inferred from the content in-
formation as a nearest-neighbor graph. For ex-
ample, Zhang et al. (2005) proposed an affinity 
ranking graph to re-rank search results by opti-
mizing diversity and information richness. Kur-
land and Lee (2005) introduced a structural re-
ranking approach by exploiting asymmetric rela-
tionships between documents induced by lan-
guage models. Diaz (2005); Deng et al. (2009) 
use a family of semi-supervised machine learn-
ing methods among documents graph con-
structed by incorporating different evidences.  
However in this work we are more interested in 
adopting an automatic approach.  
There are two important factors that should be 
taken into account when designing any re-
ranking algorithms: the original queries and ini-
tial retrieval scores. One of issues is that pre-
vious structural re-ranking algorithms treat the 
query and the content individually when compu-
ting re-ranking scores. Each document is as-
signed a score independent of other documents 
without considering of queries. The problem we 
want to address in this paper is how we can leve-
rage the interconnections between query and 
documents for the re-ranking purpose.    
Another problem with such approaches con-
cerns the fundamental re-ranking strategy they 
adopted. HITS (Kleinberg, 1999) and PageRank 
1571
(Brin and Page, 1998) style algorithms were 
widely used in the past. However, approaches 
depend only on the structure of the global graph 
or sub-graph may ignore important information 
content of a document entity. As pointed out by 
Deng et al. (2009), re-ranking algorithms that 
rely only on the structure of the global graph are 
likely lead to the problem of topic drift.  
Instead, we introduce a new document re-
ranking method based on Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) which exploits 
implicit structure of the documents with respect 
to original queries. Rather than relying on graph-
based techniques to identify the internal struc-
ture, the approach tries to directly model the la-
tent structure of ‚Äútopics‚Äù or ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù in the 
initial retrieval set. Then we can compute the 
distance between queries and initial retrieval re-
sults based on latent semantic information in-
ferred. To prevent the problem of topic drift, the 
generative probability of a document is summed 
over all topics induced. By combining the initial 
retrieval scores calculated by language models, 
we are able to gather important information for 
re-ranking purposes. The intuition behind this 
method is the hidden structural information 
among the documents: similar documents are 
likely to have the same hidden information with 
respect to a query. In other words, if a group of 
documents are talking about the same topic 
which shares a strong similarity with a query, in 
our method they will get allocated similar rank-
ing as they are more likely to be relevant to the 
query. In addition, the refined ranking scores 
should be relevant to the initial ranking scores, 
which, in our method, are combined together 
with the re-ranking score either using a linear 
fashion or multiplication process.  
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
methodology, we apply the framework to ad-hoc 
document retrieval and compare it with the initial 
language model-based method and other three 
PageRank style re-ranking methods. Experimen-
tal results show that the improvement brought by 
our method is consistent and promising. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Related work on re-ranking algorithms and LDA 
based methods is briefly summarized in Section 
2. Section 3 describes the re-ranking framework 
based on latent information induced together 
with details of how to build generative model. In 
Section 4 we report on a series of experiments 
performed over three different test collections in 
English and French as well as results obtained. 
Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and specu-
lates on future work.  
2 Related
Work 
There exist several groups of related work in the 
areas of document retrieval and re-ranking.  
The first category performs re-ranking by us-
ing inter-document relationship (Lee et al., 
2001), evidences obtained from external re-
sources (Kamps, 2004), or through local context 
analysis (Xu and Croft, 2000). In the past, docu-
ment distances (Balinski and Daniowicz, 2005), 
manually built external thesaurus (Qu et al., 
2001), and structural information (such as docu-
ment title) (Luk and Wong, 2004), etc have been 
used extensively for this very purpose.   
A second category of work is related to recent 
advances in structural re-ranking paradigm over 
graphs. Kurland and Lee performed re-ranking 
based on measures of centrality in the graph 
formed by generation links induced by language 
model scores, through a weighted version of Pa-
geRank algorithm (Kurland and Lee, 2005) and 
HITS-style cluster-based approach (Kurland and 
Lee, 2006). Zhang et al. (2005) proposed a simi-
lar method to improve web search based on a 
linear combination of results from text search 
and authority ranking. The graph, which they 
named affinity graph, shares strong similarities 
with Kurland and Lee‚Äôs work with the links in-
duced by a modified version of cosine similarity 
using the vector space model. Diaz (2005) used 
score regularization to adjust document retrieval 
rankings from an initial retrieval by a semi-
supervised learning method. Deng et al. (2009) 
further developed this method. They built a latent 
space graph based on content and explicit links 
information. Unlike their approach we are trying 
to model the latent information directly.   
This work is also related to a family of me-
thods so called latent semantic analysis (LSA) 
(Landauer et al., 1998), especially topic models 
used for document representation. Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA), after it was first introduced 
by Blei et al. (2003), has quickly become one of 
the most popular probabilistic text modeling 
techniques and has inspired research ranging 
from text classification and clustering (Phan et 
al., 2008), information discovery (Mei et al., 
2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008) to information 
retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006). In this model, 
each topic is represented by a set of words and 
each word corresponds with a weight to measure 
its contribution to the topic. Wei and Croft 
1572
(2006) described large-scale information retriev-
al experiments by using LDA. In their work, 
LDA-based document model and language mod-
el-based document model were linearly com-
bined to rank the entire corpus. However, unlike 
this approach we only apply LDA to a small set 
of documents. There are two reasons by doing 
so. One is the concern of computational cost. 
LDA is a very complex model and the complexi-
ty will grow linearly with the number of topics 
and the number of documents. Only running it 
through a document set significantly smaller than 
the whole corpus has obvious advantages. Se-
condly, it is well known that LSA-based method 
suffers from an incremental build problem. Nor-
mally adding new documents to the corpus needs 
to ‚Äúbe folded in‚Äù to the latent representation.  
Such incremental addition fails to capture the co-
occurrences of the newly added documents (and 
even ignores all new terms they contain). As 
such, the quality of the LSA representation will 
degrade as more documents are added and will 
eventually require a re-computation of the LSA 
representation. Because our method only requires 
running LDA once for a small number of docu-
ments, this problems could be easily avoided.  In 
addition, we also introduce two new measures to 
calculate the distance between a query and a 
document. 
 
3 Latent
Re-Ranking Framework 
In this section, we describe a novel document re-
ranking method based on extracting the latent 
structure among the initial retrieval set and mea-
suring the distance between queries and docu-
ments.  
3.1 Problem
Definition 
Let ùîª = {ùëë 1,ùëë 2,‚Ä¶ ,ùëë ùëõ } denote the set of docu-
ments to be retrieved. Given a query ùëû , a set of 
initial results ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë° ‚àà ùîª  of top documents are 
returned by a standard information retrieval 
model (initial ranker). However, the initial ranker 
tends to be imperfect. The purpose of our re-
ranking method is to re-order a set of documents  
ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë°‚Ä≤  so as to improve retrieval accuracy at the 
very top ranks of the final results.  
3.2 Latent
Dirichlet Allocation 
We will first introduce Latent Dirichlet Alloca-
tion model which forms the basis of the re-
ranking framework that will be detailed in the 
next subsection. It was previously shown that co-
occurrence structure of terms in text documents 
can be used to recover some latent topic struc-
tures without any usage of background informa-
tion (Landauer et al., 1998). This means that la-
tent-topic representations of text allow modeling 
of linguistic phenomena such as synonymy and 
polysemy. By doing so, information retrieval 
systems can match the information needs with 
content items on a meaning level rather than by 
just lexical congruence. 
The basic generative process of LDA closely 
resembles PLSA (Hofmann, 1999). LDA extends 
PLSA method by defining a complete generative 
model of text. The topic mixture is drawn from a 
conjugate Dirichlet prior that remains the same 
for all documents. The process of generating a 
document corpus is as follows: 
1) Pick a multinomial distribution ùúë  ùëß  for 
each topic ùëò  from a Dirichlet distribu-
tion with hyperparameter ùõΩ  . 
2) For each document ùëë , pick a multi-
nomial distribution ùúÉ ùëë , from a Dirich-
let distribution with hyperparameter 
ùõº . 
3) For each word token ùë§  in document 
ùëë , pick a topic ùëß ‚àà {1‚Ä¶ ùëò } from the 
multinomial distribution ùúÉ ùëë . 
4) Pick word ùë§  from the multinomial 
distribution ùúë  ùëß . 
Thus, the likelihood of generating a corpus is: 
 
ùëù  ùëë 1,‚Ä¶ ,ùëë ùëõ |ùõº ,ùõΩ   
=   ùëù (ùúÉ ùëë |ùõº )
ùëõ
ùëë =1
‚àô  ùëù (
ùëò
ùëß =1
ùúë  ùëß |ùõΩ  )
‚àô   ùëù  ùëß ùëñ  ùúÉ ùëë  ùëù (ùë§ ùëñ |ùëß ,ùúë  ùëß )
ùëò
ùëß ùëñ =1
ùëÅ ùëë
ùëñ =1
ùëë ùúÉ ùëë ùëë ùúë  ùëß  
Unlike PLSA model, LDA possesses fully 
consistent generative semantics by treating the 
topic mixture distribution as a ùëò -parameter hid-
den random variable.  LDA offers a new and in-
teresting framework to model a set of documents.  
The documents and new text sequences (for ex-
ample, queries) could be easily connected by 
‚Äúmapping‚Äù them to the topics in the corpus. In 
the next subsection we will introduce how to 
achieve this goal and apply it to document re-
ranking. 
LDA is a complex model and cannot be solved 
by exact inference. There are a few approximate 
inference techniques available in the literature: 
variational methods (Blei et al., 2003), expecta-
tion propagation (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) 
1573
and Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 
2004). Gibbs sampling is a special case of Mar-
kov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and 
often yields relatively simple algorithms. For this 
reason, we choose to use Gibbs sampling to es-
timate LDA. 
According to Gibbs sampling, we need to 
compute the conditional probability ùëù (ùëß ùëñ |ùëß ¬¨ùëñ ,ùë§   ), 
where ùë§    denotes the vector of all words and ùëß ¬¨ùëñ  
denotes the vector of topic assignment except the 
considered word at position ùëñ . This probability 
distribution can be derived as: 
ùëù  ùëß ùëñ  ùëß ¬¨ùëñ ,ùë§    = ùëõ ùëß ,¬¨ùëñ
ùë§ ùëñ + ùõΩ
ùë§ ùëñ
( ùëõ ùëßùë£ + ùõΩ ùë£ ) ‚àí 1ùëâùë£ =1
‚àô ùëõ ùëë ùëñ ,¬¨ùëñ
ùëß + ùõº ùëò
( ùëõ ùëë ùëñùëß + ùõº ùëß ) ‚àí 1ùëòùëß =1  
where ùëõ ùëß ,¬¨ùëñùë°  indicates the number of instances of 
word ùë§ ùëñ  assigned to topic ùëß = ùëò , not including 
the current token and ùëõ ùëë ùëñ ,¬¨ùëñùëß  denotes the number 
of words in document ùëë ùëñ  assigned to topic ùëß = ùëò , 
not including the current token.  
Then we can obtain the multinomial parameter 
sets: 
ùúÉ ùëë ùëñ ,ùëò = ùëõ ùëë ùëñ
ùëò + ùõº ùëò
 ùëõ ùëë ùëñùëß +ùëòùëß =1 ùõº ùëß  
ùúë ùëò ,ùë§ ùëñ = ùëõ ùëò
ùë§ ùëñ + ùõΩ
ùë§ ùëñ
 ùëõ ùëßùë£ +ùëâùë£ =1 ùõΩ ùë£  
The Gibbs sampling algorithm runs over three 
periods: initialization, burn-in and sampling. We 
do not tune to optimize these parameters because 
in our experiments the markov chain turns out to 
converge very quickly.  
3.3 LDA-based Re-Ranking 
Armed with this LDA methodology, we now 
describe the main idea of our re-ranking method. 
Given a set of initial results ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë° , we are trying 
to re-measure the distance between the query and 
a document. In the vector space model, this dis-
tance is normally the cosine or inner product 
measure between two vectors. Under the proba-
bilistic model framework, this distance can be 
obtained from a non-commutative measure of the 
difference between two probability distributions.  
The distance used in our approach is the Kull-
back-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback and 
Leibler, 1951). Given two probability mass func-
tion  ùëù  ùë•   and ùëû (ùë• ), the KL divergence (or rela-
tive entropy) between ùëù  and ùëû  is defined as: 
ùê∑ (ùëù | ùëû  =  ùëù  ùë•  ùëô ùëú ùëî
ùë•
ùëù (ùë• )
ùëû (ùë• ) 
In terms of text sequences (either queries or 
documents), the probability distribution can be 
regarded as a probabilistic language model ùëÄ ùëë   
or ùëÄ ùëû  from each document ùëë  or each query ùëû . In 
other words, it assumes that there is an underly-
ing language model which ‚Äúgenerates‚Äù a term 
(sequence) (Ponte and Croft, 1998). The unigram 
language model is utilized here. There are sever-
al ways to estimate the probabilities. Let 
ùëî (ùë§ ‚àà ùëë ) denotes the number of times the term 
ùë§  occurs in a document ùëë  (same idea can be 
used on a query). The Maximum-likelihood es-
timation (MLE) of ùë§  with respect to ùëë  is defined 
as: 
ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùëë ùë§ ‚âù ùëî (ùë§ ‚àà ùëë ) ùëî (ùë§ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ùëë )
ùë§ ‚Ä≤
 
Previous work in language-model-based in-
formation retrieval (Zhai and Lafferty, 2004) 
advocates the use of a Dirichlet-smoothed esti-
mation: 
ùê∑ ùêº ùëÖ ùëë ùë§ ‚âù ùëî  ùë§ ‚àà ùëë  + ùúá ‚àô ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùë§ ùîª ùëî (ùë§ ‚Ä≤ ‚àà ùëë )
ùë§ ‚Ä≤ + ùúá
 
where smoothing parameter ùúá  controls the de-
gree of reliance on relative frequencies in the 
document corpus rather than on the counts in ùëë . 
The initial ranker that we choose to use later in 
the experiment computes the KL divergence be-
tween the ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùëû ùë§  and a modified version of 
ùê∑ ùêº ùëÖ ùëë ùë§  (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001).  
Both estimations can be easily extended to dis-
tributions over text sequences by assuming that 
the terms are independent: 
ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùëë (ùë§ 1ùë§ 2 ‚Ä¶ ùë§ ùëõ ) ‚âù  ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùëë (ùë§ ùëó )
ùëõ
ùëó =1
 
 
ùê∑ ùêº ùëÖ ùëë (ùë§ 1ùë§ 2 ‚Ä¶ ùë§ ùëõ ) ‚âù  ùê∑ ùêº ùëÖ ùëë (ùë§ ùëó )
ùëõ
ùëó =1
 
In the re-ranking setting, we estimate that the 
probability of a document ùëë  generates ùë§ , using a 
mixture model LDA. It uses a convex combina-
tion of a set of component distributions to model 
observations. In this model, a word  ùë§  is gener-
ated from a convex combination of some hidden 
topics ùëß : 
ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ ùëë  ùë§  =  ùëù  ùë§  ùëß  ùëù (ùëß |ùëë )
ùëò
ùëß =1
 
where each mixture model ùëù (ùë§ |ùëß )  is a multi-
nomial distribution over terms that correspond to 
one of the latent topics ùëß . Similar to MLE and 
DIR estimations, this could be generated to give 
a distribution on a sequence of text: 
1574
ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ ùëë (ùë§ 1ùë§ 2 ‚Ä¶ ùë§ ùëõ ) ‚âù  ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ ùëë (ùë§ ùëó )ùëõùëó =1  
   Then the distance between a query and a doc-
ument based on this model can be obtained. The 
first method we propose here adopts the KL di-
vergence between the query terms and document 
terms to compute a Re-Rank score ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 1: 
ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 1 = ‚àí ùê∑ (ùëÄ ùêø ùê∏ ùëû (‚àô )||ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ ùëë  ‚àô  ) 
This method also has the property of length-
normalization to ameliorate long document bias 
problems (Kurland and Lee, 2005).  
The second method also measures a KL diver-
gence between a query and a document, however, 
in a different way. As in the original LDA model, 
the multinomial parameter  ùúÉ ùëë  indicates the topic 
distribution of a document ùëë . Query ùëû  can be 
considered as topic estimation of a unknown 
document ùë§    . Thus by first randomly assigning 
topics to words and then performing a number of 
loops through the Gibbs sampling update, we 
have: 
ùëù  ùëß ùëñ  ùëß  ¬¨ùëñ ,ùë§    ;ùëß ¬¨ùëñ ,ùë§    
= ùëõ ùëß ,¬¨ùëñ
ùë§ ùëñ + ùëõ 
ùëß ,¬¨ùëñ
ùë§ ùëñ + ùõΩ
ùë§ ùëñ
( ùëõ ùëßùë£ + ùëõ ùëßùë£ + ùõΩ ùë£ ) ‚àí 1ùëâùë£ =1
‚àô
ùëõ ùëë  ùëñ ,¬¨ùëñùëß + ùõº ùëò
( ùëõ ùëë  ùëñùëß + ùõº ùëß ) ‚àí 1ùëòùëß =1  
where ùëõ ùëß ,¬¨ùëñùë§ ùëñ  counts the observations of word ùë§ ùëñ  
and topic ùëò  in unseen document. Then the topic 
distribution for the query (just the unseen docu-
ment ùëë  ùëñ ) is:  
ùúÉ ùëë  ùëñ ,ùëò =
ùëõ ùëë  ùëñùëò + ùõº ùëò
 ùëõ ùëë  
ùëñ
ùëß +ùëò
ùëß =1 ùõº ùëß
 
so that the distance between a query ùëû  and a doc-
ument ùëë  is defined as the KL divergence be-
tween the topic distributions of ùëû  and ùëë . Then 
the re-ranking score is calculated as: 
ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 2 = ‚àí ùê∑ (ùúÉ ùëû ||ùúÉ ùëë ) 
   Thus we can re-rank the initial retrieved docu-
ments according to the scores acquired. However, 
as in other topic models, a topic in the LDA 
model represents a combination of words, and it 
may not be as precise a representation as words 
in language model. Hence we need to further 
consider how to combine initial retrieval scores 
with the re-ranking scores calculated. Two com-
bination methods will be presented in the next 
subsection. 
3.4 Combining
Initial Retrieval Scores 
Motivated by the significant improvement ob-
tained by (Wei and Croft, 2006) and (Zhang et 
al., 2005), we formulate our method through a 
linear combination of the re-ranking scores based 
on initial ranker and the latent document re-
ranker, shown as follow: 
ùëÖ ùëÜ 1 = (1 ‚àí ùúÜ ) ‚àô ùëÇ ùëÜ + ùúÜ ‚àô ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø ‚àô  
where ùëÇ ùëÜ  denotes original scores returned by the 
initial ranker and ùúÜ  is a parameter that can be 
tuned with ùúÜ = 0 meaning no re-ranking is per-
formed. 
Another scheme considers a multiplication 
combination to incorporate the original score. It 
does not need to tune any parameters:  
ùëÖ ùëÜ 2 = ùëÇ ùëÜ ‚àô ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø ‚àô  
This concludes our overview of the proposed 
latent re-ranking method. 
4 Evaluation

   In this section, we will empirically study the 
effectiveness of the latent document re-ranking 
method over three different data collections.

was made up from elements of the CLEF-2007 
and CLEF-2008 the European Library (TEL) 
collections1 written in English and French. These 
collections are described in greater detail in Ta-
ble 1. All of the documents in the experiment 
were indexed using the Lemur toolkit2. Prior to

indexing, Porter's stemmer and a stopword list3 
were used for the English documents. We use a 
French analyzer4 to analyze French documents.  
   It is worth noting that the CLEF-2008 TEL 
data is actually multilingual: all collections to a 
greater or lesser extent contain records pointing 
to documents in other languages. However this is 
not a major problem because the majority of 
documents in the test collection are written in 
main languages of those test collections (BL-
English, BNF-French). Furthermore, documents 
written in different languages tend not to match 
the queries in main languages. Also the data is 
very different from the newspaper articles and 
news agency dispatches previously used in the 
CLEF as well as TREC5. The data tends to be 
very sparse. Many records contain only title, au-
thor and subject heading information; other 
records provide more detail. The average docu-
ment lengths are 14.66 for BL and 24.19 for 
BNF collections after pre-processing, respective-
ly. Please refer to (Agirre et al., 2008) for a more 
detailed discussion about this data. The reason 
we choose these data collections is that we 
wanted to test the scalability of the proposed me-
thod in different settings and over different 
guages. In addition we also select a more 
tional collection (LAT from CLEF2007) as a test 
base. 
   We also used the CLEF-2007 and CLEF-
2008 query sets. The query sets consist of 50 
topics in English for LAT, BL and in French for 
BNF, all of which were used in the experiment. 
Each topic is composed of several parts such as: 
Title, Description, Narrative. We chose to 
conduct Title+Description runs as queries. The 
queries are processed similarly to the treatment 
in the test collections. The relevance judgments 
are taken from the judged pool of top retrieved 
documents by various participating retrieval 
systems from previous CLEF workshops.  
We compare the proposed latent re-ranking 
method with four other approaches: the initial 
ranker, mentioned above, is a KL-divergence 
retrieval function using the language models. 
Three other baseline systems are: Kurland and 
Lee‚Äôs structural re-ranking approach (Recursive 
Weighted Influx + Language Model), chosen as 
it demonstrates the best performance in their pa-
per (Kurland and Lee, 2005), Zhang et al.‚Äôs af-
finity graph-based approach (Zhang et al., 2005)

5 http://trec.nist.gov/ 
and a variant of Kurland and Lee‚Äôs work with 
links in the graph calculated by the vector-space 
model (cosine similarity as mentioned in (Kur-
land and Lee, 2005)). We denote these four sys-
tems as InR, RWILM, AFF, and VEC respective-
ly.  Furthermore, we denote the permutations of 
our methods as follows: LDA1: ùëÖ ùëÜ 2 ùë§ ùëñ ùë° ùëî  ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 1, 
LDA2: ùëÖ ùëÜ 1 ùë§ ùëñ ùë° ùëî  ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 1  , LDA3: 
ùëÖ ùëÜ 2 ùë§ ùëñ ùë° ùëî  ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 2, LDA4: ùëÖ ùëÜ 1 ùë§ ùëñ ùë° ùëî  ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 2. 
Because the inconsistency of the evaluation 
metrics employed in the past work, we choose to 
employ all of them to measure the effectiveness 
of various approaches. These include: mean av-
erage precision (MAP), the precision of the top 5 
documents (Prec@5), the precision of the top 10 
documents (Prec@10), normalized discounted 
cumulative gain (NDCG) (Jarvelin and Kekalai-
nen, 2002) and Bpref (Buckley and Voorhees, 
2004). Statistical-significant differences in per-
formance were determined using a paired t-test at 
a confidence level of 95%. 
It is worth pointing out that the above meas-
urements are not directly comparable with those 
of the CLEF participants because we restricted 
our initial pool to a smaller number of documents 
and the main purpose in the paper is to compare 
the proposed method with different baseline sys-
tems. 
 
Parameter Two primary parameters need to 
be determined in our experiments. For the re-
ranking experiments, the combination parameter 
ùúÜ  must be defined. For the LDA estimation, the 
number of topics ùëò  must be specified. We opti-
mized settings for these parameters with respect 
to MAP, not with all other metrics over the BL 
collection and apply them to all three collections 
directly. 
   The search ranges for these two parameters 
were: 
ÔÅ¨ :     0.1, 0.2, ‚Ä¶, 0.9  
k :     5, 10, 15, ‚Ä¶, 45  
   As it turned out, for many instances, the optim-
al value of ùúÜ  with respect to MAP was either 0.1 
or 0.2, suggesting the initial retrieval scores have 
valuable information inside them. In contrast, the 
optimal value of ùëò  was between 20 and 40. Al-
though this demonstrates a relatively large va-
riance, the differences in terms of MAP have 
remained small and statistically insignificant. We 
set ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë°  to 50 in all results reported, as in Kur-
land and Lee‚Äôs paper (Kurland and Lee, 2005) 
and we later show that the performance turns out 
to be very stable when this set enlarged.

4.2 Results

Primary Evaluation The main experimental 
results are presented in Table 2. The first four 
rows in each collection specify reference-
comparison data. The first question we are inter-
ested in is how our latent re-ranking methods 
1577
perform (taken as a whole). It is shown that our 
methods bring improvements upon the various 
baselines in 75% of the 48 relevant comparisons 
(4 latent re-ranking methods √ó 4 corpora √ó 4 
baselines). Only the algorithm permutation 
LDA3 performs less well. Furthermore, our me-
thods are able to achieve the highest performance 
across all the evaluation metrics over three test 
collections except in one case (MAP in BL col-
lection). An even more exciting observation is 
that in many cases, our methods, even though 
tuned for MAP, can outperform various baselines 
for all the evaluation metrics, with statistically 
significant improvements in many runs.  
A closer examination of the results in Table 2 
reveals some interesting properties. As expected, 
the RWILM method bought improvements in 
many cases in CLEF-2008 test collections. How-
ever, the performance over CLEF-2007 collec-
tion was somewhat disappointing. This seems to 
indicate that the language model induced graph 
method tends to perform better in sparse data 
rather than longer documents. Also Language 
Modeling requires large set training data to be 
effective, while the complexity of our method is 
only linear with number of topics and the number 
of documents for each iteration.  The affinity and 
vector graph based methods demonstrated poor 
performance across all the collections. This may 
be due to the fact that the approach Zhang et al. 
(Zhang et al., 2005) developed focuses more on 
diversity and information richness and cares less 
about the precision of the retrieval results while 
asymmetric graph as constructed by the vector 
space model fails in capturing important relation-
ship between the documents. 
Another observation we can draw from Table 
2 is that the relative performance tends to be sta-
ble during test collections written in different 
languages. This shows a promising future for 
studying structure of the documents with respect 
to queries for re-ranking purpose.  At the same 
time, efficiency is always an issue in all re-
ranking methods. Although this is not a primary 
concern in the current work, it would definitely 
worth thinking in the future. 
We also conducted some experiments over 
queries constructed by using Title field only. 
This forms some more realistic short queries. 
The experiments showed very similar results 
compared to longer queries. This demonstrates 
that the query length is a trivial issue in our me-
thods (as in other graph-based structural re-
ranking). We examined the best and worse per-
formed queries, their performance are generally 
consistent across all the methods. This phenome-
non should be investigated further in the follow 
up evaluation. 
 
Comparison of Different Methods In com-
parison of performance between four permuta-
tions of our methods, LDA2 is the clear winner 
over CLEF-2008 test collections. The results ob-
tained by LDA2 and LDA4 over CLEF-2007 test 
collection were mixed. LDA2 performed better 
in precision at top ùëõ  documents while LDA4 
showed promising results in terms of more gen-
eral evaluation metrics. On the other hand, the 
linear combination approach performed much 
better than multiplication based combination. 
The situation is even worse when we adopted the 
ùëÖ ùëÜ ùêø ùê∑ ùê¥ùêæ ùêø 2  method, which was inferior in several 
cases. Thus the linear combination should be 
highly recommended.  
 
Scalability We have shown that our latent 
document re-ranking method is successful at ac-
complishing the goal of improving the results 
returned by an initial retrieval engine. But one 
may raise a question of whether it is necessary to 
restrict our attention to an initial pool  ùîª ùëñ ùëõ ùëñ ùë°  at 
such a small size. As it happens, preliminary ex-
periments with LDA2 on larger size of the initial 
pool are presented in Figure 1. As we can see, 
our method can bring consistently stable im-
provements.

5 Conclusion
and Future Work 
In this paper we proposed and evaluated a la-
tent document re-ranking method for re-ordering 
the initial retrieval results. The key to refine the 
results is finding the latent structure of ‚Äútopics‚Äù 
or ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù in the document set, which leve-

rages the latent Dirichlet allocation technique for 
the query-dependent ranking problem and results 
in state-of-art performance.  
There are many research directions we are 
planning to investigate. It has been shown that 
LDA-based retrieval is a promising method for 
ranking the whole corpus. There is a desire to 
call for a direct comparison between ranking and 
re-ranking using the proposed algorithmic varia-
tions. Future work will also include the compari-
son between our methods with other related ap-
proaches, such as Kurland and Lee‚Äôs cluster-
based approach (Kurland and Lee, 2006). 
There exist a sufficient number of latent se-
mantic techniques such as singular vector de-
composition, non-negative matrix factorization, 
PLSA, etc. We are planning to explore these me-
thods to compare their performance. Also direct 
re-ranking can be used to improve automatic 
query expansion since better ranking in top re-
trieved documents can be expected to improve 
the quality of the augmented query. We believe 
this is another fruitful line for future research.
