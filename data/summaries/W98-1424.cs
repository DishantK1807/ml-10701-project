Our work is thus relevant to current efforts in work on generation to link it as a component capability to a more comprehensive system (as in the work on MT in the Pangloss project, in the work on building a generation knowledge source in the PROFILE system \[Radev & McKeown, 1997\], in the work on generating multimodal healthcare briefings in the MAGIC system \[McKeown, Jordan & Allen, 1997\], or in the work on linking the KPML generator to an editor's workbench \[Bateman & Teich, 1995\]).
