Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars for Phonology Karin M¨uller Department of Computational Linguistics University of Saarland, Germany kmueller@coli.uni-sb.de Abstract We present a phonological probabilistic contextfree grammar, which describes the word and syllable structure of German words.
The grammar is trained on a large corpus by a simple supervised method, and evaluated on a syllabification task achieving 96.88% word accuracy on word tokens, and 90.33% on word types.
We added rules for English phonemes to the grammar, and trained the enriched grammar on an English corpus.
Both grammars are evaluated qualitatively showing that probabilistic context-free grammars can contribute linguistic knowledge to phonology.
Our formal approach is multilingual, while the training data is language-dependent.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we present an approach to supervised learning and automatic detection of syllable structure.
The primary goal of the paper is to show that probabilistic context-free grammars can be used to gain substantial phonological knowledge about syllable structure.
Beyond an evaluation of the trained model on a real-world task documenting the performance of the model, we focus on an extensive qualitative evaluation.
In contrast to other approaches which work with syllable structures extracted from a pronunciation dictionary, our approach focuses on the probability of use of certain syllable structures.
Among other approaches that deal with syllable structure, there are example-based approaches (Hall (1992), Wiese (1996), F´ery (1995), Kenstowicz (1994), Morelli (1999)), symbolic approaches (Belz, 2000), connectionist phonotactic models (Stoianov and Nerbonne, 1998), stochastic models describing partial structures (Pierrehumbert (1994), Coleman and Pierrehumbert (1997)), or application-based approaches for syllabification (Van den Bosch, 1997) or text-to-speech systems (Kiraz and M¨obius, 1998).
Our method builds on two resources.
The first one is a large written text corpus, which is looked-up in a pronunciation dictionary resulting in a large transcribed and syllabified corpus.
The second resource is a manually written context-free grammar describing German and English syllable structure.
We code the assumptions (similar to Goldsmith (1995)) that the phonological material that can occur in the onsets or codas might differ depending on the syllable positions: word-initial, word-final, word-medial, versus monosyllabic words.
We train the context-free grammar for German on the transcribed and syllabified training corpus with a simple supervised training method (M¨uller, 2001a).
The main idea of the training method is that after a grammar transformation step, the grammar together with a parser can predict syllable boundaries of unknown phoneme strings.
The trained model is evaluated on a syllabification task showing a high precision on a test corpus.
We exemplify that the method can be easily transferred to related languages (here English) by adding rules for missing phonemes to the grammar.
In an qualitative evaluation, we compare German and English syllable structure by interpreting the probability weights of the preterminal July 2002, pp.

In sum, we aim to show that our method (i) models all possible words of a language, (ii) models how likely certain structures are used (in comparison to pure dictionary-based approaches), (iii) yields good results in an application-oriented evaluation, (iv) is able to disambiguate competing structures, (v) can be easily applied to other languages, (vi) produces mathematically well-defined models.
The paper is organized as follows.
We present our method in Section 2, the experiments in Section 3, and our evaluation in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss the results, and in Section 6, we conclude.
2 Method
We build on the novel approach of M¨uller (2001a) which aims to combine the advantages of treebank and bracketed corpora training.
In general, this approach consists of four steps: (i) writing a (symbolic i.e. non-probabilistic) context-free phonological grammar with syllable boundaries, (ii) training this grammar on a large automatically transcribed and syllabified corpus, (iii) transforming the resulting probabilistic phonological grammar by dropping the syllable boundaries, and (iv) predicting syllable boundaries of unseen phoneme strings by choosing their most probable phonological tree according to the transformed probabilistic grammar.
The advantages of this approach are, that simple and efficient supervised training on bracketed corpora can be used (the brackets guarantee that all syllabified words of the training corpus receive only one single analysis), and that raw phoneme strings can be parsed and syllabified after the grammar transformation.
Preserving these advantages, our approach differs in several important details.
First, we write a more advanced phonological grammar for German, yielding a more fine-grained probabilistic model of syllable structure.
Second, it is easily possible to enrich our phonological grammar by adding grammar rules for missing phonemes to adapt our phonological grammar to other languages (here English).
Third, in addition to an evaluation on a real-world task (syllabification for German), we qualitatively evaluate the resulting probabilistic versions of our phonological grammar for German and English.

Our phonological grammar divides a word into syllables, which are in turn rewritten by onset, nucleus, and coda.
Furthermore, the phonological grammar differentiates between monosyllabic and polysyllabic words.
In polysyllabic words, the syllables are divided into syllables appearing wordinitially, word-medially, and word-finally.
Additionally, the grammar distinguishes between consonant clusters of different sizes (ranging from one to five consonants), as well as between consonants occurring in different positions within a cluster.
Figure 1 displays the structure of the German word “Abfall” (waste) according to our phonological grammar.
In the following sections, we especially focus on the rewriting rules involving phonemic terminal nodes: Xa23a25a24a17a23a27a26a28a23a25a29a31a30 a32 and Ya23a25a24a33a30 a34a35a23 The rules of the first type bear three of the above mentioned features for a consonant a32 inside an onset or a coda (X=On, Cod), namely: the position of the syllable in the word (a24 =ini, med, fin, one), the cluster size (a29a37a36a39a38a40a23a41a23a41a23a43a42 ), and the position of a consonant within a cluster (a26a44a36a45a38a40a23a41a23a41a23a46a42 ).
Obviously, vowels or diphthongs a34 of a nucleus (Y=Nucleus) do not need the position and size features (a29 and a26 ).
The probabilities of these phonological rules (after supervised training) are exactly the basis for our description and evaluation of the syllable parts in Section 4.
3 Experiments
In the following, we describe two experiments.
The first experiment investigates syllable structure for German.
In the second experiment, we generalize and apply the method to another language (English).
Experiment with German data.
First, we manually write a phonological grammar for German consisting of 2,394 context-free rules.
If compared to the most successful grammar constructed by M¨uller (2001a), our grammar is enriched with an additional feature: the size of the onsets and codas.
Second, we extracted a training corpus of 2,127,798 words (3,961,982 syllables) from a German newspaper, the Stuttgarter Zeitung, and an additional corpus of 242,047 words for testing.
All words are looked up in the German part of the CELEX (Baayen et al., 1993) yielding transcribed and syllabified corpora.
As phoneme set, we used the symbols from the English and German SAMPA alphabet (Wells, 1997).
In contrast to M¨uller (2001a), we did not investigate smaller training corpora, since we are interested in maximal phonological knowledge about internal word structure.
Third, we train the phonological context-free grammar on the training corpus using the supervised method presented in Section 2.
Additionally, due to events not occurring in the training data, we use the implemented smoothing procedure of the LoPar system (Schmid, 2000) producing rules with positive probabilities.
Experiment with English data.
In this experiment, we show that our method can be easily applied to other languages.
We create a second training corpus of the same size of 2,123,081 words from the British National Corpus.
The words are looked-up in the English part of the CELEX.
Furthermore, the context-free grammar is extended by rules for all possible English phonemes.
This means, we add preterminal rules for phonemes not occurring in German words, e.g., rules for the apicodental phoneme a47Ta48 (appearing in the word this).
This (semi-automatic) procedure yields an English phonological grammar consisting of 4,418 rules, which is trained on the new corpus.
4 Evaluation
First, we evaluate on a syllabification task for German.
Second, we analyze linguistically the errors made by the German phonological parser on the evaluation corpus (word types).
Third, and more important, we concentrate on a qualitative evaluation of syllable structure for German and English.
4.1 Evaluation
on Syllabification The resulting probabilistic phonological grammar of German (Section 3) is evaluated on a syllabification task by comparing the maximum-probability parses of all raw phoneme strings in the test corpus (242,047 word tokens, 24,735 word types) with their annotated bracketed variants.
As evaluation measure, we used “word accuracy” which computes the rate of words with all predicted syllable brackets exactly matching the annotated syllable brackets.
The evaluation shows that our phonological grammar for German achieves 96.88% word accuracy on word tokens, and 90.33% on word types.
Error Analysis We analyze the results of the German phonological parser on the evaluation corpus consisting of word types.
Out of 24,735 words types 2391 words contained wrongly predicted syllable boundaries.
We analyze every tenth word of the incorrect words, which means we look at 239 items.
There are 243 errors found in the analyzed words.
Due to the fact that there can occur more than one error in one word, the number of errors is higher than the number of items.
We find that 72.42% of the errors are made for consonants uncorrectly assigned to the onset, whereas only 27.57% errors are made for consonants wrongly assigned to the coda.
The tendency that more errors occur in predicting the onset agrees with the findings of M¨uller (2001b).
The main errors appear when a a47 ta48, a47 Ra48, or an a47 na48 is predicted to be an onset consonant.
The main errors found in predicting the coda consonants mainly occur with a47 ka48, a47 sa48, and a47 pa48. If we investigate the errors made on the linguistic level, the most frequent error occurs with word boundaries (98 cases).
However, a further error source is found with syllable boundaries occuring in conjunction with prefixes and suffixes.
The most frequent error appears with syllable boundaries after prefixes like /ver-/, /er-/, and /un-/, whereas with suffixes the most frequent error appears with /-lich/.
Foreign words, which are subject to different phonotactic constraints, seem to be a minor source of errors (20 cases).
Thus, we can see that most of the errors are found in conjunction with morphological English initial medial final monosyl sum 0C onset 191,888 17,630 32,350 453,117 694,985 1C onset 407,380 246,802 556,954 852,866 2,064,002 2C onset 88,692 58,888 96,604 122,295 366,479 3C onset 3,332 3,577 5,368 4,511 16,788 4C onset 1 16 17 sum 691,292 326,898 691,292 1,432,789 3,142,271 0C coda 485,968 257,595 122,058 435,247 1,300,868 1C coda 196,409 65,594 440,176 777,347 1,479,526 2C coda 8,872 3,706 112,597 206,941 332,116 3C coda 42 3 16,361 13,014 29,420 4C coda 1 100 240 341 5C coda sum 691,292 326,898 691,292 1,432,789 3,142,271 German initial medial final monosyl sum 0C onset 294,428 54,388 50,508 273,407 672,731 1C onset 658,986 577,358 963,600 687,429 2,887,373 2C onset 127,632 103,353 75,721 68,050 374,756 3C onset 10,879 7,160 2,096 6,987 27,122 4C onset sum 1,091,925 742,259 1,091,925 1,035,873 3,961,982 0C coda 633,196 489,576 236,905 170,845 1,530,522 1C coda 404,616 223,590 708,651 645,447 1,982,304 2C coda 48,399 26,807 130,712 200,472 406,390 3C coda 4,988 2,255 14,945 16,028 38,216 4C coda 726 31 712 3,078 4,547 5C coda 3 3 sum 1,091,925 742,259 1,091,925 1,035,873 3,961,982 Table 1: Frequency of occurrence of onsets and codas for English (left) and German (right), displayed for different complexities (ranging from 0 to 5 consonants) and different positions of the syllable in the word (initial, medial, final, monosyl).

4.2 Qualitative
Evaluation The evaluation is carried out for both English and German.
First, we compare the complexity of words, syllables, and syllable parts.
Second, we analyze the probabilities of grammar rules involving phonemic terminal nodes.
Unfortunately, due to space constraints and the large size of our derived probabilistic phonological grammars, only preliminary results can be presented.
Table 1 displays the occurrence frequencies of onsets and codas (of different size and different syllable position), counted on the basis of the training corpora for English and German (see Section 3).
The following three complexity analyses are carried out on the basis of this table.
Word complexity.
German words tend to be more complex than English words.
The German training corpus comprises 48.7% 1 monosyllabic words, whereas 67.4% are found in the English training corpus.
The high frequency of occurrence of monosyllabic words justifies the separate treatment of those words.
Syllable complexity.
German syllables usually consist of onset and rhyme.
An onset is observed in initial syllables (73%) 2, in medial syllables (94%), in final syllables (94%), and in monosyllabic words (73%).
A coda is found in initial syllables (42%), in medial syllables (34%), in final syllables (78%), and 1(1,035,873 / 2,127,798)=48.7% 2((658,986 + 127,632 + 10,879) / 1,091,925) = 73% English initial medial final monosyl D 0.002 0.002 0.022 0.250 N a49 0.001 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 S 0.006 0.017 0.073 0.019 T 0.011 0.006 0.007 0.008 Z a49 0.001 0.004 0.010 b 0.068 0.025 0.042 0.072 d 0.084 0.059 0.075 0.024 f 0.057 0.052 0.029 0.055 g 0.018 0.016 0.018 0.017 h 0.048 0.004 0.003 0.063 j 0.019 0.001 0.003 0.032 k 0.113 0.046 0.052 0.032 l 0.048 0.097 0.095 0.034 m 0.087 0.078 0.057 0.045 n 0.042 0.091 0.054 0.035 p 0.080 0.065 0.037 0.021 r 0.098 0.080 0.065 0.020 s 0.114 0.097 0.067 0.052 t 0.033 0.125 0.185 0.105 v 0.026 0.080 0.052 0.003 w 0.034 0.002 0.012 0.105 z 0.003 0.041 0.031 a49 0.001 German initial medial final monosyl N 0.003 0.021 R 0.040 0.074 0.082 0.009 S 0.011 0.024 0.033 0.004 Z a49 0.001 0.001 a49 0.001 b 0.096 0.056 0.062 0.031 d 0.073 0.072 0.106 0.454 f 0.115 0.052 0.029 0.099 g 0.098 0.103 0.065 0.016 h 0.062 0.031 0.016 0.013 j 0.030 0.005 0.001 0.011 k 0.064 0.032 0.023 0.015 l 0.042 0.121 0.076 0.011 m 0.078 0.055 0.042 0.072 n 0.037 0.078 0.120 0.076 p 0.024 0.018 0.006 0.002 s 0.017 0.030 t 0.026 0.116 0.184 0.007 v 0.115 0.055 0.019 0.064 x a49 0.001 0.009 0.036 z 0.078 0.069 0.039 0.107 Table 3: Onsets consisting of 1 consonant for English (left) and German (right) English initial medial final monosyl D 0.010 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 0.019 N 0.043 0.018 0.138 0.006 S 0.011 0.012 0.007 0.002 T 0.005 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 0.007 Z a49 0.001 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 b 0.019 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 0.002 d 0.022 0.008 0.106 0.068 f 0.037 0.001 0.003 0.102 g 0.022 0.008 a49 0.001 0.003 h a49 0.001 k 0.118 0.176 0.020 0.029 l 0.074 0.105 0.119 0.046 m 0.111 0.066 0.023 0.052 n 0.435 0.426 0.166 0.168 p 0.014 0.039 0.005 0.015 r* a49 0.001 a49 0.001 0.178 0.123 s 0.026 0.080 0.046 0.038 t 0.031 0.035 0.056 0.162 v 0.005 0.016 0.016 0.026 x a49 0.001 a49 0.001 a49 0.001 z 0.009 0.002 0.108 0.124 German initial medial final monosyl N 0.011 0.014 0.055 0.002 R 0.356 0.315 0.183 0.271 S a49 0.001 a49 0.001 0.004 0.001 b a49 0.001 f 0.028 0.020 0.005 0.036 k 0.038 0.046 0.021 0.009 l 0.067 0.082 0.026 0.026 m 0.030 0.020 0.038 0.050 n 0.269 0.287 0.511 0.273 p 0.031 0.019 0.001 0.008 s 0.084 0.091 0.047 0.156 t 0.040 0.018 0.055 0.064 v a49 0.001 x 0.041 0.082 0.047 0.096 Table 4: Codas consisting of 1 consonant for English (left) and German (right).

Nuclei. Table 2 displays the nuclei found for English and German.
The symbol “-” indicates that the phoneme has not been observed in the training corpus.
However, the corresponding grammar rules receive a (very small) positive probability according to our smoothing procedure.
Note, we do not display those phonemes in the tables which are marked with “-” for all positions . Moreover, the symbol “a51a53a52a54a23a55a52a56a52a57a38 ” indicates a probability of less than 0.001 (which means a occurrence frequency of less than 0.1%).

The most likely nuclei in initial syllables are a47 @, I, E, O, &, Va48 (16.7%, 16.6%, 12.6%, 7.2%, 7%, 6.9%), in medial syllables a47I, @, E, eIa48 (28.2%, 26.8%, 10.5%, 7.7%), in final syllables a47@, Ia48 (38.6%, 36.7%), and in monosyllabic words a47@, I,&, O, eI, u:a48 (22%, 17.1%, 9.5%, 8.2%, 6.9%, 6.4%).
Furthermore, in monosyllabic words, 33.6% of the nuclei are long vowels/diphthongs, 29.1% in initial syllables, 23.6% in medial syllables, and 18% in final syllables.
German nuclei.
In initial syllables, the most probable nuclei are a47 E, a, aI, @, e:, a:, I, o:, i:, O,a48 (13.%, 10.7%, 10.5%, 8.2%, 7.5%, 6.6%, 6.4%, 6.1%, 5.4%, 5.1%), in medial syllables, a47@, i:, I, a, E, a:, e:, o:a48 (18%, 13.5%, 12.9%,9.2%, 9.1%, 5.6%, 5.4%, 5.2%), in final syllables a47 @, I, U, aa48 (69.3%, 4.9%, 4.4%, 3.6%), and in monosyllabic words a47 e:, I, i:, a, U, E, aI, O, aUa48 (17.1%, 16.3%, 12.4%, 10.3%, 8.2%, 6.1%, 6%, 5.2%, 5.1%).
Generally, we can observe that long vowels/diphthongs are more likely in monosyllabic words (52.6%) than in all other syllable positions (48.3% in initial syllables, 42% in medial syllables, and 13.4% in final syllables).
Mono-consonantal onsets and codas.
Table 3 and Table 4 display the onsets and codas consisting of 1 consonant.
German onsets.
The most probable consonants in initial syllables are a47 f, v, g, b,z, m, d, k, ha48, (11.5%, 11.5%, 9.8%, 9.6%, 7.8%, 7.8%, 7.3%, 6.4%, 6.2% ), in medial syllables a47 l, t, g, n, R, d, za48 (12.1%, 11.6%, 10.3%, 7.8%, 7.4%, 7.2%, 6.9%), in final syllables a47t, n, d, R, la48 (18.4%, 12%, 10.6%, 8.2%, 7.6%), and in monosyllabic words a47 d, z, f, n, ma48 (45.4%, 10.7%, 9.9%, 7%).
English onsets.
In initial syllables, the most probable consonants are a47 s, k, r, m, d, pa48 (11.4%, 11.3%, 9.8%, 8.7%, 8.4%, 8%), in medial syllables a47 t, s, l, n, r, va48 (12.5%, 9.8%, 9.7%, 9.1%, 8%, 8%), in final syllables a47 t, l, d, S, s, ra48 (18.5%, 9.5%, 7.5%, 7.3%, 6.7%, 6.5%), and in monosyllabic words a47D, t, w, b, ha48 (25%, 10%, 10%, 6%, 6%).
German codas.
In initial position, the most likely consonants are a47 R, na48 (35.6%, 26.9%), in medial syllables a47R, na48 (31.5%, 28.7%), in final syllables a47 n, Ra48 (50.1%, 18.3%), and in monosyllabic words a47n, R, s, xa48 (27.3%, 27.1%, 15.6%, 9.6%).
English codas.
In initial syllables, the most dominant consonants are a47 n, k, ma48 (43.5%, 11.8%, 11.1%), in medial syllables a47n, k, la48 (42.6%, 17.6%, 10.5%), in final syllables a47 r*, n, N, l, z, da48 (17,8%10%), and in monosyllabic words a47 n, t, z, r*, fa48 (16.8%11%).
Onset and coda clusters.
Clusters of 2-3 consonants are displayed and described in Table 5 and Table 7 (onsets), and in Table 6 and Table 8 (codas).
Due to space constraints, we omitted to display clusters of 4-5 consonants, but our analysis can be found elsewhere (M¨uller, to appear 2002).
Clusters with more than 5 consonants have not been found in our corpora.
Furthermore, for German, no onsets comprising 4 consonants, and for English, no codas occur comprising 5 consonants.
Last, for German, there is only one consonant cluster a47 Rnstsa48 appearing in words like “Ernsts”, the genitive case of the proper name “Ernst”.
5 Discussion
As M¨uller (2001a), we presented a method for prediction of syllable boundaries using phonological probabilistic context-free grammars for German.
However, our approach performs slightly better (96.88% word accuracy on word tokens versus 96.49%).
Van den Bosch (1997) reports a word error rate of 2.22% on English syllabification using inductive learning.
Due to the feature “cluster size”, which was not used by M¨uller (2001a), we are able to give an extensive qualitative evaluation of syllable structure considering syllable positions, as well as the complexities of consonant clusters, and the position of a consonant within a cluster.
Since our approach is multilingual (only training is language dependent), we evaluated two languages (German and English) showing that probabilistic context-free grammars add linguistic knowledge to phonology.
In contrast to theoretical approaches, we focus on syllable structures that are preferred in a certain language.
Theoretical phonotactic approaches like (Hall (1992), Wiese (1996), F´ery (1995)) describe possible syllable structures or German, and Kenstowicz (1994), Morelli (1999) for English.
There are many more approaches dealing with syllable structure.
For instance, Kiraz and M¨obius (1998) develop multilingual syllabification models on the basis of a pronunciation dictionary.
Partial English syllable structure is described by Pierrehumbert (1994), who also used a dictionary.
A more general model was introduced by M¨uller et al.(2000), who used a clustering algorithm to induce English and German syllable classes.
However, the approach treats the onsets and codas as one string.
In our method, we describe in more detail the internal structure of onsets and codas.
Our model has several advantages.
(i) We believe that the syllable structure of all words occurring in a certain language can be described by an elaborated context-free grammar.
(ii) Moreover, using probabilistic context-free grammars, alternative syllabifications of phoneme strings can be disambiguated.
(iii) Our model is able to analyze unexpected phoneme strings.
For instance, the onset a47 bRda48 of the proper name “Brdaric” (a47 bRda:RItSa48 ) is not allowed according to German phonotactics.
Table 7 correctly displays that neither a47 ba48 occurs as a first, nor a47 Ra48 as a second, or a47 da48 as a third consonant in initial triconsonantal German onset clusters.
Due to the smoothing procedure, our model syllabifies this name as a47 bRda:a48a58a47 RItSa48 although the onset a47 bRda48 has never been observed in the German training corpus.
(iv) The syllable structure of nonsense words can be predicted.
The model can be exploited in two ways: first, it predicts the most probable syllabification, second, it can be used to model the lexical decision task.
An example of English words is mentioned by Pierrehumbert (1994).
She compared “bistro” (a47 bIstr@Ua48 ) as a possible word, with a good word “bimplo” (a47 bImpl@Ua48 ), and a bad word “bilflo” (a47 bIlfl@Ua48 ).
The four possible syllabifications are a47 bIma48a58a47 pl@Ua48, a47 bIa48a58a47 mpl@Ua48, a47 bImpa48a58a47 l@Ua48, and a47 bImpla48a58a47 @Ua48 . The most probable syllable structure for “bimplo” is a47 bIma48a58a47 pl@Ua48 (1.8403e-13).
For the twosyllabic word “bilflo”, the model assigns the highest probability to a syllable boundary between a47 la48 and a47 fla48 . Out of the four possible syllabifications for the real word “bistro” a47bIstra48a58a47@Ua48 is the most probable syllable structure.
Although the triconsonantal cluster should be rather an onset cluster than a coda cluster, the model prefers a47 stra48 as a cluster, whereas a syllable boundary is added between a47 ma48 and a47 pla48, and a47 la48 and a47 fla48 . A further example mentioned in the literature is a47 brIka48, a47 blIka48, and a47 bnIka48 . The first one is a possible word of English a47 brIka48, which receives a probability of 1.16e-08, the second non-occurring word a47 blIka48 (7.2391e-09), and the non-English word a47 bnIka48 (4.3249e-09).
The least probable one is the non-English word, followed by the non-occurring one, and the highest probability is assigned to the real word brick.
Beside the good performance of the current models in applications, further improvements of the present approach can possibly be achieved by embedding more prior phonotactic knowledge.
For example, it might be useful to model the distribution of a consonant dependent on the previous one (Menzel, 2001).
In future work, we will investigate this issue by using head-lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars, like those suggested by Carroll and Rooth (1998), where the consonant cluster a47 StRa48 would be analyzed as: X.r.1.3a59a61a60a63a62 S X.r.2.3a59a65a64a46a62 t X.r.3.3a59a67a66a68a62 R Here, the lexical choice events express the desired phonotactic feature.
Moreover, it would be interesting to incorporate the stress feature.
Our linguistic evaluation of the errors point out that most errors of the phonological parser occur in conjunction with morphological phenomena like prefixes, suffixes and word boundaries.
This might point out that a further morphological layer could improve word accuracy (see also Meng (2001)).
6 Conclusion
We introduced a multilingual approach to probabilistic modeling of syllable structure using probabilistic context-free grammars.
We exemplified our approach for two languages, German and English.
Evaluation on a syllabification task shows a small improvement in word accuracy rate compared to other state-of-the-art systems for German.
Additionally, we presented an extensive qualitative evaluation of German and English syllable, onset, and coda structure (section 4) showing which structures are preferably used.
However, the presented work is a starting point of analyzing in detail the huge amount of data with regard to phonological regularities.
For instance, we found evidence that in consonant clusters sonorous consonants (like a47 Ra48, a47 la48 ) are more restricted to appear next to the nucleus than less sonorous consonants.
Clearly, this is promising work for future investigations.
We believe that our method can be easily transferred to a variety of other languages, and aim in future work at embedding more fine-grained phonotactic constraints to our grammar.
