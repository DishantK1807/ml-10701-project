For instance, noisy-channel model (NCM) (Virga et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003), HMM (Sung et al., 2000), decision tree (Kang et al., 2000), transformation-based learning (Meng et al., 2001), statistical machine transliteration model (Lee et al., 2003), finite state transducers (Knight et al., 1998) and rule-based approach (Wan et al., 1998; Oh et al., 2002).

Framework The phoneme-based approach has received remarkable attention in the previous works (Meng et al., 2001; Virga et al., 2003; Knight et al., 1998; Oh et al., 2002; Sung et al., 2000; Yaser et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003).

Recent efforts are reported for several language pairs, such as English/Chinese (Meng et al., 2001; Virga et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2004), English/Japanese (Knight et al., 1998; Brill et al., 2001; Bilac et al., 2004), 1 Pinyin is the standard Romanization of Chinese.

In Table 7, the reference data are extracted from Table 1 and 3 of (Virga et al., 2003), where only character and Pinyin error rates are reported.

For example, NCM and HMM (Virga et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2003; Sung et al., 2000) model the transformation mapping rules and the target language separately; decision tree (Kang et al., 2000), transformationbased learning (Meng et al., 2001), finite state transducers (Knight et al., 1998) and statistical machine transliteration model (Lee et al., 2003) only model the transformation rules.

English/Korean (Oh et al., 2002; Sung et al., 2000), and English/Arabic (Yaser et al., 2002).

Virga and Khudanpur (2003) reported 8.3% absolute accuracy drops when converting from Pinyin to Chinese character.

2) Cross-lingual phonemic mapping presents a great challenge due to phonemic divergence between some language pairs, such as Chinese/English, Japanese/English (Wan and Verspoor, 1998; Meng et al., 2001).
