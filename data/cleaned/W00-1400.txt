2:37	This volume contains 30 papers for the main session, 4 papers to the student session and 5 system demonstration descriptions.
3:37	The conference will also include two invited talks, and two panel discussions on Evaluation methods in Generation and on the impact of cognitive modeling on generation research.
4:37	This conference continues in the tradition of the nine biennial workshops on natural language generation that .

6:37	Following the tradition of previous INLG meetings, the conference will be held in an isolated and stunning natural environment: Mitzpe Ramon, located on the edge of the Ramon Crater, in the middle of the Negev Desert, Israel.
7:37	We hope this environment will inspire the participants and encourage the type of vibrant participation and intellectual stimulation that has characterized previous INLG meetings.
8:37	We would like to thank everybody who helped organize this conference: all the authors and researchers who submitted papers and the program committee who faced a higher than expected load, reviewing in a short period the 70 submissions we have received.
9:37	Their time, expertise and dedication enabled the selection of this fine sample of Natural Language Generation research.
10:37	Finally, special thanks to Yael Dahan Netzer who prepared most of everything related to the conference and whose commitment and enthusiasm enabled this conference to be held.
11:37	Welcome to the First International Natural Language Generation!
