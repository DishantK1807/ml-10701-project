It also differs from now traditional uses of comparable corpora for detecting translation equivalents (Rapp, 1999) or extracting terminology (Grefenstette, 2002), which allows a one-to-one correspondence irrespective of the context.

It has been aligned on the sentence level by JAPA (Langlais et al., 1998), and further on the word level by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).
