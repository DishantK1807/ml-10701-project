Many of the, traditional cases of divergences discussed, e.g. by Dorr (1994), at'e already handled in the Verbmobil syntax-seniantics interface, hence they (lo not show up in our transfer at)proach.

In order to allow for underspecification, variants of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDRS) (Reyle, 1993) are employed as semantic formalisms in the different analysis components (Bos et al., 1996; Egg and Lebeth, 1995; Copestake et al., 1995).

lexicalist approach which relates bags of lexical signs, as in Shake-and-Bake MT (Beaven, 1992; Whitelock, 1992), our transfer approach operates on the level of semantic representations produced by various analysis steps.

The exact details of subordination are beyond tim scope of this paper, of, Prank aa~d Reylc (1995) and Bos et al.(1996) for implementations.

At first glance, our approach is very similar to the semantic transfer approach presented in Alshawi et al.(1991). It, uses a level of underspecified senmntic representations as input and output of transfer.

As 319 already pointed out, e.g. in (Sadler and Thompson, 1991), this kind of transfer has problems with its own multiple level mappings, e.g. handling of verb-adverb head switching, and does not cleanly separate monolingual from contrastive knowledge, either.

(Vauquois and Boi~et, 1985; Nagao et al., 1985), is based on con~rastive bilingual corpus analyses from which a bilingual lexicon of transfer equivalences is derived.

Out" current apt)roach is strongly related to tile Shake-and-Bake approach of Beaven (1992) and Whitclock (1992).

In Kaplan and Wedekind (1993) an improved treatment of head switching is presented but it still remains a less general solution.
