We extracted 134 abstract nouns used as this kind of head noun semi-automatically by using syntactic patterns that Isahara and Kanzaki(1999) and Kanzaki et al.(2000) used in their paper.

To extract semantic information of words such as synonyms and antonyms from corpora, previous research used syntactic structures (Hindle 1990, Hatzivassiloglou 1993 and Tokunaga 1995), response time to associate synonyms and antonyms in psychological experiments (Gross 1989), or extracting related words automatically from corpora (Grefensette 1994).

We used syntactic and semantic patterns in our previous work (Isahara and Kanzaki 1999) in order to extract these types of examples from large corpora semi-automatically.
P99-1063
Isahara and Kanzaki (1999) classified semantic relations between adjectives and their head nouns from the viewpoints of syntax, semantics and computational treatment.
