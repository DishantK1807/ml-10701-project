Animacy Each noun and pronoun is labeled for the animacy of its referent (Zaenen et al., 2004).

Surface features like a wordâ€™s part-of-speech (POS) (Hirschberg, 1993) and its unigram and bigram probability (Pan and McKeown, 1999; Pan and 0Thanks to the Edinburgh-Stanford Link and ONR (MURI award N000140510388) for generous support.

A complete description of the annotation guidelines can be found in (Calhoun et al., 2005).

While the improvements from kontrast are relatively small, the consistency of these small improvements suggest that developing automatic methods for approximating the gold-standard annotation we used here, similar to what has been done for information status in (Nissim, 2006), may be worthwhile.

Bearing this difference in mind, the best reported results to our knowledge are those in (Gregory and Altun, 2004), where conditional random fields were used with both textual, acoustic, and oracle boundary features to yield 76.36% accuracy.
P04-1086
Unfortunately these studies used different parts of the corpus or different labelings (Gregory and Altun, 2004; Yuan et al., 2005), so our results are not directly comparable.

Each word was manually labeled for presence or absence of pitch accent1, as well as additional features including information status (or givenness), contrast and animacy distinctions, (Nissim et al., 2004; Calhoun et al., 2005; Zaenen et al., 2004), features that linguistic literature suggests are predictive of prominence (Bolinger, 1961; Chafe, 1976).

For example Gregory and Altun (2004) used acoustic features 3This result is comparable with the result of (Yuan et al., 2005) who in their experiment with the same corpus report the best result as 83.9% using three features: unigram, bigram and backwards bigram probability.
