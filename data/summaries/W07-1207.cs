In the one domain in which we have a reasonable amount of training data (about 9300 utterances), we experimented with a PCFG using trained probabilities with the Collins algorithm, but were not able to improve on the hand-tuned preferences in overall performance (Elsner et al., 2005).

Our generic senses have been inspired by FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).

It incorporates 168 SCF distinctions, a superset of those found in the COMLEX Syntax (Grishman et al., 1994) and ANLT (Boguraev et al., 1987) dictionaries.

This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources ??FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) ??that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.

The system uses different strategies for reFigure 8: The LF-MRS conversion algorithm 53 solving each type of referring expression along the lines described in (Byron, 2002).

In addition, it has a relatively simple method of computing possible quantifier scoping, drawing from the approaches by (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987) and (Alshawi, 1990).

Our syntax relies on a frame-based design in the LF ontology, a common representation in semantic lexicons (Baker et al., 1998, Kipper et al., 2000).

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

The general capability provided for resolving referring expressions is to search through the discourse history for the most recent entity that matches the semantic requirements, where recency within an utterance may be reordered to reflect focusing heuristics (Tetreault, 2001).

Setup Experiments aimed at extracting protein-protein interactions for Bakers yeast (Sacharomyces Cerevesiae) to assess BioNoculars (Cherry et al., 1998).

For example, Fuchss et al.(2004) formally show that the translation from MRS to Dominance Constraints is feasible.
