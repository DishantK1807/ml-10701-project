Hence researchers have investigated use of corpus-based approaches to build a WordNet like resource automatically (Hearst, 1992; Cara1The test examples were selected as follows: First, all the sentences containing definite NP “The Y” were extracted from the corpus.

We further find that the Markert and Nissim (2005) OtherY-Model and our MI-based improvement do show substantial relative performance growth at increased corpus sizes, although they still underperform our basic TheY-Model at all tested corpus sizes.

Also, several researchers have applied it to resolving different types of bridging anaphora (Clark, 1975).

Although Markert and Nissim (2005) report that using Mutual Information performs similar to using raw frequency, Table 5 shows that using Mutual Information makes a substantial impact on results using large training corpora relative to using raw frequency.

Several researchers have used WordNet as a lexical and semantic resource for certain types of bridging anaphora (Poesio et al., 1997; Meyer and Dale, 2002).

However, this issue was recently addressed by Markert and Nissim (2005) by extending their work on Other-Anaphora using lexico syntactic pattern ’X and other Y’s to antecedent selection for definite NP coreference.

This was shown to outperform a recent approachbyMarkertandNissim(2005)thatmakesuse of standard Hearst-style patterns extracting hypernyms for the same task.

The OtherY-Model performs particularly poorly on smaller data sizes, where coverage of the Hearst-style patterns maybe limited, as also observed by Berland and Charniak (1999).
P99-1008
We compare this approach with a WordNet-based algorithm and with an approach presented by Markert and Nissim (2005) on resolving definite NP coreference that makes use of lexico-syntactic patterns such as ’X and Other Ys’ as utilized by Hearst (1992).

WordNet has also been used as an important feature in machine learning of coreference resolution using supervised training data (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002).

The combined model results in a substantially better accuracy than the individual WordNet-Model and TheY-Model, indicating its strong merit for the antecedent selection task.10 3.4 OtherY-Modelfreq This model is a reimplementation of the corpusbased algorithm proposed by Markert and Nissim (2005) for the equivalent task of antecedent selectionfordefiniteNPcoreference.

Poesio et al.(2004) have suggested using Google as a source of computing lexical distance between antecedent and definite NP for mereological bridging references (references referring to parts of an object already introduced).
