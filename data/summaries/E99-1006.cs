We turned the segmentation task into a classification task by using boundaries between dialogue acts as one class and non-boundaries as the other (see Passonneau and Litman (1997) for a similar practice).

In addition to the S-List (Strube, 1998), which contains the referents of NPs available for anaphoric reference, our model includes ~These are preferences and not strict rules because some l-Incompatible contexts are compatible with NPs denoting abstract objects, e.g., The story/It is true.

Each dialogue is divided into short, clearly defined dialogue acts Initiations I and Acknowledgments A based on the top of the hierarchy given in Carletta et al.(1997). Each sentence and each conjoined clause counts as a separate I, even if they are part of the same turn.

Byron and Stent (1998) and Walker (1998) assign no importance to such utterances in their models.

Summarised below are some issues specific to anaphora resolution in spoken dialogues (see also Byron and Stent (1998) who mention some of these problems in their account of the Centering model (Grosz et al., 1995)).
J95-2003 P98-2241
We have chosen Strube's (1998) model for the resolution of individual anaphora as basis because it avoids the problems encountered by Byron & Stent, who also do not present data on the resolution of pronouns in dialogues and do not mention abstract object anaphora.
P98-2204
to Resolve Discourse Deictic Anaphora We now turn to our method of anaphora resolution, which extends the algorithm presented in Strube (1998), in order to be able to account for discourse deictic anaphora as well as individual anaphora.
P98-2204
After each step the annotations were compared using the ~ statistic as reliability measure for all classification tasks (Carletta, 1996).
J96-2004
Byron and Stent (1998) present extensions of the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995) for spoken dialogue and identify several problems with the model.
J95-2003 P98-2241
LuperFoy (1992) does not present a corpus study, meaning that statistics about the distribution of individual and abstract object anaphora or about the success rate of her approach are not available.
