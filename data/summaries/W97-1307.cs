These basic steps of "COLLECT, FILTER, and ORDER by salience" are analogous to Lappin and Leass's (1994) pronoun resolution algorithm, but each step in FASTUS relies on considerably poorer syntactic input.

Part of the pronoun resolution performance here enables a preliminary comparison with the results reported in (1) Lappin and Leass (1994) and (2) Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).
C96-1021 J94-4002
Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) then report a 75% accuracy for an algorithm that approximates Lappin and Leass's with more robust and coarse-grained syntactic input.
C96-1021
For instance, Lappin and Leass (1994) report an 86% accuracy for a resolution algorithm for third-person pronouns using fully parsed sentences as input.

Pronouns: Of the four pronoun resolution errors, one is due to a parse error (American in 7-1 was incorrectly parsed as a person entity, to which she in 8-1 was resolved), that in 6-2 is a discourse deixis (Webber, 1988), beyond the scope of the current approach, and two errors (it in 3-1 and its in 7-1) were due to the left-right ordering of intrasentential candidates.

Decision procedure for choosing among equally preferred candidate antecedents Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) approximated the above components with a poorer syntactic input, which is an output of a part-of-speech tagger with grammatical function information, plus NPs recognized by finite-state patterns and NPs' adjunct and subordination contexts recognized by heuristics.
C96-1021
The input to reference resolution in the theoretical literature is assumed to be fully parsed sentences, often with syntactic attributes such as grammatical functions and thematic roles on the constituents (Webber, 1978; Sidner, 1979; Hobbs, 1978; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995).
J95-2003
The present algorithm thus provides an interesting case of what happens with extremely poor syntactic input, even poorer than in Kennedy and Boguraev's (1996) system.

Algorithm This algorithm was first implemented for the MUC-6 FASTUS system (Appelt et al., 1995), and produced one of the top scores (a recall of 59% and precision of 72%) in the MUC-6 Coreference Task, which evaluated systems' ability to recog47 nize coreference among noun phrases (Sundheim, 1995).
