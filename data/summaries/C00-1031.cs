The fact that current anaphora resolution systems rely exclusively on the linear nature of texts in order to determine the LPA of an anaphor seems odd, given flint several studies have claimed that there is a strong relation between discourse structure and reference (Sidner, 1981 ; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Grosz et al., 1995; Fox, 1987; Vonk ct al., 1992; Azzam el al., 1998; Hitzcman and Pocsio, 1998).

The units that hierarchically precede a given unit are determined according to Veins Theory (VT) (Cristea et al., 1998), which is described brielly below.

In most cases, the COLLECT module determines an LPA by enumerating all antecedents in a window o1' text that precedes the anaphor under scrutiny (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997; Ge et al., 1998).

Linear-0 models an approach that assumes that :tll anaphors can be resolved intra-unit; Linear1 models an approach that cor,'esponds roughly to centering (Grosz et al., 1995).

In other cases, these modules are integrated by means of statistical (Ge et al., 1998) or uncertainty reasoning teclmiques (Mitkov, 1997).

Tile texts were also manually annotated by Marcu et al.(1999) with disconrse structures built in the style of Mann and Thompson (1988).

Most current anaphora resolution systems implelnent a pipeline architecture with three modules (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1997; Kameyama, 1997).

This is consistent with tile distinction between "direct" and "indirect" references discussed by Cristea, et al.(1998).
