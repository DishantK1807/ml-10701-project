Results from the last edition of the Senseval competition (Mihalcea et al., 2004) have shown that, for supervised learning, the best accuracies are obtained with a combination of various types of features, together with traditional machine learning algorithms based on feature-value vectors, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes.
