the NEGRA treebank for German (Skut et al., 1998), or the material annotated in the Framenet (Baker et al., 1998) project on the basis of The Bank of English (Cobuild, 2001) show that the syntactic patterns specific verbs occur with vary stongly.
P98-1013
We embed the formalization in the new lexicalized, dependency-based grammar formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).
P01-1024
We can also use thematic roles to structure verbs into an ontology, as e.g. attempted by (Helbig, 1995), (Davis, 1998) or (Baker et al., 1998) in order to make semantic predictions for syntactic valency patterns.
P98-1013
Thus, it lends itself easy to techniques of automatically acquiring lexica from syntactically and semantically annotated corpora, which start developing at present ((Baker et al., 1998), (Skut et al., 1998)).
P98-1013
We enriched the framework of Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001) (TDG) with a third level of representation, thematic structure, and defined well formedness conditions on the thematic structure and on the relation between thematic structure (TH) and syntactic dominance (ID) structure.

(Tarvainen, 1987), (Helbig, 1989), (Sgall et al., 1986) or the Framenet project (Baker et al., 1998) for different application-oriented sets of thematic roles (or “frame elements”).
P98-1013
We formalize our idea of linking and valency frames as an extension of the new lexicalized, dependencybased grammar formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), (Debusmann, 2001).
P01-1024
We present a formal architecture in the framework of a multi-dimensional, heavily lexicalized, efficiently parsable dependency formalism (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), which uses lexical inheritance as a means to explicitly model syntactic variation.
