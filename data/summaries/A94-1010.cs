Alshawi and Carter (1994); Rayner et al (1994); Rosenfeld (1994).

For example, dependencies between words exist at separations greater than those allowed for by trigrams (for which long-distance N-grams \[Jelinek et al, 1991\] are a partial remedy), and associating scores with parsing table states may not model all the important correlations between grammar rules.
H91-1057
When a sentence was analysed successfully, several semantic analyses were, in general, created, and a selection was made from among these on the basis of trained preference functions (Alshawi and Carter, 1994).

From this it is sensible to conclude, consistently with the results of Briscoe and Carroll (1993), that a more complex model of grammar rule interaction might yield better results.
J93-1002
For example, a bigram model may be replaced by a trigram one, and the fact that dependencies exist among the likelihoods of occurrence of grammar rules at different locations in a parse tree can be modeled by associating probabilities with states in a parsing table rather than simply with the rules themselves (Briscoe and Carroll, 1993).

Pereira, Tishby and Lee, 1993; Ney, Essen and Kneser, 1994) has addressed the problem of data sparseness by clustering words into classes which are then used to predict smoothed probabilities of occurrence for events which may seldom or never have been observed during training.

Rule Experiment In the second experiment, each training sentence and each test sentence hypothesis was analysed by the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992) trained on the ATIS domain (Agn~ et al, 1994).

The method, which is related to that of Iyer, Ostendorf and Rohlicek (1994), involves clustering the sentences in the training corpus into a number of subcorpora, each predicting a different probability distribution for linguistic objects.
H94-1014
Other corpora, such as Wall Street Journal articles, might also be expected to fall naturally into clusters for different subject areas, and indeed Iyer el al (1994) report positive results from corpus clustering here.
H94-1014
This is consistent with experience (Rayner et al, 1994) that, for the ATIS domain, trigrams model inter-word effects much better than bigrams do, but that extending the N-gram model beyond N = 3 is much less beneficial.
