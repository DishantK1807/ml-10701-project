SYNPHONICS Conceptualizer The conceptual input into the Formulator in short: CS for "conceptual structure" is represented in the RefO/RetN format (Habel 1982, 1986a/b; Eschenbach et al.1989). The basic representational units are Referential Objects (ReIDs), which are stored and processed in a net-like structure, a Referential Net (REIN).

Unlike deduction-based approaches to natural language generation in computational linguistics (e.g., Shieber et al.1990), however, the SYNPHONICS approach involves a detailed and transparent process model, with sub-processes being explicitly specified at any point in the overall process.
