To quantify the relative strengths of these transitive inferences, Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) propose to assign a weight to each link.

More generally, distributional clustering techniques (SchÂ¨utze, 1992; Pereira et al., 1993) could be applied to extract semantic classes from the corpus itself.

Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) propose to generalize the direct evidence method so that it can apply to unseen pairs of adjectives by computing the transitive closure of the ordering relation. That is, if a c and c b, we can conclude that a b.

evidence The simplest strategy for ordering adjectives is what Shaw and Hatzivassiloglou (1999) call the direct evidence method.

In particular, boosting (Schapire, 1999; Abney et al., 1999) offers the possibility of achieving high accuracy from a collection of classifiers which individually perform quite poorly.
