Our account builds on Bachenko et al.(1986), but differs in its treatment of clausal structure and predicate-argument relations.
P86-1022
In previous work (Bachenko et al.1986), we described an experimental text-to-speech system that determined prosodic phrasing for the Olive-Liberman synthesizer (Olive and Liberman 1985).
P86-1022
Previous versions of our work, as described in Bachenko et al.(1986) also assume that phrasing is dependent on predicate-argument structure.
P86-1022
Although a grid may be more descriptively suitable for some aspects of prosody (for example, Sproat and Liberman (1987) use the grid representation for their implementation of stress assignment in compound nominals), we are not aware of any evidence for or against a grid representation of discourseneutral phrasing.
P87-1020
Hirschberg and Litman (1987) and Litman and Hirschberg (1990) also examine the relation between discourse and prosodic phrasing.

14. Hindle (1983); lexical lookup and category disambiguation are done by tlhe stochastic parser described in Church (1988).

9. Problems with final phrase boundaries are discussed in more detail in Bachenko et al.(1986), where the analysis presented assumes the versi.on of final bundling proposed in G &G.

And while researchers in text-tospeech synthesis have adopted a variety of approaches to prosodic phrase generation--from the simple punctuationbased rules and function word listings of existing commercial systems to the sophisticated prosodic heuristics described in Emorine and Martin (1988) and O'Shaughnessy (1989)---the generation of appropriate prosodic phrasing in unres~tricted text has remained a problem.
