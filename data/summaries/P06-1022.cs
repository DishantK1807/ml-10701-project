However, since some methods for detecting sentence boundaries have already been proposed (Huang and Zweig, 2002; Shitaoka et al., 2004), we assume that they can be detected automatically before dependency parsing.

To resolve the syntactic ambiguity of a long sentence, some of them have focused attention on the “clause.” First, there are the studies that focused attention on compound clauses (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).

Next, other research efforts utilized the three categories into which various types of subordinate clauses are hierarchically classified based on the “scope-embedding preference” of Japanese subordinate clauses (Shirai et al., 1995; Utsuro et al., 2000).

In order to robustly deal with their extragrammaticality, some techniques for parsing of dialogue sentences have been proposed (Core and Schubert, 1999; Delmonte, 2003; Ohno et al., 2005b).

Incidentally, the above attributes are the same as those used by the conventional stochastic dependency parsing methods (Collins, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1997; Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Charniak, 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002).
