Colloeational Analysis in Japanese Text Input Masaki YAMASHINA Fumihiko OBASHI NTT Electrical Communication Laboratories 1-2356 Take Yokosuka~shi Kanagawa-ken 238-03 JAPAN Abstract This paper proposes a new disambiguation method for Japanese text input.
This method evaluates candidate sentences by measuring the number of Word Co-occurrence Patterns (WCP) included in the candidate sentences.
An automatic WCP extraction method is also developed.
An extraction experiment using the example sentences from dictionaries confirms that WCP can be collected automaticMly with an accuracy of 98.7% using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules to eliminate erroneous extraction.
Using this method, about 305,000 sets of WCP are collected.
A cooccurrence pattern matrix with semantic categories is built based on these WCP.
Using this matrix, the mean number of candidate sentences in Kana.-to-Kanji translation is reduced to about 1/10 of those fi-om existing morphological methods.
1.Introduction For keyboard input of Japanese, Kana-to-kanji translation method \[Kawada79\] \[Makino80\] \[Abe86\] is the most popular technique.
In this method, Kana input sentences are translated automatically into Kanji-Kana sentences.
However, non-segmentcd Kana input is highly ambiguous, be..
cause of the segmentation ambiguities of Kana input into morphemes, and homonym ambiguities.
Some research has been carried out mainly to overcome homonym ambiguity using a word usage dictionary \[Makino80\] and by using case grammar \[Abe86\].
A new technique named collocational analysis method, is proposed to overcome both ambiguities.
This evaluates the certainty of candidate sentences by measuring the number of co-occurrence patterns between word paix~.
It is used in addition to the usual morphological analysis.
To realize this, it is essential to build a dictionary which can reflect Word Co-occurrence Patterns (WCP).
In English processing research, there has been an attempt \[Grishman86\] to collect semi-automatically sublanguage selectional patterns.
In Japanese processing research, there have been attempts \[Shirai86\] \[Tanaka86\] to collect combinations of words with this kind of relationship, eittmr completelyor semi-automatically.
These two attempts did not provide a dictionary for practical use.
A new method is proposed for building a dictionary which accumulates WCP.
The first feature of this method is the collection of WCP from the common combination of two words having a dependency relationship in a sentence, because these common combinations will most likely reoccur in future texts.
In this method, it is important to identify dependency relationships between word pai~s, instead of identifying, the whole dependency structure of the sentence.
For this purpose, Dependency Localization Analysis (DLA) is used.
This identifies the word pairs having a definite dependency relationship using syntactic analysis and some heuristic rules.
This paper will first describe eoUocational analysis, a new concept in Kana-to-Kanji translation, then the compilation of WCP dictionary, next the translation Mgorithm and finMly translation experimental results.
2. Concept of Colloeatlonal Analysis in Translation CollocationM analysis evaluates the correctness of a translated sentence by measuring the WCP within the sentence.
The WCP data is accmnulated in a 2-dimensional matrix, by information milts indicating more restricted concepts than the words can indica.te by themselves.
As previously mentioned there are two kinds of ambiguities in Kana-to-Kanji translation.
In Fig.i, disambiguation process of homonyms is illustrated.
' NA;R (a national anthem) and ~\[~'~~ (to play)' and ' NAg( (a state) aud ~.~-~;5 (to build)' etc.
are examples of WCP.
If the simple Kana sequence ' ~_ -~ h~ ~-.~./~ ~ 5 ~" ;5 \[kokkaoensousuru\]' is input, the usual translation system will develop two possible candidate words ' NJN ' (a national anthem) and ' NAg( (a state)', for the partial Kana sequence of ' ~ ~J h~ \[kokk@ The system will also develop uniquely the creed(date word, ' ~-¢ ;5 (to play) ' for' R./~ <-) -~;5 \[ensousumq'.
These candidate words are obtained by table searching and morphologicM analysis.
Itowever, morphological analysis alone can't identify which one is correct for ' ~.
o h~ \[kokka\].
Using eo!loeationM analysis, ~he WCP of ' NA ~.7,~(a state)' and ' ~;5 (to play)' is found to be nil, while that of' NA~ (a national anthem)' and ' ~ ;5 (to play)' is found to be probable.
Using WCP, ' NA ~ik ~ ~ ~ ~" -5 (to play a national anthem)' is selected as the final candidate sentence.
If the Kana sequence' c o h~ ~ l:Y/b -t~ ~ ~" .5 \[kokkaokensetsusnru\]' is input, ' NA~-$k~: ;5 (to build a state)' is obtained in same manner.

Translation Algorlthm Fig.3 shows the translation process outline.
First, tablesearching is done for all segmentation possibilities to get each part-of-speech of segment.
This' is carried out referring to independent word •dictionary (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
\[65,000 words\]), prefix and suffix dictionary \[1085 words\], dependent word dictionary (postpositions, auxiliary verbs, etc.
\[422 words D, Then, among the morpheme sequences constructed with each segment, the grammatically possible sequences are selected.
Next, the candidate sentences with the least number of Bunsetsu are selected \[Yoshimura83\].
Furthermore, among tt~ese selected sentences, those which have the least number of words are selected.
In this process, a heuristic rule is used to prevent morPheme sequence mis-selection.
This rule rejects the combinations of nouns constructing a compound word, if the usage frequency of either nouns is very low.
ex, Input Kana sequence: 75~/b I;~ ~ 03 ~2 ~ \[kankeinonaka\] x ~ (noun) ~ (noun, freq.
: very low) (a relation) (in a field) O ~ (noun) o) (postposition) OO (noun, freq.
: high) (a relation) (among) Secondly, the co-occurrence pattern matrix is utilized in order to determine the number of WCP within each candidate sentence.
The counting operation is carried out only on adjacent Bunsetsu, because, in most eases, relationships are between adjacent Bunsetsu and determining extended relationships would prove to be too time-consuming.
Finally, the canddate sentence with the maximum WCP number is chosen as the prime candidate.
To prevent mistaken deletion of prime candidates caused by word pairs which rarely co-occur, following rule is used.
If the usage frequency of either word in WCP is low, the,candidate sentences of which WCP number is less one than maximum number, are also identified as prime candidates.
In following example, both are identified as prime candidates.

Using this method, about 305,000 sets of WCP were collected.
