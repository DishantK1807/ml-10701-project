Thus, they fail to address the first problem we discussed (in Section 1.1). 1.3 The DTG Approach Vijay-Shanker (1992) points out that use of adjunction for clausal complementation in TAG corresponds, at the level of dependency structure, to substitution at the foot node s of the adjoined tree.

In the case of the to adore tree, the situation is the inverse: the functional subject requires a finite verb Sin this context, it might be beneficiM to consider the expression of a feature-based lexicalist theory such as HPSG in DTG, similar to the compilation of HPSG to TAG (Kasper et al., 1995).
P95-1013
From the definition of DTG in Section 2 it can be seen that the essential aspects of Schabes & Shieber (1994) treatment for modification, including multiple modifications of a phrase, can be captured by using this operation 4.
J94-1004
The problem in describing these phenomena with TAG arises from the fact (observed by Vijay-Shanker (1992)) that adjoining is an overly restricted way of combining structures.
J92-4004
However, as Vijay-Shanker (1992) observes, the TAG composition operations are not used uniformly: while substitution is used only to add a (nominal) complement, adjunction is used both for modification and (clausal) complementation.

MCTAG with Domination Links (MCTAG-DL) (Becker et al., 1991) are multicomponent systems that allow for the expression of dominance constraints.

SThis was also observed by Rambow (1994a), where an integrity constraint (first defined for an tD/LP version of TAG (Becket et aJ., 1991)) is defined for a MCTAG-DL version called V-TAG.

However, they represent important linguistic intuition, they provide a uniform interface to semantics, and they are, as Schabes ~ Shieber (1994) argue, important in order to support statistical parameters in stochastic frameworks and appropriate adjunction constraints in TAG.
J94-1004
Following earlier work (Becket et al., 1991; Vijay-Shanker, 1992), DTG provide a mechanism involving the use of domination links (d-edges) that ensure that parts of the subserted structure that are not substituted dominate those parts that are.
