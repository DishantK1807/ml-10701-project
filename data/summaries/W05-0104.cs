For example, it meant that simple word alignment models like IBM models 1 and 2 (Brown et al., 1990) and the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996) came many weeks after HMMs were introduced in the context of part-of-speech tagging.

The original intention of assignment 2 was that students then use this maxent classifier as a building block of a maxent part-of-speech tagger like that of Ratnaparkhi (1996).

Second, their language models were used to rescore n-best speech lists (supplied by Brian Roark, see Roark (2001)).

However, many chose to have smoothed HMMs with complex emission models like Brants (2000), while others built maxent taggers.

Once the parser parsed correctly with the supplied treebank grammar, students experimented with horizontal and vertical markovization (see Klein and Manning (2003)) to improve parsing accuracy.
