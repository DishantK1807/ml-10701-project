Our method, adapted from that of Satta (1994) (who considered the problem of parsing with tree-adjoining grammars), is to encode information about Boolean matrices into a CFG.

487), and Satta (1994) makes this assumption as well.

Our technique, adapted from that used by Satta (1994) for tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) parsing, is to show that BMM can be efficiently reduced to CFG parsing.

Secondly, a parser should create an output structure from which information about constituents can be retrieved in an efficient way -Satta (1994) points out an observation of Lang to the effect that one can consider the input string itself to be a retrievalinefficient representation of parse information.
