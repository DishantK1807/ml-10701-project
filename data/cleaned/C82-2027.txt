A PRA~ATIC CONCEPT OF THEME AND RHEME FOR MACHINE T~TION Christa Hauenschild SFB 99 E2, Universitat Konstanz, Postfach 5560, D-7750 Konst anz The concept of theme and rheme we want to propose in this paper is pragmatic in two senses of the wordz the theme/ theme structure (TRS) is viewed as a strategy of communication and thus belongs to pra~natics, and it seems to offer a pragmatic solution for a problem of machine translation.
The starting-point of our considerations is defined by several arEuments claiming the ne@essity to preserve the TRS of sentences (or utterances) in the process of translation, as stated in Koenitz, 1978z the exhaustive-listing reading of the theme the presuppositionsl character of the theme the connexion of the THS with the degree of textual coherence. the correlation of themeness and definiteness general considerations in a framework of communication theory (readability of texts eto).
Further arguments might easily be added to this list (e.g.
the relation between the TR3 and the scope of operators).
In principle all of them hold for machine translation as well, at least if it is pursued within a theoretical fremework, as e.g. in the case of the project SALAT (of.
Hauensohild, 1978) and of the successor project "Ubersetzungsbezogene Kontexttheorie" (Context theory for translation) in the spirit of which this paper was written.
121 These considerations lead to the question whether it is necessary to compute the TRS of ever7 translated sentence, which would be very difficult if at all possible Eiven the high degree of ambiguity of written texts with respect to the TRS.
We want to propose a somewhat simplified procedure which nevertheless ensures the preservation of the TI~.
Theoretically, this procedure is based on a concept of theme and theme that ascribes them a strategic role in communication, controlling, as it were, several other factors (semantic and syntactic).
If these latter factors are kept constant during the tra~slation process, we can be sure that we have preserved theme and theme as well (or that the boundary is irrelevant in the given sentence), The central hypothesis of this paper is the following: in most cases it is sufficient to preserve the underlying (communicatively conditioned) order of main elements, which is conceived in a wa~ ve~J similar to that of Sgall and HaJiSov~, 1977/78, or Ha~l~ov~, 1980, but without indi@ation of an exact boundaz7 between theme and theme.
~he validity of this hypothesis is, of course, limited to certain languages (we treat German, French and Russian) and to certain types of texts, aiminE exclusively at an optimal transmission of information.
With such a limita~ion, it is very often possible to derive the underlying order in a straightforward way from the surface order of the main constituents of a sentence.
It might seem surprising that this should hold for such languages as German, French and Russian, ~hich are normally viewed as ezJ~ibiting different types of word-order reEularitlea.
But if we look at texts of the mentioned ~ind (e.g.
reports for international organizations), w@ find that in all three languages they axe organized in a similar way, obeying more or less to some kind of "linearity principle"s sentences 122 normally start with the elements connecting them to the preceding context, the elements carrying "new information" are situated at the end.
Such organization seemto be most effective in the sense of an optimal transfer of information.
Thus we propose a procedure that derives the underlyin~ from the surface order of the main constituents using some transformations for special oases (e.g.
cleft-sentences). The synthesis will yield the corresponding surface order of the target language, again with a minimal set of transforn~tionse The procedure is to be controlled by several semantic factors that are closely related to the TRS (compare the ar&~msnts for the preservation of the TR3 in translation mentioned at the beginning), but have to be kept constant on independent grounds s anaphoric relations definite or indefinite (or generic) interpretation of noun-phrases scope of quantiflsrs, negation and other operators References Ha~i~ovd, Evaz A dependency based specification of topic and focus Is background and motivation.
