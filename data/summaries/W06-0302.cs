As a follow-up to the work described in this paper we developed a method that utilizes the unlabeled NPs in the corpus using a structured rule learner (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006).

Our approach to source coreference resolution is inspired by the state-of-the-art performance of the method of Ng and Cardie (2002).

The latter problem of developing methods that can work with incomplete supervisory information is addressed in a subsequent effort (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006).

We evaluated using the two widely used performance measures for coreference resolution â€“ MUC score (Vilain et al., 1995) and B3 (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998).

Our work is concerned with fine-grained expressions of opinions and assumes that a system can rely on the results of effective opinion and source extractors such as those described in Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Bethard et al.(2004), Wiebe andRiloff(2005)andChoietal.(2005).

For instance selection they adopt the method of Soon et al.(2001), which selects for each NP the pairs with the n preceding coreferent instances and all intervening non-coreferent pairs.

Nevertheless, asafirstattemptatsource coreference resolution, we employ a state-of-theart machine learning approach to NP coreference resolution developed by Ng and Cardie (2002).

Riloff and Wiebe (2003), Bethard et al.(2004), Wilson et al.(2004), Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003), Wiebe and Riloff (2005)) have shown that sentiment information can be extracted at the sentence, clause, or individualopinionexpressionlevel(fine-grainedopinion information).

Additionally, researchers have been able to effectively identify sources of opinions automatically (Bethard et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2005).

Following Ng and Cardie (2002), we perform instance selection with n = 1 (soon1 in the results) and n = 2 (soon2).

The preprocessing is done following the NP coreference work by Ng and Cardie (2002).
