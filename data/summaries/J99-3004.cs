Moore and Pollack (1992) show the need to distinguish the intentional and informational structure of discourse, where the latter is characterized by the sort of relations classified as subject-matter relations in RST.

Inference of coherence relations has been used in modeling temporal (Lascarides and Asher 1991; Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander 1992) and other defeasible discourse inferences (Hobbs 1978; Dahlgren 1989).

The rule's antecedent would hold whenever obstacle detection techniques (Allen and Perrault 1980) determine that h's not knowing the referent of t is an obstacle to an inferred plan of h's.

However, not all helpful responses, in the sense described in Allen and Perrault (1980), can be used as indirect answers.
J80-3003
Moore and Paris (1993) argue that it is necessary for generation systems to represent not only the speaker's top-level goal, but also the communicative subgoals that a speaker hoped to achieve by use of an informational relation so that, if that subgoal is not achieved, then an alternative rhetorical means can be tried.

In Horacek's,approach to generating concise explanations (Horacek 1991), a set of propositions representing the full explanation is pruned by eliminating propositions that can be derived from the remaining ones by a set of contextual rules.

Techniques for interpreting indirect speech acts (Perrault and Allen 1980; Hinkelman 1989) can be used to determine whether the rule's antecedent holds.
J80-3003
Plan recognition has been used to model the interpretation of indirect speech acts (Perrault and Allen 1980; Hinkelman 1989) and ellipsis (Carberry 1990; Litman 1986), discourse phenomena that share with conversational implicature the two necessary conditions described above, cancelablity and speaker intention.
J80-3003
Rhetorical or coherence relations (Grimes 1975; Halliday 1976; Mann and Thompson 1988) have been used in several text-generation systems to aid in ordering parts of a text (e.g., Hovy 1988) as well as in content planning (e.g., McKeown 1985; Moore and Paris 1993).
