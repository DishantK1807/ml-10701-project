Finite-state machines have been extensively applied to many aspects of language processing including, speech recognition (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Riccardi et al., 1996), phonology (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), morphology (Koskenniemi, 1984), chunking (Abney, 1991; Joshi and Hopely, 1997; Bangalore, 1997), parsing (Roche, 1999), and machine translation (Bangalore and Riccardi, 2000).

Johnston (1998b) shows how techniques from natural language processing (unification-based gramumrs and chart parsing) can be adapted to support parsing and interpretation of utterances distributed over multiple modes.

In the unification-based approach to multimodal integration, this is achieved by feature sharing (Johnston, 1998b).

Johnston 1998 presents an approach in which strategies lbr multimodal integration are stated declaratively using a unification-based grammar that is used by a mnltidilnensional chart parser to compose inputs.

Compared to previous al~proaches (Johnston el al., 1997; Jolmston, 1998a; Wu et al., 1999) which compose elements from 'n.-best lists of recognition results, our approach provides an unprecedenled potential for mutual compensation among the input modes.

To realize their full potential, multimodal interfaces need to support not just input from multiple modes, but synergistic multimodal utterances optimally distributed over the available modes (Johnston et al., 1997).

However, the computational consequences of this can be lessened by lazy ewfluation techniques (Mohri, 1997) and we believe that this finitestate approach to constructing semantic representations is viable for a broad range of sophisticated language interface tasks.

In prelilninary speech recognition experiments, our approach yielded an average o1' 23% relative sentence-level error reduction on a corpus of 1000 utterances (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).

This approach overcomes many of the limitations of previous approaches to multimodal integration such as (Bolt, 1980; Neal and Shapiro, 1991) (See (Johnston ct al., 1997)(1).
