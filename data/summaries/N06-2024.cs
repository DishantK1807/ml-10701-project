Recently, sequential learning methods, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), have been used successfully for a number of applications, including NER (Sha and Pereira, 2003; Pinto et al., 2003; Mccallum and Lee, 2003).

Culotta and McCallum (2004) suggest several methods for doing this with CRFs.

(Culotta and McCallum, 2004) suggest several ways to generate confidence estimation in this framework.
