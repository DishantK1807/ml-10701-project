based correlation WordNet is an electronic thesaurus popularly used in many researches on lexical semantic acquisition, and word sense disambiguation (Green, 1999; Leacock et al, 1998).

A number of simple linguistic techniques has been developed to alleviate such problems, ranging from the use of stemming, lexical chain and thesaurus (Jing & Tzoukermann, 1999; Green, 1999), to word-sense disambiguation (Chen & Chang, 1998; Leacock et al, 1998; Ide & Veronis, 1998) and context (Cohen & Singer, 1999; Jing & Tzoukermann, 1999).

3. Semantic Correlations Although there exists many methods to derive the semantic correlations between words (Lee, 1999; Lin, 1998; Karov & Edelman, 1998; Resnik, 1995; Dagan et al, 1995), we adopt a relatively simple and yet practical and effective approach to derive three topic -oriented semantic correlations: thesaurus-based, co-occurrence-based and contextbased correlation.

based correlation Broadly speaking, there are three kinds of context: domain, topic and local contexts (Ide & Vernois, 1998).

The connectionist approach has been widely used to extract knowledge in a wide range of information processing tasks including natural language processing, information retrieval and image understanding (Anderson, 1983; Lee & Dubin, 1999; Sarkas & Boyer, 1995; Wang & Terman, 1995).

4. Semantic Groups & Topic Tree There are many methods that attempt to construct the conceptual representation of a topic from the original data set (Veling & van der Weerd, 1999; Baker & McCallum, 1998; Pereira et al, 1993).
