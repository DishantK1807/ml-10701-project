This observation has led to a new proposal to measure system "convergence" (Hirschman 1991a).

In addition, the texts posed other challenges including the frequent use of 4 Additional statistics concerning the MUC-3 corpus are presented elsewhere (Hirschman 1991b).

They have both benefited from and inspired other work on evaluation, as evidenced by the growing body of research on evaluation techniques for natural language understanding including two workshops on the subject: Palmer and Finin, 1990 and Neal and Walter, 1991.
J90-3005
Some treated a text as an unordered set of words, as in traditional text categorization techniques from information retrieval (Lewis 1991).
M91-1035
There is active research in the evaluation of spoken language understanding: Hirschman et al., 1992 and Price et al., 1992.
H92-1006 M92-1005
The first was an analysis of the text-filtering capabilities of the MUC-3 and MUC-4 systems (Lewis and Tong 1992).

6. Linguistic Phenomena Test Experiment The scores discussed above provide a black-box measure of system effectiveness because only input/output pairs were examined (Palmer and Finin 1990).
J90-3005
Additional features allowed the program to be adapted whenever the template design changed, allowed the scoring of subsets of slots and templates useful in linguistic phenomena testing (Chinchor 1991b), and allowed the merging of partial credit decisions across sites for more uniform scoring.

For instance, on the MUC-3 corpus the proper noun Jesuits was statistically a very good predictor of the set fill MURDER, due to numerous descriptions of one particular attack (Lewis 1991).
M91-1035
The second test was an analysis of the effect of discourse complexity on the performance of the MUC-4 systems (Hirschman 1992).
M92-1005
The third adjunct test showed that the "flat" template design of MUC-4 with cross references closely approximates an object-oriented template design, but that the object-oriented design allows the collection of additional performance data for diagnosis (Krupka and Rau 1992).
M92-1006
In glass-box evaluation, researchers have developed a parse evaluation methodology (Black et al.1991) that is now in use.

= (INC + SPU)/(NUMBER_POSSIBLE_INCORRECT) 6 A more detailed mathematical description of the evaluation metrics complete with examples can be found in Chinchor (1991a).

The systems scored higher on the simpler 11 The detailed results of the linguistic phenomena test experiment appear in the MUC-3 proceedings and contain the raw scores and plots of recall and precision (see Chinchor 1991b).
