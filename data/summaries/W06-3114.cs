We confirm the finding by Callison-Burch et al.(2006) that the rule-based system of Systran is not adequately appreciated by BLEU.

The shared task is a follow-up to the one we organized in the previous year, at a similar venue (Koehn and Monz, 2005).

Hence, we use the bootstrap resampling method described by Koehn (2004).
