In previous work (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), the definition of synchronous TAG derivation is given in a manner that requires multiple adjunctions at a single node.
C90-3045
The idea is formulated in its modern variant as selective-adjoining constraints (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985).
P85-1011
Space limitations preclude us from presenting the algorithm itself, but a full description is given elsewhere (Schabes and Shieber, 1992).

Statistical Parameters In a similar vein, the statistical parameters of a stochastic lexicalized TAG (SLTAG) (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992) specify the probability of adjunction of a given auxiliary tree at a specific node in another tree.

Such parsing rules, along with an extension that allows building of explicit derivation trees on-line as a basis for incremental interpretation, have been developed, and are presented in an extended version of this paper (Schabes and Shieber, 1992).
