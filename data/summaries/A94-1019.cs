With this aim in mind, we are currently investigating two novel research directions : firstly, a hybridisation of FASTR with a connectionist model dedicated to nominal composition (Jacquemin 1993) and, secondly, a cooperation between FASTR and LEXTER (Bourigault 1993) a tool for term acquisition through the filtering of part-of-speech patterns.

The denotation of a formula is an automaton calculated through an inductive interpretation of the terms it contains (Rounds and Manaster-Ramer 1987).

From these works, we have adopted the constraint of LTAG which states that rules must have at least one lexical frontier node together with the logical representation of Vijay-Shanker (1992) where rules are not restricted to immediate dependency.

The computational performances of the application reported in (Jacquemin 1994a) indicate that the parser only spends 10% of its time in generating metarules and fully justify the run-time approach.

Strzalkowski and Vauthey (1992) follow the way suggested by Sparck Jones and Tait (1984) at the end of their paper.

With this aim in mind, the definitions of term rules and metarules given in the preceding part can be transformed into logical (in)equations by using the formulae of Kasper and Rounds (1986).
P86-1038
Weisweber and Preu6 (1992) demonstrate that there is no difference in complexity between both approaches.

More details about this description are reported in (Jacquemin and Royaut6 1994).
P94-1027
The second one is the important extension of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) to a logical framework (Vijay-Shanker 1992) which contrasts with the traditional approach that operations in a TAG combine trees.
J92-4004
In Jacquemin (1994b), an algorithm for optimizing the determination of computational anchors is described.
