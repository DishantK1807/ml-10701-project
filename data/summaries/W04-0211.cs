Alto, CA 94304 {polanyi|culy|vdberg|thione}@fxpal.com, ahn@science.uva.nl Abstract 1 In this paper, we describe how the LIDAS System (Linguistic Discourse Analysis System), a discourse parser built as an implementation of the Unified Linguistic Discourse Model (U-LDM) uses information from sentential syntax and semantics along with lexical semantic information to build the Open Right Discourse Parse Tree (DPT) that serves as a representation of the structure of the discourse (Polanyi et al., 2004; Thione 2004a,b).

assignment of correct temporal, personal and spatial interpretation to utterances, which relies in large part on the relative location of referential expression and their 2 Complex default logic based reasoning as in Structured Discourse Representation Theory (Asher 1993; Asher and Lascarides 2003), speculations about the intentions or beliefs of speakers (as in Grosz and Sidner (1986)), or the intricate node labeling exercises familiar from Rhetorical Structure Theory (Mann and Thompson 1988; Marcu 1999, 2000) are not necessary.

The XLE tries to parse the input, and returns either a packed representation of all possible parses or the most probable parse as selected by its stochastic disambiguation component (Riezler et al.2002). If the XLE can not find a parse of the input as a complete sentence it tries to construct a sequence of partially parsed fragments.

In this paper, we describe discourse parsing under the Unified Linguistic Discourse Model (U-LDM) (Polanyi et al.2004). In particular, we describe the relationship between the output of sentential parsing and discourse processing.

In Polanyi et al.2004, a small set of robust rules is given for determining the attachment site and relationship of an incoming BDU-tree to the existing parse tree of the discourse.
