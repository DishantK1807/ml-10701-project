(Haruno et al., 1996) constructed collocations by combining a couple of strings 4 of high mutual information iteratively.

2.1 Extracting units of collocation (Nagao and Mori, 1994) developed a method to calculate the frequencies of strings composed of n characters(a grams).
C94-1101
(Smadja, 1993) proposed a method to retrieve collocations by combining bigrams whose cooccurrences are greater than a given threshold 3.
J93-1007
work Algorithms for retrieving collocations has been described (Smadja, 1993) (Haruno et al., 1996).

There has been a growing interest in corpus-based approaches which retrieve collocations from large corpora (Nagao and Mori, 1994), (Ikehara et al., 1996) (Kupiec, 1993), (Fung, 1995), (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996), (Smadja, 1993), (Smadja et al., 1996), (Haruno et al., 1996).
