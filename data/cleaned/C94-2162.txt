nec. corn.Abstract This paper describes how recent linguistic results in explaining Japanese short and long distance scram hling (:an be directly incorporated into an existing principles-and-parameters-based parser with only triviM modifications.
'.\['he fact that this is realizable on a parser originally designed for a fixed-word-order language, together with the fact thai; Japanese scrambling is complex, attests to the high degree of cross linguistic generalization present in the theory.
1 Introduction
l)uring the past several years, the phenomenon known as "sermnbling" has become a topic of some interest; it is of particular importance in languages like Get'man, Japanese, Korean and tlindi among others, its opposed to fixed-word-order languages like English.
Scrambling can pose both sever(', linguistic and cornpurational ditficulties for naturM language parsers.
This paper describes how these problems are dealt with in a Principles-and-I)aran3eters-based parser.
Japanese, at first glance, seems to permit fMrly-free permutation of objects: (I) Short distance (Vl'-internal) scrambling Ca) aohn-ga Mary-n! kono hon-o ageta (koto) t John gave this book to Mary (b),Iohn-ga kono hon-o Mary-n! ageta (koto) (2) Short (or medium)distance scrambling to IP (at) Mary-ga John-n! sono hon-o watasita (koto) Mary handed that book to John (b) SOIl() hon-o John-n!
Mary-ga watasita (koto) (e) .Iohn-ui sono hon-o Mary-ga watasita (koto) (3) Long distance scrambling Ca) 3ohn-ga Mary-ga sono hon o katta to omotte iru (koto) John thinks that Mary bought that book (13) sono hon-o,lohn-ga Mary-ga katta to olnotte iru (koto) *The author is deeply grateful to Iobert C.
Berwlck for his technical advice and comments.
(c) Mary-ga John-ga Bill-n! sono hon-o watasita~ to omotte iru (koto) Mary thinks John handed that book to Bill (d) Bill-n! sono hon-o Mary-ga,lohn-ga wata.sita to omotte iru (koto) (Exan3ple (l) is take.n from (Tada, 1993), and (2) and (3) from (Saito, 1985)).
To handle examples like these, computational linguists have sometimes adopted the straightforward strategy of adding permutation machinery on top of an existing formMism: for example, Becket el; M.(1990) augment the '\[¥ee Adjoining Grammar (TAG) systent using either: (1) multi-component (set-based) adjunct!on (Me-TAG), or (9) relaxed linear precedence (FO-TAG), I~o handle so-called "long distance" scrambling in German (that is, scrambling over clausal boundaries).
2 This
augmentation aims to directly repair the lack off pernmtation in ordinary TAGs by adding a mechanism that can (over)generate many different scramblings, llowever, as so often happens, when one turns to a richer sel; of exmnples in other languages, or the interaction of scrambling with other phenomena such as anaphor binding and weak crossover, things are not as simple as they appear and the straightforward solution breaks clown.
An altogether different appro~ch is t~ken in this pa per.
The goM is to produce an a nMysis of scrambling that works for different languages and a wider variety of examples wilhou! introducing new machinery.
The essential idea is to rely on the same (universal) constraints and parsing algorithms Mready in place for non-scramhling languages, e.g.
English. \[n other words, we adopt the null hypothesis.
So, we begin with a comImtationally-rnodelh:d linguistic framework that is already capable of handling scrambling as the dedm-tive result of interactions of basic principles, such as general movement (Move-c 0 with Binding theory.
The point is that scrambling (like the so-called i asmv ; and "dative" constructions) obeys the same i:estrictions ah'eady showu to be operative for other syntactic phenomena, and so shoukl follow from in1 (Salt, o, 1992) remarks that ko to %he fact.
that' is often added to avoid the unuagurahless resulting fl'om not having a topic in the main'ix clause.
2It was brought t,o lny attention by Doug Jones (personM coinmunlcation), l, hat German is normally considered to have only short, distance scrambling for technical reasons.
We will not explore this here, but note that none of die examples lu'e sented in (l-lecker et ah, 1990) inwJve "scramblillg" out of tensed clauses.

2.2 Scrambling
and Binding Our goal in this and the following sections is to reinterpret the data in terms of the implemented theory outlined above, and see how far we get.
Wc will point out any oddities and problems along tile way.
All examples are taken From (Saito, 1985) and have been verified to work on the parser unless otherwise stated.
(4) (a)* Kare<ga Mary-ga 3ohn<ni okutta tegami-o mada yonde inai (koto) s (b) Mau:y-ga,Iohnl-ni okutta tegami-o karei-ga mada yonde inai (koto) rl'he letter i;llat Mary sent to John, he has not yet read it (c)*?
Masaoga otagMi-no sensei-ni karerai-o syookaisita (koto) (d) Karera<o Masao-ga otag~G:-no sensei-ni t i syookaisita (koto) Themi, Masao introduced ti to each other/'s teachers 111 (!aeh case~ seral-ub\]illg the pronoun or anaphor saves the ungralnmatiea\] sentence.
(4a) is strMghtforwardly ruled out by Condition C of the Binding theory since 5As is conventional, sul)scrlpt indices will be used to mark coreference possibilities.
Roughly speaking, if two NPs have identical indices, then are said to denot, e the same object/person.
kate binds John.
(4c) and (4d) flora (Saito, 1992) are also handled by Binding theory.
In (4c) olagai is unbound which violates Condition A (all anaphors have to be A-bound).
In (4d) it is A-bound since we have assumed scrambling to A-positions.
Ilence, these data.
involving tile scrambling of anaphors and pronouns constitutes evidence that scrambled elements obey the usual principh;s.
2.3 Scrambling
and Weak Crossover Weak Crossover (WCO) effects are a well-known phenomenon in English.
For example: (5) (a) Whoi loves his i n\]other (b)* Who/ does hisi mother love ti (5a) can be interpreted as asking tile question for which.
person a:, x loves x's mother.
Crucially, (51)) cannot be interpreted as asking the question: for' which, person x, x's ?no/her loves x.
In the parser, the unavailability of (Sb) is explained by an LF principle, Ileanalyze Pro-l;'orms, which reanMyzes as variables those pro-rorms (e.g.
pronouns) hound by an operator in tm A-position, as suggested by the above logical analysis.
\[iowever, this fails when the pro-fbrm intervenes between the operator mid its trace, as is the case in (Sh).
(6) (a) Johni-o karei-no hahaoya-ga ti aisiteru Johni, his/ mother loves (10),}ohn-wa Mary-ga pro i yomu maeni son() honi-o yonda John read that hookl before Mary read it, i (r)*John-wa Mary-ga pry, yorml maeni done honi-o yonder lie Which book/did John read before Mary read iti (d) l)ono hon,.--o aohn-wa Mary-ga pro i yomu l\]\]aeni yollda 11o (e)# Soitui-no hahaoya-ga darei-o aisiteru no Whoi does %he guyi's' mother love (f) ? l)are<o soitui-no lmha.oya-ga li-o aisiteru no (g)*Karerai o Masao-ga otagaii-no sensei-ni llanako-ga ti hihausita t;(7 itta (koto) Them/, Masao said to each other/'s teachers that tlanako cril, icized ti (h)* Soitui-o hitome lnita hit() ga Mary-ga dare/o sukininaH to omotta no The person who took a ghmee at the guy/ thought that Mary would fa\]l in love with whol (i) * l)arei o soit;u<o hit.ome mira hito-ga Maryga li sukininaru to omotta no We note the following: 1004,, In (6@, John "crosses over" kar'e.

Let us define the obvious notion of "non-vacuous" or visible scrambling as scrambling that "passes over" one or more overt elements at S-strncture.
Adopting this definition immediately eliminates cases (a) (c), and more importantly, the repeated application of case (a) which causes parsing non-termination, la In partitular, this rules out vacnons scrambling over empty subjects, e.g. pro or PRO.
As far the data from (Saito, 1985),(1992) and ('I'ada, 1993) goes, this is no restriction at all.
This leaves case (d) which is vacuous only when considered as a "pair", i.e. each sub-instance is clearly non-vacuous.
We will make use of the following assumptions: 1.
Scrambling is always to the left.
2. Empty NPs don't scramble.
Again, judging from the data, these appear to be no restriction all.
Now, it, is simple to implement the non-vacuity (NV) constraint as a licensing condition on phrasal adjunction: IPi --+ sNP, IPi(x), {NV(x)} VP; ~sNP, VPi(x), {NV(z)} ltere, we assume that there are two phrasM adjnnction rules, for IP attd VP, that introduce scrambled NPs (sNPs).
14 Here, {NV(x)} is a semantic aelion which checks the frontier of x, the tP or VP phrase, for non-vacuity using the following left-to-right, two state machine: State 0: (Start) See an overt node, go to State 1.
State 1: (End) Skip until see an NP gap, halt.
Note this is potentially inefficient since the NV constraint is only checked when the LtUmachine completes the RHS of a rule, i.e. when it completes an IP or VP phrase.
By operating at the lew~l of the terminal string, instead of waiting for the complete IP or VP, laNote that the string w'tcuous empty operator movement showIl in (C) do(Is not count as an instance of scrambling.
It's not adjunction at VP or \[P.
14The tricky case of (d) shown earlier can be handled hy restricting sNP to overt NPs only.
we (:an take advantage of the fact; that scrambling is always to tile left to implement the non-vacuity check in ~ strictly left-to-right fashion.
As before, when we see a potentially scrambled NP, we start the two state machine.
Ilere, the basic idea is that a shift action (read a terminM) corresponds to the state 0 to state 1 transition.
Similarly, a NP-~,~ reduce action corresponds to the "see an NP gap and halt" part.
Con,paring the two algorithms on 50 Japanese sentences (25 scrambling examples) fi'om (Saito, 1985) & (Lasnik & Saito, 1984), an average speed-up factor of 2.3 per sentence and a total of 3.2 over the 50 sentences was observed for the second algorithm over just the phrase structure recovery portion.
Due to the varying effects from the participation of other principh'.s, the improvement for the total parsing time was le.ss clearcut, generally varying between no speed-up at all l;o a factor of two depending on the sentence.
Using the 25 non-scrambling examples fl'om the test set, an additional experiment hetween two variants of the parser, one with and one without the ability to handle scram bling, showed that the ability to handle scrambling exacts a penalty of about 30 50% in total parsing time, In conclusion, given tit(; pertlaps disproportionate el'feet of scrambling on parsing time, we suggest that although scrambling comes virtually for free linguistically speaking, the same certainly does not N)pear to be the case for computation.
