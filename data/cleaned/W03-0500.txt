1:15	PREFACE Welcome to the HLT/NAACL 2003 Workshop on Text Summarization.
2:15	It has been nine years since the first summarization workshop (in Dagstuhl in 1994); interest in summarization within the natural language processing and the information retrieval communities has been high ever since, leading to a succession of highly successful summarization workshops such as ACL/EACL 1997 (Madrid), the AAAI Spring Symposium 1998 (Stanford), ANLP/NAACL 2000 (Seattle), NAACL 2001 (Pittsburgh), SIGIR/DUC 2001 (New Orleans), and ACL/DUC 2002 (Philadelphia).
3:15	This is the second time that the workshop is run in a two-day format jointly with the Document Understanding Conference (DUC), an ongoing text summarization evaluation effort sponsored by the DARPA TIDES program.
4:15	The first day of the workshop will include presentations of 10 original scientific papers covering diverse areas of the summarization research spectrum.
5:15	The papers were selected from 13 submitted papers and include several new approaches to summary evaluation, new applications such as summarization of OCR'ed material, a survey of user requirements of summaries, and a new technique using compression for summarization.
6:15	These papers are published in the present proceedings.
7:15	The second day of the workshop focuses on the large-scale, competitive evaluation effort DUC.
8:15	These papers are published in Volume II.
9:15	This workshop would not be possible without the hard work of the authors, the DUC participants and the reviewers.
10:15	We would like to thank HLT and NAACL for hosting the workshop and DARPA for sponsoring the DUC evaluation.
11:15	And finally we would like to thank the program committee for helping assemble this excellent program.
12:15	We would finally like to thank two people in person: Eduard Hovy, the general conference chair and Dekang Lin, the local arrangements chair.
13:15	Without their commitment to the conference, this workshop might not have happened.
14:15	We hope you enjoy the workshop.
15:15	Drago and Simone, workshop co-chairs
