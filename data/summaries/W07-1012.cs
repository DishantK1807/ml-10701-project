Their system employed UMLS (Humphreys and Lindberg, 1993), GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), and GENA (Koike and Takagi, 2004) to further improve extraction.
W04-3102
BioNoculars is a relationship extraction system that based on a fully unsupervised technique suggested by (Hassan et al., 2006) to automatically extract protein-protein interaction from medical articles.
W06-1659
(Kazama et al., 2002) proposed a machine learning approach to BNE tagging based on support vector machines (SVM), which was trained on the GENIA corpus.
W02-0301
For POS tagging, a decision tree based tagger developed by (Schmid, 1994) was used in combination with a model, which was trained on a corrected/revised GENIA corpus provided by (Saric et al., 2004) and was reported to achieve 96.4% tagging accuracy (Saric et al., 2006).
P04-1025
(Yamamoto et al., 2003) proposed the use of morphological analysis to improve protein name tagging.
W03-1309
Rule-based systems (Fukuda et al., 1998; Hanisch et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003) that use dictionaries tend to exhibit high precision in tagging named entities but generally with lower tagging recall.
W03-1309
Without using other specific domain resources, the system achieves comparable results to some other state-of-the-art systems (Finkel et al., 2004; Settles, 2004) which resort to external knowledge, such as protein dictionaries.
W04-1221
Saric et al.developed a system to extract gene expression regulatory information in yeast as well as other regulatory mechanisms such phosphorylation (Saric et al., 2004; Saric et al., 2006).
P04-1025
(Collier et al., 2000) used a machine learning approach to protein name extraction based on a linear interpolation Hidden Markov Model (HMM) trained using bi-grams.
C00-1030
The approach uses an unsupervised graph-based mutual reinforcement, which depends on the construction of generalized extraction patterns that could match instances of relationships (Hassan et al., 2006).
W06-1659
Statistical approaches (Collier et al., 2000; Kazama et al., 2002; Settles, 2004) typically improve recall at the expense of precision, but are more readily retargetable for new nomenclatures and organisms.
