Corio and Lapalme (1998) have also presented results of a corpus study.

Whereas previous research has made this point convincingly for graphical and textual representations-particularly, for example, in the WIP (Andr4 et al.1993), COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993), and SAGE (Kerpedjiev et al.1997; Green, Carenini, and Moore 1998) systems--we take this further and demonstrate that the same commonalities extend to include overall page layout, an area that has not previously received sufficient attention.

realization. RST's functional orientation supported a further re-interpretation of RST in which rhetorical relations become plan operators for text construction (cf., Moore and Paris \[1993\]; Hovy \[1993\]).

The central components that are relevant are the automatic visualization engine (AVE: Section 2.1 and Kamps \[1998\]), the automatic page-layout component (APALO: Section 3), the natural language generator (KOMET: Bateman and Teich \[1995\] and Bateman, Teich, and Alexa \[1998\]), and the very large domain model (ca.

Conversely, simply placing textual and graphical information together is no guarantee that one view is supportive of another: if the perspective on the data taken in a graphic and that taken in a text have no relation (or, worse, even clash), then the result is incoherence rather than synergy--cf, the discussions by authors such as Arens, Hovy, and Vossers (1993), Fasciano and Lapalme (1996), Green et al.(1998), and Fasciano and Lapalme (2000).

RST suggests that only nuclei need be considered, while Cristea, Ide, and Romary (1998) refine this further and suggest that some nuclei plus a specified set of their satellites (those that are vein heads) is preferable.

In Bateman et al.(1998), we have shown this in terms more familiar to NLG by re-interpreting in dependency lattice terms some of the standard examples of aggregation discussed in the literature.

This has been used to good affect in systems such as CGS (Caption Generation System) of Mittal et al.(1998), where it is clearly crucial that the text and the graphic be in close correspondence.
