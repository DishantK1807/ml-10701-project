19:682	ABSTRACTS TESTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY OF A REPRESENTATIOrjAL MODEL, Dedre Gentner Bolt Beranek and Newrnan, Inc. A research program is described in which a partlcular zepresentational format for meaning is tested as broadly 3s pogsible.
20:682	In this format, developed by the LNR research group at The hiversity of California at San Diego, verbs are represented ab.
21:682	interconnected sets of subpredicates.
22:682	These subpredicates may be thought of as the almost inevitable inferences that a listener makes when a verb is used in a sentence.
23:682	They confer a meaning structure on the sentence in which the verb is used.
24:682	To be psychologically valid, these representations should capture (at least): Similari The more the more ty of meaning : similar two verbs their representati seem ons . in meaning should over to peopl-e, lap.
25:682	2.
26:682	Confusability: The more confusable two verb meanings are for people, the more their representations overlap.
27:682	3.
28:682	Memory for sentences containing the verb: The sentence structures set up by the verb's meaning should in part determine the way in which sentences are remembered Seman Lic integration : The representations should allow for the integration of information from different sentences into discou~se structure . Acquisition patterns: The structural partitions in correspond to the structures are learning the meanings of the representations sh0uJ.d children acquire when they the verbs 6.
29:682	Patterns of extension: The representations should be extendable so as to reflect the ways in which people interpret verb meanings when the verbs are used outside their norinal context.
30:682	7.
31:682	Reaction times: The time taken to comprehend a sentence using a given verb should reflect the structural complexity of the verb meaning . Experiments concerned with predictions 1 5 are described here.
32:682	The results are promisi~g for a general approach of representation of meaning in terms of interrelated subpredicates, but do not clearly distiaguish between several similar representations.
33:682	For example, to test prediction (Z), I read people sentences containing verbs with similar meanings, and asked them to recall the sentences.
34:682	The degree of overlap in the semantic structures was a good predictor of the number of confusions between sentences.
35:682	In ahother sentence-memory experiment (predict ion (3) ) semantically complex verbs that provided more unde~lying ~dterconnections between the nouns in a sentence led to bettdr memory fof the nouns in the sentence than simple general verbs, or than gther complex verbs that did not provide such extra interconnections.
36:682	To test prediction (5), I tested children's comprehension of a set of pos session verbs.
37:682	Both the order of acquisition among the verbs and the kinds of errors fitted well with an account of the acquisition of verb meaning in terms of interconnected subpredicates This research illustrates a breadth-first approach to testing a representation.
38:682	In the breadthirst: approach, many different psychological predictions are made.
39:682	Each different area of prediction requires a set of process assumptions, and in each case the process assumptions used are those that seem most plausible given previous research in the field.
40:682	If one rspresentational fomat can make correct predictions about a number of differenr: kinds of psychological phenomena, then that representation stands a greater chance of being generally useful than one which was tested in only one depth-first way.

48:682	50 Moulton Street Cambridge, b1R 07138 Researchers in li.nguistics, psychology and art if icii~l intcllfgence havc recently begun to abandon a *purely linguistic appruutlh to def initu ar~nphora (definitc pronouns and noun phrases.
49:682	Instcad they posit the notion nf rcfcrcncc!
50:682	into a modcl that a listcll~er/resdcr 1s sylzthcslzing fro* thc disronrcr: the referent of a definite anaphor is then not a linguistic object, but rather an entity in a model.
51:682	Such a model has been called a ''world of discourse" [levin & Goldman, 19781";a "ur~ivcrs~ of discourse" [Lyons 19781, al'discoutse nodel" [Nash-Webber 1977; Webber 19781 and a "domL~irx uf itzterprctatJ.ont1 [Stemling 19751, inter nlia, Its syntl~csis is what xnceresbs me.

52:682	What I shall discuss here are some feata~res of the text that aFfect what entities appear In a disc ours^ model and how such entitles are described.
53:682	In the course of presenting these features, I will argue that having an appropriate description for a discourse entity is critical to its successful reference later on.
54:682	I will then argue thaL recognizing formal aspects of the text is critical to the formulatioh of appropriate descriptions.
55:682	While this is not a sufficient cdhdition for successful reference, it is certainly a necessary one.
56:682	Representation of Individuals in S~~aantic Nets dohn Anderson Yale University Abstract Reseatch is reported concerned with how subjects process multiple refesrkng expressions+ In one experiment, subjects learn sentences such as: The smrwrt Russian cursed the salesgirl The smart Russian rescued the kitten The tall lawyer adopted the child Thk tall lawyer Caused the accident and only later learn that the smart Russian is the same person as the tall lawyer How do subjects integrate the information about the smart Ruqsian atkh information abgut the tall lawyer?
57:682	It is information subjects have set up two nodes in memory, one for each definite description.
58:682	Upon learning of the identity of the two descriptions, they introduce into memory a proposition indicating the identity of the two individual nodes.
59:682	They also start a process of copying infornation rum one node to the other node.
60:682	In effect, they choose to abandon one of the nodes.
61:682	It is argued that a similar process occurs when subjects recognize the referent of a definite descriptibn--but on a much shorter time scale.
62:682	So, suppose a subject hears: The first president of the United States was a bad husband, The proposal is that the subject creates a new node to represent the subject of that sentence, attaches to this node network structure to encode it is the first president of the United States, uses thfS network structure to guide a search of memory for the referent, finds a node corresponding to George Washington (GW), indicates that the new node and the GW node are the same, copies fromthe new node to the GW nbde the bad husband predicate, and abandons the nev node, Data is presented consistent with this process model for dealing with the referents of definite des,criptions.
63:682	Reference Diaries Herbert Ti.
64:682	Ciarb and Catherine Marshall Stanford University Standford CA Speakers and listenets are fotced to keep diaries about what they wow about each other because, to use or interpret a definite reference, they !I have to qssess the knowledge they ahare" with each other about the thing being referred to.
65:682	More prec?iseJ.y, it can be shm that the speaker and listener have to assess what is technically called their mutual knowledge about "the referent.
66:682	'Nnis, however, raises a striking paradax.
67:682	The assessment of muthal knowledne logically requires an infinity of separate tests, and if each test takes a finite amount of time, then people would take aq infinwe length of time to make or interpret'any definite refe~ence.
68:682	As a solutim to this problem, we argue, people use the heuristic of searching their diaries for an event that satisfies a condl'tion we call triple co-presence.
69:682	With such an event they can satisfy the infjhity of tests required by mutual knowledge in a single step.
70:682	We discuss the kinds of events that satisfy tripble co-presence, dnd we provide experimental evidence that when people cannot find such an event they are open to error in their intPs~re&ation of definite reference, Some pra5rrat I c constro i nts on the ~onstruct ion Sna in?-erpretd?ion of definite descriptions.

76:682	Bound Variables and Other Anaphors Barbara H. Partee ABSTRACT The aim of the paper is to delimit a subset of pronominal anaphora for which the logicians notion of bound variables gives the best account.
77:682	It can be argued that some cases of anaphora must be iewed this wav mrd some cases cannot be.
78:682	The clearest cases of bound variable anaphor& involve antecedents like every man and no man which are singuldr in form but da not refer to individuals.
79:682	But even with an antecedent 1 i ke John, an anaphoric pronoun must sometimes ukviewed as a bound variable to dccount for one of the readings (the so-called "sloppy identity" reading) of TI): (1 ) John was sure he would wjb, and so was Bi 11.
80:682	Bound variable anaphora wi 11 be cobtrasted with free "di scourse" anaphora; the differences between them suggest that the former is essentially a semantic phenomenon, the latter largely pragmatic.
81:682	The Use of Focus as a Tool for Disainbiguat ion of Definite Noun Phrases Candy Sidner NIT A1 Lab This paper will center on a djscussion of the use of focus in the interpretation of anaphoria noun phrases in discourse.
82:682	The need for focus will be discussed, and a description of focus shifting will be given.
83:682	Focus provides a means of representing the centra1 concept of a discourse.
84:682	The ways in which a definite noun phrase, specific or generic, can be used are constrained by its relation to the focus and by the ways in which the focus can be shifted.
85:682	The discussion of anaphoric defnps will present a taxonomy of cases, distinguished by the relation of the defnp to the focus, This taxonomy inclues several kinds of inference dependent cases.
86:682	The paper will concentrate discussing on the process of understandins defnps, and will present rules governing the ways a defnp can be used so that the hearer/reader can understand its co-referent . This paper will also distinguish reference, co-reference and internal reference, and point out the need Eor these distinctions in natural language research.
87:682	Barbara J, Grosz SRI Inter national Menlo Park, Cal i fo~ nia wnen cwo people talk they focus On only a mall portion of what each of them knows or believes.
88:682	Both what gets said and how it gets interpreted depend on this narrowing of attention to a comnon highlighted portion of knowledge.
89:682	One of the effects of understanding an utterance is to become focused on certain entities (relationships and object^) and on particular views of those entities.
90:682	A speaker provides a hearer with clues to what to lock at and how to look at it -what to focus on, how to focus on it, and how wide or narrow that focus sholrld be.
91:682	These clues may be 1 inguistic or they luay come from knowledge about the relationships among entities in the domain (the structure of the things being talked about) or from the environment in which the dialog occurs.
92:682	Linguistic cues may be either explicit, given directly by certain words, or imp1 icit, deriving from sentential structure or fror rhetorical relationships between sentences.
93:682	This paper examines focusing in dialog, discusses an initial representation in which focusing is based on domain structure cues, and examines from this perspective what other information and models are needed to extend the formalization of focusing to more general dialogs.
94:682	The importance of focllsing is illustrated by considering its role in the processes of under standing and generating definite descr iptions.
95:682	TOPIC LEVELS Joseph E. Grimes cornell Univetsuit Ithaca, N.Y. In order to interpret either a dialogue or a monologue,' some referential dements mqst be agreed on by the speaker and the hearer as a starting point.
96:682	This is the topic in me sense proposed by Searle and Gundel.
97:682	Even though the topic normally shifts away from its starting pint in the course of a text, whatever is being treated as topic in a particul ar part of the text receives special treatment in determining the expression to be used IeveJs of topic, global vd local, iri ~nglish conversation have been noted by Grosz.
98:682	They imply difPerent strategies for establishing the reference of pronouns.
99:682	It is useful to consider than in the light of two other languages,, ~onguda of Nigeria and ~acairi of Brazil, that distinguish topic from nontopic by their pronoun systems.
100:682	Finally, there is some evidence from both Greek and ~nglish that there may be more than two topic levels operating simu~taneously in nonconver sational texts.
101:682	ABSTRACT Toward a rational model of discourse comprehension J. L: Morgan Center for the Study of Reading and Department of Linguistics university of Illinois Models of discourse br text often treat connected discourse in a manner analogous to the treatment of sentences in traditional and generative grammar; i.e. as a formal.
102:682	object to be decoded by means of c~rtain formal operaaions.
103:682	I point out in this paper that even where this view is not explicitly proposed, it is often implicit.
104:682	Against this common view I argue that the only kind 05 discourse model that is likely to succeed is one that is built around two important hypotheses: first, that the key to d~scuurse comprehension is the attempt to infer the deta'ils of the plan that the speaker/ writer follows in constructing khe text; secondj that a large portion of the work of a discourse comprehension model should be derived from a theory of practical reasoning.
105:682	I will sketch the outline of a model (or more accurately, a ~chema for a large class of possible models) that incorporates these suggestions, pointing out the rdle of practical reasoning processes, and arguing that notoriously confused nottons like "gicves/'new1' and I1&xpected inforrna~ion~~ can wly be made sense of in such a model.
106:682	SOCIAL AND ~OGICAL GBECTS OF MEWING IN ?HE WAGE OF SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN David R. Qlson ontarlo Institute for Studies in Mucatlon Toronto, Canada f t is conventional to treat the meaning of an utterace in a discourse in terns of two components!
107:682	the ?ropositional component and the pragmatic or speech act component, the first indicating the meaning of the sentence, the secona r indicating its intended use.
108:682	by the speaker.
109:682	I shall present so111e arguments and evidence that these two systems are interdependent.
110:682	Roughly, it appears that social considerations, prharily status.
111:682	determine which a-cts of a proposition are lexicalized in the utterance.
112:682	Thus, a child with high status relative to his interlocutor may use a conunand, "Give me "a block", while if he has low status relative to his interlocutor he may use a request, "May I have a block"?
113:682	I he is an equal, a peer, (and perhaps only then) he will use an explicit true propsitian such as, "You have two more than me".
114:682	Only in this third case is the propositional meaning explicit in the sentence per ae, and only in this case is an a irmative or negative response dependent strictly upon truth conditions (rather than compliance, for example) . *is conception of the social aspects of meaning will be examined through an analysis of what is said vs. what is meant in Gome childch jld and teacher-child conversations, Paper prepared for ~heoret'i2al Issuesb in Natural Language Processing (TINLAP).

117:682	EFFET OF AUDIENCE AM) INTERACTION ON DISCOURSE MODELS Andee Rubin Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. Cambr idqe, Mass, Communication among people occurs in a vast vhr iety of settings frm reading a book to partiaipatiw in a conversation, from Pistening to a tape to reading a transcript of a lecture.
118:682	Most discussions of discour se, speech acts and d ialogue, however, consider a very par t icular kind of comnunicative situation: Eaae-to-f ace 3rd conversations between two participants in which there is a common spatial and temporal context.
119:682	Dialogues between a computer system and a person differ from this model along at least two dimensions: the modality of the interaction (current computer-person d ialogues are wr itten) and the lack of spatial cmnonal ity, indicated by the impssibil ity of comunicatirq with gestures and facial expressions.
120:682	The imp1 ications of these differehces for theories oE discourse are poorly understoodr Worse yet, they illusttate only a mall subset of the dimensions along which language experiences may vary, mat relevance do the theories we advance to account for these interchanges have for other communicative experiences such as listening to a lecture or reading a play?
121:682	This paper will focus on two other aspecfts of language experience which have consequences for the dialogue models we build: audience and the degree of 9nteraction.
122:682	In both situations described abdve, tne audience is a single other person (or systen) and interaction between the participants or even interrupti-on is immediate.
123:682	But in a book, for example, the audience is larae and not well defined and the boo^ s reader must adopt new strategies to cornpensate for the fact that interaction is impossible.
124:682	In a personal letter, on the other hand, the audience is a single other person, similar to the conversational situation.
125:682	Interaction, however, is impossible or at least attenuated; the reader can obtain clarifying information, but the time lapse will be significant.
126:682	I will consider in this paper where various lahguage experiences lie along these two ddnenaions and what the impiications of these differences are for models of discourse and dialogue.
127:682	On the Interdependence of Languagk and Perception David L. Waltz Coordinated Science Laboratory University of Illinois at ~rb@na/~hampaign Without a conneckion to the real world v&a perception, o language system cannot know what it is talking about.
128:682	Similarly, a perceptual system must have ways of expressing its autputs via a language (spoken, written, gestural or sthef).
129:682	The relationship between-perception and l~nguage is explored, with special attent lon to what implications results in language research have for our models of vision systems, and vice-versa.
130:682	It is suggested that early language learning is an especially fertile area Ior this exploration.
131:682	witkin this area, we argue that perceptual data is conceptualized prior to language acquisition according to largely innate strategies, tha~ this conceptualization is in terms of an internal, non-ambiguous "language," that language production from its beginnings to adulthood is a projection or the inte~nal Language which selects and highlights the most important portions of internal concepts, and that schemata produced in the sensory/motor world are evolved inso schemata to describe abstract worlds.

135:682	K:'c ci~u~t to raise sor;,e questions in the context of the representation of shapes of 8-D objects One way to get a hCindle on this prob@.m is to investigate whether labels of shapes mind the* acquiGtion reveals any striicture of attributes or cmpnents of shepes that might be used for representation purposes.
136:682	hother aspect of the puzzle of rcprescntation is the question whether the information is to be stored in analog or,rprapositionol form, and at what level this transformtion from analog to pmpsitional form takes place.
137:682	In genepal, sha-pe of a 3-D cornpact object has tsJo aspects: the surface aspect, md the volume aspect.
138:682	The surface aspect incLudes pmpsrties like concovit+y, convc.sj ty, pl,mcuxi ty of surIacas, edges, and cornws.

145:682	(1) I bought that pointing last Saturday.
146:682	A survey of types of pragmatic anaphora in English will then be used to show that the notion of "'figure" must encompass, a muck.
147:682	wider range of perceptual entities than commonly assumed.
148:682	Finally the implications for linguistic semantics, philosophy, percept la1 t-heory, and cognitive theory will be discussed (very tentative abstract) Language and Percept ion Zenon Pylyshyn University of Western Ontario A language comprehension system without a perceptual component would, in an important sense, not know what it was talking about even if it could carry on a sensible dialogue.
149:682	More significantly, a theory of comprehension would be seriously deficient if it did not relate linguistic representations to ones which derive from non-linguistic sources.
150:682	This bridge is necessary in order to explain how terms refer as well as to explain how language is acquired.
151:682	This paper will discuss and support the position that natural language learning is only possible because of the prior existence of menialese --a language-li ke system of representation for perceptual as we1 1 as more abstract conceptual contents.
152:682	How this comes into being cannot be given as an inforrnat3on processing explanation since it requires an account of the development of the underlying machine architecture--not of its langu3ge processing software ( e. interpreters).
153:682	SEMANTIC PRIMITIVES IN LANGUAGE AND VISION Yor ick Wilks Department of Language and Linguistics University of Essex England' ABSTRACT An argumeht is presented that, on the basis of the evidence at present available, there is no reason to believe that the semantic primitives required by natural language understanding have any basis or grounding in vision.
154:682	And, moreover, whatever may ultimately turn out to be the way we work, there is no reason to believe that trying to ground one sphere of A1 on the other language primitives on visual ones, would assise research in either area.
155:682	A number of systems of primitives are examined briefly in order to strengthen the above argument.
156:682	With a Spoon in my Hand this must be the Eating Erame Eugene Charniak Department of Computer Science Yale University ABSTRACT A language comprehension program using "Prames, " "scripts,I1 etc . n~ust be able to decide which frames arc appropriate to the text.
157:682	0iten there will be explicit indication ("Fred was playing tennis" suggests the TENNIS frame) but it is not always so easy.
158:682	("The steering wheel was hot, but Jack had to be home by 3" suggests DRIVING, but how)?
159:682	This paper will examine how a program might go about determining the appropriate frame in such cases.
160:682	The basic idea will be taken over from Minsky (1975) in that it will be assumed that or~c usually has one or more cogtext frames, so that one only needs worry 2f information comes in which doe,s not fit them.
161:682	As opposed to Minsky however the suggestions for new context frames will not come from the old ones, but rather directly from the conflict5ng.

204:682	Path-Based and Node-Based Inference in Semantic Mctworks>k Stuart C. Shapiro Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Buffalo Amherst?, New York 14226 ABSTRACT TWO styles of performing inference in semantic networks are presented and compared, Path-based inference allows an arc or a path or arcs between-two given nodes ko be inferieed from the existence of another specified path between the same two nodes.
205:682	Path-based inference rules may be written using a binary relational calculus notation.
206:682	Node-based inference allows a structure of nodes to be knferred Erom the existence gf an instance of a pattern of node structu~es.
207:682	Node-based inference rules can be constructed in a semantic network using a variant of a predicate calculus notation.
208:682	Path-based inference is more' efficient, while node-based inference is more genera,l. A method is described of combining the two styles in a single system in order to take advantage of the strengths of each.
209:682	Applications, of ~aeh-based inference rules to the representation of the extensional equivalence of intensional cohcepts, and to the explication of inheritance in hierarchies are sketched, ;'c Preliminary version of a paper to be presented at "Theoretical Issues in Natural Language Processing," the 1978 annual meeting of the Associatian for Computational Linguistics, UrbanalChampaign-, Illinois, Juw 25-27, 1978.
210:682	Processing of Inierences Rand Spiro and Joseph Esp~slco University of Illinois Abstract The I~ypothesis that pragmatic inferences @presented in ~ext are taken for granted, superficially processed, and not stably or enduring1 y represented in nlemory was invcstlgatcd.
211:682	Stories were read which in sorne contii t i~ns contained inforniation vitiating the iniplicational force of explicit1 inferences.
212:682	The vit iat fng informat ion was presented eittrqr before ofafter thc inferences.
213:682	In Experiment I, errors ir memory for the inferences were prevalent in th~ "aftert' but not the "beforet1 condition.
214:682	Two kinds of errors were made: saying the inference had not been presented in the story; or, if it was remembered as having been presented, alter~ng the specific content of the inference to produce the opposite f what was actually presented.
215:682	The latter errons produced coherence with tii'e vitiating information, and subjects were not able to differeptiate these errors from correct responses.
216:682	In Exp~riment~ 11, the results of Experiment I were replicated, ar~d a "spontaneous correction" interpretat ion was rejected.
217:682	The results of bath experimenlts combine to suppfct the hypothesis of superficial processing and unstable representat ion of expl ici t inferences.

315:682	S~rnulation and Modelling PROGRAMMSNC REA is easy!
316:682	!!?henyour REM system is operating in REV mode that is, executing a recognize or multi-write instruction the CPU thinks it is dolng a write operation.
317:682	The RE14 board converts it to the desired REM action For a recognize, the data written on the data bus by the CPU is a cornparand the Ctem to be recognized.
318:682	Further details axe given in the RE, Programmer's Manual, a copy of which is included at no charge with each order of 1 or more REV boards It takes only minutes to learn how to add REM operations to your repertoire if you are accustomed to programming machine language, assembly language, Bbsic, or what-have-you.
319:682	You can use any assembler with REM, since all the CPU is doing is executing a write instruction.
320:682	To make thing REM subroutin functions as s even .es for the 01 easier, complex lowing SEMIO1lICS has mitt REM operations, inc (all of which operat en a package luding such e in paralle all REM records) : Identify all records which have a specified character sequence Identify all records with zero (or all 1's) in specified byte position.
321:682	Compare (=,Z, or s) specified character string to specified field of all records, with responders Flagged.
322:682	Locate first responder (useful if there are multiple responders to a comparison) Erase specified byte of bit position in all records, or in all tagged records.
323:682	Count number of bits in given byte position which match specified byte (for all records in parallel).
324:682	Identify the record having maximum (or minimum) value in speci fied field.
325:682	(Very useful in sorting, or for reading out responders in desired logical sequence).
326:682	IJrite specified data (1 to 255 bytes long) in all flagged records.
327:682	(Very useful in sorting, of for reading out responders in desired logical sequence).
328:682	Increment (or decrement) specified field of all flagged records.
329:682	Add (or subtract) specified binary number (1 or 2 bytes) to (from) specified field of all flagged records.
330:682	Add two fields (or subtract) within all flagged records.
331:682	Move data from one field to another within all Lagged records.
332:682	Boolean operation on flages within all records The subroutine package for the 2-80 occupies 2K bytes of memory.
333:682	An 8080 version (which requires 3K bytes) is planned for release in July, and this will be followed by an Alpha Micro version if there is sufficient demand.
334:682	A higher level package for general applicati ~n in in ormation management is also in preparation.
335:682	With or without the subroutine package, yoq will find that programming for a REM system is far easier in most applications than for pre-REM computers.
336:682	Table loop-up becomes trivial, sorting and pattern recognition become easy.
337:682	You get more programming done in less time, and the programs qccupy less memory space and run faster.
338:682	And you are able to do more.
339:682	Information systems can be morc flexible.
340:682	REM makes it feasible to bring new sophistication into such areas as data base management, language data pr~cessing, and artificial intelligence.

491:682	It describes the use of Rhis cfictionary both by translatots in the course of their vjork and by the irr~rinologcs~s responsible for updating and maintaining it.
492:682	This discussion is placed in the context of the overall effort (known as the target Project) to provide attls to translators.
493:682	A final seclion presents the solution to the problem of representation bf term equivalence adopted in Target.
494:682	1.
495:682	The -Target ----Project ----Tarfict -is an intcrdi~~ciplinary research project undertaken jointly by the Translation Center and the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie-Mellon University to invcstlgate ana develop computer aids for langua~e translation.
496:682	Sincc high quality automatic trdnslat ion does not seem to be immediately realizable, our efforts at introducing computerizahon into the translation task have been directed towards providing practical aids for translators.
497:682	Workin6 with the assumptioil that each t ran5lator ca'n be provided with a standard video terminal connected by a dial-up line to a remote c~ornputing facility,2 we are exploring primarily two aids.
498:682	They are (1) an interactive multilineual dic tidary.
499:682	and (2) an environment consisting of (1) plus text rnar\iptrlation facilities within a windowed page editing environment.
500:682	The latter research will be described in a future AJCL paper; this document justifies and descrihrs only the former, how it ii accessed and how it is built up and maintained.

502:682	This may include unsi~crcssful searches in several tfictionaries, partly because these dictionaries are out of date by ttie time ttiey are publisli~d. An interactive computerized dictionary would provide effectively '%mmediatcw access to entries and moreover could be kept constantly updated at the central computing' facll~ty.

505:682	The next section shows in some deta~l how a translalor would access the dictionary and ck~termine a correct eqirivalcnt The section after that describes the facilities used to maititain and augment ttic d~ctionary The interface to the dictionary described in the nc.xt two sections reprr~~ents the fruits of continual close cooperatioh over an extenclcd period of trme brtween researchers from the Computer Science Department and from the Department of Modrr6n Languages Such coopc"ration, while it presents many problems initially, is a sine qttn nor1 of success in a venture such as Target.

507:682	Moreover, it was found to be less efficient than another method which was investigated and ult inlatcly adopted.
508:682	Some arg~rrncnts proposed for adopting this different method are set fortli In the final section of this document 2.
