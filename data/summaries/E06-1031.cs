Examples of such methods are the introduction of information weights as in the NIST measure or the comparison of stems or synonyms, as in METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).
W05-0909
The introduction of smoothing (Lin and Och, 2004) solves this problem only partially.
C04-1072
Details on this have been described in (Leusch et al., 2005).
W05-0903
As the BLEU score is unsuitable for sentence level evaluation in its original definition, BLEU-S smoothing as described by (Lin and Och, 2004) is performed.
C04-1072
State-of-the-art measures such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) or NIST (Doddington, 2002) aim at measuring the translation quality rather on the document level1 than on the level of single sentences.
