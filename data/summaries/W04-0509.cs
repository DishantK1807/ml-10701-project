Semantic Classes in Medical Text 2.1 Diseases and Medications The identification of named entities (NEs) in the biomedical area, such as PROTEINS and CELLS,has been extensively explored; e.g., Lee et al.(2003), Shen et al.(2003). However, we are not aware of any satisfactory solution that focuses on the recognition of semantic classes such as MEDICATION and DISEASE.

Pang et al.(2002) did not compare the result of using and not using the negation context effect, so it is not clear how much it improved their result.

In our earlier work (Niu et al., 2003), we showed that current technologies for factoid question answering (QA) are not adequate for clinical questions, whose answers must often be obtained by synthesizing relevant context.

The way they were added is similar to incorporating the negation effect described by Pang et al.(2002). But instead of just finding a “negation word” (not, isn’t, didn’t, etc.), we need to find two groups of words: those indicating more and those indicating less.
