Abstract 
We present results of two methods for assessing 
the event profile of news articles as a function 
of verb type. The unique contribution of this 
research is the focus on the role of verbs, rather 
than nouns. Two algorithms are presented and 
evaluated, one of which is shown to accurately 
discriminate documents by type and semantic 
properties, i.e. the event profile. The initial 
method, using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990), 
produced nmltiple cross-classification of arti
cles, primarily due to the bushy nature of the 
verb tree coupled with the sense disambiguation 
problem. Ore" second approach using English 
Verb Classes and Alternations (EVCA) Levin 
(1993) showed that monosemous categorization 
of the frequent verbs in WSJ made it possible to 
usefully discriminate documents. For example, 
our results show that articles in which commu
nication verbs predominate tend to be opinion 
pieces, whereas articles with a high percentage 
of agreement verbs tend to be about mergers or 
legal cases. An evaluation is performed on the 
results using Kendall's 7. We present convinc
ing evidence for using verb semantic classes as 
a discriminant in document classification. 1 
1 Motivation

We present techniques to characterize document 
type and event by using semantic classification 
of verbs. The intuition motivating our research 
is illustrated by an examination of the role of

nouns and verbs in documents. The listing be
low shows the ontological categories which ex
press the fundamental conceptual components 
of propositions, using the framework of Jack
endoff (1983). Each category permits the for
mation of a wh-question, e.g. for \[THING\] "what 
did you buy?" can be answered by the noun 
% fish". The wh-questions for \[ACTION\] and 
\[EVENT\] can only be answered by verbal con
structions, e.g. in the question "what did you 
do?", where the response must be a verb, e.g. 
jog, write, fall, etc. 
\[THING\] \[DIRECTION\] \[ACTION) \[PLACE\] \[MANNE.\] \[EVENT\] 
\[aMOUNT\] 
The distinction in the ontological categories 
of nouns and verbs is reflected in information ex
traction systems. For example, given the noun 
phrases fares and US Air that occur within a 
particular article, the reader will know what the 
story is about, i.e. fares and US Air. However, 
the reader will not know the \[EVENT\], i.e. what 
happened to the fares or to US Air. Did airfare 
prices rise, fall or stabilize? These are the verbs 
most typically applicable to prices, and which 
embody the event. 
1.1 Focus
on the Noun 
Many natural language analysis systems focus 
on nouns and noun phrases in order to identify 
information on who, what, and where. For ex
ample, in summarization, Barzilay and Elhadad 
(1997) and Lin and Hovy (1997) focus oll multi
word noun phrases. For information extraction 
tasks, such as the DARPA-sponsored Message 
Understanding Conferences (1992), only a few 
projects use verb phrases (events), e.g. Ap
pelt et al. (1993), Lin (1993). In contrast, the 
named entity task, which identifies nouns and 
noun phrases, has generated numerous projects 
as evidenced by a host of papers in recent con
ferences, (e.g. Wacholder et al. 1997, Pahner 
and Day 1997, Neumann et al. 1997). Although 
rich infbrmation on nominal participants, ac
tors, and other entities is provided, the nmned 
entity task provides no information on what 
happened in the document, i.e. the event or 
action. Less progress has been made on ways 
to utilize verbal information efficiently. In ear
lier systems with stemming, many of the verbal 
and nonfinal forms were conflated, sometimes 
erroneously. With the development of more so
phisticated tools, such as part of speech taggers, 
more accurate verb phrase identification is pos
sible. We present in this paper an effective way 
to utilize verbal information for document type 
discrimination. 
1.2 Focus
on the Verb 
Our initial observations suggested that both oc
currence and distribution of verbs in news arti
cles provide meaningful insights into both ar
ticle type and content. Exploratory analysis 
of parsed Wall Street Journal data 2 suggested 
that articles characterized by movement verbs 
such as drop, plunge, or fall have a different 
event profile from articles with a high percent
age of" communication verbs, such as report, say, 
comment, or complain. However, without asso
ciated nominal arguments, it is imt)ossible to 
know whether the \[THING\] that drops refers to 
airfare prices or projected earnings. 
In this paper, we assume that the set of verbs 
in a docmnent, when considered as a whole, can 
be viewed as part of the conceptual map of the 
events and action in a docmnent, in the same 
way that the set of nouns has been used as a 
concept map for entities. This paper reports on 
two methods using verbs to determine an event 
profile of the document, while also reliably cat
egorizing documents by type. Intuitively, the 
event profile refers to the classification of an ar
ticle by the kind of event. For example, the 
article could be a discussion event, a reporting 
event, or an argument event. 
To illustrate, consider a smnple article from 
WS.I of average length (12 sentences in length) 
with a high percentage of communication verbs. 
The profile of the article shows that there are 
19 verbs: 11 (57%) are communication verbs, 
including add, report, say, and tell. Other

681 
verbs include be skeptical, carry, pTvduce, and 
close. Representative nouns include Polaroid 
Corp., Michael Ellmann, Wertheim Schwder ~4 
Co., PT~zdential-Bache, savings, operating re
sults, gain, revenue, cuts, profit, loss, sales, an
alyst, and spokesman. 
In this case, the verbs clearly contribute in
formation that this article is a report with 
more opinions than new facts. The prepon
derance of communication verbs, coupled with 
proper noun subjects and human nouns (e.g. 
spokesman, analyst) suggest a discussion arti
cle. If verbs are ignored, this fact would be 
overlooked. Matches on frequent nouns like gain 
and loss do not discriminate this article from 
one which announces a gain or loss as breaking 
news; indeed, according to our results, a break
ing news article would feature a higher percent
age of motion verbs rather than verbs of com
mmfication. 
1.3 On
Genre Detection 
Verbs are an important factor in providing an 
event profile, which in turn might be used in cat
egorizing articles into different genres, fleming 
to the literature in genre classification, Biber 
(1989) outlines five dimensions which can be 
used to characterize genre. Properties for dis
tinguishing dimensions include verbal features 
such as tense, agentless passives and infinitives. 
Biber also refers to three verb classes: private, 
public, and suasive verbs. Karlgren and Cut
ting (1994) take a comtmtationally tractable set 
of these properties and use them to compute a 
score to recognize text genre using discriminant 
analysis. Tlm only verbal feature used in their 
study is present-tense verb count. As Karlgren 
and Cutting show, their techniques are effective 
in genre categorization, but, they do not claim 
to show how genres differ. Kessler et al. (1997) 
discuss some of the complexities in automatic 
detection of genre using a set of computation
ally efficient cues, such as punctuation, abbrevi
ations, or presence of Latinate suffixes. The tax
onomy of genres and facets developed in Kessler 
et al. is useful for a wide range of types, such 
as found in the Brown corpus. Although some 
of their discriminators could be useful for news 
articles (e.g. presence of second person pronoun 
tends to indicate a letter to the editor), the in
dicators do not appear to be directly applicable 
to a finer classification of' news articles. 
News articles can be divided into several stan
dard categories typically addressed in journal
ism textbooks. We base our article category 
ontology, shown in lowerca~se, on Hill and Breen 
(1977), in uppercase: 
1. FEATURE STORIES : feature; 
2. INTER~PR.ETIVE STORIES: editorial, opinion, report; 
3. PROFILES; 
4. PRESS RELEASES: announcements, mergers, legal cases; 
5. OBITUARIES; 
6. STATISTICAL INTERPRETATION: posted earnings; 
7. ANECDOTES; 
8. OTHER: poems. 
The goal of our research is to identify the 
role of verbs, keeping in mind that event profile 
is but one of many factors in determining text 
type. In our study, we explored the contribu
tion of verbs as one factor in document type dis
crimination; we show how article types can be 
successfully classified within the news domain 
using verb semantic classes. 
2 Initial
Observations 
We initially considered two specific categories of 
verbs in the corpus: communication verbs and 
support verbs. In the WSJ corpus, the two most 
common main verbs are say, a communication 
verb, and be, a support verb. In addition to 
say, other high frequency comnmnication verbs 
include report, announce, and state. In journal
istic prose, as seen by the statistics in Table l, 
at least 20% of the sentences contain commu
nication verbs such as sap and announce; these 
sentences report point of view or indicate an 
attributed comment. In these cases, the subor
dinated complement represents the main event, 
e.g. in "Advisors announced that IBM stock 
rose 36 points over a three year period," there 
are two actions: announce and rise. In sen
tences with a communication verb as main verb 
we considered both the main and the subor
dinate verb; this decision augmented our verb 
count an additional 20% and, even more im
portantly, further captured information on the 
actual event in an article, not just the commu
nication event. As shown in Table 1, support 
verbs, such as go ("go out of business") or get 
("get along"), constitute 30%, and other con
tent verbs, such as fall, adapt, recognize, or vow, 
make up the remaining 50%. If we exclude all 
support type verbs, 70% of the verbs yield in
formation in answering the question "what hap
pened?" or "what did X do?" 
3 Event
Profile: WordNet and EVCA 
Since our first intuition of the data suggested 
that articles with a preponderance of verbs of

a certain semantic type might reveal aspects of 
document type, we tested the hypothesis that 
verbs could be used as a predictor in provid
ing an event profile. We developed two algo~ 
rithms to: (1) explore WordNet (WN-Yerber) 
to cluster related verbs and build a set of verb 
chains in a document, much as Morris and Hirst 
(1991) used Roget's Thesaurus or like Hirst and 
St. Onge (1998) used WordNet to build noun 
chains; (2) classify verbs according to a se
mantic classification system, in this case, us
ing Levin's (1993) English Verb Classes and 
Alternations (EVCA-Verber) as a basis. For 
source material, we used the manually-parsed 
Linguistic Data Consortium's Wall Street Jour
nal (WSJ) corpus from which we extracted main 
and complement of communication verbs to test 
the algorithms on. 
Using WordNet. Our first technique was 
to use WordNet to build links between verbs 
and to provide a semantic profile of the docu
ment. WordNet is a general lexical resource in 
which words are organized into synonym sets, 
each representing one underlying lexical concept 
(Miller et al. 1990). These synonym sets or 
synsets are connected by different semantic 
relationships such as hypernymy (i.e. plunging 
is a way of descending), synonymy, antonymy, 
and others (see Fellbaum 1990). The determina
tion of relatedness via taxonomic relations has a 
rich history (see Resnik 1993 for a review). The 
premise is that words with similar meanings will 
be located relatively close to each other in the 
hierarchy. Figure 1 shows the verbs cite and 
post, which are related via a common ancestor 
inform, ..., let know. 
The WN-Verber tool. We used the hypernym 
relationship in WordNet because of its high cow 
erage. We counted the number of edges needed 
to find a common ancestor for a pair of verbs. 
Given the hierarchical structure of WordNet, 
the lower the edge count, in principle, the closer 
the verbs are semantically. Because WordNet 
common ancestor 
inform ..... let know

Figure 1: Taxonomic Relations for cite and post 
in WordNet. 
allows individual words (via synsets) to be the 
descendent of possibly more than one ances
tor, two words can often be related by more 
than one common ancestor via different paths, 
possibly with the same relationship (grandpar
ent and grandparent, or with different relations 
(grandparent and uncle). 
Results from WN-Verber. We ran all m'ti
cles longer than 10 sentences in the WSJ cor
pus (1236 articles) through WN-Verber. Output 
showed that several verbs e.g. go, take, and 
sayparticipate in a very large percentage of 
the high fi'equency synsets (approximate 30%). 
This is due to the width of the verb forest in 
WordNet (see Fellbaum 1990); top level verb 
synsets tend to have a large number of descen
dants which are arranged in fewer generations, 
resulting in a flat and bushy tree structure. For 
example, a top level verb synset, inform, ..., 
give information, let know has over 40 children, 
whereas a similar top level noun synset, entity, 
only has 15 children. As a result, using fewer 
than two levels resulted in groupings that were 
too limited to aggregate verbs effectively. Thus, 
for our system, we allowed up to two edges to in
tervene between a common ancestor synset and 
each of the verbs' respective synsets, as in Fig
ure 2.

Figure 2: Configurations for relating verbs in 
our system. 
In addition to the problem of the fiat na
ture of the verb hierarchy, our results from 
WN-Verber are degraded by ambiguity; similar 
effects have been reported for nouns. Verbs with 
differences in high versus low frequency senses 
caused certain verbs to be incorrectly related; 
683 
for example, have and drop are related by the 
synset meaning "to give birth" although this 
sense of drop is rare in WSJ. 
The results of WN-Verber in Table 2 reflect 
the effects of bushiness and ambiguity. The five 
most frequent synsets are given in colmnn 1; col
umn 2 shows some typical verbs which partici
pate in the clustering; column 3 shows the type 
of article which tends to contain these synsets. 
Most articles (864/1236 = 70%) end up in the 
top five nodes. This illustrates the ineffective
hess of these most frequent WordNet synset to 
discriminate between article types.

Evaluation using Kendall's Tau. We 
sought independent confirmation to assess the 
correlation between two wtriables' rank for 
WN-Yerber results. To ewfluate the effects of 
one synset's frequency on another, we used 
Kemtall's tau (~-) rank order statistic (Kendall 
1970). For example, was it the case that verbs 
under the synset act tend not to occur with 
verbs under the synset think? If so, do at
ticles with this property fit a particular pro
file? In our results, we have information about 
synset frequency, where each of the 1236 arti
cles in the corpus constitutes a sample. Ta
ble 3 shows the results of calculating Kendall's 
7with considerations for ranking ties, for all 
(~0) = 45 pairing combinations of the top 10 
most frequently occurring synsets. Correlations 
can range from -1.0 reflecting inverse correla
tion, to +1.0 showing direct correlation, i.e. tile 
presence of one class increases as tile presence 
of the correlated verb class incre~es. A r value 
of 0 would show that the two variables' values 
are independent of each other. 
Results show a significant positive correlation 
between the synsets. The range of correlation 
is from .850 between the communication verb 
synset (give, get, inform, ...) and the act verb 
synset (have, relate, give, ...) to .238 between 
the think verb synset (plan, study, give, ...) and 
the change state verb synset (fall, come, close, 
...). 
These correlations show that frequent synsets 
do not behave independently of each other and 
thus confirm that the WordNet results are not 
an effective way to achieve document discrim
ination. Although the WordNet results were 
not discriminatory, we were still convinced that 
our initial hypothesis on the role of verbs in 
determining event profile was worth pursuing. 
We believe that these results are a by-product 
of lexical ambiguity and of the richness of the 
WordNet hierarchy.

Utilizing EVCA. A different approach to 
test the hypothesis was to use another semantic 
categorization method; we chose the semantic 
classes of Levin's EVCA as a basis for our next 
analysis, a Levin's seminal work is based on the 
time-honored observation that verbs which par
ticipate in similar syntactic alternations tend to 
share semantic properties. Thus, the behavior 
of a verb with respect to the expression and in
terpretation of its arguments can be said to be, 
in large part, determined by its meaning. Levin 
has meticulously set out a list of syntactic tests 
(about 100 in all), which predict membership in 
no less than 48 classes, each of which is divided 
into numerous sub-classes. The rigor and thor
oughness of Levin's study permitted us to en
code our algorithm, EVCA-Yerber, on a sub-set

of the EVCA classes, ones which were frequent 
in our corpus. First, we manually categorized 
the 100 most frequent verbs, as well as 50 addi
tional verbs, which covers 56% of the verbs by 
token in the corpus. We subjected each verb to 
a set of strict linguistic tests, as shown in Ta
ble 4 and verified primary verb usage against 
the corpus.

Table 4: EVCA verb class test 
Results from EVCA-Verber. In order to be 
able to compare article types and emphasize 
their differences, we selected articles that had 
the highest percentage of a particular verb class 
from each of the ten verb classes; we chose five 
articles fl'om each EVCA class, yielding a to
tal of 50 articles for analysis from the full set 
of 1236 articles. We observed that each class 
discriminated between different article types as 
shown in Table 5. In contrast to Table 2, tile ar
ticle types are well discriminated by verb class. 
For example, a concentration of communica
tion class verbs (say, report, announce, ... ) in
dicated that the article type was a general an
nouncement of short or medium length, or a 
longer feature article with many opinions in the 
text. Articles high in motion verbs were also 
announcements, but differed from the commu
nication ones, in that they were commonly post
ings of company earnings reaching a new high 
or dropping from last quarter. Agreement and 
argument verbs appeared in many of the same 
articles, involving issues of some controversy. 
However, we noted that articles with agreement 
verbs were a superset of the argument ones in 
that, in our corpus, argument verbs did not ap
pear in articles concerning joint ventures and 
mergers. Articles marked by causative class 
verbs tended to be a bit longer, possibly re
fleeting prose on both the cause and effect of 
684 
a particular action. We also used EVCh-Verber 
to investigate articles marked by the absence of 
members of each verb class, such as articles lack
ing any verbs in the motion verb class. However, 
we found that absence of a verb class was not 
discriminatory.

Evaluation of EVCA verb classes. To 
strengthen the observations that articles domi
nated l)y verbs of one class reflect distinct arti
cle types, we verified that the verb classes be
hayed independently of each other. Correlations 
for EVCA classes are shown in Table 6. These 
show a markedly lower level of correlation be
tween verb classes than the results for WordNet 
synsets, the range being fl'om .265 between mo
tion and aspectual verbs to -.026 for motion 
verbs and agreement verbs. These low values 
of r tbr pairs of verb classes reflects the inde
pendence of the classes. For exmnple, the com
munication and experience verb (:lasses are 
weakly correlated; this, we surmise, m~y be due 
to tile ditferent ways opinions can be expressed, 
i.e. as factual quotes using communication 
class verbs or as beliefs using experience class 
verbs.

4 Results
and Future Work. 
Basis for WordNet and EVCA compari
son. This paper reports results from two ap
proaches, one using WordNet and other based 
685 
on EVCA classes. However, the basis tor com
parison must be made explicit. In the case 
of WordNet, all verb tokens (n = 10K) were 
considered in all senses, whereas in the case of 
EVCA, a subset of less ambiguous verbs were 
manually selected. As reported above, we cov
ered 56% of the verbs by token. Indeed, when 
we attempted to add more verbs to EVCA cat
egories, at the 59% mark we reached a point of 
difficulty in adding new verbs due to ambigt> 
ity, e.g. verbs such as get. Thus, although our 
results using EVCA are revealing in ilnportant 
ways, it nmst be emt>hasized that the compar
ison has some imbalance which puts WordNet 
in an unnaturally negative light. In order to ac
curately compare the two approaches, we would 
need to process either the same less ambiguous 
verb subset with WordNet, or the full set of all 
verbs in all senses with EVCA. Although the re
sults ret)orted in this paper permitted the vali
dation of our hypothesis, unless a fair compari
son l)etween resources is pertbrmed, conclusions 
about WordNet as a resource, versus EVCA class 
distinctions should not be inferred. 
Verb Patterns. In addition to considering 
verb type frequencies in texts, we have observed 
that verb distribution and patterns might also 
reveal subtle information in text. Verb (:lass dis
tribution within the document and within par
ticular sub-sections also carry meaning. For ex
mnplc, we have observed that when sentences 
with movement verbs such as rise or fall are fol
lowed by sentences with cause and then a telic 
aspectual verb such as reach., this indicates that 
a value rose to a certain point due to the actions 
of some entity. Identification of such sequences 
will enable us to assign flmctions to particular 
sections of contiguous text in an article, in much 
the same way that text segmentation program 
seeks identify topics from distributional vocal> 
ulary (Hearst, 1994; Kan et al., 1998). Wc can 
also use specific sequences of verbs to help in 
determining methods for performing semantic 
aggregation of individual clauses in text gener
ation for summarization. 
Future Work. Our plans m:e to extend the 
current research in terms of verb (:overage and 
in terms of article coverage. I, br verbs, we plan 
to (1) increase tile verbs that we (:over to include 
phrasal verbs; (2) increase coverage of verbs 
by categorizing additional high fl'equency verbs 
into EVCA classes; (3) examine the effects of 
increased coverage on determining article type. 
For articles, we plan to explore a general parser 
so we can test our hypothesis on additional texts 
and examine how our conclusions scale up. Fi
nally, we would like to combine our techniques 
with other indicators to form a more robust sys
tem, such as that envisioned in Biber (1989) or 
suggested in Kessler et al. (1997). 
Conclusion. We have outlined a novel ap
proach to document analysis for news articles 
which permits discrimination of the event pro
file of news articles. The goal of this research is 
to determine the role of verbs in document anal
ysis, keeping in mind that event profile is one of 
many factors in determining text type. Our re
sults show that Levin's EVCA verb classes pro
vide reliable indicators of article type within the 
news domain. We have applied the algorithm to 
WSJ data and have discriminated articles with 
five EVCA semantic classes into categories such 
as features, opinions, and announcements. This 
approach to document type classification using 
verbs has not been explored previously in the 
literature. Our results on verb analysis coupled 
with what is already known about NP identi
fication convinces us that future combinations 
of information will be even more successful in 
categorization of docmnents. Results such as 
these are useful in applications such as passage 
retrieval, summarization, and information ex
traction.
