Some applications that would benefit from knowing this distinction are machine translation (Imamura et al., 2003), finding paraphrases (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005), (multilingual) information retrieval (Melamed, 1997a), etc.

The head dependence is measured as the amount of entropy observed among the co-occurring verbs for a given PP as suggested in (Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Baldwin, 2005).

H(Ts|s) = − summationdisplay t∈Ts P(t|s)logP(t|s) (1) This measure is equivalent to translational entropy (Melamed, 1997b).

For each candidate triple, the log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993) and salience (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001) scores were calculated.

Alignments have been produced for both translation directions (source to target and target to source) on tokenized plain text.3 We also used a well-known heuristics for combining the two directional alignments, the so-called refined alignment (Och et al., 1999).

Merlo and Leybold (2001) used the head dependence as a diagnostic to determine the argument (or adjunct) status of a PP.
