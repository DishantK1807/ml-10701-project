Banko and Moore (2004) showed that unsupervised tagger accuracies on English degrade from 96% to 77% if the lexicon is not constrained such that only high frequency tags exist in the POS-set for each word.

We use the algorithm as described in (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2005b), which adapts the algorithm to structured output problems.

(Habash and Rambow, 2005) argue that the rich morphology of Arabic necessitates the use of a morphological analyzer in combination with POS tagging.

In supervised POS tagging, (Diab et al., 2004) achieves high accuracy on MSA with the direct application of SVM classi ers.

(Duh and Kirchhoff, 2005a)) or by tuning on a labeled development set; for resource-poor languages, however, no such set may be available.
W05-0708
Although previous research in unsupervised tagging have achieved high accuracies rivaling supervised methods (Kupiec, 1992; Brill, 1995), much of the success is due to the use of arti cially constrained lexicons.
