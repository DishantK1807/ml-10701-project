This graph was originally used for lexical acquisition, since clusters of words in the graph often map to recognized semantic classes with great accuracy (> 80%, (Widdows and Dorow, 2002)).

We focus on a particular class of idioms that can be extracted using lexicosyntactic patterns (Hearst, 1992), which are fixed patterns in text that suggest that the words occurring in them have some interesting relationship.
C92-2082
Even for semantically predictable phrases, the fact that the words occur in fixed patterns can be very useful for the purposes of disambiguation, as demonstrated by (Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
In the work of Smadja (1993) on extracting collocations, preference was given to constructions whose constituents appear in a fixed order, a similar (and more generally implemented) version of our assumption here that asymmetric constructions are more idiomatic than symmetric ones.

Prior work in discovering non-compositional phrases has been carried out by Lin (1999) and Baldwin et al.(2003), who also used LSA to distinguish between compositional and noncompositional verb-particle constructions and nounnoun compounds.

This technique was used successfully by (Cederberg and Widdows, 2003) to improve the accuracy of hyponymy extraction.

For extracting semantic relationships, Figure 5: Directed graph showing that life-events are usually ordered temporally when they occur together Cederberg and Widdows (2003) demonstrated that nounphrase chunking does this work very satisfactorily, while being much more tractable than full parsing.

Such hierarchical examples are quite sparse, and greater coverage was later attained by Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998) in extracting relations not of hierarchy but of similarity, by finding conjunctions or co-ordinations such as “cloves, cinammon, and nutmeg” and “cars and trucks.” This work was extended by Caraballo (1999), who built classes of related words in this fashion and then reasoned that if a hierarchical relationship could be extracted for any member of this class, it could be applied to all members of the class.
P98-2182 P99-1016 W97-0313
This technique can often mistakenly reason across an ambiguous middle-term, a situation that was improved upon by Cederberg and Widdows (2003), by combining pattern-based extraction with contextual filtering using latent semantic analysis.

When applied to the whole of the BNC, these links can be aggregated to form a graph with 99,454 nodes (nouns) and 587,475 links, as described by Widdows and Dorow (2002).

Lexicosyntactic patterns were pioneered by Marti Hearst (Hearst, 1992; Hearst and Sch¨utze, 1993) in the early 1990’s, to enable the addition of new information to lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).
