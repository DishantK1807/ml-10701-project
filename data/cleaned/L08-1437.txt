HAM which is similar to ‘headmatching’-heuristic (Cimiano, et al., 2004) aims to retrieve related terms in a glossary for the input concept. This algorithm consists of two parts: 1) it describes each term in the glossary with several dimensions, and 2) it looks up input </context>

However, the sentiment is conveyed not only by single words or phrases but rather by their combinations or contexts. Therefore, some researchers examine whether a given text has a fac</context>
