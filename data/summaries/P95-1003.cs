We solve both problems using a technique that was originally invented for the implementation of phonological rewrite rules (Kaplan and Kay 1981, 1994) and later adapted for two-level rules (Kaplan, Karttunen, Koskenniemi 1987; Karttunen and 19 Beesley 1992).

Phonological rewrite rules Our definition of replacement is in its technical aspects very closely related to the way phonological rewrite-rules are defined in Kaplan and Kay 1994 but there are important differences.

I am particularly indebted to Kaplan for writing a very helpful critique, even though he strongly prefers the approach of Kaplan and Kay 1994.

This may seem a simple matter but it is not, as Kaplan and Kay 1994 show.

RightContext ° ° ° The first three versions roughly correspond to the three alternative interpretations of phonological rewrite rules discussed in Kaplan and Kay 1994.
J94-3001
In the course of exploring the issues, Kaplan and Kay developed a more abstract notion of rewrite rules, which we exploit here, but their 1994 paper retains the procedural point of view.

Our replacement operators are close relatives of the rewrite-operator defined in Kaplan and Kay 1994, but they are not identical to it.
