Work on the PDTB is grounded in a lexicalized approach to discourse – DLTAG (Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999a; Webber et al., 2000; Webber et al., 2003).

It should be clear that the former 6In Miltsakaki et al.(2004), we have reported on the annotation of implicit connectives as well.

2.4 Inter-Annotation Reliability An extensive discussion of inter-annotator reliability in the PDTB is presented in (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).

However, developing the PDTB may help facilitate the production of more such corpora, through an initial pass of automatic annotation, followed by manual correction, much as was done in developing the PTB (Marcus et al., 1993).) Here we present some preliminary experiments we have carried out on the current version of the PDTB.

overview 2.1 Theoretical background The PDTB project builds on basic ideas presented in Webber and Joshi (1998), Webber et al.(1999b) and Webber et al.(2003) – that connectives are discourse-level predicates which project predicateargument structure on a par with verbs at the sentence level.

What we describe to annotators as arguments to discourse connectives are actually the textual span from which the argument is derived (Webber et al., 1999a; Webber et al., 2003).

The latter would accord with a theoretical distinction that has been made between postposed when expressing a purely temporal relation between the two clauses, and preposed when expressing a contingent relation between them (Moens and Steedman, 1988).

Assessment of inter-annotator agreement groups these annotations into five coarse classes (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).

Further work in this area will also be extremely relevant for NLG sentence planning components employing discourse relations (Walker et al.(2003), Stent et al.(2004), among others), where the sentence planner needs to make decisions regarding cue placement.

Large scale annotated corpora such as the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) have played a central role in speech and natural language research.

What Webber et al.(2003) call anaphoric connectives (discourse adverbials, such as otherwise, instead, furthermore, etc).

Webber and Joshi (1998) propose a tree-adjoining grammar for discourse (DLTAG) in which compositional aspects of discourse meaning are formally defined, thus teasing apart compositional from non-compositional layers of meaning.
