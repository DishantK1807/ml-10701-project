In Japanese coupus, half of the turns are started with these words, while English corpus shows that about 25 % of the turns start with corresponding expression(Kawamori et al., 1998).

Unit 2.1 First annotation scheme Based on the survey of existing annotation schemes such as the schemes of several research groups in Japan (Kyoto Univ., Tsukuba Univ., Waseda Univ., ATR (Nagata, 1992)) and DRI (Allen and Core, 1996; Carletta et al., 1997a) for utterances (we call this utterance unit tags), we created the first annotation manual for illocutionary force type, mood information and exchange structures.

As in (Carletta et al., 1997a; Carletta et al., 1997b), we also created a decision tree to improve the coding reliability of this scheme.

â€¢ Reliability: The agreement among the coders is quantitatively evaluated with reliability in terms of the kappa coefficient K (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta et al., 1997b).
