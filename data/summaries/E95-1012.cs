While we know of previous work which associates scores with feature structures (Kim, 1994) are not aware of any previous treatment which makes explicit the link to classical probability theory.

We take a slightly unconventional perspective on feature structures, because it is easier to cast our theory within the more general framework of incremental description refinement (Mellish, 1988) than to exploit the usual metaphors of constraint-based grammar.
