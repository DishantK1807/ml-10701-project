CURRENT MODELS OF TEXT STRUCTURE COMPUTATIONAL MODELS Two general methodologies have been applied to the structuring of explanations: schemas (\[McKeown, 1985\], \[McCoy, 1985\], \[Paris, 1987\]) and plans based on rhetorical structure theory (RST) (\[Hovy and McCoy, 1989\], \[Hovy, 1988a\], \[Moore and Paris, 1988a\], \[Moore and Swartout, 1988b\]).

Our analysis suggests that text structure is not completely recursive as others have claimed (\[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\], \[Reichman, 1978\], \[Polanyi, 1986\], \[Mann and Thompson, 1988\]), but rather that the high-level structure of extended explanations is determined by processes separate from those which organize text at lower levels.

Research (e.g., \[Reichman, 1978\], \[Grosz and Sidner, 1986\]) indicates that an interrupting segment is explicitly closed before returning to the one interrupted.
