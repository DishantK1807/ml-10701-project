For example, if one accepts the framework of the Penn Treebank, it is easy to move on to representations of deeper structure as suggested in three papers in this volume (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Babko-Malaya et al., 2004; Meyers et al., 2004).

Indeed (Helmreich et al., 2004) explores the question of integration across languages, as well as levels of annotation.
W04-2709
(Baumann et al., 2004) also describes how a number of different linguistic levels can be related in annotation (pragmatic and prosodic) among two languages (English and German).
W04-2707
The sixth, seventh and eighth papers (Baumann et al., 2004; C‚ mejrek et al., 2004; Helmreich et al., 2004) explore questions of multilingual annotation of syntax and semantics, beginning to answer the question of how annotation systems can be made compatible across languages.

The ninth and tenth papers (Langone et al., 2004; Zabokrtsk·y and Lopatkov·a, 2004) are respectively about a corpus related to a lexicon and the reverse: a lexicon related to a corpus.
W04-2710
The rst six papers describe linguistic annotation in four languages: Spanish (Alc·antara and Moreno, 2004), English (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Babko-Malaya et al., 2004; Meyers et al., 2004), Czech (Sgall et al., 2004) and German(Baumann et al., 2004).
