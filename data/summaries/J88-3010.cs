For instance, it is important to determine the cases where the goal underlying an utterance "contributes to the satisfaction of" the goal underlying another utterance--e.g., getting the hearer to believe some proposition p contributes to the satisfaction of getting the hearer to believe some proposition q (determined as dominance relations in Grosz and Sidner (1986).

Here, I would reinterpret slightly the term as used in Grosz and Sidner (1986) (see Cohen 1986).

a teacher in a domain of educational diagnosis; Paris (1985) shows how the form of response can vary according to the level of expertise; Chin (1986) also uses the level of expertise of the user, together with a labeling of difficulty of the system's knowledge, to produce good responses).

Which of the actual utterances of the discourse group together into logical segments is covered by the "linguistic structure" of Grosz and Sidner (1986).

The examples provided in Grosz and Sidner (1986), for instance, only record those attached to segments of more than one utterance.

I essentially include in the discourse all the components covered by the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986).

As soon as this kind of history of objects is included (covered in the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986) by tracking attentional state and the objects currently in focus), there are elements that are not specifically attached to the user himself.

Schuster seems to suggest that some of the structuring provided in Grosz and Sidner (1986) is there only to highlight the entities, In my view, the actual utterances themselves are worth examining as participating in some structure.
