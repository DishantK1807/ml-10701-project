The features we explore can be divided into the following five classes: Conversational Features: We follow Galley et al.(2003) and extracted a set of conversational features, including the amount of overlapping speech, the amount of silence between speaker segments, speaker activity change, the number of cue words, and the predictions of LCSEG (i.e., the lexical cohesion statistics, the estimated posterior probability, the predicted class).

Passonneau and Litman (1993) identified that topic shifts often occur after a pause of relatively long duration.
P93-1020
Previous work has shown that training a segmentation model with features that are extracted from knowledge sources other than words, such as speaker interaction (e.g., overlap rate, pause, and speaker change) (Galley et al., 2003), or participant behaviors, e.g., note taking cues (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2006), can outperform LCSEG on similar tasks.

Also, interlocutors pause longer than usual to make sure that everyone is ready to move on to a new discussion (Brown et al., 1980; Passonneau and Litman, 1993) and use some conventional expressions (e.g., now, okay, letâ€™s, um, so).
P93-1020
For example, lexical cohesion-based algorithms, such as LCSEG (Galley et al., 2003), or its word frequency-based predecessor TextTile (Hearst, 1997) capture topic shifts by modeling the similarity of word repetition in adjacent windows.

8 Morevoer, the combined models al6 Hirschberg and Litman (1987) have proposed to discriminate the different uses intonationally.

Table 2 shows the results obtained by using the same set of conversational (CONV) features used in previous work (Galley et al., 2003; Hsueh and Moore, 2006), and results obtained by using all the available features (ALL).

Other prosodic cues (e.g., pitch contour, energy) have been studied for their correlation with story segments in read speech (Tur et al., 2001; Levow, 2004; Christensen et al., 2005) and with theory-based discourse segments in spontaneous speech (e.g., directiongiven monologue) (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996).

Second, because the automatically generated segments make up for the lack of explicit orthographic cues (e.g., story and paragraph breaks) in conversational speech, dialogue segmentation is useful in many spoken language understanding tasks, including anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), information retrieval (e.g., as input for the TREC Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) task), and summarization (Zechner and Waibel, 2000).

But Di Eugenio and Glass (2004) have found that this interpretation does not hold true for all tasks.

Therefore, research has adopted techniques previously developed 1016 to segment topics in text (Kozima, 1993; Hearst, 1997; Reynar, 1998) and in read speech (e.g., broadcast news) (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Allan et al., 1998).
