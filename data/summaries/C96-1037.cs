When trained with a corpus only one-tenth the size of the corpus used in Gale and Church (1991), the algorithm aligns over 80% of word pairs with comparable precision (93%).

The resolution of alignment can vat3, from low to high: section, paragraph, sentence, phrase, and word (Gale and Church 1993; Matsumoto et al.1993). In addition to machine translation, many applications tbr aligped corpora have been proposed, including bilingual lexicography (Gale and Church 199l, Smadja 1992, Dallie, Gaussier and Lange 1994), and word-sense disambiguation (Gale, Church and Yarowsky 1992, Chen and Chang 1994).

In the context of statistical machine translation, Brown et al.(1993) presented a series of five models for Pr(ST \[TT).

1. Introduction Brown et al.(1990) initiated much of the recent interest in bilingual corpora.

The prospects tbr Japanese, in particular, seem highly promising There arc some work on alignment of lÂ£nglish-Japanese texts using both dictionaries and statistics (Utsuro, lkeda, Yamane, Matsumoto and Nagao 1994).
C94-2175
Motivated by the need to reduce on the memory requirement and to insure robustness in estimation of probability, Gale and Church (1991) proposed an alternative algorithm in which probabilities are not estimated and stored for all word pairs.

Using an EM algorithm for Model 2, Brown et al.(1990) reported the model produced seventeen acceptable translations for twenty-six testing sentences.

Recent work involving structural disambiguation (Brill and Resnik 1994) also indicated that statistics related to frequency outperform mutual intbrmation and q~2 statistic.
