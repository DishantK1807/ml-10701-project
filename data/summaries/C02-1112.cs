We used TnT (Brants, 2000) for PoS tagging.

Yarowsky (1994) defined a basic set of features that has been widely used (with some variations) by other WSD systems.
P94-1013
The first method is based on a decisionthreshold (Dagan and Itai, 1994): the algorithm rejects decisions taken when the difference of the maximum likelihood among the competing senses is not big enough.
J94-4003
Stetina et al.(1998) achieve good results with syntactic relations as features.
W98-0701
Despite their simplicity, Decision Lists (Dlist for short) as defined in Yarowsky (1994) have been shown to be very effective for WSD (Kilgarriff & Palmer, 2000).
P94-1013
Three parsers fulfilled all the requirements: Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993), Minipar (Lin, 1993) and (Carroll & Briscoe, 2001).
P93-1016
Ng (1996) uses a basic set of features similar to those defined by Yarowsky, but they also use syntactic information: verb-object and subjectverb relations.
P96-1006
As in (Dagan and Itai, 1994), we adjusted the measure to the amount of evidence.
J94-4003
The features are extracted using a statistical parser (Collins, 1996), and consist of the head and modifiers of each phrase.
P96-1025
