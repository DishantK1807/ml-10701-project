For such applications, the array s[j,y] would be of a size at least 5000 times the number of training instances: clearly impractical (but see below for 2 Berger et al.(1996) use an algorithm that might appear sequential, but an examination of the definition off # and related work shows that it is not.

Conditional Maximum Entropy models have been used for a variety of natural language tasks, including Language Modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), partof-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), word selection for machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), and finding sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
