SWAT considers only those translations c that has been linked with w based the Competitive Linking Algorithm (Melamed 1997) and logarithmic likelihood ratio (Dunning 1993).

Diab and Resnik (2002) extended the translation-based learning strategy with a weakened constraint that many instances of a word in a parallel corpus often correspond to lexically varied but semantically consistent translations.
P02-1033
The class based approach attacks the problem of tagging and data sparseness in a way similar to the Yarowsky approach (1992) based on thesaurus categories.
C92-2070
Yarowsky (1992) showed a class-based approach under which a very large untagged corpus and thesaurus can be used effectively for unsupervised training for noun homograph disambiguation.
C92-2070
Li and Li (2002) extended the approach by using corpora in two languages to bootstrap the learning process.

iii. The method is applicable not only to nouns but also to adjectives and verbs, since it does not rely on topical context, which is effective only for nouns as pointed out by Towell and Voorhees (1998).

The approach is very general and modular and can work in conjunction with a number of learning strategies for word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995; Li and Li, 2002).

Yarowsky (1995) showed that the learning strategy of bootstrapping from small tagged data led to results rivaling supervised training methods.

As noted in Merialdo (1994), even minimal hand tagging improved on the results of unsupervised methods.

Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992) exploited the so-called one sense per translation constraint for WSD.
