A Chinese resume C= c 1 ’,c 2 ’,…,c k ’ is first tokenized into C= w 1,w 2,…,w k with a Chinese word segmentation system LSP (Gao et al., 2003).

Then, we use a back-off schema (Katz, 1987) to deal with the data sparseness problem when estimating the probability P(L) (Gao et al., 2003).

For example, Peng and McCallum (2004) applied Conditional Random Fields to extract information, which draws together the advantages of both HMM and SVM.

But we are not sure whether N-Best approach (Zhai et al., 2004) would be helpful.

We selected SVMlight (Joachims, 1999) as the SVM classifier toolkit and LSP (Gao et al., 2003) for Chinese word segmentation and named entity identification.
