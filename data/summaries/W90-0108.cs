The Upper Model's Contribution to the Solution to the Interface Problem: Domain independence and reusability The upper model decomposes the mapping problem by establishing a level of linguistically motivated knowledge organization specifically constructed as a reponse XIncluding, for example: the Functional Sentence Structure of XTRA: \[Allgayer et al., 1989\]; \[Chen and Cha, 1988\]; \[Dahlgren et al., 1989\]; POLYGLOSS: \[Emele et ai., 1990\]; certain of the Domain and Text Structure Objects of SPOKESMAN: \[Meteer, 1989\]; TRANSLATOR: \[Nixenberg et aL, 1987\]; the Semantic Relations of ~UROTa^-D: \[Steiner et al., 1987\]; JANUS: \[Weischedel, 1989\].

7Furthermore, the experience of the JANUS project (e.g., \[Weischedel, 1989\]) has been that the cost of using a sufficiently rich logic to permit axiomatization of the complex phenomenon required is very high, motivating augmentation by an abstraction hierarchy very similar to that of the upper model and facing the same problem of definitional criteria.

~Although my discussion here is oriented towards text generation, our current research aims at fully bi-directional linguistic resources \[Kasper, 1988; Kasper, 1989\]; the mapping is therefore to be understood as a bi.directional mapping throughout.

3This is handled in the PeNM*N system by the grammar's inquiry semantics, which has been described and illustrated extensively elsewhere (e.g., \[Bateman, 1988; Mann, 1983; Matthiessen, 1988\]).
