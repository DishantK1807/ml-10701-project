(Beeferman et al., 1997) models more accurately the effect of distance between triggering and triggered word, showing that for non-self-triggers, 4 the triggering effect decays exponentially with distance.

Trigger-pair modelling research has been pursued within the field of language modelling for speech recognition over the last decade (Beeferman et al., 1997; Della Pietra et al., 1992; Kupiec, 1989; Lau, 1994; Lau et al., 1993; Rosenfeld, 1996).

The corpus, a subset s of the ATR/Lancaster General-English Treebank (Black et al., 1996), consists of a sequence of sentences which have been tagged and parsed by human experts in terms of the ATR English Grammar; a broad-coverage grammar of English with a high level of analytic detail (Black et al., 1996; Black et al., 1997).

The choice to use sentences as the unit of distance is motivated by our intention to incorporate triggers of this form into a probabilistie treebank-based parser and tagger, such as (Black et al., 1998; Black et al., 1997; Brill, 1994; Collins, 1996; Jelinek et al., 1994; Magerman, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
