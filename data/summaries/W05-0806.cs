Results The evaluation metrics used in our experiments are WER (Word Error Rate), PER (Positionindependent word Error Rate) and BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) (Papineni et al., 2002).
P02-1040
The baseline translation system is the Alignment Templates system with scaling factors (Och and Ney, 2002).
P02-1038
Word alignments are produced using GIZA++ toolkit without symmetrisation (Och and Ney, 2003).
J03-1002
Therefore, the base forms have been introduced manually and the POS tags have been provided partly manually and partly automatically using a statistical maximum-entropy based POS tagger similar to the one described in (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).
W96-0213
For detailed descriptions of SMT models see for example (Brown et al., 1993; Och and Ney, 2003).
