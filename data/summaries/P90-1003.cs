Other studies have pointed to possibilities for deriving syntax from prosody (see e.g., Gee and Grosjean 1983, Briscoe and Boguraev 1984, and Komatsu, Oohira, and Ichikawa 1989) but none to our knowledge have communicated speech information directly to a parser in a spoken language system.

The next steps in this research will include: • Investigating further the relationship between prosody and syntax, including the different roles of phrase breaks and prominences in marking syntactic structure, 20 • Improving the prosodic labeling algorithm by incorporating intonation and syntactic/semantic information, • Incorporating the automatically labeled information in the parser of the SRI Spoken Language System (Moore, Pereira and Murveit 1989), • Modeling the break indices statistically as a function of syntactic structure, • Speeding up the parser when using the prosodic information; the expectation is that pruning out syntactic hypotheses that are incompatible with the prosodic pattern observed can both improve accuracy and speed up the parser overall.

For our corpus of sentences we selected a subset of a corpus developed previously (see Price et aL 1989) for investigating the perceptual role of prosodic information in disambiguating sentences.

This coincides with Steedman's (1989) observation that syntactic units do not tend to bridge major prosodic breaks.
