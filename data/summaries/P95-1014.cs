Now consider a standard memoizing proof procedure such as Earley Deduction (Pereira and Warren 1983) or the memoizing procedures described by Tamaki and Sato (1986), Vieille (1989) or Warren (1992) from this perspective.
P83-1021
The 'abstraction' step, which is used in most memoizing systems (including complex feature grammar chart parsers where it is somewhat confusingly called 'restriction', as in Shieber 1985), receives an elegant treatment in a CLP approach; an 'abstracted' goal is merely one in which not all of the equality constraints associated with the variables appearing in the goal are selected with that goal.

rules in Categorial Grammar This section reviews Bouma and van Noord's (1994) (BN henceforth) constraint-based categorial grammar analysis of modification in Dutch, which we use as our primary example in this paper.
P94-1021
Prolog code for a simple application of our technique to Bouma and van Noord's (1994) categorial grammar analysis of Dutch is provided.
