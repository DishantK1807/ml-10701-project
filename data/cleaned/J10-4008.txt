Looking for a book that lucidly sorts out XML, XSLT and XMI, GATE and UIMA,
WordFreak, OpenNLP, and the Stanford NLP Toolkit? Looking for meticulous guid-
ance via batteries of stylesheets and shell scripts, but also keen on exploiting special-

Preferring the hands-on “how-to” over dry and winding theory debates and formally

Wilcock’sIntroductiontoLinguisticAnnotationandTextAnalyticsmightbeaperfectmatch
toenjoyallthis.
Thisvolume,thethirdpublishedlectureinMorgan&Claypool’sSynthesisLectures
onHumanLanguageTechnologies series, consists of six chapters. The ﬁrst one lays the
XML-focused meta language foundations and provides additional insights into XML
parsingandvalidationtools,aswellasformat-switchingXMLtransformationroutines
usingXSLTransformations(XSLT).Chapter4continuesthistechnicalthreadasitelab-
orates on frameworks for interchanging annotations between different formats using
XSLT,aswellastheUML-basedXMLMetadataInterchange(XMI)format,anemerging
standard to support the interchange of annotations produced by different tools. In-
troducing the WordFreak annotation tool, the second chapter sheds light on relevant
linguistic annotation layers ranging from formal sentence splitting and tokenization
via part-of-speech tagging, syntactic constituency parsing, and semantic predicate–
argument analysis up to discourse phenomena such as co-reference resolution. Al-
though this chapter focuses primarily onmanualannotation (there isalso asubsection
at the end where WordFreak is linked with OpenNLP), the following one features
automaticstatisticalannotationprocedures.Easy-to-plug-inOpenNLPiscontrastedhere
with stand-alone Stanford NLP tools at all major levels of the linguistic food chain,
namely,sentenceandtokensplitting,chunkingandparsing,namedentityrecognition,
andco-referenceresolution.Increasingthelevelofabstractionatthesystemslevel,the
author then advances to comparing GATE and UIMA, two alternativearchitecturesfor
textanalytics.Hisemphasisisontheproperconﬁgurationandtask-speciﬁccustomiza-
tion (e.g., by introducing the JAPE rule language in GATE and the regex annotator in
UIMA, both serving to improve named entity recognition). Again, practical exercises

are discussed in detail running through all levels of linguistic processing (integrating
gazetteers/dictionaries, POS tagging, NP chunking and full parsing, named entity
recognition, co-reference resolution, etc.). The ﬁnal chapter concludes with a survey
of commercially available tools doing text analytics (e.g., alias-i’s LingPipe or IBM’s
LanguageWare).Furthermore,anadvancedtreatmentofnamedentityrecognition(for
job titles) and co-reference resolution is provided using the open-source frameworks
ofrule-basedGATEandUIMAsolutions(bothincorporatingcustomizeddictionaries)
andstatisticallybasedOpenNLP.
The book assumes little prior knowledge, although regular expression, JAVA, and
XMLbasicswillcertainlybehelpful.Itistargetedatundergraduatelevel(notnecessar-
ily computer science) students who wish to gather experience in reusing, modifying,
and customizing existing linguistic annotation tools and text analytics architectures.
Throughout the book, the author directs the reader to open-source, freely available,
platform-independent, and easily downloadable software resources and repositories.
So students ﬁnd themselves embedded in a stimulating playground where tooling is
themessage.
The book is comprehensively written, well-structured, and very easy to follow,
in particular when students have the exercises run simultaneously on their personal
machines. The author has a clearly designed didactical master plan in mind which is
realized by a large number of exercises with increasing, but never particularly high,
complexity (see, e.g., the fourth chapter that deals with a nice set of transformation
problemsinvolvingWordFreak–OpenNLP[XML–plaintext],GATE–WordFreak[XML–
XML], and WordFreak–UIMA [XML–XMI] tool [language] pairs). These exercises are
reasonably chosen and solutions are technically well prepared and exhaustively ex-
plainedwithanadmirabledegreeofclarity.
However, the more advanced and experienced reader might ﬁnd the continuous
pampering by way of overly ﬁne-grained thematic exposition and visualization a bit
excessive, perhaps even wearisome. There is, for example, also no division into easy,
medium, and hard problems to offer challenging tasks at different levels of students’
understanding.Ifthebookisusedinthecontextofmoreadvancedteaching,itshould
be complemented by much more technical standard reference textbooks providing
complementary theoretical background information on empirical NLP, (supervised)
machinelearningmethodsforNLP,computationalcorpuslinguistics,andsoforth.Yet,
for getting used to mapping routines, workﬂows, and software underlying linguistic
meta data annotation, this tutorial ﬁlls certainly a gap for students who come across
