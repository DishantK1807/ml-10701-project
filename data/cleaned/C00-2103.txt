uni-stuttgart, de 1 Introduction One of the daunting problems in machine translation (MT) is the mapping of tense.
The paper singles out tile problem of translating German present tense into English.
This problem seems particularly instructive as its solution requires calculation of aspect; as well as determination of tile temporal location of events with respect to the time of speech.
We present a disambiguation algorithm which makes use of gram ularity calculations to establish the scopal order of temporal adverbial phrases.
The described algorithm has been implemented and is running in the Verbmobil system.
The paper is organized as follows.
In sections 2 through 4 we 1)resent the problem and discuss the linguistic factors involved, always keeping an eye on their exploitation for disambiguation.
Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to an abstract; def inition of temporal granularity and a discussion of granularity effects on scope resolution.
In section 7 the actual disambiguation algorithm is presented, while section 8 describes its performance on the Verbmobil test data.
A summary closes the paper.
2 Present
or Future?
In contrast to English, the German present tense is commonly used to describe both present and future happenings.
One task in translation from German to English is therefore tile dismnbiguation of German/)resent tense to present time or future time.
(1) present tense ~ future time -+ present time * This work was fimded by the German Federal Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF) in the framework of the Verbmobil Project under Grant 01 IV 101 U.

2.1 Temporal
Orientation A prominent factor involved in the choice between present and future time (Butt, 1995) is the temporal orientation of tile time adverbials that modi\[y the tensed verb.
Only a limited set of time adverbials can refer to present time.
Indeed, the set is so small that it can be enumerated.
The adverbials can be fhrther subclassified according to other times they may refer to.
• only present (now, at the moment) • also past (just, German eben) • any time (toda35 this week, in the meantime, tbr two weeks) All other time adverbials are incompatible with present time.
(2) * On 19th November 2000, I sleep late.
• Some adverbials only refer to past time (e.g.
~stm'da35 last week, formerIL recentl), two days ago).
(3) * I will be here yesterday.
• Others can only be used with filturc time (tomorrow, next week, soon, in £our d~ys).
2.2 Verbs
Immune to Temporal Orientation Effects In some cases tile temporal orientation of adverbials sounds a false alarm: Even though an adverbial requiring non-present syntactically modifies the tensed verb, German present tense is translated as present (see examples (4) from the British National Corpus).
The effect comes about because semantically the adverbial modifies not the verb's eventuality but one of the verb's objects.
712 (4) a.
'lbmorrow i am ah'eady 1)lamfing a golf trip with the boss.
(Verbmobi\] (:orlms) b.
And w(" wish trim the very best of lu(:k tomorrow in Birminghmn.
(British National Corpus, lINe) ('.
Another storm fl'om SE...
is expected here tomorrow.
(BNC) The decisive factor seems to be the verb sense involved.
Thus, for disambiguation a.
list; of such '"il\[llll\[llte" vet'b senses ltlltSt be compiled.
Such verbs can be modified by adverbials requiring 1)r(~sent and adverbials requiring non-1)resent at the Sallle time.
(5) am Montag haben wit jo%zt noch etwas Zeit 011 ~/\]011(t~l.} r have we i~ow still some time but now we still have some time on Monday.
2.3 Temt)oral Orientation and Scope Only the temporal orientation of wide-s(:ol)e adverbials is relevant for tense (lisambiguation (Butt, 1995).
lrrequen(:y )tdverbials intercel)t the disambiguating etfe(:t (see (6)).
It is (;herefore imi)ortan(; to evaluate only those a(lvcrbials that outs(:ope the fl'eqltelt(;y adverbial with widest scope.
(6) a.
John will be here on Monday.
b. John is here on Monday every week.
(:. John will |)e here in April every week.
3 Simple
or Progressive?
A distinctive feature of the English tense system th',~t is missing in German is the differentiation be(,ween siml)le and t)rogressive aspect.
We t'o(:us here on 1;\]1(: usag(: of aspect in 1)r(:sent time.
(7) present time -~,~'imple/)re,~'ent -+ l>rcs<mt t)rogres,vi~<'.
3.1 Linguistic
N~etors The factors involved have been thoroughly studted and classitied in the linguistic literature (Greenbaum and Quirk, 1990).
So we confine ourselves to a short re.view here.
State Present.
Stative verb senses get simple aspect.
(8) a.
• We are having a house on Oxtbrd Street;.
b. We arc having dinner.
Habitual Present.
A habit is a set of <:vents of the same type.
In semantic tern:s, a habit arises from quantiti('ation over events.
If the events extend indefinitely into the past and fi:ture., the lmbit is conceived as perutancu, t "and simple aspect is used; if the events occur over ~ limited period of time, the habit is conceived as temporary and progressive aspect is appropriate.
A frequency adverbial can be used to speci\[y tit(: (relative) number of occurrences of the event.
Ge.ncral .\[acts cml be viewed as a special type of a habit.
They arc always expressed in simple asl)ect (see (9)).
(9) Because water boils at 100°C, water is boiling at 100°C in the pot.
Instantaneous Present.
Dynamic verb senst~s that ret'er to a single event with little or no (lur~tion oceun'ing at the Sl)eech time are exl)ressed with simple aspect.
This type of \])resent is used in commentm'ies (10a), self commentaries (10b) and with performative verbs (10c) referring to speech acts.
(10) a.
Joe scores a goal.
b. I enclose an apt)lication tbrm.
(:. For I)ermission to tmblish this paper, the authors l;tm.nk the l)el):~rtment of Economi(: Develol)ment.
Durational Present.
Dynamic verl) senses denoting an incomph:te event with dm'ation get progressive aspect.
(11). a.
We are looking at; March sixteenth.
(Verbmobil corpus) b.
This is looking interesting.
(Verbmobil corpus) 3.2 Disambiguation State Present;.
Disambiguation requires definition and classification of all relevant verb senses according to stativity.
When in a first ap1)roximation only the most fl'equent verb sense of each verb are considered, a list; of stative verbs can be extracted from a corpus.
Habitual l?resent.
The presence of a fiequency adverbial points to a reading of Habitual Present.
Since every event can be construed as a general fact, general facts arc very difficult to identify and will be disregarded.
713 Instantaneous Present.
For disambiguation achievement verbs used in selfcommentm'ies and perfbrmative verbs need to be listed.
Durational Present.
Present events are usually regarded as having duration, so progressive is the default aspect for dynamic verb senses in the present.
4 Perfect
or Not?
In a special case, Germm~ present tense can be rendered as English present perfect: In English, perfect is used to describe periods that begin in the past and lend up to the present; German uses a non-perf~ctive tense in this situation.
(1.2) Wir leben schon fiinf Jahre in Amsterdam.
We live ah'eady five years in Amsterdam.
We have lived in Amsterdam for five years.
Whenever a period is described that begins before and still holds at speedl time, a limitative time adverbial i is used.
(This term is due to Bras (1.990)).
This peculiarity makes disambiguation very easy.
(13) a.
Er ist erst zwei Wochen hier.
lie is onlyt two weeks here.
He has only been here for two weeks.
b. Er ist nur zwei Wochen hier.
He is only two weeks hcxe.
He is here for only two weeks.
5 Definition
of Granularity For our purposes we model the time axis as the set of rational 2 numbers Q.
An interval is then a pair of rational nmnbers <s, c), such that s < e.
The d'uration of an interval is the distance between start and end of the interval (d~Lr({s, c)) = e s).
On the interval structure we define the relations of inclusion (143) and overlap (14t)).
(1.4) a.
(81,c1} C (82, c2) +-} 82 ~.~ s1 A ~1 ~ (22 b.
@1,C1) 0 (82,('2) ~ 81 ~ (32 A 82 ~__ e 1 1Limigal;ive adverbials go with the prepositions since mid for plus temporal measure nouns in English; in German they occur with the preposition seit and as duration adverbials modified by schon and erst.
'~Although natural mmlbers could have been used to(), rational mm~bers are convenient since they allow free choice of the unit.
5.1 Temporal
nouns A temporal noun denotes a set; of intervals.
We define the granularity of a temporal noun formally as a pair of numbers specifying the minireal and maximal duration of its intervals (e.g.
or'an(day) = (1., 1), gT(t,/~.(conference) = (1, 28), ora'n(senfinar) = (0.00138889, 334.812) if" the unit is a dw).
The following relation is used to compare granularity values.
(15) (d,tr~,durl) > {d'ur'~,dur~) +~ {dur'~,d'ur~) 7~ <&,r~,dur~> A dur I >> dur~ If 7t 1 has coarser grmmlarity than rt2, then an interval of rt:l cannot be included in aD.
interval of' ~7,2.
(16),,2: > -+ Vii ~ r~q,i,e c n2 : il g i2) Consider the fbllowing definition.
(17) A telnporal noun n has t;11o property of disjoh~tness iff Vi~, i2 E n : ~il O i9 Every calendar measure noun defines a partition on the time axis and has therefore the t)roperty of disjointness (e.g.
hour, day, week, etelniti)O.
Nouns functionally dependent on calendar meaSln'e l/ouns inherit the property (e.g.
Monda35 ChristlnaS, holida:B 6:45, ...).
Event and state nouns have the disjointness property, if the described intervals fimctiolmlly depend on one of the particil)ants and the pm'ticil)allt is definite.
Thus, example (18) is &wiant.
(18) * Tomorrow at 6:30 Jones will give a talk at every conference.
\]if ~zl has finer granularity than a noml ~z~ which has the property of disjointness, then every interval in r~,l overlaps with at most one interval in n2 (we disregard the case where il joins two intervals in n2).

Among the temporal relational nouns we distinguish nouns describing periods of definite length (e.g.
quarter, t;hird, hall) f'ronl those that refer to periods of indefinite length (e.g.
beginning, middle, end).
In grmmlarity calculation, relational nouns contribute a factor.

l;his v(:in, w(; gel; (231)) as h)gical r(;1)rescntat;ion: The des('ribcd evenl;s arc situal;ed in May and in ()V(}l'y x, VO, Ok.

Tlw.n I;he fornmla ass(;rts that t, her(; is a visit; in thi,q w(,ek (i.(;.
in April) and 715 ill May, which is inconsistent.
Thus, the formula should not quantify over weeks in general but over weeks in May: An inclusion restriction to the wide-scope adverbial is needed in the narrow-scope adverbial (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).
(24) ~m: May(rr~) A Vw: week(w) A w C rn, ~e : visit(e, John, Jane) A e C m A e C_ w Since temporal quantification requires that a narrow-scope iterative adverbial be included in the wide-scope adverbial, configurations are excluded where by conceptual knowledge the narrow-scope adverbial al cannot be included in the wide-scope adverbial a2.
By theorem (16) this is the case if a,i has coarser granularity than a2.
6.3 Granularity
and Scope We have now seen two nlotivations for the principle (25).
(25) If ~,~ has finer granularity than r~2 and rt,2 is iteratively quantified, ~,1 camot have scope over ~t2.
Let us now consider the tbllowing t)rinciple: (26) If 7/'1 has finer granulm'ity than 7~,,) and r~,l is iteratiwfly quantified, ~zl cmmot have scope over ?~,2.
We are not in a position to tbrmally explain the principle.
It, holds for at least all nouns with the disjointness property.
Although in example (27a) the vq reading would make perfect sense (Jones is always on holiday), it is excluded.
In contrast, example (27b) allows this reading (.Jones shuttles between conference sites).
The principle is not restricted to temporal grmmlarity: In (27c) the V~ reading is excluded, too.
(27) a.
Every Monday, Jones was here in a month in which he was on holiday.
b. Every afternoon, Jones gave a talk at a conference.
c. On every page, 1%und something interesting in a paper I read.
Taken together, the two principles assert that the grmmlarity ranking determines the scope order.
In the dismnbiguation algorithm presented in section 7 we are mainly interested in the position of the highest (iterative) quantifier.
So if every pair of time adverbials can be compared in terms of granularity, we have a procedure to compute this position.
Comparison of granularity (1.5) is not defined if the granularity values overlap or m'e equal.
Equal granularity is only possible with specific time adverbials.
(28) • John came from every Wednesday to every weekend Other heuristics will have to come into play in case of overlapping granularity (see section 8 for further discussion).
6.4 Deictic
Adverbials Another factor for determining scope order is deixis.
Some adverbials ~tre connected in their interpretation to the time of speedl (now, at the moment, next week, last week).
Since time of speech is deictic (it depends on the context of utterance), hence defilfite, every function on it will also be definite.
Deictic adverbials always get wide-scope position.
Sentences in which deixis conflicts with granularity m'e deviant.
(29) • Next month, I will be here every year.
7 The
Disambiguation Algorithm In the implementation, an underspecified senlant;ie representation formalism is used to encode the source analysis and the transfer result for the target (the Verbmobil Interface Term (FIT) formalism (Bos el; al., 1998), which is based on the theory of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (Ileyle, 1995)).
The disambiguation heuristics of the system completely rely on local context.
The most important features in local context are source tense, the predicate names of the tensed verb in source mid target, and the time adverbials inodifying the verb in source and target (Sdfiehlen, 1998).
In a first step, the source and target representations are converted into an abstract representation, using the VIT transfer forlnalism (Dorna and Emele, 1996).
All information irrelevant to tense resolution is removed.
Since no fullfledged tense logic is implemented, information about temporal reference is discarded as well.
Temporal adverbs are decomposed into prepositional phrases (e.g.
.yesterday -+ on a past, 716 day).
In particular the following featm'es are extracted: (30) a.
multiple classification of verb senses • stative or dynamic (for English only, cf.
section 3.2) • 1)otentially pertbrmative/selfcolnmentary or not (for English only, cf.
section 3.2) • "immune" or not (cf.
section 2.2) b.
temporal relation expressed by preI)ositions e.
temt)oral orientation of pret)ositions (on Monday), adjectives (the previous Monda:v) and determiners (this Monday) (of.
section 2.1) d.
granularity of nouns and adverbs (e.g.
Cerma,) g,,, ti gig (,,,ho>-(l<,j)) e.
classification of determiners (quantiticational/specitic/alnbiguous) f.
classification of adverbs (frequency adverb or not) We now give an outline of the disambiguatixm algorithm for translating German t)resent.
It is (:lear l;hat the algorithln is \]mm'isti(" in lllglJxy Hst)ects, but in the absence of Colltext alld (lel;aile, d discourse anMysis it does not seem possible to do much better.
1. For every tensed verb, determine all time adverbials modii~ying it and collect them in the set TA.
2. Order the tinle adverbials in TA according to scope (of.
section 6).
3. Let STA be the set; of all specitic time adverbials in 5/'A (i.e.
adverbials denoting a specific interval) not in the scope of a quantificational adverbial or frequency adverb (cf.
section 2.3). 4.
Perfect or Not?
(cf. section 4) If one of the time adverbials in ETA is connected to the tensed verb over a linfitative relation, choose perfect; else choose nont)erf'ective tense.
5. Present or Future?
(cf. section 2) Choose present if the verb is "immune" to temi)oral orientation (cf.
section 2.2).
Else unify the temporal orientation contributed by the time adverbials in ETA.
In case the result excludes present time, choose fltture; else choose present (cf.
section 2.1). 6.
Simple or Progressive Aspect?
(of. section 3) (a) If the tensed verb has a stative sense, choose simple (State Present).
(b) If the tensed verb is used in a selfcommentary or perfonnatively, choose simple (Ilxstantaneous Present).
(c) If there is an adverbial ill STA, choose progressive (Temporary Habit and Durational Present).
(d) If there is a quantificational adverbial or flequency adverb in TA, choose simple (Permmmnt Habit).
(e) Else choose progressive (Durational Present).
8 Results
We tested the system on a data base of 13,625 pairs of Gernlan VI~I\]q with their English translations, containing 12,036 tensed verbs.
All the d~tl;a were in the appointment scheduling domain which is investigated in Verbmobil.
They wore transliter~ted and syntactically annotated 1)3; hand.
rlk'anslation was perforined by the Verbmol)il transfer component (Dorna and Emele, 1996).
2,758 tensed verbs were modified by time.
adverbiMs, 1,373 of these verbs were modified by time adverbials with known granularity.
The algorithm made the tbllowing choices tbr these data.
The second column shows the total number of tensed verbs, the third column only counts those modified by time adverbials with granularity.

Doxnain-specific information could potentially improve results.
In the Verbmobil domain e.g. several event types do not hal)i)en in 717 the present but only in the fllture (tra.vc\], meet, eat, ...).
1,1 93.6% of the cases a specific wide-scope time adverbial could be determined with gramflarity constraints.
In 4.7% of the cases several time adverbials of equal granularity had wide scope.
A good deal of these cases were alignment errors with the translations (e.g.
iibel"morgen the day after tomorrow).
Other cases were due to the lack of a treatment for coordination (e.g.
on Monday aud on Thmwday or ti'om June to August).
Some cases were genuine double descriptions of days: (31) a.
Is it possible for you tomorrow on the second? b.
I would have time on Wednesdw on Wednesday the third of May.
In 1.7% of the eases the wide-scope adverbial could not be determined because some a.dverbials had overlapping gralmlarity values.
Here the main culprit was the unspecified adverb when (see (32a)).
Other cases were due to incorrect preposition attachment (see (321,)).
(32) a.
When shall we meet on Mond~y?
Next week/6:30.
b. Would you be available in the time period until June? 9 Summary The pal/er has presented a disambiguation algorithm ibr translation of German present into English.
After a discussion of the factors involved, particular emphasis was placed on an account of scope resolution among time adverbials.
It has been shown that grmmhu'ity calculations go a long way towards the goal of full scope resolutioii.
The cross-commotions between granularity and scope have been analysed in detail, and some motivation for these connections has been given.
One area of future work is to apply the model to larger corpora and extend it to cover the full set of tenses.
If translations can be aligned with the training data, it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which the model can be used to extract (parts of) the pertinent granularity information on temporal nouns from the corpus (Schiehlen, 1998).
For example, the occurrence of a configuration like (33) could be interpreted as evidence tbr NOUN having coarser granularity than week.
