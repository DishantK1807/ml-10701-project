Previous approaches on biological named entities extraction can be classified into two types â€“ say, rule-based (Fukuda, et al., 1998; Humphreys, et al., 2000; Olsson, et al., 2002) and corpus-based (Collier, et al., 2000).
C00-1030 C02-1110
KeX developed by Fukuda, et al.(1998) and Yapex developed by Olsson, et al.(2002) were based on handcrafted rules for extracting protein names.
C02-1110
Named entities like protein names, gene names, drug names, disease names, and so on, were recognized (Collier, et al., 2000; Fukuda, et al., 1998; Olsson, et al., 2002; Rindflesch, et al., 2000).
C00-1030 C02-1110
Collier, et al.(2000) trained a Hidden Markov Model with a small corpus of 100 MEDLINE abstracts to extract names of gene and gene products.
C00-1030
The reason may be some heuristic rules used in Yapex are modified from KeX (Olsson et al., 2002).
C02-1110
Yapex system (Olsson et al., 2002) is adopted to propose candidates, and collocates are served as restrictions to filter out less possible protein names.
C02-1110
For example, corpus-based methods are employed to extract Chinese personal names, and rule-based methods are used to extract Chinese date/time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions (Chen and Lee, 1996; Chen, et al., 1998).
