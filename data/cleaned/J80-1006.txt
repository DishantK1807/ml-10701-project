3:43	To determine whether someone understands a text, such as a story, essay, or poem, he is asked questions that require him to draw inferences from what he has read.
4:43	Since the text, questions, and answers are all in natural language, a theory of natural language understanding is not satisfactory if it cannot support a model of how questions are answered.
5:43	When linguists propose explanations for natural language, therefore, they must consider the inference procedures that will be needed to extract information from the representations in their theories.
6:43	The inference process associated with the answering of questions can be formally characterized as theorem proving, the subject of Loveland's book.
7:43	Loveland presents mostly various methods of theorem proving by resolution, but the most attractive method he presents is a non-resolution approach that extends the problem reduction method in artificial intelligence.
8:43	In the problem reduction method, a question Q is reduced to a set of subquestions P1, P2 Pn by application of the assertion P1 &P2&&Pn ~ Q which is called an implication.
9:43	The terms Pi and Q are atomic statements or their negations.
10:43	Loveland points out that the problem reduction method is not complete, i.e., that it cannot always answer answerable questions.
11:43	From the assertions P=Q, "-p ~ Q for example, the question Q cannot be answered yes (shown to be a theorem) even though that is logically implied.
12:43	(The incompleteness comes from the fact that negation is a primitive in first order logic.
13:43	See Black \[1\] and Smullyan \[3\] for systems that do not have negation as a primitive and for which problem reduction is complete).
14:43	Loveland's extension to the problem reduction method, named the MESON format (called a format because many design choices are left to the implementer), adds several rules to the problem reduction method which make it complete.
15:43	These rules do not complicate the method very much; the most important new rule, for instance, states that when answering a question Q, if one of the resulting subquestions is ~Q, then that subquestion is considered to be successfully answered in the affirmative.
16:43	(This rule is essentially proof by contradiction).
17:43	The MESON format is partially described elsewhere (Loveland and Stickel \[2\]), but this book is the source for a full description and a proof of its completeness.
18:43	The book is divided into six chapters.
19:43	The first two chapters review the basic concepts of first order logic and explain the basic resolution procedure.
20:43	Chapter 3 presents several refinements of resolution, including unit preference, set-of-support, linear refinements, and model elimination.
21:43	Chapter 4 discusses subsumption, a technique that removes redundant expressions from further consideration.
22:43	Chapter 5 adds paramodulation, the inference rule that handles equality in the context of a resolutionbased theorem proving system.
23:43	The last chapter is devoted to the MESON format.
24:43	In a sense Chapter 6 is the climax of the book because the MESON format is justified on the basis of theorems about resolution in the preceding five chapters.
25:43	This book is a well organized and well written reference for mechanical theorem proving methods presented at the algorithmic level.
26:43	More than this should not be expected.
27:43	It assumes that the reader has an acquaintance with formal logic.
28:43	It proves rigorously nearly every theorem presented, and there are many.
29:43	Many technical terms are defined throughout the book, as is typical of mathematical treatments.
30:43	Although theorem proving consists of two parts, a mechanism that defines a search space and a control that guides the search in that space, the techniques described in the book are only the space defining mechanisms.
31:43	Details of the guiding controls are still the subject of research.
