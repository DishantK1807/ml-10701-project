J¨arvinen and Tapanainen (1998; Tapanainen and J¨arvinen 1997) have demonstrated an efficient wide-coverage dependency parser for English.

In the last several years, there have been a number of studies on developing finite-state parsing systems (Koskenniemi 1990; Koskenniemi, Tapanainen, and Voutilainen 1992; Grefenstette 1996; Chanod and Tapanainen 1996; Ait-Mokhtar and Chanod 1997; Hobbs et al.1997). Another stream of work in using finite-state methods in parsing is based on approximating context-free grammars with finite-state grammars, which are then processed by efficient methods for such grammars (Black 1989; Pereira and Wright 1997; Grimley-Evans 1997; Johnson 1998; Nederhof 1998, 2000).

Finite-state transducers are closed under union, but in contrast to finite-state recognizers, they are not closed under difference and intersection operations (Kaplan and Kay 1994).

We have also employed a scheme for ranking dependency parses using the total link length of the dependency trees, as originally suggested by Lin (1996), with quite promising results.
C96-2123
To impose a ranking on the parses generated based on just structural properties of the dependency tree, we employed Lin’s (1996) notion of structural complexity.

• The rules for linking dependents to heads can specify constraints on the intervening material between them, so that, for instance, certain links may be prevented from crossing barriers such as punctuation or lexical items with certain parts of speech or morphological properties (Collins 1996; Giguet and Vergne 1997; Tapanainen and J¨arvinen 1997).

This can be achieved by using Karttunen’s lenient composition operator (Karttunen 1998).

Turkish Turkish is an agglutinative language in which a sequence of inflectional and derivational morphemes get affixed to a root (Oflazer 1993).

Recent advances in the development of sophisticated tools for building finite-state systems (e.g., XRCE Finite State Tools [Karttunen et al.1996], AT&T Tools [Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1998], and Finite State Automata Utilities [van Noord 1997]) have fostered the development of quite complex finite-state systems for natural language processing.

A work along the lines of Abney’s is that of Kokkinakis and Kokkinakis (1999) for parsing Swedish.
E99-1035
Dependency-based statistical language modeling and parsing have also become quite popular in statistical natural language processing (Lafferty, Sleator, and Temperley 1992; Eisner 1996; Chelba et al.1997; Collins 1996; Collins et al.1999). Robinson (1970) gives four axioms for well-formed dependency structures that have been assumed in almost all computational approaches.
