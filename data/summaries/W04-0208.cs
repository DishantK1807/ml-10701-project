Earlier work in a noncorpus based (Hitzeman et al.1995) as well as corpus-based setting (Mani et al.2003) attests to the usefulness of combining knowledge sources for inferring temporal relations.

C2 = {Ea < Ee, Eb < Ec} Note that the partial ordering C can be extended using T and temporal closure axioms (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2001), (Verhagen 2004), so that in the case of <T2, C2>, we can infer, for example, that Eb < Ed, Ed < Ee, and so forth.

Several automatic tools have been developed in conjunction with TimeML, including event taggers (Pustejovsky et al.2003), time expression taggers (Mani and Wilson 2000), and an exploratory link extractor (Mani et al.2003). Temporal reasoning algorithms have also been developed, that apply transitivity axioms to expand the links using temporal closure algorithms (Setzer and Gaizauskas 2001), (Pustejovsky et al.2003). However, TimeML is inadequate as a temporal model of discourse: it constructs no global representation of the narrative structure, instead annotating a complex graph that links primitive events and times.

The need for commonsense inferences has motivated computational approaches that are domainspecific, using hand-coded knowledge (e.g., Asher and Lascarides 2003, Hitzeman et al.1995). A number of theories have postulated the existence of various discourse relations that relate elements in the text to produce a global model of discourse, e.g., (Mann and Thompson 1988), (Hobbs 1985), (Hovy 1990) and others.

al. 1999) (Carlson et al.2001) reported relatively high levels of inter-annotator agreement, this was based on an annotation procedure where the annotators were allowed to iteratively revise the instructions based on joint discussion.
