In contrast, most text generation systems (with the notable exception of KAMP (Appelt, 1985)) have used only rhetorical and attentional information to produce coherent text (McKeown, 1985, McCoy, 1985, Paris, 1988b), omitting intentional information, or conflating intentional and rhetorical information (Hovy, 1988b).

We have developed a text planner that records the following information about the responses it produces: â€¢ the information that Grosz and Sidner (1986) have presented as the basics of a discourse structure: intentional structure: a representation of the effect each part of the text is intended to have on the hearer and how the complete text achieves the overall discourse purpose (e.g., describe entity, persuade hearer to perform an action).

In their work on discourse analysis, Grosz and Sidner (1986) argue that it is necessary to represent the intentional structure, the attentional structure (knowledge about which aspects of a dialogue are in focus at each point), and the linguistic structure of "The research described in this paper was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under a NASA Ames cooperative agreement number NCC 2-520.

We wish to extend our criteria for satellite expansion to include other factors such as pragmatic and stylistic goals (Hovy, 1988a) (e.g., brevity) and the conversation that has occurred so far.

In (Paris, 1988a), we outline our preliminary ideas on this issue.

In an approach taken by Cohen and Appelt (1979) and Appelt (1985), text is planned by reasoning about the beliefs of the hearer and speaker and the effects of surface speech aWe are also currently implementing another interface which allows users to use a mouse to point at the noun phrases or clauses in the text that were not understood {Moore, 1989b).

Itecently, Hovy (1988b) built a text structurer which produces a coherent text when given a set of inputs to express.

STATUS AND FUTURE WORK The text planner presented is imple.mented in Common Lisp and can produce the text plans necessary, to participate in the sample ~lialogue described m this paper and several others (see (Moore, 1989a, Paris, 1988a)).
J88-3006
Following Hovy (1988a), we use the terminology for expressing beliefs developed by Cohen and Levesque (1985) in their theory of rational interaction, but have found the need to extend the terminology to represent the types of intentional goals necessary for the kinds of responses desired in an advisory setting.
