Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) demonstrate that high reliability and coverage are simultaneously attainable with such an approach.

Disambiguated Subcorpora Our original study of antonym co-occurrence (Justeson and Katz 1991) was based on a version of the Brown Corpus, containing 54,717 sentences; it yields only 57 sentences in which both adjectives from any of the ten antonym pairs analyzed in the present study were modifying different instances of the same noun.

In co-occurrence-based approaches, it is usual to take into account the entire set of words in the vicinity of a target (Maarek and Smadja 1989; Yarowsky 1992).

One much-studied example is the semantic relation between a verb and its arguments (e.g., Boguraev et al.1989; Church and Hanks 1989; Braden-Harder 1991; Hindle and Rooth 1991).

The semantic attributes that were applied were animate, body part, color, concrete, human, and text type; Church and Hanks (1989) had pointed to two of these attributes, person and body part (also time, previously mentioned above) in a seemingly casual listing of just five attributes potentially useful for describing the lexico-syntactic regularities of noun-verb relations.

Antonym co-occurrence is a frequent and pervasive phenomenon, and it takes place under highly restricted semantic and syntactic conditions (Charles and Miller 1989; Justeson and Katz 1991, 1992).
