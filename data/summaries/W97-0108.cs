The first is the LBXAS algorithm which uses an exemplar-based learning framework s;mil~to the case-based reasoning foundation of Kenmore (Ng, 1997; Ng and Lee, 1996).

Attempts to alleviate this tagbottleneck i~lude tmotstr~ias (Te~ ot ill,, 1996; Hearst, 1991) and unsupervised algorith~ (Yarowsky, 199s) Dictionary-based approaches rely on linguistic knowledge sources such as ma~l~i,~e-readable dictionaries (Luk, 1995; Veronis and Ide, 1990) and WordNet (Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Resnik, 1995) and e0(ploit these for word sense disaznbiguation.

Corpus-based word sense disambignation algorjthm~ such as (Ng and Lee, 1996; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Yarowsky, 1994) relied on supervised learning fzom annotated corpora.
P94-1013 P94-1020 P96-1006
Ng and Lee (1996) found that train/rig sets of 1000-1500 e~mples per word are necessary for sense dJ-~mhiguation of one highly ambiguous word.

Grishman et aL (1992) too ventured towards automatic semantic acquisition for information extraction.

Semantic classification has proved useful in a range of application areas, such as information extraction (Soderland et at., 1995), acquim'tion of domain knowledge (Mikheev and Finch, 1995) and improvement of parsing accuracy through the speci~cation of selectional restrictions (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Gri~h,n~n aud Sterling, 1992).

Unsupervised algorit~m~ such as (Yarowsky, 1995) have reported good accuracy that rivals that of supervised algorithms.

Thus far, two notable sense-tagged corpora, the semantic concordance of WordN'et 1.5 (Miller et aal.,1994) and the DSO corpus of 192,800 sense-tagged occtuTences of 191 words used by (Ng and Lee, 1996) are still insu~cient in scale for supervised algorithms to perform well on a wide range of texts.
H94-1046 P96-1006
Information Content Resnik (1995) proposed a word sense disambiguation algorithm which determ~ the senses of words in noun groupings.

This metric is motivated by Resnik's use of the probability of instance occurrences of concepts, p(c) (Resnik, 1995).

Conceptual Density Agirre and Rigau:s (1996) approach has a ~imilar motivation as Kesnik's.
