Our algorithm extends earlier approaches to morphology induction by combining various induced information sources: the semantic relatedness of the affixed forms using a Latent Semantic Analysis approach to corpusbased semantics (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), affix frequency, syntactic context, and transitive closure.

563). 3.3 Correlating Semantic Vectors To correlate these semantic vectors, we use normalized cosine scores (NCSs) as we had illustrated before (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)).

MED has been applied to the morphology induction problem by other researchers (such as Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000).

We 3 Current Approach 3.1 Finding Candidate Circumfix Pairings As in our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), we begin by generating, from an untagged corpus, a list of word pairs that might be morphological variants.

In order to obtain semantic representations of each word, we apply our previous strategy (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)).

For the future, we expect improvements could be derived by coupling this work, which focuses primarily on inducing regular morphology, with that of Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), who assume some information about regular morphology in order to induce irregular morphology.

and Jurafsky: induced semantics In our earlier work, we (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) generated a list of N candidate suffixes and used this list to identify word pairs which share the same stem but conclude with distinct candidate suffixes.

Gaussier (1999) induces derivational morphology using an inflectional lexicon which includes part of speech information.

We compare this improved algorithm to our former algorithm (Schone and Jurafsky (2000)) as well as to Goldsmith's Linguistica (2000).

Using this final lexicon, we can now seek for suffixes in a manner equivalent to what we had done before (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000).

Since our Most of the existing algorithms described focus on approach falls into this category (expanding upon suffixing in inflectional languages (though our earlier approach (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000)), Jacquemin and DéJean describe work on prefixes).

Also, Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) obtained outstanding results at inducing English past tense after beginning with a list of the open class roots in the language, a table of a language’s inflectional parts of speech, and the canonical suffixes for each part of speech.

We had noted previously (Schone and Jurafsky, 2000), however, that errors can arise from strictly orthographic systems.
