For the syntactic generator, the relevant syntactic information is extracted in the form of a Feature-Based Lexicalized TAG (FB-LTAG) grammar, see \[Joshi 1987, Vijay-Shanker and Joshi 1991, Schabes, Abeill4, and Joshi 1988\].

For this preprocessing of the HPSG grammar, we adapted the 'HPSG to TAG compilation' process described in \[Kasper et al.1995\]. The basis for the compilation is an identification of syntactically relevant selector features which express subcategorization requirements of a lexical item, e.g. the VALENCE features.

The input for the generation module VM-GECO 1 is generated by a semantic-based transfer component (see \[Dorna and Emele 1996\]).

Work on generation with TAG generally assumes that there is a one, to~-one mapping between the information in the generator input and the choice of elementary tree \[Mcdonald and Pustejovsky 1985, Yang, McCoy, and Vijay-Shanker 1991, D0ran and Stone 1997\].

This separation allows for an easy adaptation of the system to other languages and domains (see \[Becker et al.1998\]). 3 Declarativity in the Syntactic Generator All modules of the generator utilize external, declarative knowledge bases.

It is important to compare the generation strategy presented here with Semantic-head-driven generation \[Shieber et al.1990, van Noord 1990\] which is a direct generation algorithm froni logical form encodings.
