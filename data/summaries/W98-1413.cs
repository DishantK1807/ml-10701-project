The IDAS project of Reiter et al.(1992; 1995) served as a key motivation for this work.

We take the stand that a complete natural language instruction generation system for a device should have, at the top level, knowledge of the device (as suggested by Delin et al.(1993)). This is one facet of instruction generation that many NLG systems have largely ignored by instead incorporating the knowledge •of the task at their top level, i.e., the basic content of the• instructions is assumed to already exist and does not need to be planned for.
