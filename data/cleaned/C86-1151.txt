Ferment \])epartment of Information,<c\]ence and 1)ocumentat:ion Free Un:ivers\]ty of Brussels Be l ~ \] um The fo\]lowine article presents a prototype :for the mach:ine translation of English into French.
The study was carried out over a period of nine months, fol:lowin? a six months preliminary study, under contract with tile Burroughs Company and using a micro-comnuter of tile B20 series.
The prototype aims to provide a d\]apnostic study that lays the foundations for further development rather than immediately nroducing an accurate but limited realisation.
By way of exneriment, the corpus :For translat:ion was based on selected extracts :From computer systems manuals.
After studyin, the basic materia\], as well as assessdn.~ the varJous decis:ion criteria, :it was decided to construct a prototype made tm of three components : analysis, transfer and generation.
Although the prototype was desimmd with muitJ\]ingua\], anp\]icat\]ons :in mind, it am~eared preferable at th:is stage not to set un a system wilh interlinp:ua since tile e:laboraâ€¢ lion of the :interlinyua alone would have taken un a disnronortionate amount of time (King, Perschke, 1984), thus handJcap~Jnp the development of the nrototyne itself.

Horeover, all the canital letters placed lit the be~-innin~ of sentollces are converted to the lower case before analysis and are reintroduced during oeneration.

2.2. Mornholooical analysis As the nrototyne was being, real~sed based on and for a limited corrals, the SL dictionary was made un of comnlete forms : the working out of a mornhological narser is simpler than that of a syntactical narser.
2.3. Syntactical analvsis The Aup-mented Transition Network (ATN) was selected for the ana\]ysis : it had successfully been used in many nrevious systems : I,UNAi~, SH!~DLII, \]INTEI,I,\]iC, T and, more recently, ENFISPAN (Leon, 1984).
T. ~'~\]no~rad nresents three networks in great detail in his boo\]< 'Lan~ua9e as a Cognitive Process' (Winograd, 1983).
These were taken as the basis for the four (Sentence, Noun Phrase, Prenositional Phrase and Adjectival Phrase) of the nrototyDe, thus makin~ it nossible to sneed un the develonment of a narser which had already nroved itself in other resnects.
The majority of the modifications made to the \]~rino~rad's ATN were aimed at increasin~ its nerformance (esnecia\]ly bv dealin~ with the most common cases of coordination) as well as its determinist canacities thereby ensuring, the accuracy of the initial analysis sunnlied by the system (it :is ill fact on this analysis that the transfer operates because the micro-comnuter's memory was satura643 ted before it had managed to supply all possible analysis).
2.4. Disambiguation Within the prototype framework, the creation of a disambiguation sub-component would have taken up too much time and would not have been useful particularly that this research is deliberately designed to apply to only a limited corpus in which most of the ambiguities concern the Prepositional Phrase attachment and need not be solved for the translation if English into French.
2.5. Source-Language dictionary For the various reasons explained above, the dictionary includes only complete forms.
All variable words are characterised by different syntactical :features, certain of which concern their form, others do not.
All of these are treated by the analysis component.
Semantic features could easily be added at a later stage.
Words forming certain 'traditiona\]' classes may belong to various categories of the ~rototype dictionary.
This is notably the case with cardinal adjectives, which are at once classified as determiners and substantives.
At present, the only compounds that the prototype dictionary accepts are locutions with a maximum of two consecutive words.
Longer locutions, compound verbs and other discontinuous compounds~ quite rare in the corpus, will be treated as follows at a later sta~e: all words liable to appear in compounds will be tagged with a nointer to this effect, to enable the preprocessing sub-comnonent to determine whether a compound or simple form is present in a given text.
Numbers were not introduced into the prototype dictionary.
The parser would accent them if a routine were created that would automatically attribute noun and determiner categories to them.
3. "Transfer" component The transfer component deals with the results obtained by the analysis component.
3.1 . Structural transfer By dealing<with the structural transfer first, one is saved, notably, from having to waste time translating forms that will duly be dropped (such as 'will'), since the adaptation to tense in French is done along with the structural transfer.
The structural transfer operates on the sentence as a whole, on various levels.
It only saves those results of the analysis that are pertinent for the generation.
3.1.1. Sentence The various constituent elements of the clau644 se are rewritten so as to conform to the following seauence : (Passive) + (Negative) + Role + NPl + Auxiliaries + Verb + (NP2) + (NP3) + PP NPI is the deep subject of the clause, NP2 is the direct'object (the attribute or even nothin~ at all if the main verb is of the 'be' type) and NP3 is the indirect object.
All nass\]ve clauses are out into the active voice durlnv the analysis and structural transfer.
These are the transformations that, where necessary, regain the passive voice in the process of generation into French.
3.1.2. Noun Phrase Three rewrites are possible for the noun phrase : Number + Pronoun DNP ('dummy NP') Number + ((Determiner) + Noun + (Adjective) + (Noun) + (PP) + (S)) The rewrite elements are derived from various registers of the analysis result.
3.1.3. Verb Phrase By Verb Phrase is understood here the Auxiliary together with the Main Verb.
This involves 'Auxiliary' in its widest sense, that is comprising all that precedes the verb : tcnse (present, infinitive and/or imperfect), modality and even person.
It should be noted that only third person forms appear in the corpus studied.
The verb phrase rewrites itself extensively in the following manner : (Infinitive) + Present/Imperfect + 3rd.n + (Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + (Modal) + (Avoir/Etre + Past Participle) + Verb To arrive at this rewrite, many rules that combine together are brought into play for various reasons concerning, notably, the multiple feature categories, the treatment of 'be', 'dummy be' and .'dummy modal'.
3.2. Transfer dictionary In En~l\]sh as in other languages, a word may belon~ to several grammatical categories ('all' is at once adverb, determiner and pronoun) or, indeed, the same form may have various dimensions ('read' has the features of infinitive, present (except for the 3rd person in the singular), and past as well as past participle).
Besides, one word in English may have several possible translations in French.
For these reasons, it seemed convenient to create a transfer dictionary situated in between source and target language dictionaries in order to avoid excessive multiplication of relationships and also to facilitate the extension of the system to other language pairs.
Unlike the English terms which are in the dictionary in a complete form, their French translations are presented in canonical form.
3.3. Lexical transfer Lexical transfer operates directly after the structural transfer.
At the moment, it is always the first translation (when there are several possibilities) that is chosen.
One could envisage adapting various means of selecting the best translation, ranging from the human operator to the style index.
4. "Generation" component The generation or synthesis takes place in two stages : the syntactical generation is followed by the morphological generation.
Both of these stages refer to data :from the target-language dictionary as well as from the common data pool.
The generation in French is inspired by the rules of (:homskian generative and transformational grammar, specifically as presented in the work of C.
Nique (Nique, 1978).
Most of the other grammatical theories currently in vogue (Montagov\]an Grammar, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, )... make wide use of semantics and thus necessitate Far more powerful computer resources than those available on micro-computers at present.
4.1. Target-Language dictionary In the target-language dictionary, the different :features allowing :for the agreement of the canonical :forms must be added to the various grammatical categories.
A common data pool is associated with this dictionary.
This enables one to conjugate the verbs correctly (root table and conjugation table), lit also contains the different forms of the determiners and their conditions of usage.
4.2. Syntactical Generation The generation is carried out by means of transformations.
Below are presented those transformations that have a fundamental role in the elaboration of the structure of the sentence in French and in the ordering of its terms.
Others directly concern the morphology of the words, and are outlined briefly later on.
In accordance with the theory of generative and transformational grammar, transformations occur in an orderly manner in an ascending cycle, that is to say :from the inside, outwards, starting with the most subordinate clauses.
Passive Transformation : e.g. : The entire field of booleans can be treated active deep structure Le champ entier de boo16ens peut 8tre trait6.
Transformation of Negation : e.~.
: Each name is an identifier which cannot be a\]located --positive dee~ structure Chaoue nom est un \]dent:ifieur qu\] ne peut pas ~tre allou6.
Transformation of Subordination, which correctly :inserts the subordinate clauses : e.g. : Each bit may be used to store a logical value Chaque \])it ~eut @tre employ6 pour m(moriser une valeur lo~.ique.
Auxiliary Transformation : if, in the rewrite of the verbal nhrase, Avoir/gtre occur, the apDronrJate auxiliary is chosen denending on the feature specified :in the tareet-langua~e dictionary.
Transformation Movement of the Adverb : e.g. : A virtual field item always occupies an :integral number of 4-bit diÂ£its o Un article v:irtue\] du cham~ occune toujours un norabre entier de chiffres de auatre hits.
4.3. ~ornholoqica\] ~enerat:ion The mornholoyical generation :is made up of the following trans:formations : subject-verb a~,reement, conjugation, noun oualifier (which inserts 'de le' between a noun and its comolement), insertion of determiner, noun a-,reement, determiner agreement, adject:ive agreement, placement of adjective, elision and contract:ion.
5. Conclusion The resuJts obtained over a relatively brief neriod by a team of two researchers may he considered as encouragin~ and tend to be o~ timistic as to the :future o:f machine translation or machine-aided translation on small systems.
