The generative probability of the string given it is a LN would be estimated as P(乌苏里江 |LN) = P(乌|<LN>) P(苏|乌) P(里|苏) P(江|里) 4 The detailed description of these models are in Sun et al.(2002), which also describes the use of cache model and the way the abbreviations of LN and ON are handled.

Because any character strings can be in principle named entities of one or more types, to limit the number of candidates for a more effective search, we generate named entity candidates, given an input string, in two steps: First, for each type, we use a set of constraints (which are compiled by 3 Sproat et al.(1996) also studied such problems (with the same example) and uses weighted FSTs to deal with the affixation.

of foreign names As described in Sproat et al.(1996): FNs are usually transliterated using Chinese character strings whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.

Teahan et al., 2000) are trained on a segmented corpus which is not always available.

One example of such approaches is Sproat et al.(1996), which is based on weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).
