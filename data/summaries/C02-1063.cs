For this purpose we refer to the concept of lexical cohesion introduced by (Halliday and Hasan, 1976); see (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Hearst, 1997; Marcu, 2000) who already use this concept for text segmentation.

In order to model this concept of structured connotation, we use the space model M0 of (Rieger, 1984) as a point of departure and derive three text representation models M1, M2, M3.

See (Wolters and Kirsten, 1999) who, following this approach, already used POS frequency as a source for genre classification, a task which goes beyond the scope of the given paper.

Another candidate is given by dependency trees (Rieger, 1984) which are equal to similarity trees (Lin, 1998): for a given root x, the nodes are inserted into its similarity tree (ST) in descending order of their similarity to x, where the predecessor of any node z is chosen to be the node y already inserted, to which z is most similar.

Relying on sparse knowledge resources, they prove to be efficient in cognitive science (Kintsch, 1998; Landauer and Dumais, 1997), computational linguistics (Rieger, 1984; SchÂ¨utze, 1998), and information retrieval.
