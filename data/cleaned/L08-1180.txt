<title>Assisting Translators in Indirect Lexical Transfer</title>

<context>c perspective the lack of generality in equivalents learnt from parallel data can impose fundamental limits on the range of translation solutions that are generated by the data-driven MT systems. In (Babych et al., 2007a) we discuss the problem of indirect translation equivalence, i.e., cases when a word-for-word translation of expressions in a source language (SL) does not render a meaningful expression in a target</context>
<context>lised, e.g., the Europarl corpus for major European languages (Koehn, 2005). Thus the accuracy of models trained on them drops when the models are transferred to another text type in the same domain (Babych, et al, 2007). Moreover, the large (potentially infinite) number of cases like (1) or (2) can render an aligned parallel corpus of the Europarl size too sparse to give an acceptable coverage of problematic phrase</context>
<context>s). The Euronews Interviews corpus is used for testing. We automatically extract multiword expressions from the Euronews corpus using a part-of-speech filter and frequency threshold, as described in (Babych et al, 2007: 138). The corpus is also automatically aligned at the word level with Giza++. Then MWEs on the Russian and English side are matched using these alignments, and those which contain non-dictionary equ</context>
