The ConTroll grammar development system as described in (GStz and Meurers, 1997b) implements the above mentioned techniques for compiling an HPSG theory into typed feature grammars.
J97-4003
Typed feature grammar constraints that are inexpensive to resolve are dealt with using the top-down interpreter of the ConTroll grammar development system (GStz and Meurers, 1997b) which uses an advanced search function, an advanced selection function and incorporates a coroutining mechanism which supports delayed interpretation.

3 (Meurers and Minnen, 1997) propose a compilation of lexical rules into T~r/: definite clauses 2This view of typed feature structures differs from the perspective on typed feature structures as modehng partial information as in (Carpenter, 1992).
J97-4003
(GStz and Meurers, 1997b) describe a method for compiling implicational constraints into typed feature grammars and interleaving them with relational constraints.
J97-4003
This solution is based on the observation that there are sub-computations that are relatively cheap and as a result do not need tabling (Johnson and D6rre, 1995; van Noord, 1997).
J97-3004
The described parser was implemented as part of the ConTroll grammar development system (GStz and Meurers, 1997b).
J97-4003
Typed feature grammars can be used as the basis for implementations of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag, 1994) as discussed in (GStz and Meurers, 1997a) and (Meurers and Minnen, 1997).

See, among others, (Ramakrishnan et al.1992). As shown in (Minnen, 1996) *The presented research was carried out at the University of Tfibingen, Germany, as part of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340.
