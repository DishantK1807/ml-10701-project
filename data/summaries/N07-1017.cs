pattern-based Espresso system Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) is a corpus-based general purpose, broad, and accurate relation extraction algorithm requiring minimal supervision, whose core is based on the framework adopted in (Hearst, 1992).

To do so, Espresso uses a slight modification of the state of the art algorithm described in (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

A pattern-based relation extraction algorithm is particularly likely to extract erroneous relations if it uses generic patterns, which are defined in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) as broad coverage, noisy patterns with high recall and low precision (e.g.

We will also explore the domain restriction property of semantic domains to develop open domain ontology learning systems, as proposed in (Gliozzo, 2006).

Settings As a baseline system, we used the ESPimplementation of Espresso described in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Harvesting algorithms either ignore generic patterns (Hearst, 1992) (affecting system recall) or use manually supervised filtering approaches (Girju et al., 2006) or use completely unsupervised Web-filtering methods (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

The state of the art technology for relation extraction primarily relies on pattern-based approaches (Snow et al., 2006).

syntagmatic and domain information The strategy of integrating syntagmatic and domain information has demonstrated to be fruitful in many NLP tasks, such as Word Sense Disambiguation and open domain Ontology Learning (Gliozzo, 2006).

135 As an evaluation benchmark, we adopted the same instance sets extracted by ESPin the experiment described in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

In this phase generic patterns are detected, and their instances are filtered, using a technique described in detail in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).

Harvested lexical resources, such as concept lists (Pantel and Lin, 2002), facts (Etzioni et al., 2002) and semantic relations (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) could be then successfully used in different frameworks and applications.

In the literature, semantic domains have been inferred from corpora by adopting term clustering methodologies (Gliozzo, 2005), and have been used for several NLP tasks, such as Text Categorization and Ontology Learning (Gliozzo, 2006).
