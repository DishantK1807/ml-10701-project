2:781	These are each specialized computer science research fields with distinct objectives and assumptions.
3:781	The narrower goals involve making it possible for a computer user to employ a near natural-language mode for problem-salving, information retrieval, and other applications.
4:781	Naturdl computer responses have also been created and a special term, "understanding", has been used to describe the resulting computek-human dialogues.
5:781	Phe purpose of this paper is to survey these recent developments to make the A1 literature accessible to researchers mainly interested in computation on written text or spoken language.
6:781	1, INTRODUCTION The computer literature discussed in this paper uses several linguistic terms in special ways, when there is a possibility sf congusion, quotation marks will be used to identify technical terms in computer science.
7:781	The term "understanding" is frequently used as a synonym for "the addition of logical relationships or semantics to syntactic processing".
8:781	This use is substantially qarrower than the word's implicit association with "human behavior implemented by computer'' the narrower use is introduced as a neutral reference point, The question of whether a computer porgram can operate in a human-like way is central to artificial intelligence.
9:781	"Do current 'understanding' program systems show how extended human-like capability can be implemented using computers"?
10:781	is a related pragmatic questton Initially this investigation sought to examine whether programs which "understand" language in the stipulated narrow sense are protatypes which could lead to expanded capability.
11:781	Unfortunately, "language understanding" and its special subtopic "speeeh understanding'' are insufficiently developed to permit profitable discussion of the original question Hence an operational approach to the recent literature is taken here.
12:781	This paper outlines how "language understanding" research has evolved and identifies key elements of program organization used to achieve limited computer "understanding".
13:781	2, LEVEL AND DOMAIN Current A1 programs for lankuage processing are organized by level and restricted to specified domains.
14:781	This section presents those ideas and comments on the limitations that they entail.
15:781	Three principal levels of language-processing software are 1.
16:781	"Lexical" (allowed vocabulary) 2.
17:781	"Syntactic" (allowed phrases or sentences) 3 "Semantic" (allowed meanings) ln practice all these levels must operate many times for the computer to interpret even a small portion, say two words, of restricted natural-language input.
18:781	Programs that perform operations on each level are, respectively, 1.
19:781	Word in a table?
20:781	2.
21:781	Word string acceptable grammatically?
22:781	3.
23:781	Word string acceptable logically?
24:781	A program to detect "meaning" (logical consequences of word interpretations) must also perform grammatical operations for certain words to determine a part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc).
25:781	One method makes a tentative assigrlment, parses, then tests for plausibility via consistency with known facts.
26:781	To reduce the complexity of this task, the designer limits the subset of language allower or the "world" (i.e. the subject) discussed.
27:781	The word "domain" sums up this concept, other terms for "restricted domain" are "limited scope of discourse", "narrow problem domain", and "restricted English framework" The limitation of vocabulary or context constrains the lexicon and semantics of the "language".
28:781	The trend in the design of software for "natural-language understanding" is to deal with (a) a specialized vocabulary, and (b) a particular context or set of allowed interpretations in order to reduce processing time.
29:781	Although computing results for several highly specialized problems Le,g. 7, 231 are impressive examples of language processing in restricted domains, they do not answer several key concerns.
30:781	1.
31:781	Do specialized vocabularies have sufficient complexity to warrant comparison with true natural language?
32:781	2.
33:781	Are current "understanding" programs, organized by level and using domain reatrictidn, extendable to true natural language?
34:781	The realities are severe.
35:781	Syntactic processing is interdependent with meaning and involves the allowed logical relationships among words %n the lexicon.
36:781	Most natural-language software is highly developed at the "syntactic" level Howwer, the number of times the "syntactic" level must be ent'ered can grow explosively as the "naturalness" of the language to be processed increases.
37:781	Success on artificial domains cannot imply a great deal about processing truly natural language.
38:781	3, PROGRAM SYSTEMS The systems cited in this section answer questions, perform commands, or conduct dialogues.
39:781	Programs that enable a user to execute a task via computer in an on-line mode are generally called "interactive" Some systems are so rich in their language-processing capability that they are called "conversational" Systems that have complicated capabilities and can reply with a sophisticated tesponse to an inquiry are called "question answering".
40:781	The survey [I] discusses two "conversational" pkograms ELIZA [2, 31 and STUDENT [41, which answers questions regarding algebraic word problems.
41:781	SIR [51 answers questions about logic.
42:781	Both [41 and [51 appear in [61, the introd,rction there provides a general discussion of "semantic information and computer programs involving "semantics" The "question-answering" program systems described in [2-51 were sophisticated mainly in methods of solving a problem or determining a response to a statement.
43:781	Other systems have emphasized the retrieval of facts encoded in English.
44:781	The "blocks-world" system described in [71 contrasts with these in that it has sophisticated language-processing capability It infers antecedents of pronouns and resolves ambiguities in input word strings regarding blocks on a table.
45:781	The distinction between "interactive", "conversational", and "question-answering" is less important when the blocks-world is the.
46:781	domain.
47:781	The computer-science contribution is a program to interaet,wfth the domain as if it could "underktand" the input, in the sense that it takes the proper action even when the input is somewhat ambiguous.
48:781	To resolve ambiguities the program refers to existing relationships among the blocks.
49:781	The effect of [71 was to provide a sophisticated example of computer "understanding" which led to attempts to apply similar principLes to speech inputs.
50:781	(More detail on parallel developments in speech processing is presented later).
51:781	The early "language-understanding" systems, BASEBALL [9], ELLZA, and STUDENT, were based on two special formats: one to represent the knowledge they store and one to find meaning in the English input.
52:781	They discard all input information which cannot be transformed for internal storage.
53:781	The comparison of ELIZA and STUDENT in [I] is with regard to the degree of "understanding" ELIZA responds either by transfoiming the input sentence (essentially mimicry) following isolation of a key word or by using a prestored content-free remark.
54:781	STUDENT translates natural-language "descriptions of algebraic equations,  proceeds to identify the unknowns involved and the relationships which hold between them, and (obtains and solves) a set of equations" [I, p 851.
55:781	Hence ELIZA munderstands" only a few key words; it transf6rms these words via a seatence-reassembly rule, discards other parts of the sentence, and adds stock phrases to create the response.
56:781	STUDENT solves the underlying algebraic problem-i t "unders'tands" in that it "answers questions based on information contained in the input" [4, p. 1351 . ELIZA responds but does not "understand", since the reply has little to do with the information in the input sentence, but rather serves to keep the person in a dialogue.
57:781	Programs with an ability to spout back similar to ELIZA's usually store a body of text and an indexing scheme to it.
58:781	This approach has obvious limitations and was replaced by systems that use a formal representation to store limited logical concepts associated with the text.
59:781	One of them is SIR, which can deduce set relationships anong objects described by natural language.
60:781	SIR is designed to meet the requirement that "in addition tu echoing, upon request, the facts it has been given, a machine which 'understands' must be able to recognize the logical implications of those facts.
61:781	It alqo must be able to identify (from a large data store) facts which are relevant to 8 particular question'' [51 . Limited-logic systems are important because they provide methods to represent complex facts encoded in English-language statements so that the facts can be used by computer programs or accessed by a person who did not input the original textual statement of the fact.
62:781	Such a second user may employ a completely different form of language encoding.
63:781	Programs of this sort include DEACON [lo, 111 and the early version of CONVERSE [121.
64:781	The former could "handle time questions" and used a bottom-up analysis method which allowed questions to be nested.
65:781	For example, the question "Who is the commander of the battalion at Fort Fubar"?
66:781	was handled by first internally answering the questian "What battalion is at Fort Fubar"?
67:781	The answer was then substituted directly into the original question to make ic "Who is the commander of the 69th battalion"?
68:781	which the system then answered.
69:781	[7, p. 371 CONVERSE contained provisions for allwing even more complex forms of input questions (Recent versions are described in 113-151 ).
70:781	Deductive systems can be divided into general systems which add a flrst-order predicate-calculus theorem-proving capability to limited-loglc systems to improve the complexity oE the facts they can "infer", and proccdurnl systcms which enable other computations to obtain complex information The theorem-proving capability is designed to work Erom a group of logical statements given as input (or statements consistent with the'se input s-tements) However, facts INCONSISTENT with the original statements cannot always be detected and deductive systems quickly become impractical as the number of input statements (elementary facts, axioms) becomes large [b, 7, 161, since the time to obtain a proof grows to an impractical length.
71:781	Special programming languages (e.g. QA4 [17, 181, PLANNER [20, 211 ), have added strategy capabilities and better methods of problem representation to reduce computing time to practical values QA4 (seeks) to develop natural, intuitive representations of problems and problem-solving programs.
72:781	(The user can) blend  procedural and declarative information that includes explicit instructions, intuitive advice, and semantic definitions.
73:781	171 However, there is currently no body of evidence regarding the effectiveness of the programs written in this programming language or related ones on problem-solving tasks in general or "lapguage understanding1' in particular.
74:781	There is a need for experimental evaluation of the strategies that the progsahing language permits for "language understanding" problems.
75:781	Procedural deductive systems facilitate the augmentation of an existing store of complex information.
76:781	Usually systems require a new set of subprograms to deal with new data: each change in a subprogram may affect more of the other subprograms.
77:781	The structure grows more awkward and difficult to generalize.
78:781	Finally, the.
79:781	system may become too unwieldy for further expkrimentation.
80:781	15, p. 911 In procedural systems the software is somewhat modular In 19 "semantic primitives" were assumed to exist as LISP subroutines.
81:781	PLANNER 1201 allows complex information to be expressed as procedures without requiring user involvement with the details of interaction anong procedures (but [21] reports some second thoughts).
82:781	The work of many other groups could be added to this survey.
83:781	Recent work on REL, building on on [lo, 111 is reported in [36, 371; [24, 251 are relevant collections; and [26] is a survey paper.
84:781	4, DEDUCTION In all of the program systems described thus far, "language understanding" depends on the "deductive capabilities" of the *Some experiments on problem-solving effectiveness of special programing languages in another context appear in [22].
85:781	program, that is, its ability to "infer" facts and rela.tionships from given statements.
86:781	In some cases deduction involves discerning structure in a set of facts and relatimships.
87:781	This section describes how "imderstanding" prOgrAmS qhemselves are structured and how that structure limits tfheir capability for general deduction.
88:781	Theorem-proving programs use an inference rule illustrated in [23 p. 611 to deduce new knowledge.
89:781	A formal succession of 1ogi.cal steps called resolutions leads to the new fact.
90:781	The example there begins with P1 P4 given: P1 if x is part of v, and if v is part of y, then x is part of y; P2 a finger is part of a hand; P3 a hand is part of an arm; P4 an arm is part of a man A pr'oof that P9 a finger is part of a man is derived by steps, such as combining P1 and P2 to get P6 if a hand is part of y, then a finger is part of y Unfortunately, it is easy to move outside the domain where the computer can make useful deductions, and the formal resolution process is extremely lengthy and thus prohibitively costly in computer time.
91:781	In [31, 321 it is shown that some statements ("whol did not write ---?It) are unanswerable and that there is no algorithm which can detect whether a question stated in a zero-one logical form can beb answered.
92:781	Henc.e theorem proving is not: e-sential to "deduction" and "understanding" systems, natural or artificial, must rely on other techniques, e.g., outside information such as knowledge about Lhe domain.
93:781	In most "understanding" programs, information on a primi tive level of processing can be inaccurate; for example, the identification of a sound string "blew" can be inaccurately "blue" Subsequent processing levels combine identified primitives.
94:781	If parts of speech are concerned, the level is syntactic; if meaning is involved, "semantic"; if domain is involved, the lave1 is that of the "world".
95:781	Sach level can be an aid in a deductive process, leading to "understanding" an input segment of language.
96:781	Programs NOW EXIST which operationally satisfy most of the following points concerning "understanding" in narrow domains (emphasis has been added) Perhaps tha most importaht criterion for undersvanding a language is the ability TO RELATE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED in a sentence TO KNOWLEDGE PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED.
97:781	This IMPLIES HAVING SOME KIND OF MEMORY STRUCTURE IN WHICH THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF VARIOUS PIECES OF KNOWLEDGE ARE STORED AND INTO WHICH NEW INFORMATION MAY BE FJTTED  The memory structure in these programs may be regarded as 3emantic, cognitive, or conceptual structures.
98:781	,.these programs can make statements or answer questions based not only an the individual statemegts they were previausly told, but also On THOSE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONCEPTS that were built up from separate sentences as information was incorporated into the structure  THE MEANINGS OF THE TERMS STORED IN MEMORY ARE PRECISELY THE TOTALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY HAVE WITH OTHER TERMS IN THE MEMORY.
99:781	[28 pp.
100:781	3-4) This has been accomplished through clever (and lengthy) computer programming, and by taking advantage of structure inherent in special proklem domains such as stacking blocks on a table, moving chess pieces, and retrieving facts about a large naval organization.
101:781	Program systems for understanding begin with a "front end": a portion designed to transform language input into a computer representatiort.
102:781	The representation may be as simple as a character-by-character encoding of alphabetic, space marker, and punctuation elements.
103:781	However, a complex "front end" could involve word and phrase detection anti encoding.
104:781	The usual computer science term fol a computer representation is "data structure'' [271 and there are many types.
105:781	The language processimg program DEACON used ring sqructures 1111, a representation frequently used to store queues.
106:781	In principle a data structure can represent involved associations, but in practice simple order or ancestor relationships predominate Completely different and far more complex types of structure are inherent in natural language.
107:781	For example, from 1281 "The-professors signed a petition".
108:781	is not true.
109:781	has for valid interpretations: (a) The professors DIDN'T sign a petition.
110:781	(b) THE PROFESSORS didn't sign a petition.
111:781	(c) The professors didn't sign a PETITION.
112:781	(d) The professors di'dn't SIGN a petition: Iterative substitution of alternatives to deduce overall meaning yields cumbersome processing, especially when there are nested uncertainties.
113:781	The recursive properties associated with the data structure term "list" [271 are not easily adapted to multiple meanings.
114:781	Hence, representing linguistic data for computation is ah opwr and fundamental researrh problem.
115:781	Nevertheless, the programs which de~uce facts from language do so withnut a clear best technique for computer representation.
116:781	To do this, restrictions on the language implicit in the input domain are used, and repeated processing by level (lexical, syntactic, semantic) is used in the absence of an efficient representation language.
117:781	Data structures that facilitate following the language structure are needed Existing programs provide special solutions to the problems of deductive processing in narrow language domains While these programs are not a general breaktht-ough in reuresenting language data for computation, they demonstrate that current programming t.echniques enable a us.eful "understanding" capability Furthermore, tbere is a reql potential for use ot the "understanding" in an interactive node to facilitate use of computers by nonspecialists and to tap fhe more sophisticated human understanding capabilities 5 INTERACT I ON Research and computer program development desrgned to store multitudes of facts so that they can be accessed [29] qx combined [301 and "unders,tood (see pp.
118:781	3-10 in [301') in linguistic form (see pp.
119:781	11-17 of [30]) is highly relevant to recent research programs in text and speech understanding.
120:781	When such a system is used a user might fail to get a fact or relataonship because the natural-language subset chosen to represent his question was too righ--i.e. , it includes a complex set of logical relationships not in the computer.
121:781	Thos a block could result in a human-computer dialogue if the program has no logical connection between "garage" and "car" but only between "garage" and "house" (the program replies "OK" or "??'!I1 to user input sentences) I LIKE CHEVROLETS.
122:781	OK CHEVROLETS ARE Eco~oMICAL.
123:781	OK M.Y HOUSE HAS A LARGE GARAGE.
124:781	OK I CAN GET TWO IN ???
125:781	The computer failed to "understand" that there was no change of discourse subject.
126:781	This is an example of a "semantfo" failure whi~h could be overcome by interaction.
127:781	That is; the human user would need to dnput one more meaning or association of a valid word so that computer "understanding" may be achieved.
128:781	Syntactic blocks may also occur.
129:781	M. Denicoff pointed out that in [7] 172 different syntactic features were used fox a situation where there are no statements with psychological content and no use of simile.
130:781	If the psychological meanings are added as in 1381, these features would not be enough to describe all the possible meanings of a text drawn from a less artificial soprce.
131:781	Indeed, a key problem which formal granhars seem ill-suited for is the reality that many contexts may-be sifiultaneousLy valid: multiple meanings give natural-language communication the richness of ovextones, ana subtleties--poetry carries this ta an extreme.
132:781	The above dialogue on "Chevroletsl' is an example of what Carbonell [39, p. 1941 called "mixed-initiative discourse".
133:781	This important aspect of interaction is considered in the LISP program DWIM ("Do What I .Mean1'), which is a useful working tool for text-input error correction precisely because it "understands" the user's character~stics .
134:781	(For example, typical spelling errors ).
135:781	This is discussed by Teitelman 140, 41,, 421 A great deal of effort has been put into making DWI-N '-'smartn.
136:781	Expkrience with perhaps a dazen different users indichtes we have been very successful: DWIM seldom fails to correct an error the user feels it should have, and almost never mistakenly corrects an error.
137:781	[40, p. 111 Another limited-discourse interactive program 1431 facilitates introduction of expert knowledge on 7hess.
138:781	The program uses search with a maxitnum look-ahead depth of 20 and has backtracking capability; both s,yntactic and semantic knowledge is incorporated.
139:781	By grouping similar board positions (i.e. , all involving a piece on cell 1, all involving a queen moue), it imposes semantic organization on the vast files to be searched and improves syntactic processing speed Bublication of 1443, which coined the term "speech understanding", initiated,the natural next,step toward use of the computer's "understandfng" capability.
140:781	The goal of easy intqraction with the computer becomes more exciting with speech as input medium.
141:781	Systems to recognize both text and speech have used syntax and context [45, 461, but [471 added a comprehensive approach using multiple processing levels to resoLve ambiguities.
142:781	, In the dkrect successors of this work [ 8, 491, the same Frocess of parriaL acceptance of primitive elements (phonemic candidates from digitized acoustic data) followed by lexical, syntactic, and semantic processing ko rank alternatives has shown significant success.
143:781	Reddy (in a,Carnegie-Mellon University film on the Hearsay System) sta-tee hat on 144 connected utterances, involving 676 words, obtained from 5 speakers, performing 4 tasks (chess, news retrieval, medical diagnosis, and desk calculator use), req.uiring 28 to 76-word vocabul~ries, t,he computer program recognition, in terms of words spotted and identified correctly, was a. 89% with all sources of kmm1edge . 67% without use of semantic bowledge c. 44% without use of sptactic or semantic knowledge These results were obtained in October 1973, and have been improved since [501.
144:781	However, a key limitation of this form of computer speech "understandkng" is response rate.
145:781	Reddy estimated that the third w~rd-accuracy figure (without use of syntactic and semantic knowledge) would have to be in excess of 90% to allow the program to achieve a near-human response speed.
146:781	The nature of computer "understanding" programs leads to problems of combinatoric explosion in number of alternatives and this lessens the usefulness of multilevel program organization (acoustic-phonetic, lexical, syntactic, semantic, domain, and user interactions) as much in speech processing as in text pro.cessing.
147:781	Prototype speech "understanding" systems have been build 149, 501 and newer acoustic-phonetic and syntactic techniques have been incorporated into this work [49, 51, 521, yet it seems clear that the development of theory in prosody and grammar cannot provide a breakthrough to escape the combinatoric explosion.
148:781	The reason is that the search of parse rrees and the use of semantics (look up related words) depend on a single context--both take geometrica'lly increasing amounts of computing time as the number of contexts grows.
149:781	Furthermore, this increase in time is added onto that which occurs when the size of lexicon is expanded.
150:781	ks words are added, the number of trees that can Be-produced by the grammar's rewriting rules in an attempt to "recognize" a string expqnds rapidly.
151:781	Hence in speech as in text processing, "under,standihgn1 exists via computer yet it is not likely to lead to rhachine processing of truly natural language.
152:781	Indeed the artificiality of speech "understanding" by computer is even greater than that of text input.
153:781	The "moon rocks" text system [33, 351 used a vocabulary of 3500 words, while the speech "understanding" version based on it [5M used only 250 words.
154:781	The COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY of systems that recognize isolated words with 98.5% accuracy [531* and the need for a rapid human-computer input interface [54] promise that the last word has not been spoken on "understanding".
155:781	Research and development on language handling systems is continuing in the hope of achieving useful "understanding".
156:781	Indeed, Stanford Research,Institute's Artificial Intelligence Center is basing its current work on the just-mentioned isolated-word recognizer.
157:781	It is likeap that useful developments will occur where language, and probably spoken-language, "understanding" will be exhibtred.
158:781	These developments will occur through careful design of tasks and use of advances in computer technology However, the general problem of machine' "understanding" of natural language-whether text Dr speechis not likely to be aided by these developments.
159:781	7 CONCLUS IONS A large body of research in computer science is devoted to language processing.
160:781	A survey of the program systems that *Threshold Technology Inc. has sold such a system to several users.
161:781	Their VIP-100 includes a miriicamputer dedicated to the recognition task; there are otker isolated-word systems [541 have been reported shows that two main goals have emerged: 1 To enable "intelligent" processing by the computer ("hrtificial intelligence") 2.
162:781	To produce a more useful way to access daa and solve problems ("man-machine interaction") Techniques in artificial intelligence and speech recognition have been developed to the extent that prototype computer program systems which exhibit "understanding" have been developed for highly limited conrexts.
163:781	To extend these programs to larger subsets of natural language poses problens, it is unlikely that any of the yesearch directivns currently being explored will of thewselves "solve" the I1na.tural lan guage problem".
164:781	(The techniques include, but are not limited to, further developments in artificial intelligence programming languages [17, 18 20, 21, 551.
165:781	refinements in theories of grammar; improved deductive ability, possibly by better theorem-proving techniques; and the introduction of stressrelated features in the ehcoding of speech [52].
166:781	A useful collection of language models appears in [56]).
167:781	Nevertheless, prorotype systems for "understanding" both text and speech are useful achievements of engineering, and spoken entry of data by humans to computers is beginning to be established by isolated-word re-cognizers which use a minicomputer dedicated to the task.
168:781	A multiplicity of purposes beyond this simple but practical task of data entry are mentioned briefly in the foregoing discussion of "interaction".
169:781	Developments along, the many diverse paths indicated under that heading are likely to be rapid in the future as practical "understanding" of subsets of language becomes part of computer technology Far another view of the evolution of that process, see [57].

246:781	Records can be actions, words, verb phrases, etc. There are three kinds of attributes: relations, whose value is a pointer to other records; properties, with values either numbers or character strings; and indicators, whose values have a role similar to linguistic featires.

252:781	This theory rek jects 'backup as a standard contro mechamsm for parsing.
253:781	A grammar is a set of modules.
254:781	The parser works on two levels, a group level and a clause level.
255:781	Group level modules work on a word buffer and build group level structures.
256:781	Modules have a pattern, a pretest procedure and a body to be executed if the pattern matches and the pretest succeeds.
257:781	If the parser fails, it keeps the structure constructed to date, and makes whatever substructures it can from the remaining part.

260:781	Semantics Discourse Brian Phillips Department of Information Engineering University of Illinois at Chicago Circle Doctoral dissertation, State University of New York, Buffalo, 1975 A theory for the structure of discourse is developed.
261:781	It is sh~wn that proposi~ions of a coherent discourse must be logically cbnnected and exhibit a hierarchic thematic structure that has a single root.
262:781	An eqample of a logical connective is 'Cause'; a theme is a generalized pattern that is associated with a single word, e.g., 'poison' is describable as 'Someone ingests something that causes him to become ill'.
263:781	A theme applies to a discourse if 2ts definiens matches part of the discourse.
264:781	The topic of a coherent discourse is its matrix theme; an illformed discourse has no topic.
265:781	Not all discourse structure is expressed.
266:781	If omitted, it must be inferrable.
267:781	The process of inference requires a store of world knowledge encyclopedic knowledge.

295:781	If semantic primitives are seen as essentially djtfferent from words, this leads to attempts to justify them directly, usually psychological~y. Otherwise the justification is merely that they work.
296:781	Primitives can be taken as a small natural language, with no essential difference betQeen primitives and mrde.
297:781	But the set of primitives cannot be extended indefinitely.
298:781	ptherwise the distinction between the representation end the nntural language will be lost.

337:781	One kind of inference in comprehension is in the context of given-new information: the speaker tries to construct the given and new information of each utterance, so that the listener is able to compute unique antecedents for the given information, and so that he will not already have the new information attached to the antecedent.

392:781	REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING Preface Jaime Carbonell was our friend and colleague.
393:781	For many years he worked with 11s on problems in Artificial Intelligence, especially on the developrnerit of RII intelligent instructionnl system.
394:781	Jainle directed the Artificinl Intelligence group et Bolt, Deranek, and Ncwman (in Cambridge, Massnchusetts) until his death in 1973.
395:781	Some of us who hod worlred with Jaime decided to hold a conference in his nlemory, a confcrerlce whose guiding principle wonld be that Jaime would have enjoyed it.
396:781	This book is the result of that conferencb.
397:781	Jain~e Carbonell's isnportant contribution to cognitive science is best sumnlarized in the title of one of his publicatio~ls: A7 irt CAI.
398:781	Jaime wanted to put principles oE Aritificial Intelligence into Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) systems.
399:781	He dreamed of a system which had a data base of knowledge about a topic matter and general information about language and the principles of tutorial instruction.
400:781	The system could then pursue a natural tutorial dialog with a student; sometimes following the student's initiative, sometimes taking its own intiative, but always generating its statements rind responses in a natural way from its general knowledge.
401:781	This system contrasts sharply with existing systems for Computer-Assisted Instruction in which a relatively fixed sequence of questions and possible reponses have to be determined for each topic.
402:781	Jaime did construct working versions of his &ream--in a system which he called SCHOLAR.
403:781	But he died befoi-e SCHOLAR reached the full realization of the dream.
404:781	It was a pleasure to work with Jaime.
405:781	His kindness and his enthusiasm were infectious, and the discussions we had with him over the years were a great stimulus to our own thinking.
406:781	Both as a friend and a colleague we miss him greatly.
407:781	Cognitive Science.
408:781	This book contains studies in a new field we call cognitive science.
409:781	Cognitive science includes elements of psychology, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, and education, but it is more than the intersection of these disciplines.
410:781	Their integration has produced a new set of tools for dealing with a broad range REPRESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING of questions.
411:781	In recent years, the interdctions among the workers in these fields has led to exciting new developments in our undemtanding of intelligent systems and the development of a science of cognition.
412:781	The group of workers has pursued problem$ that did not appear to be solvable from within any single discipline.
413:781	It is too early to predict the future course of this new interaction, but the work to date has been stimulating and inspiring.
414:781	It is our hope that this book can serve as an illustrntion of the type of problems Chat can be qq~roached through interdisciplinary cooperation.
415:781	The participants in this book (and at the conference) represent the fields sf Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, and Psychology, all of whom work on similar problems but with different viewpoints.
416:781	The book focuses on the common problems, hopefully acting as a way of bringing these issues to the attention of all workers in those fields related to cognitive science.
417:781	Subject Matter.
418:781	The book contains four sections.
419:781	In the first section, Theory of Representotion, general issues involved in building representations of knowledge are explored.
420:781	Daniiel G. Bobrow proposes that solutions to a set of design issues be used as dimensions for comparing different represetltations, and he examines different forms such solutions might take.
421:781	William A. Woods explores problems in representing natural-language statements in semantic networks, illustrating difficult theoretical issues by examples.
422:781	Joseph D. Becker is concerned with the representation one can infer for behavioral systems whose internal workings cap not be observed directly, and he considers the interconnection of useful concepts such as hierarchical organization, system gaals, and resource conflicts Robert J. Bobrow and John Seely Brown present a model for an expert understander which can take a collection of data &scribing some situation, synthesize a contingent knoultedge structure which places the input drrta in the context of a larger structural organization, and which answers questions about the situation based only on the contingent knowledge structure.
423:781	Section two, New Memory Models, discusses the implications of the assumption that input information is always interpreted in terms of large structural units derived REPFLESENTATION AND UNDERSTANDING from esporionce.
424:781	Daniel G. Bobrow and Donnld A. Norman postulate active sciicrnnla in memory which r~fer to each other through use of car~tuxl-deper~derlt descriptions, and whir11 respo~irl both to input data and to hypothcs~s about structure.
425:781	Benjamin J. Kuipers describes thc conc~l)t of a frame us a structural organizing unit for data ele~nents, nnd he discusses the use of these units in the context of n recognition system.
426:781	Terry Winogrod explores issues i~lvolved in the controversy on rcl~rcsc~lting knowledge iu declarative vcrsus procedural form.
427:781	Winogr~tl uses the concept of a frame ns a basis for the synthesis of the declarative and proccdural tipproaches.
428:781	The frame provides an organizing structure on which to attach both declarative and procedural informhtion.
429:781	The third section, lligher Level Structures, focuses on the representation of plans, episodes, and stories within memory.
430:781	David E. Rumelhart proposes a grammar for wellformed stories.
431:781	'His summarization rules for stories based on this grammar seem to provide reasonable predictions of human behavior.
432:781	Roger C. Schank postulates that in understanding paragraphs, the reader fills in causal connections between propositions, and that such causally linked chains are the basis for most human memory organization.
433:781	Robert P Abelson defines a notation in which to describe the intended effects of plans, and to express the conditions necessary for achieving desired states.
434:781	The fourth section, Semantic Knowledge in Understander Systems, describes how knowledge has been used in existing systems.
435:781	John Seely.Brown and Richard R. Burton describe a system which uses multiple representations to achieve expertise in teachiog a student about debugging electronic circuits.
436:781	Bonnie Nash-Webber describes the role played by semantics in the understanding of continuous speech in a limited domain of discourse.
437:781	Allan Collins, Eleanor H. Warnock, Nelleke Aiello, and Mark L. Viller describe a continuation of work on Jaime Carbonell's SCHOLAR system.
438:781	They examine how liumans use strategies to find reasonable answers to questions for which they do net have the knowledge to answer with certainty, and how people can be taught to reason this way.

462:781	Frames are static structures about one stereotyped topic Each frame has many statements about the topic, each expressed in a suitable semantic representation.
463:781	The primary goal in understanding is to find instances of frame statements in the discourse Questions about a source statement can be answered by reference to the frame of which it is en instance.

Hays Department of Linguistics State University of New York at Buffalo Journal of Clinical Computing, 3, 110-118, 1973 By systematic application of a cognitive network or similar theory of knowledge the internal structure of a (medical) code can be improved and tools developed for different purposes.
465:781	Hays's theory uses paradigmatic, syntagmatic, discursive, attitudinal, and metalingual (MTL) arcs.
466:781	The MTL arcs shift level of abstraction; e.g., anemia is neither a fewness nor an erythrocyte but an abstract condition.
467:781	An abstract definition can include several syntagmatic propositions, linked discursively.
468:781	A medical term can be linked by MTL to definitions in different languages (clinical, ~athophysiological, etc).

475:781	Tulving's episodic memory is seen as a record of experiences and their context.
476:781	However, both episodic and semantic memories must have similar power of representation, so their structures are not disttnguishable.
477:781	Similarly, a lexical memory must have the power to represent propositional information about words.
478:781	Thus, the fabric of knowledge is merely cut into different shapes.

484:781	The distinction between semantic and episodic memory is not so much one between different kinds of memo, but one between dif'K ferent kinds of knowledge.
485:781	The dbtinction as been rejected, because it is said that since we know everything Erom experience, there is no room for the distinction.
486:781	The error lies in confusing knowledge from knowledge, and knowledge of knowledge.
487:781	Semantic knowledge is knowledge that has been reorganized around concepts from knowledge originally encoded around events; it fs stripped of personal experience.
488:781	One question raised by the distinction is how does information get into semantic memory, and how and when does it get 10s t from episodic memory.

491:781	There is evidence that people use three-dimensional models and that they integrate several views into a single model.
492:781	This is counter to the claim that we symbolically store a large number of separate views.
493:781	Another problem is with the assumption of default values for slots in frames.
494:781	In the extreme, this gives visual perception without vision.
495:781	The evidence is that people can understand totally unexpected images presented for quite short pexiods.
496:781	A rhird point concerns the telatively static nature of frames.
497:781	A better model is to condtruct a goal oriented subsystem making use of context specific knowledge.

528:781	Artificial Intelligence has had at least four benefits for the study of natural language: (a) emphasis on complex stored structures, (b) emphasis pn the importance of real world knowledge, (c) em hasis on the communicative function of sentences in context, and (dy emphasis on the expression of rules, structure and information within the operational environment.
529:781	The only test of a natural language system is its success on a task, any demand for more theory must bear this in mind.
530:781	Neither can recent work in A1 be regarded as theoretical; it is the semi-formal expression of intuition.

545:781	A model of reasoning about human action must include (1) how people arrive at a plan, (2) what can count as a reason for choosing to perform the plan, and (3) discovering plans and motivations from observation or linguistic report of actions.
546:781	A plan is the internal representation or set of beliefs about how a particular goal may be achieved.
547:781	The belief by an observer that an actor performed one act to enable a second to be performed can follow neither from deductive nor inductive reasoning.
548:781	An observer may have other propositions that are reasons for believing or nut believing that a plan correctly characterizes the beliefs of the actor.
549:781	An act name organizes a set of beliefs about how a move of this type might relate to other moves, and the cognitive and motivational statea of the actors.

Englewood Cliffs New Jersey 1975 Reviewed by Norman Badler Department of Computer and Informatian Science The Moore School of Electrical Engineering University of Pennsylvania Among popular computer progrdg languages, SNOBOL4 stands out as the only one offering complex pattern definition and mtching capabilities.
551:781	It also has a flexible function definition facility and programmer-defined data types.
552:781	While not unique, these two features encourage problem-dependent extensions of the language.
553:781	All ?bee aspects of SNOBOLA fom the basic tools in Griswold's new book Intended as a text for the SNC1BON user (it is not an "introductoryt' text), it presents techniques for the representation and manipulation of data in string, list, or otherwise "structured" fm.
554:781	The text includes my programed examples, problems with a wide range of difficulty, and answers to my of these problems.
555:781	The first Shree chapters develop pattern matching, function definition, and data s-tructures.
556:781	The last four chapteFs examine particular application domiins: mthemtics, cryptography, document ~rpar-~or, Plus a few more specialized problems.
557:781	Although this my seem tb ignore cqutational linguistics, the greatest imnediate benefit for the pmgranurter lies in the fFrst the chapters anyway.
558:781	Within Chap 1, the section on gramws and patterns can be used for the inIplemntation of simple syntactic analysis.
559:781	For exaqle, there is a straightforward mpping of a BNf g~mmar into SNOBON patterns, but there are pitfalls (as well as scsne more efficient representations in the balance) that the programer ought to know.
560:781	These are c'arefully explained.
561:781	A topic that I felt was inadequately covered in Chapter 1 was the definition of the pattern mtching mechanism itself.
562:781	The immediate presentation of examples using pattern rratchhg (page 2) calls for a brief overview of pattern mtchhg syntax and seman-tics.
563:781	Surely a progrwnnw?
564:781	muld appreciate not having to refer back to his in.troductory text should some patten function or construct bebhazy in his memory.
565:781	Even an appendix wuld be satisfactory.
566:781	In addition, this would support the section on ptterns as procedures by providing the underlying semantics for such tlprocedures.
567:781	EUrther incentive for its inclusion is provided by.
568:781	the excellent review of progt-annner-defined data types in Chapter 3.
569:781	Why leave pattern mtching to the userJ.s recollection?
570:781	The function definition facility discussed in Chapter 2 eraables the constructic of generic functions.
571:781	Since there are no data type declarations for function argunents or parwters, often only one function is required for the execution of related op&ations.on various data types.
572:781	The proliferation of functions in a complex system might therefore be systemtically reduced.
573:781	, The burdeg falls on the progrmer, of course, to sort out +he admissible combinatians or appropriate actions.
574:781	An addition function for real and cmplex numbers is discussed, where the fom is a SNOBOL4 primitive and the latter is constructed from pmgrmerdefined data types.
575:781	Although not in the realm of cqutatiowl linguistics, it does have a parallel, for exmple, in a function whi& inserts data into a semantic network and is expected to handle various chunks of netwmk as well as atomic data.
576:781	The data type might only be determined.
577:781	during prop execution; using a generic function avoids distracting logic within the user's primary function.
578:781	The section on functions as generators is a little weak from the point of view of computational linguistic requirements fa procedures which generate successive alterna?ives frcmn a complex s-tructure, for example, sentence parsing or referent resolution.
579:781	The use of sjmple global variables is tm lMted in these contexts; one often heeds to become involved with saving the values of ~e~eral lwal variables in special data blocks or stacking the decision pints associated with alternatives.
580:781	The first is a well-known compiler-design technique, while he second involves a backbxicking control struc'hxe.
581:781	In fact, an excellent illustration of these ideas would be an implementation of the SfJOBOL4 pattern matohing system in SNOBON.
582:781	Chapter 3 is the mst useful because it desmibes how propammer-defined data types can be used to build "sh.u~tures~~: stacks, queues, lhked lists, binary trees, am3 trees.
583:781	The skillful user of such representations will find a reduced role for complicated patterm mtchhg expressions because the implicit structure &coded into a string becomes dfest in the explicit links of the shcture.
584:781	Not only is there often an economic advantage, but the semmtics of SNOBOL4-are easier to use than the implicit itcMracking semantics of pattern mtching.
585:781	(Grimold himself phts this out in the section on patterns as procedures.
586:781	The prog~mner is encouraged to consider economic trade-offs in the hplemehtation of stcuchuws.
587:781	Often overlooked questions are addressed: for example, the relative merits of implementing stacks using strings, arrays, tables, or defined data types.
588:781	Programs for the use or traversal of structures are also provided.
589:781	Although exercise 3.40 requests a representation for directed graphs, neither hint nor answer is pvided.
590:781	The canputatid linguist having an hterest in smtic networks or similar associative structures is thus lef-t to his own expertise.
591:781	?he basic -tree representation mst be significantly dified to incorporate labelled edges, a nears of eaversal (search) thmqh the edge set, and, of course, non-txee structures.
592:781	Gritwold apologizes for not covering every application, 6 8 but the generality and current popularity of networks for the representation of knowledge calls for expanded treatment of the topic.
593:781	Among the appSications covered in detail, the ones most relevant to ccsnputational linguistics include a Mndom sentence generator (fm a pra~~~nar), an mcm processor, and (perhaps) a context editor.
594:781	The input and output of textual mterial is covered in depth undw d6cument prepmtion (Chapter 6).
595:781	Since the text does not delve into computational linguisfics pw se, the reader (or instructor) will dften be called upon to map techniques described in the text onto his own problem.
596:781	I think that a gkd programer muld be able to perform this 'transformation since solutions are provided for my of the basic problems in handling input text, setting up data structures, and traversing these structmes . Before you begin programming your next computational linguistics project, a glance thr"ough this book my save you considerable programing time and reward you with usable and flexible data structures.
597:781	Even if you do not program in SNOBOL4, the techniques presented here might guide you to more efficient usage of other languages.
598:781	On the other hand, it might convince you to try SNOBOLU.

Miller St. Olaf College A practical guide for the occasional Fortran TV programmer to the basic "tricks" and vocabulary used by the systems programmers.
600:781	his boo^ ranges over topics from plotting on a line printer to hashing and basic storage structures (stacks, queues, etc).
601:781	using a concise, to-the-point writing style.
602:781	This style reinforces the stated intention of the book, which is to heLp a programmer with a problem by providing descriptions of non-mathematical techniques.
603:781	The style and intention do limit the usefulness of this book, as some of the topics would be well known to advanced programmers and are not covered in sufficient depth for such a person.
604:781	It is then the area between these two extr'emes to which this book is aimed, and there it can be of great service.
605:781	The only important assumption made of the reader is that be know the variable types of Fortran (integer, real, Hollerith, etc).
606:781	and their attendant foymat specifications.
607:781	A good knowledge of character formats is especially useful, although the major use for them is in output statements used in the examples given in the book.
608:781	It is also assumed that the reader knows the basic Fortran statements, but this is simple matter as opposed to the format and variable type problems which confront a Fortran programmer.
609:781	The bodk also includes several exercises at the end of each chapter (answers not supplied unfortunately) and a short but very complete bibliography which includes several sources for each chapter.
610:781	The book's primary value is as a source for Hints to problems encountered during programming, providing an introduction to the'more sophisticated literature which can be found by starting with the bibliography.
611:781	This book is therefore a starting point for picking up a basic vocabulary, techniques, and references for someone who has just completed a programming course or who needs a quick introduction to some technique which he may want to look at later in more detail.

623:781	Semantic structure is relative to the process that constructs and uses the representatton.
624:781	By positing analogue representations it is suggested that a process does noc need to know the rules of transformation, e.g., rotation, but this is impossible unless the analogical modelling medium intrinsically follows khe laws of physics, i.e., ascribing these laws to brain tissue.

627:781	At the sensory end, the representation is analog, and propositional at the cognitive end.
628:781	Analog images are incorrectly seen as having all details of the stimulus whereas quasi-linguistic representations are only partial.
629:781	The important issue is not the partiality but the selection, possibly information that discriminates the object&n_c~texJ, Fokstru_c_ral information there needs to be a mechanism for both parts ana wholes.

635:781	The distinction between Fregean (symbolic) and analogical representations is that in the latter both representation and thing must be complex and there must be correspondence between the structures, whereas in the farmer case there is no need for a correspondence.
636:781	Attempts to subsume either representation under the other have not succeeded.
637:781	There is a mistaken belief that only proofs in Fregean symbolism are rigorous.
638:781	Although analogical representations can sometimes be implemented using Fregean ones, this does not imply that they are not used.

Friedrich Fromann Verlag / Gunther Hol?boog KG, Stuttgart, 1974 DM 370 per volume, half-leather A review of volumes 1-10 of the 26-volume Concordantia Prima Ford Lewis Battles Pittsburgh Theological Seminary It is appmpriate indeed that, on the seven hundredth anniversary of the death of St. Thomas Aquinas, Father Roberto Busa with his co-workers of the Faculty of Philosophy at the Aloisianum, Gallarate, Italy has begun to publish the long awaited massive concordance to his writings and to texts by other authors long associated with his circle.
727:781	For many of us who have done lesser work in computerized humanistic studies, rumors and reports of Busa's enterprise aroused our curiosity and, in some cases, led us also to grapple with the manifold problems of producing a concordance by computer.
728:781	In studying the specifications and sampling the first ten volumes of Index Thomisticus (Seatio 11, Concordantia Prima (A-Initor)), this reviewer has been reminded of his own struggle to produce a concordance to the Institutes of ~ohn Calvin (Pittsburgh, 1972) . The r . T. provides a hierarchically organized concordance to a literary corpus of 10,600,000 words of Latin Texts; by comparison, the CaLvin concordance contains 405,338 words of Latin text in a single sequence.
729:781	Thus, the vastly greater literary task of Busa called for a series of basic literary and philological and logical declsions not only to make the enormous work of processing possible, but also to produce a final instrument for the use of scholars that would rationally encompass the vaat corpus.
730:781	At the outset the character of the Latin language and especially its morphological peculiarities had to be translated into computerizable routines, so that something other than a sea of raw alphabetical sdrting would result.
731:781	Lematization by hand sorting after the basic concordancing (feasible for a small corpus), preparation of an interlined ("glossed") lemmatized machine readable rext (also suitable for smaller texts), even the elaborated encoding of the text developed by De Latte at the Liege Centre none of these methods was chosen by Busa and his associates.
732:781	They turned rather to Forcellini ' s Lexicon tot ius ~atinlhtis and encarded the 90,000 Forcellini lemmata (in all possible forms) plus additional ones in the Thornistic corpus to a total of 10,000,000 codes, put this on magnetic tape, and worked out procedures to apply this Latin Machine Dictionary (LEL) to the machine-readable text.
733:781	This instrument is now available fox the use of others working on Latin texts.
734:781	To anyone knowing the homographs of Latin, the limitations of any mechanical routine are apparent: the T. , however, handles these problems in a clear and workable manner.
735:781	The size of the literary corpus also called for basic decisions by successively sequestering different fractions of the corpus (in a way that would have doubtless intrigued Thomas himselfl), the compilers reduced the mass to manageable proportions.
736:781	Their decisions may be set down serially.
737:781	(1) LITERARY.
738:781	First, divide the authentic works of Thomas (100 + 181) from those of other authorship (61): treat each in separate series.
739:781	Secondly, extract literal quotations, citations in references to other authors, and cross-citations to other Aquinian treatises; treat these sepaiately.
740:781	This leaves distinct layers of mat'erial for concor dancing (2) PHILOLOGICAL.
741:781	First, separat.e out indeclinable6 like prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, f oms of esse, helping verbs, etc pronouns, numerals, etc. , etc ; these will occupy a pareiaular concordance.
742:781	Second, put the remaining nouns, adjectives and verbs in a primary concordance: nbuns and adjectives arranged alphabetically by termination; verbs by a standard order.
743:781	(3) LOGICAL.
744:781	TO reduce the bulk of the concordance and to make the vacabdlary and context more rationally accessible: First, analyze out frequently used phrases (.e.g. , liberum arbitrim, acceptio personarum, caelum et terra there are about 500 of these), concordancing them under one word only; for example, acceptia personarum would be listed after all other instances of acceptio.
745:781	Secondly, distinguish words which are either proper names or so commonly found that only a brief context (1% lines) need be quoted; the rest can then be set in a context of a lines and the whole interfiled in a single series.
746:781	These decisions have determined both the cnaraccer ana content of Sectio 11, comprising two series (Aquinian and non-Aquinian works) of five concordances each.
747:781	So much for the Cotlcordance proper.
748:781	There remains a further instrument for the use of scholars, Sectio I. In this are included indices of diseribution, sumrnarhs of the lexicon, and indLces of frequency: Through these lists linguistic and literary studies of all sorts can be made.
749:781	By reverse alphabetical ordering of lemmata and forms additional 'kinds of analysis are facilitated.
750:781	Since these volumes have not yet appeared, they can only be briefly mentioned here.
751:781	A massive concordance of this type must carry a concise yet: precise location code for each item.
752:781	The editors have determined the proper modern edition to be used, have set a precise order of works to be followed In the concordancing of each type under its appropriate lemma, and have summarized this on a separate 4-page insert, to whidh the user will doubtless make frequent reference as he learns to use this grand instrument of research.
753:781	A short review cannot do justice to the immense detail and the intelligence with which this detail has, with human and computer help, been marshalled in the I.T. Ea'ther Busa and his associates are to be commended not only for their achievement, but: also for the example they have set for other laborers.
