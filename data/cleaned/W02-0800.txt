1:13	Introduction The main purpose of the workshop is to discuss recent results in word sense disambiguation (WSD), with reference to SENSEVAL-2.
2:13	The second purpose is to begin planning SENSEVAL-3, the next evaluation exercise for WSD systems.
3:13	SENSEVAL-2, held 5-6 July 2001 in conjunction with ACL-01, unveiled the results of over 90 systems submitted by 35 teams to tasks in 10 different languages.
4:13	At the time, it was not possible to do any in-depth analysis, so it was agreed to organize a follow-up workshop in 2002 after sufficient analysis could be done.
5:13	The result is this one-day workshop dedicated to Word Sense Disambiguation: Recent Successes and Future Directions, with 17 regular papers accepted for presentation.
6:13	This includes 4 papers to be presented in a special session on preposition semantics.
7:13	The quality of the submissions was remarkably high.
8:13	The wide range of problems addressed in these papers is encouraging, including in-depth analyses of systems participating in SENSEVAL-2, improvements and new approaches, comparative results, proposals for application-based evaluations and for new tasks to be undertaken during SENSEVAL-3.
9:13	The workshop culminates in a session to start planning SENSEVAL-3.
10:13	The central question is: Can we, and should we, move towards a morereal application scenario?
11:13	Panelists will present positions on the aim and scope of SENSEVAL-3.
12:13	We believe that this mixture of interesting approaches, results, and discussion will provide a better insight into the recent successes in Word Sense Disambiguation, and will help create a roadmap for future R&D in this field.
