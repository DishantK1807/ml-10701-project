A wide range of exact and asymptotic tests as well as computationally intensive randomisation tests (Yeh, 2000) are available and add to the confusion about an appropriate choice.

However, even significant results cannot be generalised to a different type of collocation (such as adjective-noun instead of PP-verb), different evaluation criteria, a different domain or text type, or even a source corpus of different size, as the results of Krenn and Evert (2001) show.

The candidates were then ranked according to the scores assigned by four association measures: the log-likelihood ratio G2 (Dunning, 1993), Pearson’s chi-squared statistic X2 (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, 169–172), the t-score statistic t (Church et al., 1991), and mere cooccurrence frequency f.4 TPs were identified according to the definition of Krenn (2000).

Following the methodology described by Evert and Krenn (2001), German PP-verb combinations were extracted from a chunk-parsed version of the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus.3 A cooccurrence frequency threshold of 2Namely, Π = nTP · R/n, where nTP stands for the total number of TPs in the candidate set.

She is aware, though, that this test assumes independent samples and is hardly suitable for different ranking methods applied to the same candidate set: Krenn and Evert (2001) suggest several alternative tests for related samples.

The evaluation results also confirm the argument of Dunning (1993), who suggested G2 as a more robust alternative to X2.
