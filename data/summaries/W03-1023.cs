However, there is evidence that, e.g., syntactic features play a smaller role in resolving anaphors with full lexical heads than in pronominal anaphora (Strube, 2002; Modjeska, 2002).

(4)) usually expresses hyponymy/similarity relations between the hyponym NP BD and its hypernym NP BE (Hearst, 1992).

training data was generated following the procedure employed by Soon et al.(2001) for coreference resolution.

Should, e.g., underspecified and point-of-view dependent hyponymy relations (Hearst, 1992) be included?

In particular, (Keller et al., 2002) have shown that using the Web handles data sparseness better than smoothing.

4) and other-than contexts (footnote 2), in which the antecedents are available structurally and thus a relatively unsophisticated procedure would suffice to find them; (b) idiomatic and discourse connective “other”, e.g., “on the other 3 In parallel, efforts have been made to enrich WordNet by adding information in glosses (Harabagiu et al., 1999).

Its P, R and BY-measure are 27.8%. 4 Naive Bayes without the Web First, we trained and tested the NB classifier with a set of 9 features motivated by our own work on other-anaphora (Modjeska, 2002) and previous ML research on coreference resolution (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube et al., 2002).

For this reason, using the Web has proved successful in several other fields of NLP, e.g., machine translation (Grefenstette, 1999) and bigram frequency estimation (Keller et al., 2002).

There have been efforts to extract missing lexical relations from corpora in order to build new knowledge sources and enrich existing ones (Hearst, 1992; Berland and Charniak, 1999; Poesio et al., 2002).

3 However, the size of the used corpora still leads to data sparseness (Berland and Charniak, 1999) and the extraction procedure can therefore require extensive smoothing.
