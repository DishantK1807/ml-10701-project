From a theoretical perspective, IDAS's main objective was to show that a single representation and reasoning system can be used for both domain and linguistic knowledge \[Reiter and Mellish, 1992\].

To take one fairly random exampie, Danlos and Namer \[1988\] have pointed out that Since the French masculine and feminine pronouns le and la are abbreviated to l' before a word that starts with a vowel, and since in some cases le and la may be unambiguous references while l' is not, the referring expression system must have some knowledge of surface word order and selected content and function words before it can decide whether a pronoun is acceptable; this will not be possible if referring expressions are chosen before syntactic structures are built, as happens in the consensus architecture.

However, all examples of PENMAN SPL input that I have seen have essentially had content 167 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 terns, such as the tactical component of McKeown's TEXT system \[McKeown, 1985\], did integrate lexical and syntactic processing in a single 'tactical generator'; also, systemic systems that have been less driven by application needs than PENMAN, such as GENESYS \[Fawcett and Tucker, 1990\], have used integrated lexicogrammars.

In FUF it is the 'lexical chooser', in IDAS it is the 'text planner', in JOYCE it is the 'sentence planner', in SPOKESMAN it is the 'text structurer', and in PENMAN it doesn't seem to have a name at all, e.g., Hovy \[1988\] simply refers to 'pre-generation textplanning tasks'.

Hovy \[1988\] has proposed an architecture where these tasks are performed separately (in particular, the 166 7th International Generation Workshop • Kennebunkport, Maine • June 21-24, 1994 application program performs deep content determination, while the generation system performs rhetorical planning).

decision: avoid integrated architect~e Many NL generation researchers have argued against dividing the generation process into modules; perhaps the best-known are Appelt \[1985\] and Danlos \[1984\].

IDAS and PENMAN use variants of the same deep syntactic language, SPL \[Kasper, 1989\].

Similarly, psycholinguistic knowledge of how the human language generator works may suggest useful algorithms for NL engineers; one such ease is described in \[Reiter and Dale, 1992\].

After all, as Woods \[1975\] has pointed.out, while descriptive analyses of language can at best tell us what the brain does, engineering analyses can potentially offer insights on why the brain functions as it does.

Among the systems exan~ned, however, ttovy is unique in taking this approach; the builders of the other systems (including Moore and Paris \[1989\], who also worked with PENMAN) apparently believe that these two processes are so closely related that they should be performed simultaneously.

In other words, it does not use an integrated 'lexicogrammar', which systemic theorists in particular (e.g., \[Matthiessen, 1991\]) have argued for, and which is implicit in some unification-based approaches, such as the semantic head-driven algorithm \[Shieber etal., 1990\].
J90-1004
None of the systems use the semantic head-driven generation algorithm \[Shieber et al., 1990\], although this is probably the single best-known algorithm for surface generation; Elhadad \[1992, chapter 4\] claims that such an algorithm is only necessary for systems that at-tempt to simultaneously perform both lexical choice and surface generation, which none of the examined systems do.
