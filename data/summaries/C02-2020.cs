comparable medical corpora The material for the present experiments consists of comparable medical corpora in French and English and a French-English medical lexicon (Fung and Yee (1998) call its words ‘seed words’).
P98-1069
Methods have been proposed to acquire a lexicon from corpora when such a lexicon does not exist or is not complete enough (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998; Picchi and Peters, 1998; Rapp, 1999).
P98-1069 P99-1067 W97-0119
An additional difference with Fung and Yee (1998) is that they look for translational equivalents only among words that are unknown in both corpora.
P98-1069
This set corresponds to the ‘seed words’ of Fung and Yee (1998).
P98-1069
Fung and Yee (1998) demonstrated that the associations between a word and its context seed words are preserved in comparable texts of different languages.
P98-1069
Such non-parallel texts can become prevalent in the development of bilingual lexicons and in cross-language information research as they may be easier to collect than parallel corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Picchi and Peters, 1998).
P98-1069 P99-1067
As a comparison, on a ‘general language’ corpus, Rapp (1999) reports an accuracy of 65% at the first percentile by using loglike weighting and city-block metric.
P99-1067
In Fung and McKeown (1997), a translation model applied to a pair of unrelated languages (English/Japanese) with a random selection of test words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a precision around 30% when only the top candidate is proposed.
W97-0119
Among these, Rapp (1999) proposed that in any language there is a correlation between the cooccurrences of words which are translations of each other.
