This result agrees with DUC’s additional evaluation results (Harman and Over, 2004).
W04-1003
The results of the comparison with ROUGE-N (Lin and Hovy, 2003; Lin, 2004a; Lin, 2004b), ROUGE-S(U) (Lin, 2004b; Lin and Och, 2004) and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004a; Lin, 2004b) show that our method correlates more closely with human evaluations and is more robust.
N03-1020 P04-1077 W04-1013
They reported that their method is superior to BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) in terms of the correlation between human assessment and automatic evaluation.
P02-1040
Lin et al.(2003) proposed a recall-oriented measure, ROUGE-N, whereas BLEU is precision-oriented.

N03-1020 P04-1077 P04-1078 W04-1013
Lin (2004a; 2004b) and Lin and Och (2004) proposed an LCS-based automatic evaluation measure called ROUGE-L.
P04-1077 W04-1013
We conducted an experimental evaluation using automatic summarization evaluation data developed for TSC-3 (Hirao et al., 2004a).
C04-1064 C04-1077
Our method is based on the Extended String Subsequence Kernel (ESK) (Hirao et al., 2004b) which is a kind of convolution kernel (Collins and Duffy, 2001).
C04-1064 C04-1077
The evaluation metric follows DUC’s SEE evaluation scheme (Harman and Over, 2004).
W04-1003
For ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU, we use three variations following (Lin, 2004b): the maximum skip distances are 4, 9 and infinity 7.
P04-1077 W04-1013
Therefore, Lin and Och (2004) introduced skip-bigram statistics for the evaluation of machine translation.
P04-1077 W04-1013
One is the longest common subsequence (LCS) based approach (Hori et al., 2003; Lin, 2004a; Lin, 2004b; Lin and Och, 2004).
