Head transducers were introduced in Alshawi 1996b, where the symbols in the source and target sequences are source and target words respectively.

In fact, the original motivation for the head transducer models was that they are simpler and more amenable to automatic model structure acquisition, while the transfer component of the traditional system was designed with regard to allowing maximum flexibility in mapping between source and target representations to overcome translation divergences (Lindop and Tsujii 1991: Dorr 1994).

Dunning 1993), make use of both positive and negative instances of performing a task.

Further details of this approach, including the analysis, transfer, and generation algorithms appear in Alshawi 1996a.

The transfer system follows the familiar analysis-transfer-generation architecture (Isabelle and Macklovitch 1986).

Cost Assignment The transfer and head transduction derivation models can be formulated as probabilistic generative models; such formulations were given in Alshawi 1996a and 1996b respectively.

Both models underlying the translation systems can be characterized as statistical translation models, but unlike the models proposed by Brown et al.(1990, 1993), these models have non-uniform linguistically motivated structure, at present coded by hand.

A bilingual iexical entry (see Alshawi 1996a for more details) includes a mapping function between the source and target nodes of the fragments.

I Introduction In this paper we describe an experimental machine translation system based on head transducer models and compare it to a related transfer system, described in Alshawi 1996a, based on monolingual head automata.

Comparison 5.1 English-Chinese ATIS Models Both the transfer and transducer systems were trained and evaluated on English-to-Mandarin Chinese translation of transcribed utterances from the ATIS corpus (Hirschman et al.1993). By training here we simply mean assignment of the cost functions for fixed model structures.
