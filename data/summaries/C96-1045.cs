F-structures are either interpreted indirectly in terms of a homomorphic embedding into Quasi Logical Form (QLF) (Alshawi, 1992; Alshawi & Crouch, 1992; Cooper et al., 1994a) representations or directly in terms of adapting QLF interpretation clauses to f-structure representations.

Our apt)roach is in the spirit of but (:ontrasts with at)proaches by (Halvorsen, 1983; ttalvorsen & Ksplan, 1988; Fenstad et al., 1987; Wedekind & Ksplan, 1993; Dalrymple et al., 1995) which are ne.ither unde.rspecifie.d nor direct.

I,\]'om this rather general perspective the difference between f-structures mid l'l'he motivation for including tiffs syntactic information in QLFs is that resolution of such things as anaphora, ellipsis or quantifier scope may be constrained by syntactic factors (Alshawi, 1990).

We assume an analysis involving the restriction operator in the LFG description language (Wedekind & Kaplan, 1993) and selnantic form indexing (II<...> @) e.g. by string position) as introduced by (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982).
E93-1047
Quasi-Logical Forms (QLFs) (Alshawi & Crouch, 1992; Cooper et al., 1994a) provide the semantic level of representation employed in the Core Language Engine (CLE) (Alshawi, 1992).

Like (Halvorsen, 1983; Wedekind & Kaplan, 1993) our approach fails int;o the description by analysis 1)aradigln.

The architecture of the LFG and QLF formalism are described at length elsewhere (Ksplan & Bresnan, 1982; Alshawi & Crouch, 1992; Cooper et al., 1994a).
