The original function we used to evaluate the utility of our grammars was an MDL prior very similar to the one described by Goldsmith (2001).

Goldsmith (2001) provides a detailed description of the exact grammar encoding and search heuristics used to find the optimal set of stems, suffixes, and signatures under this type of model.

This segmentation is provided by the Linguistica morphological analyzer (Goldsmith, 2001; Goldsmith, 2004b), itself an unsupervised algorithm.

For each rule-context pair, we add the rule to the grammar 4The reasoning we use to finding conditioning contexts for deletion rules was also described by Goldsmith (2004a), and is similar to the much earlier work of Johnson (1984).

These complexities are irrelevant to the points we wish to make here, but are described in detail in Goldsmith (2001).
