To obtain such a corpus Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) mine the Web to gather the relevant data.

We will base our representation on the output of Connexor (Tapanainen and J¨arvinen, 1997), but the choice of parser is arbitrary.

There has been a long tradition on the use of graphs for this kind of sentence representation, such as Sowa’s Conceptual Graphs (Sowa, 1979), and Quillian’s Semantic Nets (Quillian, 1968).
P79-1010
Considering that text information as complex as syntactic information or even logic and semantic information can be expressed in graphs (Quillian, 1968; Schank, 1972; Sowa, 1979), we are convinced that the time is ripe to explore the use of graphs for question answering.

There is recent interest on the use of graph methods for Natural Language Processing, such as document summarisation (Mihalcea, 2004) document retrieval (Montes-y-G´omez et al., 2000; Mishne,2004),andrecognitionoftextualentailment (Pazienza et al., 2005).

For example, Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) learns rules based on simple surface patterns.

In contrast, other theories (such as Sowa (1979)’s Conceptual Graphs) would represent the sentence as a graph containing vertices that are themselves graphs.
