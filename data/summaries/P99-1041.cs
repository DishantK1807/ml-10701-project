For example, an underlying assumption in some word sense disambiguation systems, e.g., (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Li et al., 1995; Lin, 1997), is that if two words occurred in the same context, they are probably similar.

For each object noun o, (Tapanainen et al., 1998) computes the distributed frequency DF(o) and rank the non-compositionality of o according to this value.

The first column in Table 5 lists the top 40 verbobject pairs in (Tapanainen et ai., 1998).

This method was also used to evaluate automatically identified hyponyms (Hearst, 1998), word similarity (Richardson, 1997), and translations of collocations (Smadja et al., 1996).

Work There have been numerous previous research on extracting collocations from corpus, e.g., (Choueka, 1988) and (Smadja, 1993).

More details about the construction of the collocation database and the thesaurus can be found in (Lin, 1998).

It was also used to compute the distributional similarity between words CHin dle, 1990; Lin, 1998).

The frequency counts of dependency relationships are filtered with the loglikelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).

For example, (Lin, 1998) compared automatically created thesaurus with the WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and Roget's Thesaurus.

Not only many combinations are found in the corpus, many of them have very similar mutual information values to that of 318 Table 2: economic impact verb economic financial political social budgetary ecological economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic object impact impact impact impact impact impact effect implication consequence significance fallout repercussion potential ramification risk mutual freq info 171 1.85 127 1.72 46 0.50 15 0.94 8 3.20 4 2.59 84 0.70 17 0.80 59 1.88 10 0.84 7 1.66 7 1.84 27 1.24 8 2.19 17 -0.33 nomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a normal distribution (Dunning, 1993).

A method to determine the compositionality of verb-object pairs is proposed in (Tapanainen et al., 1998).
P98-2210
The basic idea in there is that "if an object appears only with one verb (of few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature" (Tapanainen et al., 1998, p.1290).
P98-2210
Using the similarity measure proposed in (Lin, 1998), we constructed a corpus-based thesaurus 3 consisting of 11839 nouns, 3639 verbs and 5658 adjective/adverbs which occurred in the corpus at least 100 times.

We parsed a 125-million word newspaper corpus with Minipar, 1 a descendent of Principar (Lin, 1993; Lin, 1994), and extracted dependency relationships from the parsed corpus.
