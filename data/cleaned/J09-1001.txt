Letter to the Editor
DearEditor:
Ifoundmyselfinagreementwithyourrecent(Dec.2008)enumerationofthedifﬁculties
withACLconferences,andthegeneralproblemposedbyaﬁeldwhoseprimarymeans
of communication is the conference paper. I want to point out another problem with
this state of affairs: conference papers entail conference travel. A humble linguistics
professor at a California State University campus has essentially no funding and a
relativelylowsalary,sotheopportunitytojet-setaroundtheworldtoanACLmeeting
ishardlyavailable.
I would much prefer a computational linguistics research community whose primary
means of communicating completed research is the journal paper, not the conference
paper. The expectation that one presents at conferences is fundamentally elitist, as
it effectively excludes those of us without grants or funding. It would be foolish to
assume that all such individuals are busy performing ”bad” research. Yet without a
substantialincreaseinthenumberofavailablejournalpagesinourﬁeld,therewillbe
