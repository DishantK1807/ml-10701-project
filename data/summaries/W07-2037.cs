Another type of WSD method uses supervised machine learning (ML) technolo41 gies (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Lee and Ng, 2002; Liu et al., 2002).

The goal for SemEval-2007 task 2 (Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems)(Agirre and Soroa, 2007) is to automatically discriminate the senses of English target words by the use of only untagged data.

 the type of these phrases which are around the target phrases 2 http:// maxent.sourceforge.net/ 20  word category information comes from Chinese thesaurus I2R system used a semi-supervised classification algorithm (label propagation algorithm) (Niu, et al., 2005).

The label propagation algorithm (Niu, et al., 2005) was used to perform sense disambiguation by the use of both training data and test data.

Algorithm SVM is an effective learning algorithm to WSD (Lee and Ng, 2002).

Here we used a semisupervised classi cation algorithm (label propagation algorithm) (Niu, et al., 2005) to address this Chinese word sense disambiguation problem.

More recently, the mapping has been used to test the system on publicly available benchmarks (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004; Niu et al., 2005).

The feature set used here is as same as the feature set used in (Lee and Ng, 2002) except that we did not use syntactic relations.
