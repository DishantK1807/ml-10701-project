5. TEST, RESULTS AND I)ISCUSSION The results that arc under discussion were obtained on the basis of semantic information which was automatically extracted from Longman I)ictionary of Contemporary English (I~I)OCE) as described in Montemagni and Vanderwende (1992) 1 . The semantic information has not been altered in any way fl'onl its automatically derived form, and so there are still errors: for the 94,()00 attribute clusters extracted fl'om nearly 75,000 single noun and verb definitions in L1)()CE, we estimate the accuracy to be 78%, with a margin of error of +/5% (see Richardson et al., 1993).

\]'he algorithm described here, therefore, relies on semantic information which has been extracted automatically fi'om an on-line dictionary (see Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992; l)ohm et al., 1993).

1. INTRODUCTION The inte~opretation of noun sequences (henceforth NSs, and also known as noun compounds or complex nominals) has long been a topic of research in natural language processing (NLP) (Finin, 1980; Sparck Jones, 1983; Leonard, 1984; Isabelle, 1984; Lehnert, 1988; and Riloff, 1989).
