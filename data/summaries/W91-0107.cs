Something similar is to be found in most grammars, but precedents in generation can be found in Appelt 1985, and Bunt 1987.

lf~uk.ac.cam.cl 1 Abstract A considerable amount of study has recently been concentrated on the use of linguistically motivated unification based grammars for sentence generation (see for example Appelt 1987, Calder 1989, Shieber 1988, Shieber et al.1989). The grammars state correspondences between semantic structures and syntactic ones.

generation algorithm The current GDE generation system uses a chart based bottom-up grammar traversal algorithm, similar to that described in Shieber 1988).
C88-2128
The syntactic analyses are based on those developed by Pulman 1987, with extensions to cover all the 48 thematic forms mentioned in the last section.

The tricky problems of passives and dative shift are covered by a version of the neat treatment presented in Pulman 1987.

A possible solution to this problem is discussed in McKeown 1987 in which pragmatic constraints are added to a FUG grammer.
