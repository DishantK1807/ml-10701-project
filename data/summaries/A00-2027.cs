the PARADISE evaluation scheme (Walker et al., 1997), we divided performance features into four groups: â€¢ Task success: task success rate, # of calls.
P97-1035
Once they had completed all tasks in sequence using one system, they filled out a questionnaire to assess user satisfaction by rating 8-9 statements, similar to those in (Walker et al., 1997), on a scale of 1-5, where 5 indicated highest satisfaction.
P97-1035
and Discussion Based on the features described above, we compared MIMIC and the control systems, MIMIC-SI and MIMIC-MI, along three dimensions: performance features, in which comparisons were made using previously proposed features relevant to system performance (e.g., (Price et al., 1992; Simpson and Fraser, 1993; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Walker et al., 1997)); discourse features, in which comparisons were made using characteristics of the resulting dialogues; and initiative distribution, where initiative characteristics of all dialogues involving MIMIC from both experiments were examined.
P97-1035
