8. Focused nouns: Especially after a vocally stressed discourse marker (Wolters and Byron, 2000) or some other marked shift in topic, a word that normally would be pronominalized is often not, as in this example: . . . and you frequently find that mice occupy an important part of the modern medical laboratory.

With the same three texts from the New York Times, STORYBOOK performed better than the previous reported results of 85-90% described in (McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al., 2000) on both animate and all anaphora using a corpus matching technique.

Almost without exception, they focus on anaphoric pronouns as described in Focus/Centering Theory (Webber, 1979; Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Walker, 1998), ignoring the multitude of other possible types.

While this works for many cases of anaphoric pronouns [84.7% in (McCoy and Strube, 1999), 8790% in (Henschel et al., 2000)], we have seen that these form only a subset of the potential reasons for pronominalization.

AF Checking algorithms semiautomatically: Other researchers opt instead to annotate a corpus for pronominalization and their antecedents as well as the pronoun forms that should occur, and then simulate a pronominalization algorithm on the marked-up text (Henschel et al., 2000).

While many NLG researchers have attempted to transfer the ideas of Centering Theory to generation (Not, 1996; Yeh and Mellish, 1997; McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al., 2000; Kibble and Power, 2000), there has yet been no substantial return contribution to the field of anaphora resolution.

Finally, there are significant obstacles to verifying the correctness of existing pronominalization algorithms for any pronominalization theory (Not, 1996; Yeh and Mellish, 1997; McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al., 2000; Kibble and Power, 2000): the lack of natural language generation systems that can produce large enough texts to bring discourse-level processes into play.

Since discourse anaphora resolution was first studied theoretically (Grosz, 1977; Webber, 1979; Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986), it has come to be dominated by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Di Eugenio, 1998; Walker, 1998) which proposes rules for the determination of focus and salience within a given segment of discourse.
