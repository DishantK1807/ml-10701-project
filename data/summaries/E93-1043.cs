Very successful in the domain of morphological analysis/generation are finite-state approaches, notably two-level morphology \[Koskenniemi, 1984\].

We can now impose any of the structures proposed in the literature (e.g., \[Krieger and Nerbonne, 1991; Russell et al., 1992\]) for hierarchical lexica on it, as long as they observe the same functor argument structure of words crucial to our morphotactics.
