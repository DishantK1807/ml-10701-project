The paper first presents our approach and compares it with the one developed in the framework of a similar project called Genia (Collier et al.1999). We then propose an account of Caderige techniques on various filtering and normalization tasks, namely, sentence filtering, resolution of named entity synonymy, syntactic parsing, and ontology learning.
