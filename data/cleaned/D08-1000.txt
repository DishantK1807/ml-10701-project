2:30	The conference is organized under the auspices of SIGDAT, the ACL Special Interest Group for linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to natural language processing.
3:30	It is co-located this year with AMTA 2008 and the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, in Honolulu, Hawaii.
4:30	EMNLP received 385 submissions.
5:30	We were able to accept 116 papers in total (an acceptance rate of 30%).
6:30	81 of the papers (21%) were accepted for oral presentation, and 35 (9%) for poster presentation.
7:30	Two poster papers were subsequently withdrawn after acceptance.
8:30	The papers were selected by a program committee of 15 area chairs, from Asia, Europe, and North America, assisted by a panel of 339 reviewers.
9:30	This year EMNLP introduced an author response period.
10:30	Authors were able to read and respond to the reviews of their paper before the program committee made a final decision.
11:30	They were asked to correct factual errors in the reviews and answer questions raised in the reviewer comments.
12:30	The intention was to help produce more accurate reviews.
13:30	In some cases, reviewers changed their scores in view of the authors response and the area chairs read all responses carefully prior to making recommendations for acceptance.
14:30	First and foremost, we would like to thank the authors who submitted their work to EMNLP.
15:30	The sheer number of submissions reflects how broad and active our field is. We are deeply indebted to the area chairs and the reviewers for their hard work.
16:30	They enabled us to select an exciting program and to provide valuable feedback to the authors.
17:30	We are grateful to our invited speakers Oren Etzioni, Tom Griffiths, and Fernando Pereira who graciously agreed to give talks at EMNLP.
18:30	Additional thanks to the Publications Chair, Sebastian Pado, who put this volume together.
19:30	Jason Eisner helped us immensely by compiling a web site on How to Serve as Program Chair of a Conference (http: //www.cs.jhu.edu/jason/advice/how-to-chair-a-conference.html).
20:30	Special thanks to David Yarowsky and Ken Church of SIGDAT who provided much valuable advice and assistance over the past months.
21:30	David also helped raise important financial support for the conference.
22:30	We are most grateful to Priscilla Rasmussen who helped us with various logistic and organizational aspects of the conference.
23:30	Rich Gerber and the START team responded to our questions quickly, and helped us manage the large number of submissions smoothly.
24:30	Finally, thanks are due to our webmaster, Francesco Figari, who revamped our conference website on very short notice.
25:30	We hope you enjoy the conference!
