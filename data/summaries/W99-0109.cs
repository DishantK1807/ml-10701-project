So researchers have focussed on filling in de~ tails of the theory which were left unspecified: what counts as an utterance, and how should transitions be handled in complex sentences (Kameyama 1998; cf Suri and McCoy 1994)? how is salience ranking determined (Gordon et al 1993; Stevenson et al 1994;.

So the next stage in this research will Concentrate on developing a characterisation of Cb based on semantic content and information structure, taking account of e.g. the proposals of Strube and Hahn (1996) and experimenting with optlmisation algorithms as discussed in section 3.1.2 above.

It is of course impossible to verify this without access to the original texts, but it is instructive to consider the-following example from Strube and Hahn (1996): (1) a.

Grosz et al (1995) give the following example of the ~Am SHIFT pattern: (5) a.

" Previous researchers have implemP.nted pronominalisafion decisions using CT, and so have located Centering as part of RE generation (e.g., Dale 1992, Passoneau 1998), while Mittal et al (1998) have a ~centering module" which forms part of Sentence Planning and seeks to realise the center as Subject in successive sentences.

An exception is Hahn, Strube and Markert's (1996) treatment of bridging reference, or "textual ellipsis" in their terminology.

For instance Passoneau (1998) refers to two variantS of CT: "Version A" based on Brennan et al (1987) and ~Version B" taken from Kameyama et al (1993).

In fact it is an open research question whether CT should operate in this manher or whether the rules should be reformufated to take account of dominance in addition to precedence; di~erent positions are taken by Kameyama (1988) and Suri and McCoy (1994).

the transitions Strube and Hahn (1996) question the canonical ordering of transitions, partly on the grounds that this ordering fails to predict the P~TAIN SHIFT pattern which has been claimed by many researchers to signal a segment boundary or the introduction of a new =discourse topic".

The result is as follows: UI : Cb f a, Cp = a U2:Cb=a, Cp=b U3 : Cb f b, Cp = b U4 : Cb = b, Cp = b In terms of the conventional transitions this works out as U~/U2: RET^IN U2/U3: SMOOTH SHIFT us/u~: COnTINUa This is consistent with Strube and Hahn's (1996) observation that "a II~rAIN transition ideally predicts a SMOOTH ssw'r in the following utterance".

It is intended that the procedures described in "this" paper will be implemented in ICONOCLAST, an authoring tool which enables domain experts to create a knowledge base through a sequence of interactive choice-and generates hiexarchitally structured text according to various stylistic constraints (See Power and Scott 1998).
