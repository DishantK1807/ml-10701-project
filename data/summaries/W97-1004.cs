Pereira et a1.(1993) put forward a method to cluster nouns in V-N compositions, taking the verbs which can combine with a noun as its environment.

While bound compositions are not predictable, i.e., their reasonableness cannot be derived from the syntactic and semantic properties of the words in them(Smadja 1993).
J93-1007
Word compositions have long been a concern in lexicography(Benson et al.1986; Miller et al.1995), and now as a specific kind of lexical knowledge, it has been shown that they have an important role in many areas in natural language processing, e.g., parsing, generation, lexicon building, word sense disambiguation, and information retrieving, etc.(e.g., Abney 1989, 1990; Benson et al.1986; Yarowsky 1995; Church and Hanks 1989; Church, Gale, Hans, and Hindle 1989).

An alternative to semantic class is word cluster based on distributional environment (Brown et al., 1992), which in general refers to the surrounding words distributed around certain word (e.g., Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1993; Pereira et al., 1993), or the classes of them(Bensch et al., 1995), or more complex statistical means (Dagan et al., 1993).
P93-1023 P93-1024
Now with the availability of large-scale corpus, automatic acquisition of word compositions, especially word collocations from them have been extensively studied(e.g., Choueka et al.1988; Church and Hanks 1989; Smadja 1993).
