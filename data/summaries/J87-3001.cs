Extracting the information necessary for classification will of course include locating superordinates in the definitions (which define the so called "ISA" relation) as is done in the work reported by Amsler (1981) and Calzolari (1984).

Pattern matching has played an important role in several previous parsing systems, for example those of Wilks (1975), Parkinson et al (1977), Wilensky and Arens (1980), and Hayes and Mouradian (1981).

(The analysis system retrieves definitions from a 'lispified' version of the LDOCE type-setting tape, for example items preceded by an asterisk are Lisp atoms corresponding to font control characters present on the type-setting tape (see Alshawi, Boguraev, and Briscoe, 1985)).
