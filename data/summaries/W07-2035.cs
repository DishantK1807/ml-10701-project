Textual Entailment Recognition (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2006) has recently been proposed as an application independent task to capture such inferences.

There exists already many interesting approaches to this problem, see (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006) for various recent efforts and our paper wont try to fully reinvent the wheel.

It is our first attempt to RTE and we have taken profit of an analysis of the approaches followed in previous challenges (see (Dagan et al., 2005), and (Bar-Haim et al., 2006) for overviews of RTE-1 and RTE-2).

Finding alternative words that can occur in given contexts would potentially be useful to many applications such as question answering, summarisation, paraphrase acquisition (Dagan et al., 2006), text simplification and lexical acquisition (McCarthy, 2002).

In previous RTE challenges (Dagan et al., 2006; Bar-Haimetal., 2006), severalmachine-learningapproaches appeared, but their results showed that significant improvements were still necessary.

The results obtained, using the accuracy measure that is the fraction of correct responses according to (Dagan et al., 2006), are shown in table 1.

The approach we present here is inspired by (Mihalcea and Moldovan 1999;Brill 2003; Rosso et al.2005; Dagan et al.2006; McCarthy 2002).

1In the literature, slight variations of this problem have been also referred to as sense matching (Dagan et al., 2006).

To overcome this problem several approaches have been studied, being the Recognising Textual Entailment Challenge (RTE) (BarHaim et al., 2006; Dagan et al., 2006) the most referred source for determining which one is the most accurate.

[Bar-Haim, Dagan, et al.2006] We do recognize that some of our metrics have already been employed by other teams [Jijkoun and Rijke, 2005] and that our results may be different because of the thesaurus corpus we employed and the classification strategy we used.

The lexical substitution task follows on from some previous ideas (McCarthy, 2002) to examine the capabilities of WSD systems built by researchers on a task which has potential for NLP applications.
