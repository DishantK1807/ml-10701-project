Work As we do not propose long distance attachments, our method can not be compared with other standard corpus-based approaches to attachment resolution (Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Brill and Resnik, 1994; Li and Abe, 1998).

By contrast, unsupervised strategies to acquire selection restrictions do not require a training corpus to be semantically annotated using pre-existing lexical hierarchies (Sekine et al., 1992; Dagan et al., 1998; Grishman and Sterling, 1994).

Some of them induce syntactic subcategorisation from tagged texts (Brent, 1993; Briscoe and Carrol, 1997; Marques, 2000).

The learning algorithm requires sample corpora to be constituted by verb-noun, noun-verb, or verb-prepnoun dependencies, where the nouns are semantically tagged by using lexical hierarchies such as WordNet (Resnik, 1997; Framis, 1995).

Soft clusters, in which words can be members of different clusters to different degrees, might solve this problem to a certain extent (Pereira et al., 1993).
