1 Introduction
Recent years have shown a large increase in the
usage of content creation platforms—blogs, com-
munity QA sites, forums, etc.—aimed at the gen-
eral public.User generated data contains emotional,
opinionated, sentimental, and personal posts. This
characteristic makes it an interesting data source
for exploring new types of linguistic analysis, as is
demonstratedby research on, e.g., sentimentanaly-
sis[4], opinionretrieval[3], andmooddetection[1].
Weintroducethetaskofexperiencemining. Here,
the goal is to gain insights into criteria that people
formulate to judge or rate a product or its usage.
These criteriacan be formulatedas the expectations
that people have of the product in advance (i.e., the
reasonsto buy), but can also be expressedas reports
of experienceswhile using the productand compar-
isons with other products. We focus on the latter:
reports of experiences with products. In this paper,
we define the task, describe guidelines for manual
annotation and analyze linguistic features that can
be used in an automaticexperienceminingsystem.
2 Motivation
Our main use-caseis user-centereddesign for prod-
uct development. User-centereddesign [2] is an in-
novation paradigm where users of a product are in-
volved in eachstepof the researchand development
process. Thefirststageoftheproductdesignprocess
is to identifyunmet needs and demandsof users for
a specific product or a class of products. Forums,

review sites, and mailing lists are platforms where
people share experiences about a subject they care
about. Althoughstatementsfoundin suchplatforms
maynotalwaysberepresentativeforthegeneraluser
group,they can accelerateuser-centereddesign.
Another use-case comes from online communi-
tiesthemselves. Usersof onlineforumsareoftenin-
terested in other people’s experienceswith concrete
products and/or solutions for specific problems. To
quote one such user: [t]he polls are the only in-
formation we have, though, except for individual
[users] giving their own evaluations. With the vol-
umeofonlinedataincreasingrapidly,usersneedim-
proved accessto previouslyreportedexperiences.
3 Experiencemining
Experiences are particular instances of personally
encountering or undergoing something. We want
to identify experiencesabout a specific target prod-
uct, that are personal, involve an activity related to
thetargetand,moreover, areaccompaniedby judge-
ments or evaluative statements. Experience mining
isrelatedtosentimentanalysisandopinionretrieval,
in that it involves identifying attitudes; the key dif-
ferenceis, however, thatwearelookingforattitudes
towards specific experienceswith products,not atti-
tudestowards the productsthemselves.
4 An
explorative study
To assess the feasibility of automatic experience
mining, we carried out an explorative study: we
asked human assessors to find experiences in ac-
tual forum data and then examined linguistic fea-
tures likely to be useful for identifying experiences
automatically.

Table 1: Comparison of surface text features for posts
with and withoutexperience;p(·) denotesprobability.
We acquired data by crawling two forums on
shaving,1 with111,268postswrittenby2,880users.
Manualassessments Two assessors(bothauthors
of this paper) were asked to search for posts on five
specific target products using a standard keyword
search,and label each resultpost as:
• reportingno experience,or
• reportingan off-target experience,or
• reportingan on-target experience.
Moreover, posts should be marked as reporting an
experience only if (i) the author explicitly reports
his or someone else’s (a concrete person’s) use of
a product; and (ii) the author makes some conclu-
sions/judgementsaboutthe experience.
In total, 203 posts were labeled by the two asses-
sors, with 101 posts marked as reporting an experi-
ence by at least one assessor (71% of those an on-
target experience). The inter-annotator agreement
was 0.84, with Cohen’s κ = 0.71. If we merge
onand off-target experience labels, the agreement
is 0.88, with κ = 0.76. The high level of agreement
demonstratesthe validityof the task definition.

the comparison results. Remarkably, the subjectiv-
ityscoreis lowerforexperienceposts: thisindicates
that our task is indeed different from sentiment re-
trieval. Experience posts are on average twice as
long as non-experienceposts and containmore sen-
tences with pronoun I. They also contain more con-
tent (non-modal)verbs, especially past tense verbs.
Table2 presentsa moredetailedanalysisof the verb
use. Experienceposts appear to contain more verbs
referring to concrete actions rather than to attitude
andperception. It is stilltobeseen,though,whether

5 Conclusions
We introduced the novel task of experience min-
ing. Users of products share their experiences, and
mining these could help define requirements for
next-generationproducts. We developed annotation
guidelines for labeling experiences, and used them
to annotate data from online forums. An initial ex-
plorationrevealedmultiplefeaturesthatmightprove
