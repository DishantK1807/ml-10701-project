The XML-based GMT could serve as a starting point for defining the pivot format; its applicability to diverse annotation types, including terminology, dictionaries and other lexical data (Ide, et al., 2000), morphological annotation (Ide & Romary, 2001a; 2003) and syntactic annotation (Ide & Romary, 2001b) demonstrates its generality.

The choice of this model is indicated by its almost universal use in defining general-purpose annotation formats, including the Generic Modeling Tool (GMT) (Ide & Romary, 2001, 2002) and Annotation Graphs (Bird & Liberman, 2001).
