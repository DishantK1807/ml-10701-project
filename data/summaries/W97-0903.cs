In this paper, we focus on the lessons learned during the successive development of three text generation systems at Bellcore: PLANDoc (McKeown et al., 1994) summarizes execution traces of an expert system for telephone network capacity expansion analysis; FLOwDoc (Passonneau et al., 1996) provides summaries of the most important events in flow diagrams constructed during business reengineering; and ZEDDoc (Passonnean et al., 1997) produces summaries of activity for a user-specified set of advertisements within a user-specified time period from logs of WWW page hits.

Modular pipeline architectures have a long history of use in text gen16 eration systems (Kukich, 1983a; McKeown, 1985; McDonald and Pustejovsky, 1986; Reiter, 1994), although recent work argues for the need for interaction between modules (Danlos, 1987; Rubinoff, 1992; McKeown et al., 1993).

In particular, the function of message aggregation lay exclusively in the Discourse Organization module in PLANDoc (Shaw, 1995), whereas aggregation functions are executed in both the Message Generation and Discourse Organization modules in FLOWDOC.
