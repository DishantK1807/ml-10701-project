Brown et al.(1992) used windows containing 1001 words.

Statistical word similarity measures play an important role in information retrieval and in many other natural language applications, such as the automatic creation of thesauri (Grefenstette, 1993; Li and Abe, 1998; Lin, 1998) and word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1992; Li and Abe, 1998).

Brown et al.(1992) use a word similarity measure for language modeling in an interpolated model, grouping similar words into classes.
J92-4003
Dunning (1993) used a likelihood ratio to test word similarity under the assumption that the words in text have a binomial distribution.
J93-1003
The window size may vary, Church and Hanks (1990) used windows of size 2 and 5.
J90-1003
Dunning (1993) also used windows of size 2, which corresponds to word bigrams.

Mutual Information This measure for word similarity was first used in this context by Church and Hanks (1990).
J90-1003
Many different statistical tests have been proposed to measure the strength of word similarity or word association in natural language texts (Dunning, 1993; Church and Hanks, 1990; Dagan et al., 1999).
