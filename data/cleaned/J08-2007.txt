Theworkpresentedinthisbookismotivatedbythegoalofapplyinglinguistictheory-
building to the concrete needs of potential linguistic applications such as question
answering,dialoguesystems,andmachinetranslation.Topursuethisgoal,atranslation
of linguistic theory into a framework of “practical linguistics” is suggested. Database
Semantics (DBS) is presented as a ﬁrst step towards such a framework. It models the
communication between cognitive agents, which can be used, for example, to imple-
mentthecommunicativeabilitiesofacognitiverobot.
DBS serves as a single underlying format for modeling communication in that it
lendsitselftoanaccountofbothlanguageprocessingandlanguageproduction(think-
ingisaddedasaseparatecomponent,whichreferstoinferencingonstoredinformation,
andactivatingcontenttobeverbalized).Assuchanunderlyingformat,itcanbeusedto

as word order and diatheses, it still preserves much syntactic structure, for example,
in its representation of modiﬁcation and of elliptical expressions. Semantics proper is
encoded within proplets (except those for deictic expressions and proper names) by
deﬁningaconceptasthevalueoftheir“coreattribute.”

difference to proplet sets for the modeling of linguistic content is that proplet sets for

Thesimilaritybetweentherepresentations ofutterances andofcontextmakesthe
move between them straightforward, which is crucial for the proposed analysis of
language processing and production: Language processing consists of deriving lists
of proplets (including the coindexations between proplet values) from utterances and
storingtheminthecontextrepresentation, whichismodeledasadatabase. Language
production consists of the activation of such lists of proplets from this database and
theirtranslationintoutterances.

secondclassconsistsofcoordinationphenomena,rangingfromsimplecoordinationon
the word or phrase level to gapping and right-node raising. The last class is cases of
coreference. A wide range of these cases is represented in DBS, including even Bach–
Peters sentences (where there are two NPs that constitute anaphors whose antecedent
is the respective other NP). The DBS framework is used to formulate a version of the
Langacker–Ross conditiondatingbacktoLangacker (1969)andRoss(1969):Pronouns

In the third part, three fragments are presented in detail, the ﬁrst two from the
processingandproductionperspective,thelastoneonlyfromtheprocessingperspec-

extremely simple texts consisting of intransitive present-tense sentences whose NP
is a proper name. The second fragment extends the coverage to pronouns, complex
NPs(Det-Adj*-N),andtransitiveandditransitiveverbsinsimpleandcomplextenses.
Finally,thethirdfragmentoffersatreatmentofintensiﬁers(very,rather)andadverbials,
and an outlook on a syntactically underspeciﬁed approach to modiﬁer attachment
ambiguities.Thefragmentsaredescribedintermsof“grammars,”whichspecifystart
and end states (in terms of the ﬁrst and the last proplet of a list to be processed or
verbalized) and a setof rules. Therules are ordered inthat every rule isaccompanied
by a set of potential successors, and in that rules to start and to end a derivation with
arespeciﬁed.
The book is written in a highly accessible way. The formalism itself as well as its
applicationtothefragmentsisdescribedthoroughly,whichmakesiteasytounderstand

However, the book does not offer much discussion of the relation between the
proposed analysis and competing approaches. This shows up in speciﬁc parts of the
analysis—for example, in the discussion of coreference in Chapter 10, which does not

deep linguistic processing in the analysis of biomedical and other scientiﬁc texts), a
