2 Introduction
Current Machine qh'anslatiou (MT) systems proc,~ss input sentence by sentence.
I\[owever, experience wil.h English and Japanese has shown that some languages difl'er to such a degree that sentential translation yiehls poor results, l,eL us first compare the results of a conventional MT sysl.em with those we expect, t,o get for MT with context: t.

An attempt has therefore I}een made to solve some of tile problems of translal.ing languages SllCIt sis Japanese and English using contextual information.
Due to \[.he consideral.ions of wanting to produce a high quality small-sized MT system, lhe approach taken is to use tile resources awdlahle in an exisl;ing MT system and to process the contextu;d i,l\['orlmd.ion l There is obviously n great difference in results Imtweet, systems, hnl, l.hese translat.icms relweSent tyl}iCal {uHe, llted) r~.stdts fi'om a numher of systems, a) and I}) options,hq}end on the default settings of individual systems 1.

This kiml of feal,ure with rat.her light; processing for the production of a higher quality translation is desirable in a pracl,ical MT system because the advanl.ages of large-scah~ processing for deep conl.extual ilfform;d.ioi, are likely to he limited in Lids apl~lical.ion.
3 The

The translation Imr~ is carried out h, Pl.O1,0(\] usinp; nn l,FC-LIike gramma.tieal formalism 2.
'\]'he current, dictionaries conl,~dn information to translal.e aboul; 300 words.
There are 350 grammar rules which (:own' a wide range of sentence pal,terns.
The context monil,or operates using information retrieved from file f-sLrueturc of ;t SOlli.eltCe al't(W analysis.

57 of tile source f~structure to the target f-structure.
As context processing is carried out on only a shallow level, only information for lexical item, nurnber, person, gender, case role etc is used in the context system, along with semantic inIi)rtnation from the semantic network.
The way that this information is used will be explained below in regard to the specific problems that tile use of context is intended to resolw~.
4 The
Context Monitor The context monitor proposed in this pal)er uses a standard focussing theory as a basis (\[Sidner 81\]),\[Sid,ler 8(i\]), amlough sonrexvhat simplified according to the bes* :press approach that we are adopting.
It is planned to increase the COml~lexily of this initial algorithm to reflect more current wn'sions of the theory as the system is developed.
The context monitor has a number of basic data structures: Current l;k)cus, Actor l'~oeus, Potential l,'ocus List, Potential Actor I;'ocus List, Discourse Segment Stack and Actor I:ocus Stack.
There is also a Current State List that maintains a record of all the semantic items currently hehl in any of the other data structures and the semantic features to whMl they are linked.
This list is updated (entries added :rod removed) after every sentence.
In ordc'r to lilnlt the scope of the context information required in the context monitor, an analysis was made of the main differences between 3apanese aml English that provide problenas for MT syst.ems.
The basis of the analysis was to find what information can be gained from context to solve these problems.
4.1 Plural
Fomns Japanese is (in general a) mmlarkc'd for mlmber.
I';nglish, however, differentiates between singular and plural, q'his fact causes problems when translating t¥om Japanese to English as the mlmber information required for the inflection and declension of English is not available from the analysis of the 3apanese.
I:or example: (I,oy(s),,,~, dog(s)o,,s lille) The boy likes th.e do~j.
The bo W like the cloy.
The boy likes Zhe dolls.
The bow like Hie do!Is.
Bogs like doas.
In the current system an initial sellt.ence analyzed by the system is processed to find possible: ff)ci.
II,ents which are in the l)lural or are in conjunction are stored as a set.
'Che set as a whole is given phlral nultll)er, aNote the use of .t'~ ('l(tchi') with mainly people and anlm.ls, but consists of imlividual items or, as} in the case of "/we ~e,v 7'V models and fo~tr 7~ew video models", as subsets.
Subsets or individual items within the sets are available as antecedents to subsequ.etlt referring expressiolls.
'\]_'hus, in the example text.
in Section 1, after the initial sentence is analysed, the proposed focus is two new TV models and fmtr new video models, the strut.lure o\[" which is shown in Figure 3 below: 4 \[sell : \[set2: \[pred :terebi (T V), lllllll~l)\[lll' ~ nlod:\[p red:l.:ishu (model), spee:\[pred:,li (Iwo), _.\]1\], ref:set2\], \[set3: \[pred:l)ideo(video), lllllll;phlr 1 mod:\[pred:kishu(model), SlmC :\[pred : yo,,(fiJwl 9, -.\]\]\], rcf:set3\],,'of:set 1\] l:igure 3: PIi.Of, OG Structure Sentence 2 (S)? is analysed and a test is made to see if any items in that sentence confirm or reject the proposed focus.
'l'he structure for the item g'7"~ ("a video/videos") is matched by mfiIication with the structure for the prol)osed focus and can Im matched with a subset of it., namely ~)i k.
v,/2"-)~ ~ IJtl,~K~{\[( ("d new video models").
That item is there.fore taken Io conllrm the proposed R)t:us.
That proposed I'oeus is, however, hnmedhttely PUSlled onto the focus stack because the subset of 4 vhleos is taken as the current \['ocus 5.
'Phe item 13-)~";t of $2 inherits the feal.tlrcs of the set.
of videos fronl S I.
aml is therefore expressed ill the I(nglish with a plural form: "videos".
It is hoped that in this way the conl ext monitor will be able to distinguish between singular alld plural in at least some cases.
II/ sonic cases t, here is Iio way of disl.inlguishing between singular and l/lural rei~renee in .Japanese as in tile case o\[" the sel/tellce below: "/'eve (~)1¢1 llm~al,:o bO,:lht a ca\]w..

This provides a powerflil augnlentation to the basic nctwork.
4,4 The Augmented Semantic Network Tile semantic network in this system is basically a hierarchy of Objects, States and Events.
The addition of features to the semantic network in effect adds links to the network.
Two kinds of link are proposed: permanent links and temporary links.
Permanent' links are conditions that must be true for a certain action or state-of-affairs to bold.
The other, temporary, links are used to create a default state for the objects mentioned in the text.
As the text is processed, these links may change, so that the information awtilable to the system will differ from one sentence to the next.
4.4.1 The
Links The division between Objects, States and Events is reflected in tlle type of feature given to semantic itclnS.
For exainple, Events typically coilgain features about the sort of things that are affected by that event; States contain information the types of objects that may be in that state; Objects contain iilforlnaiiou about any subparts or if they themselves are typically part of another (larger) object and wliat type of Event they are typically involved in.
On this basis, the following types of link are proposed: . Condition (=c): (permanent) a condition that must |lold for a State or Event to come aabout., Before Condition (BC::): (pernianeut) a condition that must be trlie before an Event or State conies about.
* After Condition (AC::): (permanent) a co,ldition that becomes trtie after an Event or State comes about.
* Has Subpart (l,as): (tenlporary) an Object lias re-lated subparts or is a subpart of another Object.
* Characteristic (has Semautic.Label): (I.emliorary) an Object has the characteristic of Senmntie_Lal)el (usually an Abstract_Relation: Size, Shape Colour etc.).
This takes the form of: "lteni has Senlautie_Label", such as "Pelerhas Existel,ee Lif~span".
Tiffs states that an item witll tile semantic item Peter has an existence of some kind and filrther locates tllat itenl on a path of the network to the abstract relation of lAfespan.
Iu this way, nodes between these two points are all available for reference by the inference system.
. Ability (able_to): (temporary) This is not fully defined in tim current systenl but represents characteristic features of items e.g.
"dooF' often appears in the tlleme position of tile Events Open aud,O'hll\[.
These liuks are considered sutllcient for tile current capabilities of the system.
I,inks may be deleted or others added as the range of the sytem widens, if this is tllought necessary or desirable.
4.4.2 Permanent
.(k Tenlporary Links The dlfference between perrnallent and I;enll)orary links is iu the nature of the iuformation that they convey.
Permauent links are those that are augmented to tile lletwork and COlllleCt uodes cue I,o tile other in accordance with the features found in those nodes.
~Bef(~re Condition and Aries" Condition links are permanent, although the hiformation contaiued in the uodes that, t.hey connect to will only become awdlable to the context nlonitor iu accordance with the tense al/d aspect of the verb (i.e..
all After Condilion is obviously only valid crier the completion of the (for exalnplc) action denoted by a verb has finished.
Teniporary liuks are those that supply default illforfllation to the COlltext Il~Ollitor coucerning nodes that it is COliCerlied wii.h.
'Fhus, for exaluF, le > an entry for a bird iuight state that it is Able_To Fly.
llowever, if the input text were to state that a particular bird is unable to fly, that A1Ao "l'o link would be cancelled.
Thus tolllporary links provide the iliforulatioil that the colitext nlonitor rises> using the teinporary links to spread throughoilt the network (within set search constraints) aild gat.hering inPoruiatioii that Call lie used for infcreilcing.
4.4.3 Exanlph; of the Augmented Foat;uro.s All exalllple Of the features used to a/l~_~Illent tile seniantic network can be <tivoli tlsiilg the e×alrll)le: Peler heard that,\]olui had died.

When the enibedded clause is analysed, "Jolin" will be analysed in a similar way.
The semantic feature human:yes locates these l, wo lexical items as subsurned by the semantic feature "Living" in the network.
Augmerited Featin'es Ibr a mah; bureau such as the objects relZ'rred to by the nanles Pcler aud Jolin are shown below in Figure d below along with possible entries for the l,\]w!nt die and the St~te be sad, It ca,l be seen that one of the Before Conditions o\[' the I'\]wmt Die is I,hat the actor role is filled by all il, em I;hat has the seilialllic feature "Living".
The del'ault asstllUl'd, iou for "JoDll" is thai.

Thus the semantic item "John" is first linked with the semantic feature "lluman" and all the other featm'es inherited from that feature.
However, the features associated with the semantic item "Die" cause the links associated with "John" to change.
This means that when tile seeend sentence is analysed, the possilfle candidates f()r the exl)erieneer role of the semantic item "lhLSa(f' are analysed, an itmn with the semantic feature "Allinmte" will be sought, and so the item ",/ok".
will not be considered in the.
search as it is no long,-r on a path reachable hy "Animate.".
"Pete/' is therefore the only possible antecedent.
4.~ Articles Japanese does not use de.finite and indefinite artides and so when there is no ow.'rt determiner in the aal)anese, one must be supplied for the English translation.
For example, Sentence 2 of ore" example text: 155" M" 1:111~3E l~ll V~l~',Ij: U/::,, They passed the videos to the Sales,qeetion.
Where a simple default rule is used for articles, ibis eouhl equally be machine translated as: I\]te 9 llaSsed videos to the Sales Division ~, where it can be co.sidered that some of the sense of the original seuteuce is lost.
While the use of contextual informatDm canl~.t solve all of the prolflems of art.Mes, it is hoped that at least in some eases incorrect possil)ililies (:;m I)e eliminated (following tile "l>est guess" policy).
I1, lhe cases that the context monitor cannot decide, an article, the MT system default will be re.lied upon.
% decide between a definite and indefinite article in \]'~nglish, a simple rule of thumb in the present system is that once an object has been specified in a coiitexL, 6ttSstlnlillg that the noun is defined as phu'al l)y sonic (~lher process, oLherwlse a vtdeo is als~ a l)osslbilily ;ill subsequent references to that parLichh~r object in the saine context will be definite r.
In the method proposed here, as objects are analysed, they are giwm a unique reference number (re*) that separates them l'ron~ all other objects of file same type.
Thus, the first time that an object is analysed, it will be nLade indefinite, unless the reference can l)e analysed as being ;t generic one (e.g.
The lio~ is a da~lerous animal et(:).
l"rom then on, if an item ill the text can be linked to an il.em which is the current focus, a potential focus or an i(.em on the focus stack, it will l)e made definite i.
the English tr;mslation.
Therefore, the two video models of Sentence 3 are recognised as a sul)set of the four videos that Form the focus and are.
given the (lefild/.e article.
Note also that as subparts of objects are inch|ded in the features attached to selllantic items using the has feature, objects related to an item already ment.ioned call also be treated to solne extent and translated with deft.

5 Limitations
g~ Problems As shown above, the inferencing carried out is very simple.
It depends entirely on the links between nodes of the network and there is an obvious limit as to how complicated those links may I)eeome before the processing required to search all t,he nodes linked to a particular item becomes prohibitiw~'.
At, the current, stage of planning, a strnctnre (a semantic il.eni) may be linked to another via one node (constrained l o be an Abstract It.elation).
There are no current plans I.o increase the number of such linking nodes.
The inference mechanism is also expected to perform poorly where actions denoted by a wn'b are COlllplex.
This is due to the very simple feature descriptions that we use in the systenl.
It might therefore be desirable that, if the processing is not ccmlpleted within, for example, a constrained time, the process be terminated and the context moiiit,or left to rely on semantic feature matching alone.
Another major problem is writing the features for the links in the network.
At the moment, all features are written by hand, })tit, it is hoped that sinlilar information might be extracted from semantic and casefi'ame dictionaries.
The context monitor is currently written in PII0LOG 9.
The program eui'rently consists of several hundred lines of PROLOG.
6 Final

The context monitor syst,em searches tbr Sl)e('ific information fi'om the input sentence and if it: cannot find it, it simply does nothing, ailowilig (.lie defaults of the translation system to supply the necessary hlformation.
The search routines of the context monitor look for that specific information at as earlier a sl.age as possible in the process aud so if that inforniation is 9Not all of the feahn'es inentioneJ, in this paper at'(! currently iniplelriented not fonnd, the next routine is tried as qui\[:kly as possible in order not to decrease the overall translation speed by a significant amounL Even when the context monitor fails and the MT systeln defaults are relied upon, the context monitor enstlres COllSistellcy with snl)sequent sentellces.
Complicated texts are likely to lead to the Context.
