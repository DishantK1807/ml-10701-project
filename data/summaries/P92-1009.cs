Finally, note that our approach of including rhetorical goals in discourse plans is modelled on the work of Hovy (Hovy, 1988) and Moore and Paris (Moore & Paris, 1989; Moore & Paris, 1988), who used rhetorical plans to generate coherent text.

to Past Research Most previous work in computational or formal linguistics on particularized conversational implicature (Green, 1990; Horacek, 1991; Joshi, Webber & Weischedel, 1984a; .\]oshi, Webber Weischedel, 1984b; Reiter, 1990; Whiner & Maida, 1991) has treated other kinds of implicature than we consider here.

Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander (Lascarides & Asher, 1991; Lascarides & Oberlander, 1992) described the interpretation and generation of temporal implicatures.
