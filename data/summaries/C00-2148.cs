Stone and Doran (1997) describe a system used for generation that simultaneously constructs the semantics and syntax of a sentence using LTAGs.
P97-1026
Researching whether a TAG grammar for VerbNet can be automatically constructed by using development tools such as Xia et al.(1999) or Candito (1996) is part of our next step.
C96-1034
Dang et al.(1998) showed that multiple listings could in some cases be interpreted as regular sense extensions, and defined intersective Levin classes, which are a more line-grained, syntactically and semantically coherent refinement of basic Levin classes.
P98-1046
We decompose each event E into a tripartite structure in a manner similar to Moens and Steedman (1988), introducing a time function for each predicate to specify whether the predicate is true in the preparatory (d~ring(E)), cuhnination (er~d(E)), or consequent (res~ll:(E)) stage of an event.
J88-2003
Despite many different lexicon development approaches (Mel'cuk, 1988; Copestakc and Sanfilippo, 1993; Lowe et al., 1997), the field has yet to develop a clear conseusus on guidelines for a colnputational lexicon.
