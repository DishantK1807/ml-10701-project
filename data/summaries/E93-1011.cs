In that sense, our method can be viewed as a particular implementation of a model of language Performance (Bod, 1992), and may belong to the family of Data-Oriented methods in Computational Linguistics.

(Zernik, 1992a, 1992b) describes a method to distinguish thematic relations (e.g., expressed concerns), which take on syntactic variations in the corpus, and sentential relations (e.g., preferred stocks) that do not.

The average rates are : 27 % no disambiguation 70 % correct disambiguation 3 % wrong disambiguation The LEXTER-K project : knowledge extraction from large technical text corpora LEXTER is a Terminology Extraction Software (Bourigault, 1992a, 1992b).

(Jensen and Binot, 1987) proposes a method to disambiguate prepositional phrase attachment in English sentences which is similar to ours in that it aims at eliminating the hand coding of semantic information by exploiting an already available source of information.

Some of the MLNP structures are non-ambiguous : given such a structure it can be stated with a very high rate of certainty (Bourigault 1992a) that only one parsing is valid.

This method ("Asking the right questions of the corpus") is similar to the strategy described in this paper, and we agree with Zernik's general line of thinking : "In order for a program to interpret natural language text, it must train on and exploit word connections in the text under interpretation (Zernik, 1992a)".

Moreover, we argued that, given the restricted grammatical structures of complex terminological units, it was not necessary to go into a complete syntactic analysis of the sentences to extract the terminology from a corpus (Bourigault, 1992b).
