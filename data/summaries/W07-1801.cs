For example, by using the GF grammar compiler, the DUDE (Lemon and Liu, 2006) system can support both the ATK and Nuance recognizers.

DUDE (Lemon and Liu, 2006) and its extension REALL-DUDE (Lemon et al., 2006b) are environments where non-experts can develop dialogue systems based on Business Process Models describing the applications.

We have extended Moore?s (2000) LCLR transform to preserve the semantic interpretation.

SLMs from GF Grammars Jonson (2006) has shown that in addition to generating grammar-based language models, GF can be used to build statistical language models (SLMs).

We carry compositional semantic interpretation through left-recursion elimination using the same idea as the UNIANCE grammar compiler (Bos, 2002), though our version handles both direct and indirect left-recursion.

Work 7.1 Unification Grammar Compilation Compilation of unification grammars to speech recognition grammars is well described in the literature (Moore, 1999; Dowding et al., 2001).

Left-recursion elimination All direct and indirect left-recursion is removed using the LCLR transform described by Moore (2000).

The UNIANCE grammar compiler (Bos, 2002) uses that approach.

The Voice Programming system by Georgila and Lemon (Georgila and Lemon, 2006; Lemon et al., 2006a) uses an SLF language model generated from a GF grammar.
