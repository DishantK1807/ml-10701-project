purpose of the experiment was to test the usefulness of our proposed system and to gather data for the designers of the natural language processor we planned to implement (Biermann et al.1983). The subjects in the experiment were seated in front of a terminal display with a microphone and were instructed to speak their commands using discrete speech (about one word per second) or slow connected speech.
