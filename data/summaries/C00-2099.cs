Nothing prevents conditioning the random variables on arbitrary portions of Clio 1)artial tree generated this far, using, e.g., maximum-entrol)y or decision-tree models to extract relevant t~atnres of it; there is no difference 689 in principle between our model and history-based parsing, see (Black el; al., 1993; Magerman, 1995).
P93-1005 P95-1037
Schemes like (Alshawi, 1996) tacitly make this approximation.
P96-1023
This is the same separation of arguments and adjuncts as that employed by (Collins, 1997).
P97-1003
The stochastic model generating dependency trees is very similar to other statistical dependency models, e.g., to that of (Alshawi, 1996).
P96-1023
Otherwise, the result will be approxima.ting the parse probabi\]ity with a derivation probability, as described in detail in (Samuelsson, 2000) based on the seminal work of (Sima'an, 1996).
