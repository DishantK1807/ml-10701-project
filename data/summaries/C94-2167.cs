Our work has focussed recently on the development of tools for sublanguage linguistic analysis to aid the process of word classification: e.g. to effect inversion of KWIC indexes and to apply techniques of gradual approximation to discover semantic collocations between words (Sekine et.al, 1992a, 1992b).
