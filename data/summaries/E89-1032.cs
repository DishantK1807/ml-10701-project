The obvious solution is to use a lemma table or chart (as discussed by Pereira and Warren 1984 and Shieber 1988).
C88-2128
Shieber (1988) claims that the problem of logical equivalence reduces to the knowledge representation problem.

1. Introduction In this paper we present an algorithm for generating sentences using unification categorial grammars (UCGs, Zeevat et al.1987) but which extends to any categorial grammar with unification (e.g., categorial unification grammars, Uszkoreit 1986, Karttunen 1987).
C86-1045
Two further problems are the treatment of unary rules and functors with what Shieber (1988) calls vestigial semantics, which we prefer to call identity semantics.
C88-2128
The crucial property is a stricter form of Shieber's (1988) property of semantic monotonicity.
C88-2128
Shieber (1988) states that to guarantee completeness in using a precomputed entry in the chart, the entry must subsume the formula being generated top-down.
C88-2128
We relate the algorithm to proposals by Shieber (1988).
