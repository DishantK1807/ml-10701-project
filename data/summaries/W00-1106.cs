Noun Indexing To index compound nouns from documents, we use a natural language processing engine, SKOPE (Standard KOrean Processing Engine) (Cha et al., 1998), which processes documents by analysing words into morphemes and tagging part-of-speeches.

For the three-element compound nouns, the MI part is replaced with the three-element MI equation 3 (Su et al., 1994).
P94-1033
(Su et al., 1994) showed that the average mutual information of a compound noun tends to be higher than that of a noncompound noun, so we try to use the mutual information as the measure for identifying the compound nouns.
P94-1033
(Strzalkowski et al., 1996; Evans and Zhai, 1996) indexed subcompounds from complex noun phrases using noun-phrase analysis.
P96-1003
For mutual information (MI), we use two different equations: one for two-element compound nouns (Church and Hanks, 1990) and the other for three-element compound nouns (Suet al., 1994).
