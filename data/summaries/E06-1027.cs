The majority of dictionary-based approaches use WordNet information, especially, synsets and hierarchies, to acquire sentiment-marked words (Hu and Liu, 2004; Valitutti et al., 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) or to measure the similarity between candidate words and sentiment-bearing words such as good and bad (Kamps et al., 2004).

The statistical approaches usually employ somequantitative criterion (e.g., magnitude of pointwise mutual information in (Turney and Littman, 2002), “goodness-for-fit” measure in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), probability of word’s sentiment given the sentiment if its synonyms in (Kim and Hovy, 2004), etc).

in importance of various sentiment markers have crystallized in two main approaches: automatic assignment of weights based on some statistical criterion ((Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004), and others) or manual annotation (Subasic and Huettner, 2001).

A third, clean-up pass is then performed to partially disambiguate the identified WordNet glosses with Brill’s part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995), which performs with up to 95% accuracy, and eliminates errors introduced into the list by part-of-speech ambiguity of some words acquired in pass 1 and from the seed list.

With multiple bootstrapping runs on different seed 4It is consistent with the observation by Kim and Hovy (2004) who noticed that, when positives and neutrals were collapsed into the same category opposed to negatives, the agreement between human annotators rose by 12%.

Overall, the system’s 66.5% accuracy on the collapsed runs is comparable to the accuracy reported in the literature for other systems run on large corpora (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997).

The Table 1 presents the comparison of GIH4 (General Inquirer Harvard IV-4 list, (Stone et al., 1966)) 2 and HM (from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) study) lists of words manually annotated with sentiment tags by two different research teams.

The first group includes methods that rely on syntactic or co-occurrence patterns of words in large texts to determine their sentiment (e.g., (Turney and Littman, 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Grefenstette et al., 2004) and others).
