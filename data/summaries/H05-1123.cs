In an earlier line of research we have formulated the above problem and addressed it within a probabilistic vector-based setting, presenting two related heuristic algorithms (Dagan et al., 2002; Marx et al., 2004).

This research task has been defined quite recently (Dagan et al., 2002), and has not been explored extensively yet.

Previous works aimed at identifying – through clusters of words – concepts, sub-topics or themes that are prominent within a corpus of texts (e.g., Pereira et al., 1993; Li, 2002; Lin and Pantel, 2002).

clustering Our algorithmic framework elaborates on Pereira et al.’s (1993) distributional clustering method.

Falkenhainer et al., 1989), the CP method adapts distributional clustering (Pereira et al., 1993), a standard approach applicable to unstructured data.

Here we term the three variations involving priors CPI (prior added in step (1) only, which is the same as the method described in Dagan et al., 2002), CPII (prior added in step (3) only) and CPIII (prior added in both steps; as the method in Marx et al., 2004).
