t r Abstract This paper presents an efficient algorithm for retrieving from a database of trees, all trees that match a given query tree appro,imately, that is, within a certain error tolerance.
It has natural language processing applications in searching for matches in example-based translation systems, and retrieval from lexical databases containing entries of complex feature structures.
The algorithm has been implemented on SparcStations, and for large randomly generated synthetic tree databases (some having tens of thousands of trees) it can associatively search \[or trees with a small error, in a matter of tenths of a second to few seconds.
1 Introduction
Recent approaches in machine translation known as example-based translation rely on searching a database of previous translations of sentences or fragments of sentences, and composing a translation from the translations of any matching examples (Sato and Nagao, 1!)90; Nirenburg, Beale and l)omasnhev, 1994).
The example database may consist, of paired text fragments, or trees as in Sat() and Nagao (1990).
Most often, exact matches for new sentences or fragments will not be in the database, and one has to consider exampies that are "similar" to the sentence or fragment in question.
This involves associatively searching through the database, tbr trees that are "close" to the query tree.
This paper addresses the computational problem o\[ retrieving trees that are close to a given query tree in terms of a certain distance metric.
The paper first presents the approximate tree matching problem in an abstract setting and presents an algorithm for approximate associative tree matching.
The Mgorithm relies on linearizing the trees and then representing the complete database of trees as atrie structure which can be efficiently searched.
The problem then reduces to sequence correction problem akin to standard spelling correction problem.
The trie is then used with an approximate finite state recognition algorithm close to a query tree.
Following some experimental results from a number of synthetic tree databases, the paper ends with conclusions.
2 Approximate
Tree Matching In this paper we consider the problem of searching in a database of trees, all trees that are "close" to a given query tree, where closeness is defined in terms of an error metric.
The trees that we consider have labeled terminal and non-terminal nodes.
We assume that all immediate children of a given node have unique labels, and that a total ordering on these labels is defined.
We consider two trees close if we can • add/delete a small number of leaves to/from one of the trees, and/or • change the label of a small number of leaves in one of the trees to get the second tree.
A pair of such "close" trees is depicted in Fignre 1.
2.1 Linearization
of trees Before proceeding any fllrther we would like to define the terminology we will be using in the fob lowing sections: We identify each leaf node in a tree with an ordered vertex list (re, vl, v2,..., vd) where each vi is the label of a vertex from the root v0 to the leaf Vd at depth d, and :{'or i > 0, vi is the parent of vi+ L.
A tree with n leaves is represented by a vertex list sequence.
VLS =.Vi,V'e,...,¼, where each V~.
= v3o, v, v~, v~, . •., va,;, corresponds to a vertex list for a leaf at level dj.
This sequence is constructed by taking into account the total order on the labels at every level, that is, 17i is lexico.qraphically less than Vi+l, based on the total ordering of the vertex labels.
For instance, the first tree in Fignre 1 would be represented by the vertex list sequence: 860 S NP I)ct N P V I ~ I A A(I.j N chased I I black cat VP NP Det N P the A<I.j N I I little mouse j~-..

2.2 Distance
between two trees We deline the distan<'e 1)etween two trees aeeor(1ing to the struchrral diJl~,,,'cnces or differences in leaf labels.
We consider an extra or a missing leaf a.s a structural change.
If, however, both trees Itave a leaw~s whose vertex lists match in all but the last (leaf vertex) lat>e\], we.
<:onsi<ler this as a dil\[erence in leaf lal>cls.
For instance, in I,'igm'e 2, (ihere is extra, leaf in tree (I)) in <,Oml)a.rison to the tree in (a), while tree (c) has a leaf label diffc,,ence.
We a.sso<:iate the f'ollowing costs associated with these <lifl'erences: • If I>oth trees have a.
lea\[' whose verl;ex list matches in all but the last (leaf w.'l:tex) ta-bel, we assign a label <lill~rence error of C.
• \[\[' a certa,in leaf is missing in one of" the trees but exists in the other one, then we assign a <:ost S for this a structural dilI'erence.
We <'urrently treat all structural or leaf label <\]if:fere,<:es as incurring a.
cost that is indel>endent of the tree level at whi<'h \];he difference takes i)lacc.

If, however, ditl~rences that ar0.
closer to the root of the tree are considered to b(' more serious than differences further away \[\]:on~ the root, it is \]>os-sible to mo<lify the formulation to take this into ~tCCOtl nt.

A h'ee database l) <:onsists of a set o\[' trees '/~, "1~, •.., 5/~., ea.ch "1) being a vertex list sequ<mce for a tree.
Once we convert all the trees to a linear form, we haw: a set; o\[" vertex list sequences.
We can convert this set into a trie data structure.
This trie will compress ;-'~l\]y l>ossible redundancies in the prefixes of the vertex list; sequences to achieve a.
certain ('ompa<'tion which hell>s during searching.

2 2.4 Error-tolerant, matching in the trie Our concern in this work is not the exact match of trees but rather approximate match.
Given the vertex list sequence for a query tree, exact match over the trie can be performed using the standard t;ech niques by fbllowing the edge labeled with next vertex list until a loft in the trie is reached, ~-md the query vertex label sequence is exhausted.
For approximate tree matching, we use the errortolerant approximate tinite-state recognition algorithm (Oflazer, 1996), which tinds all strings within a giwm error threshold of some string in the regular set accepted by the underlying finitestate acceptor.
An adaptation of this algorithm will be briefly summarized here.
hh:ror-tolerant matching of vertex list sequences requires an errol: inetric for measuring how rnuch two such sequences deviate from each other.
The distance between two sequences measures the minimum number of insertions, deletions and leaf label changes that are necessary to convert one tree into another.
It should be noted that this is different fl:om the error metric defined by (Wang el M., 1994).
Let Z = Z1, Z.~,..., Zp, denote a generic vertex list sequence of p vertex lists.
Z\[j\] denotes the initim subsequence of Z up to and including the ju~ leaf label.
We will use X (of length rn) to denote the query vertex list sequence, and Y (of length n) to denote the sequence that is a (possibly pattie.I) candidate vertex list sequence (from (;he database of trees).
Given two vertex list sequences X and Y, the distance, disffX\[m\], Y\[n\]), computed according to the recurrence below, gives the minimum number of leaf insertions, deletions or lea\[' label (:hai~ges necessary to change one tree to the other.
dist(X\[m\], Y\[n\]) = dist(X\[m1\], Y\[n1\]) if x,~, = y,,.

2.5 An
algorithm for approximate tree mat ehing Standard searching with a trie corresponds to traversing a path starting t}om the start node (o\[' the trie), to one of tlle lea\[' nodes (of the trie), so that the concatenation of the labels on the arcs along this path matches the input vertex list sequence.
For error-tolerant matching, one needs to lind all paths from the start node lo one of the final nodes, so lhat wh.en lhe labels on the edges along a path are concatenated, lhc resulting "verlea; list sequence is within a given dislance lh, rcshold t, of the query vertex list sequence.
This search has to be very fast if apl)roximate matching is to be of any practical use.
This means that paths in the trie that can lead to no solutions have to be pruned so that the search can be limited to a very small percentage of the search space.
We need to make sure that any candidate (1)refix) vertex list sequence that is generated as the search is being p'erfbrmed, does not deviate from certain initial subsequences of" the query sequence by more than the allowed threshold.
To detect such cases, we use the notion ol'a cnl-off distance.
The cut-off distance measures the minimum dislance between an initial subsequence of the query 862 sequence sequel:it(% a.nd the (possibly partial) can(lidate soqtlOll(-(L I,et Y he ;~ l)a.rtial candi(lato se<,llleric(~ whose lmagth is n, and le, t X be tl/c query soqll('\[lC(~ O\[ hmgth m..
