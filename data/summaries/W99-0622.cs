Lesmo and Torasso (1985) and Collins (1997)) would almost certainly improve parsing.

Carroll et al.(1998) argue that these relations enable a more accurate metric for parsing than labeled bracketing and recall.

Utsuro and Matsumoto (1997) present a very interesting mechanism for learning semantic case frames for Japanese verbs: each case frame is a tuple of independent component frames (each of which may have an n-tuple of slots).

While these approaches have had som e success to date (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997a), their usability as parsers in systems for natural language understanding is suspect.
P97-1003
Carroll et al.(1998) report results on a parser, similarly based on linguistically well-founded resources, using corpus-derived subcategorization probabilities (the first term in Equation (2)).

Since the most frequent words are typically the most polysemous, the ambiguity problem is more severe for this subset, but there is also more data: we have about 24,000 instances of 10,000 distinct senses in our corpus, and Ng and Lee (1996) use 192,800 occurrences of their 191 words.

Ng and Lee (1996) report results on disambiguat√∑ 6The improvement gotten for moving from binary to rt-ary relations, when using WordNet, is not significant.

Chang et al.(1992) describe a model for machine translation which can accommodate n-ary lexical statistics.

As an example, consider the fiat NP structures that are in the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
