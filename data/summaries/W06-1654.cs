Curran and Moens (2002) found that dramatically increasing the volume of raw input data for distributional similarity tasks increases the accuracy of synonyms extracted.

The text was lemmatised using Connexor Machinese (Tapanainen and J¨avinen, 1997)2 producing vocabularies of 42,671 terms of Spanish, 100,891 terms of Swedish, 40,181 terms of English and 70,384 terms of German.

Curran and Moens (2002) found that increasing the volume of input data increased the accuracy of results generated using a full vector space model.

Gorman and Curran (2006) showed Random Indexing to be much faster than full vector space techniques, but with a 46–56% reduction in accuracy compared to using JACCARD and TTEST±.

This task was first approached as a distributional similarity-like problem by Brown et al.(1988). Their approach uses aligned corpora in two or more languages: the source language, from which we are translating, and the target language, to which we are translating.
C88-1016
Comparisons between low frequency terms are less accurate than between high frequency terms as there is less evidence describing them (Curran and Moens, 2002).
