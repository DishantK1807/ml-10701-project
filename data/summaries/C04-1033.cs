In both trees, the string-similarity features occur on the top portion, which supports the arguments by (Strube et al., 2002) and (Yang et al., 2004) that string-matching is a crucial factor for NP coreference resolution.

Among them, NE recognition, part-of-speech tagging and text chunking adopt the same HMM based engine with error-driven learning capability (Zhou and Su, 2002).

In the heuristic salience-based algorithm for pronoun resolution, Lappin and Leass (1994) introduce a procedure for identifying anaphorically linked NP as a cluster for which a global salience value is computed as the sum of the salience values of its elements.

Besides, the idea of clustering can be seen in the research of cross-document coreference, where NPs with high context similaritywouldbechainedtogetherbasedoncertain clustering methods (Bagga and Biermann, 1998; Gooi and Allan, 2004).

The NE recognition component trained on GENIA (Shen et al., 2003) can recognize up to 23 common biomedical entity types with an overall performance of 66.1 Fmeasure (P=66.5% R=65.7%).

Cardie and Wagstafi (1999) have proposed an unsupervised approach which also incorporates cluster information into consideration.

MRF (Soon et al., 2001) selects the candidate closest to the anaphor, while BF (Aone and Bennett, 1995; Ng 2The confldence value is obtained by using the smoothed ratio p+1t+2, where p is the number of positive instances and t is the total number of instances contained in the corresponding leaf node.

Inspired by the work of (Strube et al., 2002) and (Yang et al., 2004), we use two features, StrSim1 (f17) and StrSim2 (f18), to measure the string-matching degree of NPj and NPi.

2 Baseline: the NP-NP based approach 2.1 Framework description We built a baseline coreference resolution system, which adopts the common NP-NP based learning framework as employed in (Soon et al., 2001).

A similar flnding was also reported by Ng and Cardie (2002b) in the MUC data set.

The recall and precision were calculated automatically according to the scoring scheme proposed by Vilain et al.(1995). In Table 3 we compared the performance of difierent coreference resolution systems.

Most of the features come from Soon et al.(2001)â€™s system.

So far, several efiorts (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002a; Ng and Cardie, 2002b) have attempted to address this problem by discarding the \hard" pairs and select only those confldent ones from the NP-pair pool.
