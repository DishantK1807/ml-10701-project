Aone and Bennett (1995) claimed that the overall anaphora resolution performance seems to have reached a plateau at around 250 training examples.

On the other hand, Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) proposed a resolving algorithm for Japanese exophoric ellipses of written texts, utilizing semantic and pragmatic constraints.

Machine-learning algorithm has also been attempted to solve some Table 1: Tagged Ellipsis Types Tag Meaning <lsg> <lpl> (2sg> (2pl) (g) (a) first person, singular first person, plural second person, singular second person, plural person(s) ~n general anaphoric discourse processing problems, for example, in discourse segment boundaries or discourse cue words (Walker and Moore, 1997).
J97-1001
The most popular touchstone in this field is the verbal case frame or the translation rules (Tanaka, 1994).
C94-2116
For instance, Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) attempted to resolve Japanese ellipsis in the source language analysis of J-to-E MT, despite utilizing targetdependent resolution candidates.
C96-2137
Aone and Bennett (1995) applied a machinelearning technique to anaphora resolution in written texts.
