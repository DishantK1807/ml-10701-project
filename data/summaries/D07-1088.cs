Recently an increasing number of research efforts on text mining and IE have used CRF models (e.g., Peng and McCallum, 2004).

(Wick et al., 2006) report extracting database records by learning record field compatibility.

Hence the standard P k (Beeferman et al., 1997) and WinDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) measures for text segmentation are not so suitable for our task.

Recent work includes improved model variants (e.g., Jiao et al., 2006; Okanohara et al., 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al., 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).

This paper mainly focuses on the VP problem, since linguistic features for the HP problem is the general IE topic of much past research (e.g., Peng and McCallum, 2004).

Results To fully compare the effectiveness of our semantic analysis functionality, we evaluated system performance for all the following systems: TextTiling (TT): To compare with text segmentation techniques, we use TextTiling (Hearst, 1994) with default parameters as the first baseline system.

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has come up with various solutions towards topic-based text segmentation (e.g., Hearst, 1994; Choi, 2000; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).
