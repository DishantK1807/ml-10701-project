(Webber et al., 1999) apply operations on trees for incorporating cue-phrases in a grammar-driven approach to discourse structure.

It has, however, also been observed (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995; Grote et al., 1997) that sometimes phrases may serve as very condensed forms to express elaborate contents.

As prepositions (and cue-phrases in general) can signal different coherence relations, the presented computational approach couples a cue-phrase approach like (Marcu, 1998) with inferences using the computed semantic representation.

Ultimately, however, there is also a third criterion that needs to be considered: namely, that a coherence relation can be found by which the phrase may be related to the remainder of the clause it occurs in (Marcu et al., 1999).

cent studies mention the role of PPs as carriers of coherence relations (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995; Grote et al., 1997), but only for the purpose of text generation.
J95-1002
Previous approaches to (automatically) deriving a text's discourse structure either tried to rely on purely surface-based criteria (cuephrases, (Marcu, 1998)) or concentrated on inferences about representations of discourse units (Asher, 1993; Hobbs et al., 1993).

(Corston, Oliver, 1998) enlarges the cue-phrase approach of (Marcu, 1998) in a vein sJmi\]ar to the one presented in Section 5.
W98-0301
Only recently, there have been some approaches (Webber et al., 1999) that acknowledge the need to incorporate both a treatment of cue-phrase approaches and inferences.
