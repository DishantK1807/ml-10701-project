ntt. j p Abstract This paper proposes a method to resolve the reference of deictic Japanese zero pronouns which can be implemented in a practical machine translation system.
This method focuses on semantic and pragmatic constraints such as semantic constraints on cases, modal expressions, verbal semantic attributes and conjunctions to determine the deictic reference of Japanese zero pronouns.
This method is highly effective because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand is not very large and its precision of resolution is good.
This method was implemented in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system, ALT-J/E.
According to a window test for 175 zero pronouns with deictic referent in a sentence set for the evaluation of Japaneseto-English machine translation systems, all of zero pronouns could be resolved consistently and correctly.
1 Introduction
In all natural language, elements that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978).
This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural language processing systems.
For example in a machine translation system, the system needs to recognize that elements which are not present in the source language, may become mandatory elements in the target language.
In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese; whereas they are often mandatory in English.
Thus, in Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (these are referred to as "zero pronouns") for their translation into English expressions.
Several methods have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986) (Walker et al., 1990) (Yoshimoto, 1988) (Dousaka, 1994).
When considering the application of these methods to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area can not be limited, it is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resolution is low as they only use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared betbrehand is so large.
The zero pronouns that must be resolved by a machine translation system carl be classitied into 3 types; (a) zero pronouns with antecedents within the same sentence (intrasenteutial), (b) zero pronouns with antecedents elsewhere in the text (intersentential) and (c) zero pronouns with deictic reference (extrasentential).
Regarding type (b), Nakaiwa and Ikehara (1992) proposed a method to determine the intersentential antecedents us-ing verbal semantic attributes.
The rules used in this method are independent of the field of the source text.
Therefore, anaphora resolution may be conducted with a relatively small volume of knowledge, making the proposed method very suitable for machine translation systems.
Furthermore, for type (a), Nakaiwa and \[kehara(1995) proposed a method to determine the intrasententim antecedents of Japanese zero pronouns using semantic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes and pragmatic constraints such as types of conjunctions and modal expressions.
In this paper, we propose a widely applicable method to determine the deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns (type (c)) using not only semantic constraints to the c~es but also fln:ther semantic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes and pragmatic constraints such as modal expressions and types of conjunctions.
2 Appearance
of Zero Pronouns in Japanese Texts In order to understand the distribution of zero pronouns with antecedents that do not appeal" in the text, in this section, we examine which zero pronouns nmst be resolved and where their antecedents appear, using a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English ma812 chine translation systems (lkehara et al., 1994).
'l'he results of the examination of zero pronouns and their referential elements in the flmctional test sentence set (3718 sentences) are shown in Table l.
There were ~, total of 512 zero pronomls in 463 sentences.
The location of referential elements can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressed in the same sentence, and those, not expressed in the same sentence.
'rim latter were fltrther classitied into 6 kinds.
• The zero pronoun is not translated be(:ause the passive voi(:e is used.
• The referent is the writer or speaker, I or a grollp~ we.
• '\['he referent is the reader or hemmer, you, • The referent is human but it is not known who the human is.
• The zero pronoun shouhl be translated as it.
• The rcf(,rent is another specitic element.
According to this study of the fimctional test sentence set, in 373 out of 512 instances (73%) the antecedent was not expressed in the sentence.
Zero pronouns conhl be left unexpressed by converting the translation to the passive voice in 173 instances (34%).
'Fhe other zero pron(mns, 200 instances (39%), referred to antecedents that (lid not appear in the sentence.
\[n 69 ()tit, of the 200 instances (13%) zero pronouns were th.e subject of the sentence and referred to the writer or speaker I or a group we.
Further examination revealed that only in these 69 instances did the verb that governed them express some modality such as shilai 'want to -' or -shiyou 'Let us -' or the verbs were omou 'tMnk' and other such words indicating ~TI\]\[INKING ACTION'.
Furthermore, zero pronouns that were the subjects and that referred to the reader or hearer you, ainounted to 28 out of the 200 instances (5%).
In these 28 instances, ~he verbs that governed these zero pronouns expressed the modalities ofsubekida 'should' or -sitehanaranai 'nmst n(it'.
Similarly, modalities and verb types can be used to identify it or the 'unknown human'.
This tyl)e of zero t)ron(mn can be resolved by deducing their referents using modality or categor:ized verl)al semantic attrilmtes.
3 Deictic
Resolution of Japanese Zero Pronouns lhused on the results shown in section 2, we propose a method to resolve Japanese zero pronouns whose antecedents do not appear in the texts.
3.1 Dei('tle Resolution using Semantic Constraints on Cases ~lb resolve Japanese zero pronouns whose antecedents do not appear within the texts, it is possible to use the semantic constraints on verbs' case Table 1: Distribution of zero pronouns and their referential elements ~~ Loc.
of 'referential elements' \[ --,tII p~w I l~-yo.--7\]~,, in.
I t~l elements to deduce like.ly referents.
The semantic information used to estimate supplementing elements is similar to the constraints on cases used tbr selecting the transfer patterns in a machine translation systeln.
Figure \[ shows an examph: of a transtb.r pattern in a Japanese-to-English tnachine translation syst, em for the,lapanese~ verb ikimasu 'gC.
Figure 1 shows how, if the,lapane.se verb is ikimasu 'go' and the noun phr~use with a ga pc.riMe, which shows a subject, has the senmntic attribute SUBJECT, VEIIICLES OR, ANIMALS~ then the verb should be translated as 'go'.
In this pattern, if Lit(; suhject N I beeonles a zero l)ronoun, the system tries to estimate the referent using semantic constraints.
But, in this case., it is impossible to estimate the referent as one type, be.cause there are three kinds of semantic constraints.
In the transfer pattern, the semantic constraints are left unfulfilled if they are not used in selecting the appropriate translation.
So, this method frequently l)oses di\[\[iculties in pinpointing elements to be estimated.
According to die results that were examined in section 2, this type of zero pronoun can be resolved by deducing I;heir reDrents not only /tsing semantic constraints to the cases but also using modality or categorized verbal semantic ato tributes.
For example, in this case, it is efl'cetive to determine the referents corresponding to 'I' itsing the verbal semantic attributes of the pattern, N \['S PIIYSI(JAL TRANSI,'ER and the polite exl)ression -maser.
NI(suBJEC'rS, VEHICLES OR ANIMALS)-ga iki-mcu~u N\]-SUBJ go-I'OLITB => N I go.
Figure l: J apanese-toq~Jnglish transfer dictionary 3.2 Deietic Re, solution using Semantic and Pragmatic Constraints According to the analysis of the results shown in section 2, we found that modal expressions and verbal semantic a.ttribntes are usefltl in (leretraining the dei('tic referents of Japanese zero pronouns.
Also, we can estimate the types of conjun<:tions that are effe(:tive in determining the tel< 813 erents in a complex sentence.
In this section, we examine three kinds of semantic and pragmatic constraints, modal expressions, verbal semantic attributes arid conjunctions.
3.2.1 Constraints
Based on Modal Expressions Modal expressions in Japanese are expected Co be the most powerful constraints for estimating deictie reference.
For example, in the case of zero prononns in ga-cases 'subject', the referent becomes the writer or speaker, I or a group, we if the sentence has the modal expressions, -sitai '4) want to -' HOPF, or -silchosii '¢ want ¢ to-' CAUSATIVE HOI'E; the referent becomes the reader or hearer, you if the sentence has the modal expressions, sileha-ikenai '4) must not -' PR()IIIBIT or -subekida '¢ should -' OBLmA'rmN.
If there are no refereat candidates found within the surrounding text, the referents can be determined using the previous constraints based on modal expressions.
3.2.2 Constraints
based on Verbal Smnantie Attributes Constraints b~sed on verbal semantic attributes can be divided into tile \[bllowing two types: (1) Constraints based on the types of verbs 'Give and take' expressions such as the verbs moran 'get' and yaru 'give' and transfer expressions such as the verbs iku 'go' and h'ur'u 'come' can deternfine the referents of zero pronouns without modal expressions.
For example, if the ga-case (subject) of the sentence whose verb is,nora'tt 'get' becolnes a zero pronoun, the referent becomes 1.
In the case of verb kuru 'come', the referent becomes an element other than i, tbr example you.
These kinds of verbs inrplicitly indicate tile relationship between the writer/speaker and the referent of the ga-case (for example, the empathy (Kuno, 1978) or the side of the territory of infbrmation (Kmnio, 1985)).
Based on these properties, tire deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns (:an be estimated.
(2) Constraints based on the types of verbs and modal expressious I,;ven if the referents of zero pronouns (:an not be determined using modal expressions or tile types of verbs, the referents can sometimes be determined using a combination of modal expressions and the types of verbs.
For example, it1 the following Japanese expression, the ga-case becomes a zero pronoun.
(1) hon-wo gon-da ¢-SUBJ book-OI3J \]read-PAST I read a book.
In this sentence the experience of the writer/speaker, 1 is suitable for the reference of the zero pronoun.
As shown in this sentence, if the ga-c~use in an expression with a verb whose semantic attribute is ACTION and modal expre.ssion is -ta PAST, becomes a zero pronoun, it will be translated by a truman translator ~s 1.
In a similar way, if the ga-case in an expression with a verb whose semantic attribute is ACT1ON and modal expression is -darou 'will' FSTIMA'FION, becomes a zero l)ronottn, the referent is you.
Such constraints using both verbal semantic attributes and modal expressions can be used to determine the deictic reference of 3 apanese zero pronouns.
To write constraints based on types of verbs eflbx:tively, we used the 97 verbal semantic attributes (VSA) proposed by Nakaiwa (1994).
3.2.3 Constraints
based on Conjunctions Sometimes the deictic referents of Japanese zero pronouns can be determined depending on the types of conjunctions.
The constraints based on the Japanese conjunctions can be divided into the following two types.
(1) The eonstralnts on <:as(; sharing depending on the types of conjunctions Minami (1974) and Takubo (1987) proposed that (lilt'event Japanese conjunctions cover or share different cases, l,'or example Minanfi divided Japanese conjnnctions into three kinds, A, B and C.
A complex sentence which includes A type Japanese conjunctions, such as tsu-Lsu 'while' and nagara 'while', shares one ha-case ('l'opie) and one ga-ea,se (Subject).
In the case of B type Japanese conjullctions, stlch a8 lzodc 'because' or tara 'iF, one ha.-c~e is shared but not the ga-case.
In the case of C type J a I)an esc conj u actions, such as kcredo 'but' or kedo 'but', neither the ha-case nor the ga-case are necessarily shared.
According to this classification, if two ga-cases in a complex sin> tence joined by an A type Japanese conjunction were to become zero pronouns and the referent of one of the two zero pronouns wins determined by the constraints proposed previously, then the referent of the other zero pronoun is the same referent.
These characteristics of Japanese c(mjunctions can be used to determine the refit'rents of zero pronouns.
(2) Constraints based on conjunctions, inodal expressions and verbal semantic attributes Sometimes co-occurrence of conjunctions, verbal semantic attributes and moda.l expressions in a complex sentence determines the meaning of the sentence, and sometimes they determine the deictic referen(;e of zero pronouns in the sentence.
For example, in the following Japanese expression, th(~ subject of the verb ika-nai 'go-not' becomes a zero pronoun but the referent can be determin(;d as the writer or speaker, you.
(2) tokoya-ni ika-nai to, ¢-SUBJ b~'ber-IND-O13 J go-not if If you don't go to the tmrber, kami-ga boubou-ni-naru hair begin to look unt2dy your hair will begin to look untidy.
814 This sentence has the meaning that the writer or speaker advises that if you do not do something, a situation will arise.
The meaning type of a complex sentence can be determined using the rules that the eOBjlIIICtiO\[I is tO 'if' and in the sub clause ga-case beeoInes a zero pronoun and tile meaning; o\[' the verb is ACTION with negation and in the main clause the meaning of the verb is A'P'PlLIBU'FE with tnoda\] expression ni-uaru 'become' AT'I'ItlB U'\['\],', '\['ltA N S FE \[1..
'\['he meaning type of a complex sentence can he determined using the tblowing ruh'.s: when the con.imletion is 'if' ~md the sill) clause ga-c;~se be(;on~es a zero \]\]FOlIO/Ill, and the meanil~g of the verb is aCTION with negation, and in the main cla.use the meaning of the verb is ATTRIBUT\],; with modal expression, then ni-naru q)eeome' is an example of A'\["PIIBUTE TRANSI,'I~3R.
Using these kinds of rules, the meaning types o1" complex sentences can I)e determined, and the reference of zero pr(m(mns c.an be deterufine.d. 3.3 Algorithm In this sul)section, we t)ropose an algorithm for the deictic resolution of Japanese zero pronouns using the constraints proposed in this section.
This algorithm was implemented in a Japanesetod,3nglish machine translation system, so the only zero pron(mns that must be resolved are those tlu~t become mandatory elernents in li\]nglish.
To realize the previously proposed conditions in an algorithm, we must consider eases when these tmtece(lelll, s exist in the same selitellCe ;ts well as when these antecedents exist in another sent, ences in the text, and we must design the algorithm to increase the eve.rail accuracy of the resolution of zero pronouns.
Anaphora resolution of zero pronouns is conducted as follows.
In each step in the algorithm, when the referential element within or without the text is determined, the system checks not only the conditions that are written in the following algorithm, I)ut also the semantic conditions that verbs impose on zero pronouns in tile case elements in each pattern of the Japanese-to-English transfer dictionaries.

show the results of evaluation of the method that was proposed above.
The method to resolve zero pronouns with deictic reference was tested using the Japanese-to-l'hlglish machine translation system AI/\['-J/F, (lkehara et al., 1991).
The criteria for tile evaluation and proeedures used were as folh)ws.
815 4.1.1 Resolution Target The target was to resolve successfully the five types of zero pronouns (ga-case ~-'T' or "we", gacase e"you", ga-case +-HUMAN, ga-case ~-"it", hi-case ~"you"; 175 instances).
These are the zero pronouns with deictic reference found within the 512 zero pronouns in the a718 sentence set for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems.
4.1.2 Rules
to Resolve Zero Pronouns The rules to resolve 175 zero pronouns were created by examining these zero pronouns using the constraints discussed in section 3 (46 rule@.
4.1.3 Tests
for the Evaluation 'l'o examine the relationship between conditions of resolution and accuracy of resolution, we conducted the following two tests.
(1) Resolution aeeuraey for eonditions of resolution We examined the accuracy of resolution depending on the types of conditions in a.naphora resolutiou such as semantic constraints to the cases, modal expression, verbal semantic attributes and conjunctive expressions.
We evaluated the accuracy depending on the types of constraints used.
(2) Resolution accuracy for rule complexity We examined the accuracy of the resohttions to see how they were affected by the complexities of the rules that were used in the resolution.
In this test we evaluated the accuracy using simple, easily created and universal rules.
4.2 Resolution
Accuracy for Conditions of Resolution To examine the resolution accuracy under different conditions, we examined the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper with the tbllowing 4 kinds of conditions: • using conditions of semantic constraints on cases only • using conditions of semantic constraints on cases and modal expression • using conditions of semantic constraints on cases, modal expression and verbal semantic attributes • using conditions of semantic constraints on cases, modal expression, verbal semantic attributes and conjunctions Table 3 shows the results of the resolution depending on the types of the rules.
As shown in tAt the moment, it is difficult to use sentences which were not successfully syntactically and semantically a.nalyzed for the evaluation of our method.
So, to evaluate the technical limitation of proposed method, we evaluated the resolution accuracy in the sentences which were examined to make the 46 rules (window test).
We will conduct blind tests after we have finished debugging the whole system.
this table, all 175 zero pronouns can be resolved using the rules that were proposed in section 3.
The. introduction of verbal semantic attributes has achieved the same accuracy of resolution as the in-troduction of modM expressions (41 entries, 24%).
From this result, we can say that the verbal semantic attributes are comparatively as effective as modal expressions.
The results also show that, without using the constraints of conjunctions, the accuracy achieved is as high as 85%.
4.3 Resolution
Accuracy against Rule Complexity To examine how the resolution accuracy varied according to the complexity of' rules, we tested the accuracy of the method proposed in this paper at different levels of complexity.
The complexities C were evaluated using the following formula, and depended on the number of constraints used.
C = # of modal const.* 1 + # of VSA coast.* 1 + # of conjunctions coast.* 2 In this formula, 1 in the modal and VSA and 2 in the conjunction indicate the weights.
Because conjunction constraints affect both sides of the unit sentence, we gave the conjunctions constraints a weight of 2.
According to this formula, the complexity of a rule that has a constraint fbr conjunctions and for VSA in the main clause and for modM and VSA in the sub clause, becoines 5(-l(modal)*l + I(VSA)*2 + 2(conjunction)*l).
Table 4 shows the accuracy of the resolution depending on the complexities of the rules.
46 kinds of rules were used in the deictic resolution of 175 zero pronouns as shown in |;able 4.
The accuracy of resolution using rules with complexities of 3 or less, is 90%, and the accuracy of resolution using rules with complexities of 4 or less, is 95%.
This result shows that the use of the constraints based on modM expressions, VSA and conjunctions can achieve high accuracy using relatively simple rules.
5 Conclusion
This paper proposes a powerful method for the resolution of Japanese zero pronouns with deictic reference.
It was found possible to resolve all of the sentences in the window test where the referential elements were not in the sentence resolved.
This was achieved by the introduction of rules based on four kinds of constraints: semantic constraints on cases, modal expressions, verbal semantic attributes and conjunctions.
In the future, we will examine the universality of the rules that have been discussed in this paper by applying them to other texts and examine a method tbr automatically acquiring the rules needed to resolve zero pronouns with deictic references.
