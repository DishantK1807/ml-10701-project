We used the MUC coreference scoring metric (Vilain et al 1995) to evaluate3 our systems.
M95-1005
The best F score of the (Ng and Cardie 2002) system (also on newspaper data) is 62.1.
P02-1014
(Ge et al.1998) incorporate gender, number, and animaticity information into a statistical model for anaphora resolution by gathering coreference statistics on particular nominal-pronoun pairs.
W98-1119
Though gains have been made with such methods (Tetreault 2001; Mitkov 2000; Soon et al.2001; Ng and Cardie 2002), there are clearly cases where this sort of local information will not be sufficient to resolve coreference correctly.
J01-4003 J01-4004 P02-1014
On newswire data the (Ng 2005) system had an F score of 54.7 and the (Ng and Cardie 2002) system had an F score of 50.1.

(Soon et al.2001) use WordNet to test the semantic compatibility of individual noun phrase pairs.

The HMM tagger generally follows the Nymble model (Bikel et al.1997), but with a larger number of states (12 for Chinese, 30 for English) to handle name prefixes and suffixes, and, for Chinese, transliterated foreign names separately.
A97-1029
Recently Bean and Riloff (2004) have sought to acquire automatically some semantic patterns that can be used as contextual information to improve reference resolution, using techniques adapted from information extraction.
