In order to solve this problem, START deploys "S-rules" (Katz and Levin, 1988), which are reversible syntactic/semantic transformational rules that render explicit the relationship between alternate realizations of the same meaning.

A similar technique for handling both syntactic and semantic variations can be found in (Grishman, 1995; Jacquemin et al., 1997).

More recently, Pereira and Wright (1991) developed formal methods of approximating context-free grammars with finitestate grammars, s Thus, for practical purposes, computationally simple finite-state grammars can be utilized to adequately model natural language.

Currently, the Brill Tagger (Brill, 1992) (with minor postprocessing) is used for the part-of-speech (POS) tagging.

The NYU team switched over from a system that performed full parsing (PROTEUS) in MUC-5 (Grishman and Sterling, 1993) to a regular expression matching parser in MUC-6 (Grishman, 1995).

One approach is to first parse the document using a full-text parser, and then extract interesting relations from the resulting parse tree (Fagan, 1987; Grishman and Sterling, 1993; Loper, 2000).
