In particular, we show that by quarantining gazetteer features and training them in a separate model, then decoding using a logarithmic opinion pool (Smith et al., 2005), we may achieve much higher accuracy.

However, some research has questioned the usefulness of gazetteers (Krupka and Hausman, 1998).

The orthographic features are based on those found in (Curran and Clark, 2003).

Instead, we show that by training gazetteer features in a separate model to the other features, and decoding using a logarithmic opinion pool (LOP) (Smith et al., 2005), much greater accuracy can be obtained.

Other work has supported the use of gazetteers in general but has found that lists of only moderate size are suf cient to provide most of the bene t (Mikheev et al., 1999).

In recent years discriminative probabilistic models have been successfully applied to a number of information extraction tasks in natural language processing (NLP), such as named entity recognition (NER) (McCallum and Li, 2003), noun phrase chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and information extraction from research papers (Peng and McCallum, 2004).

For our experiments we use the limited memory variable metric (LMVM) (Sha and Pereira, 2003) routine, which has become the standard algorithm for CRF training with a likelihood-based objective function.

In work developed independently and in parallel to the work presented here, Sutton et al.(2006) identify general problems with gazetteer features and propose a solution similar to ours.

To do this we use a logarithmic opinion pool (LOP) (Smith et al., 2005).
