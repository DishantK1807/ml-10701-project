Proportional assignmen~ (Lewis 1992b) is used to assign the descriptors from statistical measurements of their appropriateness.

uk Abstract The use of NLP techniques for document classification has not produced significant improvements in performance within the standard term weighting statistical assignment paradigm (Fagan 1987; Lewis, 1992bc; Buckley, 1993).

Lewis 1992bc; Jacobs & Rau 1990) have suggested that a more linguistically sophisticated representation of a document might be more effective for the purposes of statistical keyword assignment.

identifying noun groups and phrases (Lewis 1992c, Church 1988)), and subject-predicate identification (e.g.

Hindle 1990).

The recall scores for the rule-based tagging strategy show that the improved performance of the sequence based representations can be explained by 3All recall and precision scores are microaveraged (Lewis 1992c); they are the expected probability of assigning or recalling correctly per tagging decision.

This is achieved in a manner similar to Church's (1988) PARTS algorithm used by Lewis (1992bc), in the sense that its main properties are robustness and corpus sensitivity.

There are so many variations on the theme of term weighting models that it is impossible to try them all in one experiment, so this paper uses a variation of a model used by Lewis (1992e) in which he re-.ports the results of some experiments using phrases In a term weighting model (which has a probabilistic interpretation).

Nevertheless, the problem of estimating the huge number of parameters needed for such a model is statistically problematic, and as Buckley (1993) points out, the choice of weights has a large influence on the effectiveness of any model for classification or for retrieval.

Van Risjbergen, 1979) which make various assumptions about the independence between descriptors and diagnostic units (Fuhr & Buckley, 1993).
