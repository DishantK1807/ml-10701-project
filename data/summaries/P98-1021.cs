No grammar is used to determine the correct syntactic annotation; there is a small set of guidelines, that has the degree of detail necessary to avoid an "anything goes" attitude in the annotator, but leaves room for the annotator's perception of the structure of the utterance (see Bonnema et al.1997). The semantic annotations are based on the update language defined for the OVIS dialogue manager by Veldhuijzen van Zanten (1996).

The most probable parse can be estimated by iterative Monte Carlo sampling (Bod 1995), but efficient algorithms exist only for sub-optimal solutions such as the most likely derivation of a sentence (Bod 1995, Sima'an 1995) or the "labelled recall parse" of a sentence (Goodman 1996).

We will also extend the annotations with feature structures and/or functional structures associated with the surface structures so as to deal with more complex linguistic phenomena (see Bod & Kaplan 1998).

Bod 1992, 1995; Bod & Kaplan 1998; Scha 1992; Sima'an 1995, 1997; Rajman 1995) is a probabilistic parsing model which does not single out a narrowly predefined set of structures as the statistically significant ones.

The most likely derivation is computed by a bottom-up best-first CKY parser adapted to DOP (Sima'an 1995, 1997).

Next, parsing proceeds with the subtrees that are triggered by the dialogue context C (provided that all subtrees are converted into equivalent rewrite rules -see Bod 1992, Sima'an 1995).

However, the computation of the most probable parse of a sentence is NP-hard (Sima'an 1996).

For example, Goodman (1998) compares the results of his DOP parser to a replication of Pereira & Schabes (1992) on the same training and test data.
