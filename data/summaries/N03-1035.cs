• Simplex or complex NPs (e.g., Church 1988; Hindle and Rooth 1991; Wacholder 1998) identify simplex or base NPs – NPs which do not have any component NPs -at least in part because this bypasses the need to solve the quite difficult attachment problem, i.e., to determine which simpler NPs should be combined to output a more complex NP.

To evaluate the performance of a parser, NP chunks can usefully be evaluated by a gold standard; many systems (e.g., Ramshaw and Marcus 1995 and Cardie and Pierce 1988) use the Penn Treebank for this type of evaluation.

Anderson. HUM HS TT Total Total number of terms 673 7980 1788 9992 Percentage of total number of terms 6.73% 79.86% 17.89% * Table 2: Number of terms in index by method of identification Wacholder et al.(2000) showed that when experimental subjects were asked to assess the usefulness of terms for an information access task without actually using the terms for information access showed that the terms identified by the technical term algorithm, which are considerably fewer than the terms identified by head sorting, were overall of higher quality than the terms identified by the head sorting method.

two techniques for automatic identification were the technical terms algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995) and the head sorting method (Dagan and Church (1994); Wacholder (1998).

Three sets of terms were used in the experiment: one set (HS) was identified using the head-sorting method of Wacholder (1998); the second set (TT) was identified by an implementation of the technical term algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995); a third set (HUM) was created by a human indexer.

NP chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 1995; Evans and Zhai 1996; Frantzi and Ananiadou 1996) and technical terms (Dagan and Church 1994; Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 1996; Jacquemin 2001; Bourigault et al.2002) fall into this difficult-toassess category.

NP chunks and technical terms have been proposed for use in this task (Boguraev and Kennedy 1997; Wacholder 1998).

Toward a Task-based Gold Standard for Evaluation of NP Chunks and Technical Terms Nina Wacholder Rutgers University nina@scils.rutgers.edu Peng Song Rutgers University psong@paul.rutgers.edu Abstract We propose a gold standard for evaluating two types of information extraction output -noun phrase (NP) chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 1995) and technical terms (Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 2000; Jacquemin 2002).
