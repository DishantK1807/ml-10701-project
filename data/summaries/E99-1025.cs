5An alternate approach to TAG parsing that effectively shares the computation associated with each lexicalized elementary tree (supertag) is described in Evans and Weir (1998).

Training data for this pass is obtained using a head percolation table (Magerman (1995)) on bracketed Penn Treebank sentences.

Grishman (1995) and Hobbs et al.(1995) use phrasal information in information extraction.

There have been two main robust parsing paradigms: Finite State Grammar-based approaches (such as Abney (1990), Grishman (1995), and Hobbs et al.(1997)) and Statistical Parsing (such as Charniak (1996), Magerman (1995), and Collins (1996)).

Alshawi (1996) uses dependency information in a machine translation system.
P96-1023
It is related to work by Brown et al.(1992) where mutual information is used to cluster words into classes for language modeling.

Joshi and Srinivas (1994) define supertagging as the process of assigning the best supertag to each word.

We consider three voting strategies suggested by van Halteren et al.(1998): equal vote, where each classifier's vote is weighted equally, overall accuracy, where the weight depends on the overall accuracy of a classifier, and pair'wise voting.
