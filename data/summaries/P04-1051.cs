2.3 Probability-Based Cost Functions A fundamentally different approach to measure discourse coherence was proposed by Lapata (2003).

Second, we use twelve discourses from the BLLIP corpus taken from (Lapata, 2003), together with M.LAPATA.

Several papers in the recent literature (Mellish et al., 1998; Barzilay et al., 2002; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002; Lapata, 2003; Karamanis et al., 2004) have focused on defining local coherence, which evaluates the quality of sentence-to-sentence transitions.

However, our algorithm can still be useful as a subroutine in a more complex system that deals with global coherence (Marcu, 1997; Mellish et al., 1998).
W98-1411
Kibble and Power (2000) define three further classes of transitions: COHERENCE and SALIENCE, which are both defined in Table 1 as well, and NOCB, the class of transitions for which Cb(ui) is undefined.
W00-1411
Measures of local coherence specify which ordering of the sentences makes for the most coherent discourse, and can be based e.g. on Centering Theory (Walker et al., 1998; Brennan et al., 1987; Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002) or on statistical models (Lapata, 2003).

Finally, a transition is considered to satisfy the CHEAPNESS constraint (Strube and Hahn, 1999) if Cb(ui) = Cp(uiâˆ’1).
J99-3001
The measure M.KP (Kibble and Power, 2000) sums the value of nocb and the values of three functions which evaluate to 0 if the transition is cheap, salient, or coherent, and 1 otherwise.
W00-1411
For example, the measure from (Mellish et al., 1998) looks at the entire discourse up to the current transition for some of their cost factors.
W98-1411
Mellish et al.(1998) and Karamanis and Manurung (2002) present algorithms based on genetic programming, and Lapata (2003) uses a graph-based heuristic algorithm, but none of them can give any guarantees about the quality of the computed ordering.

Table 2 summarises some cost functions from the literature, in the reconstruction of Karamanis et al.(2004). Each line shows the name of the coherence measure, the arity d from Definition 1, and the initial and transition cost functions.
P04-1050
We define a branch-and-cut algorithm based on linear programming, and evaluate it on discourse ordering problems based on the GNOME corpus (Karamanis, 2003) and the BLLIP corpus (Lapata, 2003).
P03-1069
The first is a family of algorithms for discourse ordering based on genetic programming (Mellish et al., 1998; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002).
W98-1411
Finally, the measure M.BFP (Brennan et al., 1987) uses a lexicographic ordering on 4-tuples which indicate whether the transition is a CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, or ROUGHSHIFT.

Details on the comparison of different centering-based coherence measures are discussed by Karamanis et al.(2004). 6 Comparison to Other Approaches There are two approaches in the literature that are similar enough to ours that a closer comparison is in order.
P04-1050
However, a Majority Ordering algorithm is not guaranteed to compute good solutions to the discourse ordering problem, as Lapata (2003) assumes.
P03-1069
Table 1 shows the most common classification into the four types CONTINUE, RETAIN, SMOOTH-SHIFT, and ROUGH-SHIFT, which are predicted to be less and less coherent in this order (Brennan et al., 1987).
