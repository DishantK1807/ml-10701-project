2. Syntax Driven Continuous Speech Recognition The general trend in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition research is that of building integrated systems (Huang, 1990; Murveit, 1990; Paul, 1990; Austin, 1990) in which all the relevant knowledge sources, namely acoustic, phonetic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic, are integrated into a unique representation.

The constraints imposed by the WP grammar may be easily imposed in the decoding phase in a rather inexpensive procedural way, keeping the size of the FSN very small (10 nodes and 1016 arcs in our implementation (Lee, 1990/1) and allowing the recognizer to operate in a reasonable time (an average of 1 minute of CPU time per sentence) (Pieraccini, 1990).

When testing on the DARPA resource management task using the word-pair grammar, we found (Lee, 1990/2) that most of the word errors involve short function words (60% of the errors, e.g. a, the, in) and confusions among morphological variants of the same lexeme (20% of the errors, e.g. six vs.

Details about the speech recognition system we refer to in the paper can be found in Lee (1990/1).

While a modular system, like for instance HWIM (Woods, 1976) or HEARSAY-II (Reddy, 1977) may be the only solution for extremely large tasks when the size of the vocabulary is on the order of 10,000 words or more (Levinson, 1988), it generally achieves lower performance than an integrated system in a restricted domain task (Levinson, 1989).

Admittedly, performance does degrade somewhat, but it is still satisfactory (Lee, 1990/2) (e.g.
