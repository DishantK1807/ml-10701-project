1Introduction Various factors contribute to the difficulties of CJK information retrieval.
To achieve truly "intelligent" retrieval many challenges must be overcome.
Some of the major issues include: 1.
The lack of a standard orthography.
To process the extremely large number of orthographic variants (especially in Japanese) and character forms requires support for advanced IR technologies such as crossorthographic searching (Halpern 2000).
2. The accurate conversion between Simplified Chinese (SC) and Traditional Chinese (TC), a deceptively simple but in fact extremely difficult computational task (Halpern and Kerman 1999).
3. The morphological complexity of Japanese and Korean poses a formidable challenge to the development of an accurate morphological analyzer.
This performs such operations as canonicalization, stemming (removing inflectional endings) and conflation (reducing morphological variants to a single form) on the morphemic level.
4. The difficulty of performing accurate word segmentation, especially in Chinese and Japanese which are written without interword spacing.
This involves identifying word boundaries by breaking a text stream into meaningful semantic units for dictionary lookup and indexing purposes.
Good progress in this area is reported in Emerson (2000) and Yu et al.(2000). 5.
Miscellaneous retrieval technologies such as lexeme-based retrieval (e.g.
'take off' + 'jacket' from 'took off his jacket'), identifying syntactic phrases (such asZ�b�fromZ ��`h), synonym expansion, and crosslanguage information retrieval (CLIR) (Goto et al.2001). 6.
Miscellaneous technical requirements such as transcoding between multiple character sets and encodings, support for Unicode, and input method editors (IME).
Most of these issues have been satisfactorily resolved, as reported in Lunde (1999).
7. Proper nouns pose special difficulties for IR tools, as they are extremely numerous, difficult to detect without a lexicon, and have an unstable orthography.
8. Automatic recognition of terms and their variants, a complex topic beyond the scope of this paper.
It is described in detail for European languages in Jacquemin (2001), and we are currently investigating it for Chinese and Japanese.
Each of the above is a major issue that deserves a paper in its own right.
Here, the focus is on orthographic disambiguation, which refers to the detection, normalization and conversion of CJK orthographic variants.Thispaper summarizes the typology of CJK orthographic variation, briefly analyzes the linguistic issues, and discusses why lexical databases should play a central role in the disambiguation process.
2Orthographic Variation in Chinese 2.1 One Language, Two Scripts As a result of the postwar language reforms in the PRC, thousands of character forms underwent drastic simplifications (Zongbiao 1986).
Chinese written in these simplified forms is called Simplified Chinese (SC).
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and most overseas Chinese continue to use the old, complex forms, referred toasTraditional Chinese (TC).
The complexity of the Chinesewritingsystem is well known.
Some factors contributing to this are the large number of characters in common use, their complex forms, the major differences between TC and SC along various dimensions, the presence of numerous orthographic variants in TC, and others.
The numerous variants and the difficulty of converting between SC and TC are of special importance to Chinese IR applications.
2.2 Chinese-to-Chinese Conversion The process of automatically converting SC to/from TC, referred to as C2C conversion,isfull of complexities and pitfalls.
A detailed description of the linguistic issues can be found in Halpern and Kerman (1999), while technical issues related to encoding and character sets are described in Lunde (1999).
The conversion can be implemented on three levels in increasing order of sophistication, briefly described below.
2.2.1 Code
Conversion The easiest, but most unreliable, way to perform C2C conversion is on a codepoint-to-codepoint basis by looking the source up in a mapping table, such as the one shown below.
This isreferred toascode conversion or transcoding.
Because of the numerous one-to-many ambiguities (which occur in both the SC-to-TC and the TC-to-SC directions), the rate of conversion failure is unacceptably high.
Table 1.

That is, they are meaningful linguistic units, especially multi-character lexemes.
While code conversion is ambiguous, orthographic conversion gives better results because the orthographic mapping tables enable conversion on the word level.

Because of segmentation ambiguities, such conversion must be done with the aid of a morphological analyzer that can break the text stream into meaningful units (Emerson 2000).
2.2.3 Lexemic
Conversion Amore sophisticated, and far more challenging, approach to C2C conversion is called lexemic conversion, which maps SC and TC lexemes that are semantically, not orthographically, equivalent.
For example, SC G1667G26f5 (xìnxī )'information' is converted to the semantically equivalent TC G534dG5090 (zī xùn).
This is similar to the difference between lorry in British English and truck in American English.
There are numerous lexemic differences between SC and TC, especially in technical terms and proper nouns, as demonstrated by Tsou (2000).
For example, there are more than 10 variants for 'Osama bin Laden'.
To complicate matters, the correct TC is sometimes locale-dependent.
Lexemic conversion is the most difficult aspect of C2C conversion and can only be done with the help of mapping tables.
Table 3 illustrates various patterns of cross-locale lexemic variation.

There are numerous TC variant forms, and much confusion prevails.
To process TC (and to some extent SC) it is necessary to disambiguate these variants using mapping tables (Halpern 2001).
2.3.1 TC
Variants in Taiwan and Hong Kong Traditional Chinese dictionaries often disagree on the choice of the standard TC form.
TC variants can be classified into various types, as illustrated in Table 4.

2.3.2 Mainland
vs.
Taiwanese Variants To a limited extent, the TC forms are used in the PRC for some classical literature, newspapers for overseas Chinese, etc., based on a standard that maps the SC forms (GB 2312-80) to their corresponding TC forms (GB/T 12345-90).
However, these mappings do not necessarily agree with those widely used inTaiwan.We will refer to the former as "Simplified Traditional Chinese" (STC), and to the latter as "Traditional Traditional Chinese" (TTC).

Because of the large number of orthographic variants and easily confused homophones, the Japanese writing system is significantly more complex than any other major language, including Chinese.
A major factor is the complex interaction of the four scripts used to write Japanese, resulting in countless words that can be written in a variety of often unpredictable ways (Halpern 1990, 2000).
Table 6 shows the orthographic variants of �{ Mtoriatsukai 'handling', illustrating a variety of variation patterns.
Table 6.

The "standard" orthography would be�w[���2 (Kin no tamago wo umu niwatori).
In reality, tamago 'egg' has four variants ([,��,h�],���), niwatori 'chicken' three (2,t�q�,����) and umu 'to lay' two (��, \�), which expands to 24 permutations like�w[� \�����,� w�����2etc.
As can be easily verified by searching the web, these variants frequently occur in webpages.
Clearly, the user has no hope of finding them unless the application supports orthographic disambiguation.
3.2 Okurigana
Variants One of the most common types of orthographic variation in Japanese occurs in kana endings, called ��>�okurigana, that are attached to a kanji base or stem.
Although it is possible to generate some okurigana variants algorithmically, such as nouns (� Z`)derivedfromverbs(� Z b), on the whole hard-coded tables are required.
Because usage is often unpredictable and the variants are numerous, okurigana must play a major role in Japanese orthographic disambiguation.

Orthographic variation across scripts, which should play a major role in Japanese IR, is extremely common and mostly unpredictable, so that the same word can be written in hiragana, katakana or kanji, or even in a mixture of two scripts.
Table 8 shows the major cross-script variation patterns in Japanese.

A major annoyance in Japanese IR is that katakana orthography is often irregular; it is quite common for the same word to be written in multiple, unpredictable ways which cannot be generated algorithmically.
Hiragana is used mostly to write grammatical elements and some native Japanese words.
Although hiragana orthography is generally regular, a small number of irregularities persist.
Some of the major types of kana variation are shown in Table 9.

3.5 Miscellaneous
Variants There are various other types of orthographic variants in Japanese, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
Only a couple of the important ones are mentioned below.
A detailed treatment can be found in Halpern (2000).
3.5.1 Kanji
Variants Though the Japanese writing system underwent major reforms in the postwar period and the character forms have by now been standardized, there is still a significant number of variants in common use, such as abbreviated forms in contemporary Japanese (= for@and�for�)andtraditional forms in proper nouns and classical works (such as bfor aand�forC).
3.5.2 Kun
Homophones An important factor that contributes to the complexity of the Japanese writing system is the existence of a large number of homophones (words pronounced the same but written differently) and their variable orthography (Halpern 2000).
Not only can each kanji have many kun readings, but many kun words can be written in a bewildering variety of ways.
The majority of kun homophones are often close or even identical in meaning and thus easily confused, i.e., noboru means 'go up' when written ��but 'climb' when written J�,while yawarakai ’soft’ is written J�TMor ��TM with identical meanings.
4Orthographic Variation in Korean 4.1 Irregular Orthography The Korean orthography is not as regular as most people tend to believe.
Though hangul is often described as "logical," the fact is that in modern Korean there is a significant amount of orthographic variation.
This, combined with the morphological complexity of the language, poses achallenge to developers of IR tools.
The major types of orthographic variation in Korean are described below.
4.2 Hangul
Variants The most important type of orthographic variation in Korean is the use of variant hangul spellings in the writing of loanwords.
Another significant kind of variation is in the writing of non-Korean personal names, as shown in Table 10.
Table 10.
Hangul Variants cake Gb8bbGb12fGba27(keikeu) Gb8bbGb147(keik) yellow GafcbGa217Gb06b(yelrou) GafcbGa217(yelro) Mao Zedong Ga383GafdfGb407Ga06c (maojjeottung ) Ga463Gba98G9d94 (motaekdong) Clinton Gba2fGa36bGbaef (keulrinteon ) Gba2fGa36bGbb5f (keulrinton) 4.3 Cross-Script Orthographic Variants Afactor that contributes to the complexity of the Korean writing system istheuse of multiple scripts.
Korean is written in a mixture of three scripts: an alphabetic syllabary called hangul, Chinese characters called hanja (their use is declining) and the Latin alphabet called romaja.
Orthographic variation across scripts is not uncommon.
The major patterns of cross-script variation are shown Table 11.

South Korea Another factor contributing to the irregularity of hangul orthography is the differences in spelling between South Korea (S.K).
and North Korea (N.K.).
The major differences are in the writing of loanwords, astrong preference for native Korean words, and in the writing of non-Korean proper nouns.
The major types are shown below.

Old Orthography The hangul script went through several reforms during its history, the latest one taking place as recently as 1988.
Though the new orthography is now well established, the old orthography is still important because the affected words are of high frequency and their number is not insignificant.
For example, the modern Gb137G972b 'worker' (ilgun)waswritten Gb137G9977 (ilkkun)before 1988, whileGa816G95c3'color' (bitgal)was writtenGa816G980f(bitkkal).
4.4.3 Hanja
Variants Although language reforms in Korea did not include the simplification of the character forms, the Japanese occupation of Korea resulted in many simplified Japanese character forms coming into use, such as the Japanese formCto replace�(bal).
4.4.4 Miscellaneous
Variants There are various other types of orthographic variation, which are beyond the scope of this paper.
This includes the use of abbreviations and acronyms and variation in interword spacing in multiword compounds.
For example, 'Caribbean Sea' (karibeuhae)maybewritten solid (Gb82fGa367Ga7c7Gbf2f)or open (Gb82fGa367Ga7c7G3Gbf2f).
5TheRoleofLexical Databases Because of the irregular orthography of CJK languages, lexeme-based procedures such as orthographic disambiguation cannot be based on probabilistic methods (e.g.
bigramming) alone.
Many attempts have been made along these lines, as for example Brill (2001) and Goto et al.(2001), with some claiming performance equivalent to lexicon-based methods, while Kwok (1997) reports good results with only a small lexicon and simple segmentor.
Thesemethods may be satisfactory for pure IR (relevant document retrieval), but for orthographic disambiguation and C2C conversion, Emerson (2000) and others have shown that a robust morphological analyzer capable of processing lexemes, rather than bigrams or n-grams, must be supported by a large-scale computational lexicon (even 100,000 entries is much too small).
The CJK Dictionary Institute (CJKI), which specializes in CJK computational lexicography, is engaged in an ongoing research and development effort to compile comprehensive CJK lexical databases (currently about 5.5 million entries), with special emphasis on orthographic disambiguation and proper nouns.
Listed below are the principal components useful for intelligent IR tools and orthographic disambiguation.
1. Chinese to Chinese conversion.
In 1996, CJKI launched a project to investigate C2C conversion issues in-depth, and to build comprehensive mapping tables (now at 1.3 million SC and 1.2 million TC items) whose goal is to achieve near 100% conversion accuracy.
These include: a.
SC-to/from-TC code-level mapping tables b.
SC-to/from-TC orthographic and lexemic mapping tables for general vocabulary c.
SC-to/from-TC orthographic mapping tables for proper nouns d.
Comprehensive SC-to/from-TC orthographic/lexemic mapping tables for technical terminology, especially IT terms 2.
TC orthographc normalization tables a.
TC normalization mapping tables b.
STC-to/from-TTC character mapping tables 3.
Japanese orthographic variant databases a.
A comprehensive database of Japanese orthographic variants b.
A database of semantically classified homophone groups c.
Semantically classified synonym groups for synonym expansion (Japanese thesaurus) d.
An English-Japanese lexicon for CLIR e.
Rules for identifying unlisted variants Conclusions CJK IR tools have become increasingly important to information retrieval in particular and to information technology in general.
As we have seen, because of the irregular orthography of the CJK writing systems, intelligent information retrieval requires not only sophisticated tools such as morphological analyzers, but also lexical databases fine-tuned to the needs of orthographic disambiguation.
Few if any CJK IR tools perform orthographic disambiguation.
For truly "intelligent" IR to become a reality, not only must lexicon-based disambiguation be supported, but such emerging technologies as CLIR, synonym expansion and cross-homophone searching should also be implemented.
We are currently engaged in further developing the lexical resources required for building intelligent CJK information retrieval tools and for supporting accurate segmentation technology.
