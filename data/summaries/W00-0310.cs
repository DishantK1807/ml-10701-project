Further details of MIMIC are presented in the relevant sections below, but see (Chu-Carroll, 2000) for a complete overview.

For example, the Direction Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a discourse structure for generated directions.

As in (Nakatani, 1998), we take the prosodic output of an advanced research system that implements the Pierrehumbert theory of intonation, namely the Bell Labs TTS system, as our baseline experimental system to be enhanced by CTS algorithms.

System: Mixed-Initiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) The dialogue system whose baseline speech generation capabilities we enhance is the MixedInitiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) (Chu-Carroll, 2000).

Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) conjectured that the absence or presence of accentuation conveys discourse focus status, while the tonal properties of the accent itself (i.e.

Foundations In this work, we implement and extend the compositional theory of intonational meaning proposed by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1986; 1990), who sought to identify correspondences between the Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies 600 Mountain Avenue Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA {chn I j encc}Â©research, bell-labs, com Grosz and Sidner (1986) computational model of discourse interpretation and Pierrehumbert's prosodic grammar for American English (1980).

1 Specifically, MIMIC uses an n-dimensional call router front-end (Chu-Carroll, 2000), which is a generalization of the vector-based call-routing paradigm of semantic interpretation (Chu-CarroU and Carpenter, 1999); that is, instead of detecting one concept per utterance, MIMIC's semantic interpretation engine detects multiple (n) concepts or classes conveyed by a single utterance, by using n call touters in parallel.
