SIGHAN, the Special Interest Group for Chinese Language Processing of the Association for Computational Linguistics, conducted two prior word segmentation bakeoffs, in 2003 and 2005(Emerson, 2005), which established benchmarks for word segmentation against which other systems are judged.

For the WS task, we computed the following measures using the score(Sproat and Emerson, 2003) program developed for the previous bakeoffs: recall (R), precision (P), equally weighted F-measure (F = 2PR(P+R)), the rate of out-ofvocabulary words (OOV rate) in the test corpus, the recall on OOV (Roov), and recall on invocabulary words (Riv).
