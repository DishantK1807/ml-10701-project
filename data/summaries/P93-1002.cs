Aligned bilingual corpora have proved useful in many tasks, including machine translation (Brown e/ al., 1990; Sadler, 1989), sense disambiguation (Brown el al., 1991a; Dagan el at., 1991; Gale el al., 1992), and bilingual lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990; Warwick and Russell, 1990).

We view a bilingual corpus as a sequence of sentence beads (Brown et al., 1991b), where a sentence bead corresponds to an irreducible group of sentences that align with each other.

11 However, modeling word order under translation is notoriously difficult (Brown et al., 1993), and it is unclear how much improvement in accuracy a good model of word order would provide.

Existing efficient algorithms ignore word identities and only consider sentence length (Brown el al., 1991b; Gale and Church, 1991).

The natural next step in sentence alignment is to account for word ordering in the translation model, e.g., the models described in (Brown et al., 1993) could be used.
