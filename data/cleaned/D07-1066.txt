This claim is based on the assumption that PARSEVAL metrics fully reect parse quality across treebank encoding schemes.
In this paper we present new experiments to test this claim.
We use the PARSEVAL metric, the Leaf-Ancestor metric as well as a dependency-based evaluation, and present novel approaches measuring the effect of controlled error insertion on treebank trees and parser output.
We also provide extensive past-parsing crosstreebank conversion.
The results of the experiments show that, contrary to K?ubler et al.(2006), the question whether or not German is harder to parse than English remains undecided.
1 Introduction
A long-standing and unresolved issue in the parsing literature is whether parsing less-con gurational languages is harder than e.g. parsing English.
German is a case in point.
Results from Dubey and Keller (2003) suggest that state-of-the-art parsing scores for German are generally lower than those obtained for English, while recent results from K?ubler et al.(2006) raise the possibility that this might be an artefact of particular encoding schemes and data structures of treebanks, which serve as training resources for probabilistic parsers.
K?ubler (2005) and Maier (2006) show that treebank annotation schemes have considerable in uence on parsing results.
A comparison of unlexicalised PCFG parsing (K?ubler, 2005) trained and evaluated on the German NEGRA (Skut et al., 1997) and the T?uBaD/Z (Telljohann et al., 2004) treebanks using LoPar (Schmid, 2000) shows a difference in parsing results of about 16%, using the PARSEVAL metric (Black et al., 1991).
K?ubler et al.(2006) conclude that, contrary to what had been assumed, German is not actually harder to parse than English, but that the NEGRA annotation scheme does not support optimal PCFG parsing performance.
Despite being the standard metric for measuring PCFG parser performance, PARSEVAL has been criticised for not representing ’real’ parser quality (Carroll et al., 1998; Brisco et al., 2002; Sampson and Babarbczy, 2003).
PARSEVAL checks label and wordspan identity in parser output compared to the original treebank trees.
It neither weights results, differentiating between linguistically more or less severe errors, nor does it give credit to constituents where the syntactic categories have been recognised correctly but the phrase boundary is slightly wrong.
With this in mind, we question the assumption that the PARSEVAL results for NEGRA and T?uBaD/Z re ect a real difference in quality between the parser output for parsers trained on the two different treebanks.
As a consequence we also question the conclusion that PARSEVAL results for German in the same range as the parsing results for the English 630 Penn-II Treebank prove that German is not harder to parse than the more con gurational English.
To investigate this issue we present experiments on the German TIGER treebank (Dipper et al., 2001) and the T?uBa-D/Z treebank.
TIGER is based on and extends the NEGRA data and annotation scheme.
Our error insertion and past-parsing treebank-encoding experiments experiments show that the differences in parsing results for the two treebanks are not caused by a higher number of errors in the output of the parser trained on the TIGER treebank, but are due to the bias of the PARSEVAL metric towards annotation schemes (such as that of T?uBa-D/Z) with a higher ratio of non-terminal/terminal nodes.
The experiments also show that compared to PARSEVAL the Leaf-Ancestor metric is somewhat less susceptible to non-terminal/terminal ratios and that contrary to the PARSEVAL results, dependency-based evaluations score TIGER trained parsers higher than T?uBa-D/Z trained parsers.
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the main features of the two treebanks.
Section 3 describes our rst experiment, where we systematically insert controlled errors into the original treebank trees and compare the in uence of these modi cations on the evaluation results in the PARSEVAL metric and the Leaf-Ancestor metric against the original, unmodi ed trees for both treebanks.
In Section 4 we present the second experiment, where we extract an unlexicalised PCFG from each of the treebanks.
Then we convert the output of the PCFG parser trained on the T?uBa-D/Z into a TIGER-style format and evaluate the converted trees.
In Section 5 we present a dependency-based evaluation and compare the results to the results of the two other measures.
The last section concludes.
2 The
TIGER Treebank and the T?uBa-D/Z The two German treebanks used in our experiments are the TIGER Treebank (Release 2) and the T?ubaD/Z (Release 2).
The T?uBa-D/Z consists of approximately 22 000 sentences, while the TIGER Treebank is much larger with more than 50 000 sentences.
Both treebanks contain German newspaper text and are annotated with phrase structure and dependency (functional) information.
Both treebanks use the Stuttgart T?ubingen POS Tag Set (Schiller et al., 95).
TIGER uses 49 different grammatical function labels, while the T?uBa-D/Z utilises only 36 function labels.
For the encoding of phrasal node categories the T?uBa-D/Z uses 30 different categories, the TIGER Treebank uses a set of 27 category labels.
Other major differences between the two treebanks are: in the Tiger Treebank long distance dependencies are expressed through crossing branches (Figure 1), while in the T?uBa-D/Z the same phenomenon is expressed with the help of grammatical function labels (Figure 2), where the node label V-MOD encodes the information that the PP modi es the verb.
The annotation in the Tiger Treebank is rather at and allows no unary branching, whereas the nodes in the T?uBa-D/Z do contain unary branches and a more hierarchical structure, resulting in a much deeper tree structure than the trees in the Tiger Treebank.
This results in an average higher number of nodes per sentence for the T?uBa-D/Z.
Table 1 shows the differences in the ratio of nodes for the Tiger treebank and the T?uBa-D/Z.
phrasal phrasal words nodes/sent nodes/word /sent TIGER 8.29 0.47 17.60 T?uBa-D/Z 20.69 1.20 17.27 Table 1: Average number of phrasal nodes/words in TIGER and T?uBa-D/Z Figures 1 and 2 also illustrate the different annotation of PPs in both annotation schemes.
In the Tiger treebank the internal structure of the PP is at and the adjective and noun inside the PP are directly attached to the PP, while the T?uBa-D/Z is more hierarchical and inserts an additional NP node.
Another major difference is the annotation of topological elds in the style of Drach (1937) and H?ohle (1986) in the T?uBa-D/Z.
The model captures German word order, which accepts three possible sentence con gurations (verb rst, verb second and verb last), by providing elds like the initial eld (VF), the middle eld (MF) and the nal eld (NF).
The elds are positioned relative to the verb, which can ll in the left (LK) or the right sentence bracket (VC).
The ordering of topological elds is determined by syntactic constraints.

Things seem better in Wales.
Figure 2: T?uBa-D/Z treebank tree 2.1 Differences between TIGER and NEGRA To date, most PCFG parsing for German has been done using the NEGRA corpus as a training resource.
The at annotation scheme of the TIGER treebank is based on the NEGRA annotation scheme, but it also employs some important extensions, which include the annotation of verb-subcategorisation, appositions and parentheses, coordinations and the encoding of proper nouns (Brants et al., 2002).
3 Treebank
Preprocessing: Converting TIGER Graphs into CFG Trees The sentences in the TIGER treebank are represented as graphs with LDDs expressed through crossing branches.
Before being able to insert errors or extract a PCFG we had to resolve these crossing branches in the TIGER treebank.
This was done by attaching the non-head child nodes higher up in the tree, following K?ubler (2006).
For the graph in Figure 1 this would mean that the modifying PP Auch mit staatlichen Auftr?agen (also for public contracts) was attached directly to the S node, while the head of the adjectival phrase (AP) remained in it’s original position.
As a side effect this leads to the creation of some unary nodes in the TIGER trees.
We also inserted a virtual root node and removed all functional labels from the TIGER and T?uBa-D/Z trees.
4 Experiment
I Experiment I is designed to assess the impact of identical errors on the two treebank encoding schemes and the PARSEVAL1 and Leaf-Ancestor evaluation metrics.
4.1 Experimental
Setup The TIGER treebank and the T?uBa-D/Z both contain newspaper text, but from different German newspapers.
To support a meaningful comparison we have to compare similar sentences from both treebanks.
In order to control for similarity we selected all sentences of length 10 ≤ n ≤ 40 from both treebanks.
For all sentences with equal length we computed the average number of prepositions, determiners, nouns (and related POS such as proper names and personal pronouns), interrogative pronouns, nite verbs, in nite verbs, past participles and imperative verb forms.
For each sentence length we selected all sentences from both treebanks which showed an average for each of the POS listed above which did not deviate more than 0.8 from the average for all sentences for this particular sentence length.
From this set we randomly selected 1024 sentences for each of the treebanks.
This results in two test sets, comparable in word length, syntactic structure and complexity.
Table 2 shows the ratio of phrasal versus terminal nodes in the test sets.
We then inserted different types of controlled errors automatically into the original treebank trees in our test sets and evaluated the modi ed trees against 1In all our experiments we use the evalb metric (Sekine and Collins, 1997), the most commonly used implementation of the PARSEVAL metric.

4.2 Error
Insertion The errors fall into three types: attachment, span and labeling (Table 3).
We carried out the same number of error insertions in both test sets.
Error description ATTACH I Attach PPs inside an NP one level higher up in the tree ATTACH II Change verb attachment to noun attachment for PPs on sentence level, inside a VP or in the MF (middle eld) LABEL I Change labels of PPs to NP LABEL II Change labels of VPs to PP SPAN I Include adverb to the left of a PP into the PP SPAN II Include NN to the left of a PP into the PP SPAN III Combination of SPANI and SPANII Table 3: Description of inserted error types 4.3 Results for Error Insertion for the Original Treebank Trees Table 4 shows the impact of the error insertion into the original treebank trees on PARSEVAL results, evaluated against the gold trees.
PARSEVAL results in all experiments report labelled precision and recall.
The rst error (PP attachment I, 85 insertions in each test set) leads to a decrease in f-score of 1.16 for the TIGER test set, while for the T?uBa-D/Z test set the same error only caused a decrease of 0.43.
The effect remains the same for all error types and is most pronounced for the category label errors, because the frequency of the labels resulted in a large number of substitutions.
The last row lists the total weighted average for all error types, weighted with respect to their frequency of occurrence in the test sets.
Table 4 clearly shows that the PARSEVAL measure punishes the TIGER treebank annotation TIGER T?uBa # errors PP attachment I 98.84 99.57 85 PP attachment II 98.75 99.55 89 Label I 80.02 92.73 1427 Label II 93.00 97.45 500 SPAN I 99.01 99.64 71 SPAN II 97.47 99.08 181 SPAN III 96.51 98.73 252 total weighted ave.
87.09 95.30 Table 4: f-score for PARSEVAL results for error insertion in the original treebank trees scheme to a greater extent, while the same number and type of errors in the T?uBa-D/Z annotation scheme does not have an equally strong effect on PARSEVAL results for similar sentences.
4.4 Discussion: PARSEVAL and LA Experiment I shows that the gap between the PARSEVAL results for the two annotation schemes does not re ect a difference in quality between the trees.
Both test sets contain the same number of sentences with the same sentence length and are equivalent in complexity and structure.
They contain the same number and type of errors.
This suggests that the difference between the results for the TIGER and the T?uBa-D/Z test set are due to the higher ratio of non-terminal/terminal nodes in the T?uBa-D/Z trees (Table 1).
In order to obtain an alternative view on the quality of our annotation schemes we used the leaf-ancestor (LA) metric (Sampson and Babarbczy, 2003), a parser evaluation metric which measures the similarity of the path from each terminal node in the parse tree to the root node.
The path consists of the sequence of node labels between the terminal node and the root node, and the similarity of two paths is calculated by using the Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein, 1966).
Table 5 shows the results for the leaf-ancestor evaluation metric for our error insertion test sets.
Here the weighted average results for the two test sets are much closer to each other (94.98 vs.
97.18 as against 87.09 vs.
95.30). Only the label errors, due to the large numbers, show a signi cant difference between the two annotation schemes.
Tables 4 and 5 show that compared to PARSEVAL the LA metric is somewhat less sensitive to the nonterminal/terminal ratio.
Figure 3 illustrates the different behaviour of the 633 TIGER T?uBa # errors PP attachment I 99.62 99.70 85 PP attachment II 99.66 99.78 89 Label I 92.45 95.24 1427 Label II 96.05 99.28 500 SPAN I 99.82 99.84 71 SPAN II 99.51 99.77 181 SPAN III 99.34 99.62 252 total weighted ave.

However, the differences in the LA results are only indirectly caused by the different error types.
They actually re ect the number of terminal nodes affected by the error insertion.
For Label I and II the LA results vary considerably, because the substitution of the PP for an NP (Label I) in Figure 3 affects two terminal nodes only (PP von [of] Venedig [Venice]), while the change of the VP into a PP (Label II) alters the paths of four terminal nodes (VP erstmals [for the rst time] streunende [straying] Katzen [cats] gez?ahlt [counted]) and therefore has a much greater impact on the overall result for the sentence.

5 Experiment
II K?ubler (2005) and Maier (2006) assess the impact of the different treebank annotation schemes on PCFG parsing by conducting a number of modi cations converting the T?uBa-D/Z into a format more similar to the NEGRA (and hence TIGER) treebank.
After each modi cation they extract a PCFG from the modi ed treebank and measure the effect of the changes on parsing results.
They show that with each modi cation transforming the T?uBa-D/Z into a more NEGRA-like format the parsing results also become more similar to the results of the NEGRA treebank, i.e. the results get worse.
Maier takes this as evidence that the T?uBa-D/Z is more adequate for PCFG parsing.
This assumption is based on the belief that PARSEVAL results fully re ect parse quality across different treebank encoding schemes.
This is not always true, as shown in Experiment I.
In our second experiment we crucially change the order of events in the K?ubler (2005), Maier (2006) and K?ubler et al.(2006) experiments: We rst extract an unlexicalised PCFG from each of the original treebanks.
We then transform the output of the parser trained on the T?uBa-D/Z into a format more similar to the TIGER Treebank.
In contrast to K?ubler (2005) and Maier (2006), who converted the 634 treebank before extracting the grammars in order to measure the impact of single features like topological elds or unary nodes on PCFG parsing, we convert the trees in the parser output of a parser trained on the original unconverted treebank resources.
This allows us to preserve the basic syntactic structure and also the errors present in the output trees resulting from a potential bias in the original treebank training resources.
The results for the original parser output evaluated against the unmodi ed gold trees should not be crucially different from the results for the modi ed parser output evaluated against the modi ed gold trees.
5.1 Experimental
Setup For Experiment II we trained BitPar (Schmid, 2004), a parser for highly ambiguous PCFG grammars, on the two treebanks.
The T?uBa-D/Z training data consists of the 21067 treebank trees not included in the T?uBa-D/Z test set.
Because of the different size of the two treebanks we selected 21067 sentences from the TIGER treebank, starting from sentence 10000 (and excluding the sentences in the TIGER test set).
Before extracting the grammars we resolved the crossing branches in the TIGER treebank as described in Section 3.
After this preprocessing step we extracted an unlexicalised PCFG from each of our training sets.
Our TIGER grammar has a total of 21163 rule types, while the grammar extracted from the T?uBa-D/Z treebank consists of 5021 rules only.
We parsed the TIGER and T?uBa-D/Z test set with the extracted grammars, using the gold POS tags for parser input.
We then automatically converted the T?uBa-D/Z output to a TIGER-like format and compare the evaluation results for the unmodi ed trees against the gold trees with the results for the converted parser output against the converted gold trees.
5.2 Converting
the T ?uBa-D/Z Trees The automatic conversion of the T?uBa-D/Z-style trees includes the removal of topological elds and unary nodes as well as the deletion of NPs inside of PPs, because the NP child nodes are directly attached to the PP in the TIGER annotation scheme.
As a last step in the conversion process we adapted the T?uBa-D/Z node labels to the TIGER categories.
5.2.1 The
Conversion Process: An Example We demonstrate the conversion process using an example sentence from the T?uBa-D/Z test set (Figure 4).
The converted tree is given in Figure 5: topological elds, here VF (initial eld), MF (middle eld) and LK (left sentence bracket), as well as unary nodes have been removed.
The category labels have been changed to TIGER-style annotation.

Figure 4: Original T?uBa-D/Z-style gold tree Figure 5: Converted TIGER-style gold tree Figure 6 shows the unmodi ed parser output from the T?uBa-D/Z trained grammar for the same string.
The parser incorrectly included all adverbs inside an NP governed by the PP, while in the gold tree (Figure 4) both adverbs are attached to the PP.
The modi ed parser output is shown in Figure 7.
5.3 Results
for Converted Parser Output We applied the conversion method described above to the original trees and the parser output for the sentences in the TIGER and the T?uBa-D/Z test sets.
Table 7 shows PARSEVAL and LA results for the modi ed trees, evaluating the converted parser output 635 Figure 6: Parser output (T?uBa-D/Z grammar) Figure 7: Converted parser output (T?uBa-D/Z) for each treebank against the converted gold trees of the same treebank.
Due to the resolved crossing branches in the TIGER treebank we also have some unary nodes in the TIGER test set.
Their removal surprisingly improves both PARSEVAL and LA results.
For the T?uBa-D/Z all conversions lead to a decrease in precision and recall for the PARSEVAL metric.
Converting the trees parsed by the T?uBaD/Z grammar to a TIGER-like format produces an fscore which is slightly lower than that for the TIGER trees.
The same is true for the LA metric, but not to the same extent as for PARSEVAL.
The LA metric also gives slightly better results for the original TIGER trees compared to the result for the unmodied T?uBa-D/Z trees.
The constant decrease in PARSEVAL results for the modi ed trees is consistent with the results in K?ubler et al.(2005), but our conclusions are slightly different.
Our experiment shows that the T?uBaD/Z annotation scheme does not generally produce higher quality parser output, but that the PARSEVAL results are highly sensitive to the ratio of nonterminal/terminal nodes.
However, the parser output for the grammar trained on the T?uBa-D/Z yields a EVALB LA prec.

6 Experiment
III In Experiment I and II we showed that the treebased PARSEVAL metric is not a reliable measure for comparing the impact of different treebank annotation schemes on the quality of parser output and that the issue, whether German is harder to parse than English, remains undecided.
In Experiment III we report a dependency-based evaluation and compare the results to the results of the other metrics.
6.1 Dependency-Based (DB) Evaluation The dependency-based evaluation used in the experiments follows the method of Lin (1998) and K?ubler and Telljohann (2002), converting the original treebank trees and the parser output into dependency relations of the form WORD POS HEAD.
Functional labels have been omitted for parsing, therefore the dependencies do not comprise functional information.
Figure 8 shows the original TIGER Treebank representation for the CFG tree in Figure 3.
Square boxes denote grammatical functions.
Figure 9 shows the dependency relations for the same tree, indicated by labelled arrows.
Converted into a WORD POS HEAD triple format the dependency tree looks as follows (Table 8).
Following Lin (1998), our DB evaluation algorithm computes precision and recall: • Precision: the percentage of dependency relationships in the parser output that are also 636 Figure 8: TIGER treebank representation for Figure 3 SB NKPGNK NK OA MO OC the city counsil of Venice has for the straying cats counted first time Die Stadtverwaltung von Venedig hat erstmals streunende Katzen gezählt For the rst time the city counsil of Venice has counted straying cats.

Topological elds in the T?uBa-D/Z test set have been removed before extracting the dependency relationships.
We then removed all functional information from the trees and converted the stripped trees into dependencies, using heuristics to nd the head.
We evaluated the dependencies for the stripped gold trees against the dependencies for the original gold trees including functional labels and obtained an f-score of 99.64% for TIGER and 99.13% for the T?uBa-D/Z dependencies.
This shows that the conversion is reliable and not unduly biased to either the TIGER or T?uBa-D/Z annotation schemes.
6.2 Experimental
Setup For Experiment III we used the same PCFG grammars and test sets as in Experiment II.
Before extracting the dependency relationships we removed the topological elds in the T?uBa-D/Z parser output.
As shown in Section 6.1, this does not penalise the dependency-based evaluation results for the T?uBaD/Z.
In contrast to Experiment II we used raw text as parser input instead of the gold POS tags, allow637 ing a comparison with the gold tag results in Table 7.
6.3 Results
Table 9 shows the evaluation results for the three different evaluation metrics.
For the DB evaluation the parser trained on the TIGER training set achieves about 7% higher results for precision and recall than the parser trained on the T?uBa-D/Z.
This result is clearly in contrast to the PARSEVAL scores, which show higher results for precision and recall for the T?uBa-D/Z.
But contrary to the PARSEVAL results on gold POS tags as parser input (Table 7), the gap between the results for TIGER and T?uBaD/Z is not as wide as before.
PARSEVAL gives a labelled bracketing f-score of 81.12% (TIGER) and 85.47% (T?uBa-D/Z) on raw text as parser input, while the results on gold POS tags are more distinctive with an f-score of 83.59% for TIGER and 91.17% for T?uBa-D/Z.
The LA results again give better scores to the TIGER parser output, this time the difference is more pronounced than for Experiment II (Table 7).

7 Conclusions
In this paper we presented novel experiments assessing the validity of parsing results measured along different dimensions: the tree-based PARSEVAL metric, the string-based Leaf-Ancestor metric and a dependency-based evaluation.
By inserting controlled errors into gold treebank trees and measuring the effects on parser evaluation results we gave new evidence for the downsides of PARSEVAL which, despite severe criticism, is still the standard measure for parser evaluation.
We showed that PARSEVAL cannot be used to compare the output of PCFG parsers trained on different treebank annotation schemes, because the results correlate with the ratio of non-terminal/terminal nodes.
Comparing two different annotation schemes, PARSEVAL consistently favours the one with the higher node ratio.
We examined the in uence of treebank annotation schemes on unlexicalised PCFG parsing, and rejected the claim that the German T?uBa-D/Z treebank is more appropriate for PCFG parsing than the German TIGER treebank and showed that converting the T?uBa-D/Z trained parser output to a TIGER-like format leads to PARSEVAL results slightly worse than the ones for the TIGER treebank trained parser.
Additional evidence comes from a dependencybased evaluation, showing that, for the output of the parser trained on the TIGER treebank, the mapping from the CFG trees to dependency relations yields better results than for the grammar trained on the T?uBa-D/Z annotation scheme, even though PARSEVAL scores suggest that the TIGER-based parser output trees are substantial worse than T?uBa-D/Zbased parser output trees.
We have shown that different treebank annotation schemes have a strong impact on parsing results for similar input data with similar (simulated) parser errors.
Therefore the question whether a particular language is harder to parse than another language or not, can not be answered by comparing parsing results for parsers trained on treebanks with different annotation schemes.
Comparing PARSEVALbased parsing results for a parser trained on the T?uBa-D/Z or TIGER to results achieved by a parser trained on the English Penn-II treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) does not provide conclusive evidence about the parsability of a particular language, because the results show a bias introduced by the combined effect of annotation scheme and evaluation metric.
This means that the question whether German is harder to parse than English, is still undecided.
A possible way forward is perhaps a dependency-based evaluation of TIGER/T?uBa-D/Z with Penn-II trained grammars for ’similar’ test and training sets and cross-treebank and -language controlled error insertion experiments.
Even this is not entirely straightforward as it is not completely clear what constitutes ’similar’ test/training sets across languages.
We will attempt to pursue this in further research.
