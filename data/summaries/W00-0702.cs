Later work (Samuelsson, 1994; Sima'an, 1999) attempts to automatically determine appropriate tree-cutting criteria, the former using local measures, the latter using global ones.

This is in itself a specialization of the grammar which was used to parse the treebank, since some rules may not show up in any correct parse in the training set; experimental results for this first-order specialization are reported in (Cancedda and Samuelsson, 2000).

Subsequent work (Rayner and Carter, 1996; Samuelsson, 1994) views the problem as that of cutting up each tree in a treebank of correct parse trees into subtrees, after which the rule combinations corresponding to the subtrees determine the rules of the specialized grammar.
