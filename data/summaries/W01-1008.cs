(Radev, 2000) describes 24 cross-document relations that can hold between their segments, one of which is the subsumption (or entailment) relation.

The work described in this paper is closely related to the area of multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev, 2000), where related documents are analyzed to use frequently occurring segments for identifying relevant information that has to be included in the summary.

In the context of document fusion, we focus on the entailment relation and how it can be formally defined; unfortunately, (Radev, 2000) provides no formal definition for any of the relations.

This has shown to be successful in inference-based approaches to question-answering, see (Harabagiu et al., 2000), and document fusion might also benefit from representations that are a bit deeper than the one discussed in this paper.

Obviously, it would be better to use an automatic anaphora resolution component to cope with this problem, see, e.g., (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996; Kameyama, 1997), where anaphoric expressions are replaced by their antecedents, but at the moment, the integration of such a component remains future work.

A more sophisticated approach to text segmentation is described in (Hearst, 1997).
J97-1003
Obviously, intrinsic evaluation is more reliable, but it remains an extremely laborious process, where inter-judge disagreement is still an issue, see (Radev et al., 2000).
