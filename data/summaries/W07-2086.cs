For this work, we used the Context Vector measure (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).
W06-2501
The relatedness between two word senses is computed using a measure of semantic relatedness defined in the WordNet::Similarity software package (Pedersen et al., 2004), which is a suite of Perl modules implementing a number WordNet-based measures of semantic relatedness.
N04-3012
The semantic relatedness of concepts was measured using the Context Vector measure, with configuration options as defined in previous research (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2006).
W06-2501
WordNet::SenseRelate::TargetWord1 (Patwardhan et al., 2005; Patwardhan et al., 2003) is an unsupervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system, which is based on the hypothesis that the intended sense of an ambiguous word is related to the words in its context.
P05-3019
The system uses WordNet-based 1http://senserelate.sourceforge.net measures of semantic relatedness2 (Pedersen et al., 2004) to measure the relatedness between the different senses of the target word and the words in its context.
