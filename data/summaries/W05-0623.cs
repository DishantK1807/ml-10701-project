Most of the features we use are described in more detail in (Toutanova et al., 2005).
P05-1073
The ones denoted with asterisks (*) were not present in (Toutanova et al., 2005).
P05-1073
We find the exact top N consistent1 most likely local model labelings using a simple dynamic program described in (Toutanova et al., 2005).
P05-1073
Recent releases of the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) have included an option to provide the top k parses of a given sentence according to the probability model of the parser.
A00-2018
The improvement achieved by the joint model relative to the local model is about 2 points absolute in F-Measure, similar to the improvement when gold-standard syntactic parses are used (Toutanova et al., 2005).
P05-1073
Previous research (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004; Carreras and M`arquez, 2004) has identified many useful features for local identification and classification.
J02-3001 N04-1030 W04-2412
The system, introduced in (Toutanova et al., 2005), implements a joint model that captures dependencies among arguments of a predicate using log-linear models in a discriminative re-ranking framework.
