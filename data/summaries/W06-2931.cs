The algorithm in (Nivre et al., 2004) is a blend of bottom-up and top-down processing.
W04-2407
Good results have been achieved in some dependency parsers (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004).
W04-2407
Classifiers are good at encoding more features in the deterministic parsing (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre et al., 2004).
W04-2407
(Jin et al., 2005) used a two-phase shift-reduce to decrease such errors, and improved the accuracy of long distance dependencies.
I05-2044
Many previous works focus on unlabeled parsing, in which exhaustive methods are often used (Eisner, 1996).
