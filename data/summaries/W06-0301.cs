Sentiment detection is the task of determining positive or negative sentiment of words (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005), phrases and sentences (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wilson et al., 2005), or documents (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002).

For example, the word “central” that Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) marked as a positive adjective is not classified as positive by our system.

We used FrameNet II (Baker et al., 2003) which contains 450 semantic frames and more than 3000 frame elements (FE).

As a learning algorithm for our classification model, we used Maximum Entropy (Berger et al., 1996).
