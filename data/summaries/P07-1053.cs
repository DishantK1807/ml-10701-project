Similarly, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) decompose an opinion across several dimensions and capture the sentiment across each dimension.

Other work in this area includes (Lee, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) which uses text mining in the context product reviews, but none uses the economic context to evaluate the opinions.

Finally, other approaches rely on reviews with numeric ratings from websites (Pang and Lee, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Cui et al., 2006) and train (semi-)supervised learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative, or in more fine-grained scales (Pang and Lee, 2005; Wilson et al., 2006).

For instance, (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Nigam and Hurst, 2004) use annotated data to create a supervised learning technique to identify the semantic orientation of adjectives.

To evaluate the polarity and strength of opinions, most of the existing approaches rely either on training from human-annotated data (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), or use linguistic resources (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) like WordNet, or rely on co-occurrence statistics (Turney, 2002) between words that are unambiguously positive (e.g., “excellent”) and unambiguously negative (e.g., “horrible”).

We follow the approach by Turney (2002), who note that the semantic orientation of an adjective depends on the noun that it modifies and suggest using adjective-noun or adverb-verb pairs to extract semantic orientation.
