We performed an experiment analyzing a specific verb group produced by one semantic clustering program (McMahon and Smith, 1996).

Recent work in this vein includes identification of lexical constraints from textual tutorial dialogue (Moser and Moore, 1995), constraints on illocutionary act type from spoken task-oriented dialogue (Allen et al., 1995), prosodic constraints from spoken information-seeking monologues (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996), and constraints on referring expressions from spoken narrative monologue (Passonneau, 1996).

domain-dependent semantic classifications to identify predominant senses The process outlined above has two significant advantages: first, it can be automatically applied, assuming a robust method for parsing the relevant verb phrase context (the experiments presented in (Pustejovsky et al., 1993) depend on the same type of information).

Biber (1993) presents evidence that a corpus restricted to one or two language registers would exclude "much of the English language" by narrowing the lexicon, verb tense and aspect, and syntactic complexity.

For example, when our word grouping system (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993) classified about 280 frequent adjectives in stock market reports, it formed, among others, the cluster {common, preferred}.

In the future, it will also allow us to use corpora tagged with COMLEX subcategorization frames, e.g., (Macleod et al., 1996).

Two types of investigations that would undoubtedly be enhanced are explorations of the interrelation of lexical cohesion and global discourse structure (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Hearst, 1994), and identification of lexicaliza-: tion patterns for domain-specific concepts (Robin, 1994).
J91-1002 P94-1002
Previous work has shown that within a given discourse (Gale et al., 1992), or with respect to a given collocation (Yarowsky, 1993), a word appears in only one sense.

To identify such interacting syntactic and semantic constraints at the lexical level, we utilize three knowledge bases for verbs: * The COMLEX database (Grishman et al., 1994; Macleod and Grishman, 1995), which includes detailed subcategorization information for each verb, and some adjectives and nouns.

Related work suggests that constraints of different types are interdependent (Biber, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, forthcoming), hence should be investigated together.
J93-2001
Semantic classification programs (Brown et al., 1992; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Pereira et al., 1993) use statistical information based on cooccurrence with appropriate marker words to partition a set of words into semantic groups or classes.
