The most important proposals for anaphora resolution--such as those of Baldwin (1997), Lappin and Leass (1994), Hobbs (1978), or Kennedy and Boguraev (1996)--are based on a separation between constraints and preferences.

The evaluation of this algorithm was performed in Strube (1998) and obtained a precision of 85.4% for English, improving upon the results of the centering algorithm by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), which achieved only 72.9% precision when it was applied to the same corpus.

According to Carletta et al.(1997), a k measurement such as 0.68 < k < 0.8 allows us to draw encouraging conclusions, and a measurement k > 0.8 means there is total reliability between the results of the two annotators.

However, both Strube (1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) point out that it is difficult to define grammatical roles in free-word-order languages like German or Spanish.

The ranking criteria used by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) order items in the Cf list using grammatical roles.
J95-2003
Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) use this sort of resolution model, which involves the use of semantic and pragmatic constraints, such as constraints based on modal expressions, or constraints based on verbal semantic attributes or conjunctions.
C96-2137
Consequently, current anaphora resolution methods rely mainly on constraint and preference heuristics, which employ morpho-syntactic information or shallow semantic analysis (see, for example, Mitkov \[1998\]).

This filter consists of six conditions for NP-pronoun noncoreference within any sentence (Lappin and Leass 1994, page 537).
J94-4002
Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) state that Cf may be ordered using different factors, but they only use information about grammatical roles.

However, this set is not needed to resolve pronominal anaphora (Strube and Hahn 1999).
J99-3001
More recently, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) proposed an algorithm for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one developed by Lappin and Leass (1994).

Other approaches, however, give equal 559 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 importance to each kind of knowledge and generally distinguish between constraints and preferences (Baldwin 1997; Lappin and Leass 1994; Carbonell and Brown 1988).

Lappin and Leass (1994) describe an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that achieves a high rate of correct analyses (85%).

and Leass's Algorithm An algorithm for identifying the noun phrase antecedents of third person pronouns and lexical anaphors (reflexive and reciprocal) is presented in Lappin and Leass (1994); this algorithm has exhibited a high rate (85%) of correct analyses in English texts.

Conditions on NP-Pronoun Noncoreference These conditions are based on c-command and minimal-governing-category constraints as formulated by Reinhart (1983) and on the noncoreference conditions of Lappin and Leass (1994).

Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) state that if any element of Cf(Ui) is realized by a pronoun in Ui+l, then Cb(Ui+l) must also be realized by a pronoun.

We choose to ignore discourse structure because obtaining this kind of knowledge requires not only an understanding of semantics but also knowledge about world affairs and the ability to almost perfectly parse any text under discussion (Azzam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998).

The annotation phase was accomplished in the following manner: (1) two annotators were selected, (2) an agreement was reached between the annotators with regard to the annotation scheme, (3) each annotator annotated the corpus, and, finally, (4) a reliability test (Carletta et al.1997) was done on the annotation in order to guarantee the results.

Centering theory, as employed by Strube and Hahn (1999) or Okumura and Tamura (1996), uses this type of approach.
C96-2147 J99-3001
Approach The centering model proposed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1995) provides a framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse.
J95-2003 P83-1007
Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) applied the centering model to pronoun resolution.
P87-1022
Still other approaches are based on statistical information, including the work of Dagan and Itai (1990, 1991) and Ge, Hale, and Charniak (1998), all of whom present a probabilistic model for pronoun resolution.
C90-3063 W98-1119
Incorporating these adaptations, Strube (1998) then proposes the following algorithm: 1.

Still other approaches to anaphora resolution are based either on machine learning techniques (Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994; Yamamoto and Sumita 1998; Paul, Yamamato, and Sumita 1999) or on the principles of uncertainty reasoning (Mitkov 1995).
