Use of a morphological analyzer (developed by Tzoukermann and Liberman (1990)) allowed distributional measures to be computed for associations of lemmas (morphological roots), improving generalization to different inflected forms not observed in the training data.
C90-3049
The reason is grounded in the strong tendency of a word to exhibit only one sense or accent pattern per collocation (discussed in Step 6 and (Yarowsky, 1993)).
H93-1052
Such words were given a part-of-speech tag consisting of the union of the possibilities (eg ADJECTIVE-NOUN), as in Kupiec (1989).
H89-1054
The given algorithm may be used to solve each of these problems, and has been applied without modification to the case of homograph disambiguation in speech synthesis (Sproat, Hirschberg and Yarowsky, 1992).
C92-2070
Decision trees (Brown, 1991) have been usefully applied to word-sense ambiguities, and HMM part-of-speech taggers (Jelinek 1985, Church 1988, Merialdo 1990) have addressed the syntactic ambiguities presented here.
A88-1019 P91-1034
This is not surprising, given the observation in (Leacock et al., 1993) that widely divergent sense-disambiguation algorithms tend to perform roughly the same given the same evidence.
H93-1051
This may be explained by the empirical observation that in most cases, and with high probability, words exhibit only one sense in a given collocation (Yarowsky, 1993).
H93-1052
This was expanded upon by (Gale et al., 1992), and in a class-based variant by (Yarowsky, 1992).
C92-2070
An algorithm for combining syntactic and semantic evidence in lexical ambiguity resolution has been realized in (Chang et al., 1992).
