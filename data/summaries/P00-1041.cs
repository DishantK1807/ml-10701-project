More recently, summarizers using sophisticated postextraction strategies, such as revision (McKeown et al., 1999; Jing and McKeown, 1999; Mani et al., 1999), and sophisticated grammar-based generation (Radev and McKeown, 1998) have also been presented.

It is likely that more sophisticated language models, such as structure models (Chelba, 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), or longer ngram models would lead to the system generating headlines that were more similar in phrasing to real headlines because longer range dependencies shelf Carnegie Mellon University summarizer, which was the top ranked extraction based summarizer for news stories at the 1998 DARPA-TIPSTER evaluation workshop (Tip, 1998).

The work reported in this paper is most closely related to work on statistical machine translation, particularly the ‘IBM-style’ work on CANDIDE (Brown et al., 1993).

Work Most previous work on summarization focused on extractive methods, investigating issues such as cue phrases (Luhn, 1958), positional indicators (Edmundson, 1964), lexical occurrence statistics (Mathis et al., 1973), probabilistic measures for token salience (Salton et al., 1997), and the use of implicit discourse structure (Marcu, 1997).
