Not surprisingly, the authors of those two papers took issue with a number of
myclaims, and have requested the opportunityto respond. The two responses, taken

was intended to be taken seriouslyand to stand on its own merits. If so, then I felt—
and still feel—that the paper had serious problems. A problematic paper that cannot
stand on its own does not become unproblematic even if subsequent research were to
show the conclusions to be correct. To give a stark example, if someone should even-

of the background short was what prompted me not to expand on myclaim that our
argumentshad“beenacceptedbymanyarchaeologistsandlinguists.”RaonotesthatI
do not actuallycite “who these ’manyarchaeologists and linguists’ are.” Perhaps they
do not exist? But theydo: Andrew Lawler, a science reporter who in 2004 interviewed
a large number of people on both sides of the debate notes that “manyothers are
convincedthatFarmer,Witzel,andSproathavefoundawaytomoveawayfromsterile
discussions of decipherment, and theyﬁnd few ﬂaws in their arguments” (Lawler
2004, page 2029), and quotes the Sanskrit scholar George Thompson and University
ofPennsylvaniaProfessorEmeritusofIndianstudiesFrankSouthworth.
2.1MisunderstandingsaboutNonlinguisticSymbols
A large part of the discussion in Rao’s response centers, as it should, on the question
of the “Type 1” (random) and “Type 2” (rigidly ordered) models, which I argued did
notaccuratelycharacterizeanynonlinguisticsymbolsystems.Atthecoreofthisdebate
is the Old European sign system of the Vinˇca, which is claimed to be a good instance
of Type 1, and the Mesopotamian deity symbols found on kudurru stones, which are
claimedtobegoodinstancesofType2.
To support the claims for Vinˇca, Rao provides a quote from Winn (1990), which
notes that the signs do not seem to have anyordering, and are “characteristically
disarranged.” But if one sees the broader context of this quote, it becomes clear that
Winn is talking here about a subset of the corpus, which is found on small vessels
and spindle whorls. He contrasts the inscriptions discussed in the quote given by
Rao with “the more arranged format of tablets and seals” (page 270), and then again
(page 276) where he notes that “[d]ifferences in complexityof sign usage is denoted
bysign ordering, which occurs on tablets and other objects, such as the plaque from
Gradeˇsnica.”Onpage263hereferstothe“discoveryoftabletswithscript-likecontent
atTartariain1961,”aclearindicatorthattheVinˇcatabletswouldseemtoinvolvesome
form of sign ordering. It is clear then, that Winn is not saying that the system is in
generalunordered,onlythatasubsetofthecorpusis.Winnalsosuggeststhatthesmall
vessels in particular probablyhad a ritualistic function (page 276). Furthermore, the
text that was ellipted in Rao’s quote suggests that order was probablyunimportant on
the spindle whorls “since concepts or mnemonic aids could be inferred or interpreted
byan individual cognizant of the culture-speciﬁc content of the signs” (page 269),
suggestingasituationwheretheVinˇca“reader”couldinterpretthejumbledsignssince
theyknewthestructureofthesystem.ItisunfortunatethatmostofWinn’sinteresting
work has been published in obscure locations, and is therefore not something the
average reader would run across. Fortunatelythough, Winn maintains a Web page at
http://www.prehistory.it/ftp/winn.htm,whereonecanseewhatthesigntextslook
likeandwhereWinnalsonotes(page8)that“thedistinctionbetweensignsonpottery
and the more organized signs on tablets and other artifacts maysignifyfunctional
differencesordifferentlevelsofusageandformality.”
Winn’sdescriptiondoesnotsupporttheclaimthatVinˇcasigntextsweregenerally
withoutstructure.Butsuppose,counterfactually,itdid.WouldRaoetal.’s“Type1”be
a good model of the system? Their Type 1 data is modeled by a random process that
generatestexts“basedontheassumptionthateachsignhasanequalprobabilityoffol-
lowinganyother”(Raoetal.2009,Supplement,page2),orinotherwordsasystemthat
is random and equiprobable. But where does Winn saythat the system is equiprobable?

plausiblemodelofarandomancientsignsystemwouldbeonewherethesymbolshave
a non-equiprobable distribution: as I argued in myarticle “symbols represent things,
andthethingstheyrepresenttypicallydonotoccurwithequalprobability.”Further,we
knowthatmanythings,fromnonlinguisticsystemssuchas kudurrus(seethefollowing)
to populations of sets of species, have a Zipﬁan distribution, so a reasonable model
of such a system might well be one in which the unigram probability follows a Zipf-
Mandelbrot distribution. But to have presented Type 1 in this way would have been
problematic: As I discussed in mypiece, such random texts easily“fool” the bigram
conditionalentropymeasurethatRaoetal.proposedintheir Sciencepaper.Raoobjects
to the statement in mypiece that at least some of the discussion surrounding their
paper depends on the confusion between “random” and “random and equiprobable,”
deemingthatstatement“unwarrantedandnotworthyofcomment.”Yettheirmodelof
Vinˇcaasarandomequiprobablesystemdependspreciselyonthisconfusion.
Attheotherextremearethekudurrutexts,whichareclaimed tobegood examples
of Type 2, a rigidly ordered system. In support, Rao quotes Slanski (2003), who says
“to a certain extent, the divine symbols were deployed upon the Entitlement narˆus
(kudurrus) according to the deities’ relative positions in the pantheon. The symbols
forthehighergodsofthepantheon...aregenerallyfound upon or toward the top
and most prominent part of the monument.” Crucial phrases here are “to a certain
extent”and“thesymbolsforthehighergods...aregenerallyfound.” No doubt these
are partlytrue; indeed it is veryoften true that the “sun disk,” “crescent moon,” and
“star” symbols occur at the beginnings of texts—though ordering within those three
varies.Butthekudurrutextsarestillfarfromrigid,asweshowedinFarmer,Sproat,and
Witzel(2004)andasmyownsamplefromSeidlshows.Overandabovethis,thequoted
excerptswouldonlyseemtosupportahierarchy,notamodel“basedontheassumption
that each sign has a unique successor sign” or even one where based on “variations of
thisthemewhereeachsigncouldbefollowedby,forexample,2or3othersigns”(Rao
et al. 2009, Supplement, page 3). All the hierarchyimplies is that a symbol Y that is
lower on the hierarchyshould come after a symbol X that is higher on the hierarchy.
Butforanygiven Xtheremaybeseveralsymbolsloweronthehierarchy,whichmeans
thatX could be followed directlybyanyof these, assuming that no concepts from the
interveningelementsare“mentioned”inthe“text.”
It is puzzling to me that, given these considerations and myown description of
myclose examination of the kudurru corpus, Rao still suggests that “we expect the
entropyof the kudurru sequences to be lower than linguistic systems and perhaps
slightlyabovetheminimumentropy(MinEnt)rangeinFigure1(b).”Surelyonewould
like to examine the data and see whether such a statement is likelyto be supported.
In anycase there seems to be little point in arguing about this. I have the data for the
kudurrus that I transcribed from Seidl and I will be happyto make them available to
anyone who wants them. As the reader will have seen in Lee et al.’s reply, and as I
discuss in Section 3, Lee et al. took a different attitude to the deitysymbols than Rao
has. Rather than argue from “ﬁrst principles” about what the corpus might look like,
theyactuallywenttothetroubleofreplicatingmyexperimentanddevelopedtheirown
corpus from Seidl’s work (Rob Lee, personal communication): Theyconcluded that by
their measureskudurruswould also count as (logographic) writing (an issue I get back
tosubsequently)—suggestingamuchlessrigidorderingthanRaoetal.seemtobelieve.
Rao contrasts the hierarchythat is certainlypartlytrue of kudurru texts with the
situation in linguistic systems, which “have no such hierarchy imposed on characters
or words.” Interestingly, although this is generally true, there are pockets of such
hierarchies that do occur in language. A good example is from Egyptian (Allen 2000),
809
ComputationalLinguistics Volume36,Number4
where there is a hierarchythat determines the order in which terms denoting human
ordivineentitiesarewritten.Thustermsforgodswilloccurinwritingbeforetermsfor
humansorotherthings,evenifthedivinetermswouldbespokenaftertheotherterms.
This occurs a lot in royal names, so that for exampleTutankhamen, whose name means
‘livingimageofAmen’,iswrittenincartoucheswiththegodAmen’snameﬁrst.
In my piece, I made the point that relevant nonlinguistic symbol systems abound,
a point that Rao seems to be calling into question. As a minor point, theyobject to
myuse of BoyScout merit badges and highwaysigns as relevant to the discussion,
invitingthereadertoexaminetheseandsee“whethersuchacomparisonbearsmerit.”
UnfortunatelythisisduetoamisinterpretationofwhatImeantbythesecomparisons,
and it is perfectlypossible that I did not explain mypoint well enough. I was not
discussing the forms of the individual signs, but rather the fact that for merit badges

the individual signs are not linearlycomposed anymore than the Indus symbols are

A more serious objection surrounds myclaim that to have done the job properly,
Raoetal.(2009)wouldhavetohavecomparedawidersetoflinguisticandnonlinguistic
systems,butIalsosuggestedthiswoulddependuponhavingagoodsetofcorporafor
real nonlinguistic systems, something which I claimed nobody has done the legwork
of compiling. Rao claims that this ignores the work of Vidale (2007), who included a
description of ten ancient South Asian nonlinguistic systems in his rebuttal to Farmer,
Sproat,andWitzel(2004).Thisismisleadingatbest.Ifthereaderwillcaretorereadwhat

their distribution and use, and lists numbers of signs in each. But by“legwork,” I was
notreferringtodiscussionofsuchsystems,butratherthedevelopmentofcorporaofsuch
systems whereby one could actually perform serious statistical analyses and compare
among a range of linguistic and nonlinguistic systems. As far as I am aware, there
is no such set of corpora. As Rao highlights, Vidale notes the “systematic, large-scale
redundancy”ofsymboldistributionsofsomeofthesystemsheexamines.Perhaps,but
as we have seen in the discussion of Vinˇca symbols and kudurrus earlier, translating
suchbroadstatementsintoprecisestatisticalcharacterizationsofthekindnecessaryfor
Rao’smethodsistrickyatbest.
Rao also makes a point of noting Vidale’s observation that the number of distinct
signs in the systems he examines is 44, “a far cry from the 400 or so signs in the Indus
script.” To that statistic one could add kudurru symbols, which number about 60 in
Seidl’s (1989) catalog. In fact, Vidale challenges Farmer, Witzel and me to “identify
another South Asian system datable to the 3rd millennium B.C. of nonlinguistic signs
amountingto400basicsignsormore”(page344).Nonlinguisticsystemswithhundreds
of symbols certainlyexist: heraldry(where the sign set is open-ended; see anytext on

notmeetthetimeandspacerestrictionsrequiredbyVidale.Butthen,whatisthebasisof
those restrictions? A symbol system has as many symbols as it needs. Chinese writing
has thousands of characters because it has chosen to represent linguistic units at the

size of over 400 symbols would merely reﬂect that it represented a rich underlying
set of concepts. Proponents of the script thesis always like to discuss the advanced
stateofInduscivilization,arguingthatsuchanadvancedcivilizationcouldeasilyhave

IendthediscussionofType1andType2systemsbynotingthatRaocharacterizes
theobjectiontotheuseofartiﬁcialdatasetsas“aredherring”that“doesnotchangethe
result that the Indus script is entropicallysimilar to linguistic scripts.” But within the
ﬁrst two paragraphs of theSciencepaper, Rao et al. state: “We compared the statistical
structure of sequences of signs in the Indus script with those from a representative
groupoflinguisticandnonlinguisticsystems.Twomajortypesofnonlinguisticsystems
arethosethatdonotexhibitmuchsequentialstructure (type1systems)andthosethat
follow rigid sequential order (type 2 systems).” These (artiﬁcial) systems are clearly
central to their argument yet, as I have argued, theyare poor models of anyrelevant
nonlinguisticsystem.Objectionshardlyseemtoconstitutearedherring.
Rao takes strong issue with the fact that whereas I discuss Figure 1A from their
Sciencepaper,nowheredoIdiscusstheirFigure1B,nordoIdomorethanmentiontheir
later work. On the latter point, let me reiterate: Myarticle was about the paper that
appearedinScience,notanylaterwork.Iwasnot,forexample,makinganyclaimsabout

thisﬁgure,whichshowshighentropyforDNAandproteins,includesSanskritamong

natural language samples theyinclude. Myquestion about DNA and proteins would
be: Whyare these relevant? Although theyare possibly“the two ‘most ancient’ non-
linguisticsystems,”thetopicofdiscussionsurelyissymbolsystemsthatwereproducts

me is whyFortran was not included in Figure 1A: Whydid Rao and colleagues not

While we are on this topic though, the block entropyin their new Figure 1(b) still
leaves one wondering: Fortran is lower than their linguistic examples, but not much
lower. The same is true of the Figure 1B in theirSciencepaper. How would one expect
theplottolookiftheyhadincludedalargerrangeoflanguagesandtexttypes?Ireturn
tothispointsubsequently.
In Figure 1(b) in their response, Rao includes music (a Beethoven piece), which,
likeDNAandprotein,isveryclosetothemaximumentropycurve.Theylatercriticize

Finally,whileweareonthetopicoftypesofsymbolsystems,InotethatRaomakes
a point of enumerating the list of properties that theydeem relevant for considering
the linguistic status of the Indus symbols. This is of course related to the issue of how
to interpret the claims of their work, which we take up in Section 2.2. Rather than
enumerate the properties theydescribe, I will simplypresent the script-like properties
of another system, namely, the Mesopotamian deity symbols, a system we know was
notlinguistic.Ialsomadesomeofthesepoints,butmorebrieﬂy,inmy piece:(1)Deity

a fairlycompelling list of script-like properties: Contraryto what Rao suggests, it is

2.2MisunderstandingsaboutClaims
Rao, in the response to myarticle, as well as elsewhere, makes the point that nowhere
do theyclaim that the conditional entropymeasure(s) are sufﬁcient bythemselves
to demonstrate that the Indus symbols were linguistic. Indeed they do not. The last
sentenceoftheSciencearticlereads:“Giventhepriorevidenceforsyntacticstructurein
theIndusscript,ourresultsincreasetheprobabilitythatthescriptrepresentslanguage,
complementing other arguments that have been made explicitlyor implicitlyin favor
ofthelinguistichypothesis.”
It is worth stressing at the outset that in mypiece I do not claim that Rao and
colleagues make the claim that conditional entropysettles the matter—though it is
surelytruethatthiswasthewaymanypeopleinterpretedtheirresults.Thequestionis,
howisonesupposedtointerprettheirclaimthattheirresults“increasetheprobability
that the script represents language”? I can think of three possible interpretations. One
isasaloosegeneralstatementtotheeffectthatthereisalreadylotsofevidenceforthe
scriptthesis,andthisadditionalpieceofevidenceaddstothatbody.
The next two interpretations are more formal. A second interpretation is that they
are assuming some sort of “deductive” model wherebyfor a set of features F
i,oneis
computing the probabilityof the linguistic hypothesis ( H
L
), versus the nonlinguistic
812

intoaclassiﬁerthatcomputesP(H
L
|F
i
)versusP(H
NL
|F
i
)foreachfeature,andproduces
an overall prediction. It is worth noting that Lee et al.’s paper does indeed use the
statisticalmeasuresLeeandcolleaguesdevelopinthisdeductivesense.
The third interpretation is the “inductive” one that Rao presents in his response,
which he claims is the “correct” wayto interpret their work. In that interpretation, a
set of feature values are observed, and the task is to induce which of two underlying
models—H
L
orH
NL
—istheonelikelytohavegeneratedtheobservation.Thereaderwill
surelyrecognizethatthesecondandthirdinterpretationscorrespondprettydirectlyto
discriminativeversusgenerativemodels.Bothoftheseapproachesareusedinavariety
of classiﬁcation tasks, and both are perfectlylegitimate ways to view the problem.
The choice of the generative model as the correct interpretation of their work, and
its formalization as theyhave given it in their response to mypiece, is the ﬁrst time
this particular interpretation has been explicitlystated. At the veryleast, if theyhad
wanted people to understand this point, it would have been good to make it clear at
the outset bystating the model in the Science paper. One can hardlyfault critics for
misunderstandingwhichoftwoequallyviableinterpretationswastheoneintended.

we need to consider the probabilityof observing a feature, given one of the two hy-
potheses. For some features, such as the feature of linear arrangements of symbols, it
seems plausible that one has a higher expectation of seeing linearlyarranged symbols
on the hypothesis that something is a true script, compared with the hypothesis of a
nonlinguistic system. For bigram conditional entropy, again we really do not know.
Again, not enough examples of human-created nonlinguistic systems were presented
in theSciencepaper to be able to estimate the probabilities. And there is another issue:

2.3ComputationalLinguistics,Decipherment,andtheWiderWorld
Rao concludes byciting the impressive achievements of computational linguistics as a
ﬁeld,andsomeoftheimportantcontributionstodeciphermentthatworkintheﬁeldhas
afforded. Theyquestion myhypothesis that the editors of prominent science journals
maynot “even know that there are people who spend their lives doing statistical and
computationalanalysesoftext,”andclaimthat“[s]uchastatementfailstoacknowledge
both the impressive achievements of the ﬁeld of computational linguistics in recent
yearsandthewidecoverageoftheseaccomplishmentsinthepopularpress.”
Iamofcourseawareoftheimpressiveachievementsofmyﬁeld,andIevenalluded
to them in the conclusion of my piece. I was trying to hypothesize why, apparently,
computational linguists were not asked to review the Science piece byRao (or the Lee
et al. piece inProceedingsoftheRoyalSociety). It is entirelypossible myhypothesis here
iswrongandthattheeditorsof,say,Sciencearewellawareofcomputationallinguistics

I am also well aware of a whole range of work on applying computational tech-
niques to ancient scripts. Mypoint, clearly, was not to claim that such work in general

3.Leeetal.’sResponse
Lee et al.’s response (henceforth “Lee”) is much shorter than Rao et al.’s, and boils
down essentiallyto two points. The ﬁrst point is that one can use randomizations of
agivencorpus,comparethebigramconditionalentropiesofthoserandomizedcorpora
to the conditional entropies of the original, and see if the true conditional entropyis
uniformlysmallerthananyofthevaluescomputedfromrandomizedcorpora.For80%

814
Sproat ReplytoRaoetal.andLeeetal.
randomized entropywas more uniform. This method seems to make sense as a way
to spot memoryless non-equiprobable processes masquerading as structured systems,
suchastheexampleofsuccessivetossesofsevensix-sideddiceIdiscussedinmypiece.
But this was not part of the methodologypresented in the published paper byLee,
which as I showed is fooled bysuch processes. Furthermore, it would still fail to spot
nonlinguisticsystemsthathavestructure,suchasMesopotamiandeitysymbols.
This leads directlyinto the second point, because Lee acknowledges myresult
that texts from kudurrus look linguistic, noting that the values that I calculate “for the
kudurrusdata set places them in a similar level of communication” to Pictish symbols.
For them this is an acceptable result, and comes down to a “difference in viewpoint
over terminologyas to the deﬁnition of what constitutes ’writing’,” noting that I use
a “stricter deﬁnition of writing than some other researchers, such as Powell (2009).”
TheyquotePowellasstatingthat“writingisasystemofmarkingswithaconventional
reference that communicates information.” There is no doubt that some students of
writing systems have indeed adopted a broader deﬁnition of writing than that which
I assume. But these are byno means majorityviews. The problem with the broader
view expressed bythe quoted sentence from Powell is that it would seem to classify
as writing any meaningful conventionalized symbol system. Mathematical equations,
dance notation, music, and (pace Lee et al.) European heraldrywould all count as
writing from that standpoint. After all, all of these are systems of markings, with

writing work as the “technologyof civilization” is preciselythat it allows us to record
language (see Sproat 2010b). In anyevent if that is the breadth that Lee wants, then
certainlyPictishsymbols(andMesopotamiandeitysymbols)arewriting,becausethey
are conventional systems of marks that (presumably) communicated information. But

4.Conclusion
It has been a useful exercise to read Rao et al.’s and Lee et al.’s responses, because this
has forced me to think even deeper about the issues than I had alreadydone. I believe
mybasiccriticismsarestillvalid.

we wrote a letter to Science outlining our objections to the original paper, the journal
