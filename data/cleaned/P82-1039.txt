SOLUTIONS TO ISSUES DEPEND ON THE KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION Frederick B.
Tho~psoH ~li£orni~ Institute o£ Technology Pasadena, C~,li?orni~ In orpQnizing This p~nel, our Ch(tirmon, Bob Moore, expressed the view thor too often discussion o?
Hoturra'l l,',nguage occess To dol'o buses has focused on whot p~rticulc~r systems c~*n or cQnnot do, ro'ther than on underlying issues.
He Then sd~irr4bly proceeded to orgonize the prJnel nr.
ound issues r-qther th~n systems.
In responding, I qttempted to ?rr.iMe my ~'emr~rk~, on e,ach o? his five issues in r~ gener~l woy that would not reflec~ ~y,wn pr4rochiul experience qnd interest, At one point I thought th~.~t I h~d s,cceeded quite well.
Howe,.,er~ offer t~king a cleorer eyed view~ it wqs qpparent thor my remarks reflec~c;d ~ssumptions obout knowledge representotion theft were by no Meons univers~ol.
This suggests,a sixth issue which I would like ~o r~omin~t,.,: Are there r'eolly useful generolizNtions ~bou~ comput~Jtionr~l linguistic issues th<~t c~r,e independer~t of r~ssumptions concerning knowledq,.~ r'epre.sentcition?
I will come back 'to this sixth issue q?ter discussing t'i~e ?ire cho-~.,n by our Choir~or,.

Issue #5: Hu~ti-Fil#._~uer'ie_.s This issue has been stated by Bob in terms of G tr'~dixional Multiple file de=to b,~se s'tructure, This issue h~s its coun'ter'p~rt in seM~intic neT data.
base structures discussed in pr4per,~ on k~ow\].edge representation, Since we use such q semantic net s~ructure For, our data, le't me rephrase the issue in those ~erMs.
In Dab's st~tteMerlt of the issue~ he uses tl'~ example of the SHIP file and the PORT .File; wl}ere the SHIP f.ile h,~s fields -For ho~,~¢ port, departure port and destination port.
P,~,r'allelLnq his exa~p\](:, let us consider ~h~ phrase: "London ship", Suppose ~hr.~t (q) there w~s ship n,~r~ed London, nnd (b) London was a ho~e por~, port of depqrtur~ and des'tir~o'~ion~ not necessarily o~" the same ship, Then "London ship" is four ways,~Mbifuous~ ~e~ning: (i) the ship London~ (2) London (ho~e port) ships, (3) l.ondon (depr~r~-ur~z par-X) ~hips ~nd (4) London (destinq~ion port) ~hips, In this for~ul~tion of the probleM~ ~II is easy~ insofar ~ the phr~s~; "Londo, ship" is not '.iisc~Mbigu~Ted in con'text~ the user is informed o? the ~lMbiguous M~lrlincjs (Ind the,~ssoci,:~'ted responses.

Issue ~6: Solution~....tO.
Is~q.es_._D~.~.n.. As I look back on the abuv~ reMork~ t:oncerning Sob's five issues~ it becomes ~pparent thr~t the u.~efulness of these remarks depends on The degree one is aware of the knowledge representatLon that underlie.s the solution suggested, For ex~Mple~ in the case of the last,Ls~ue,.
il ~ one only knew about traditional file structures~ finding paths theft link fields in More Than one file appears all but unsolvable, Even if one is accustomed to semantic net structures~ the viability of finding connective pnth.~ is highl~ dependccn~ on the existence of back links between attributes and their,~rgu~en~s and values.
Adding a definitional capability~ other thun simple abbreviqtions ~md synonyf4s~ Burns on the way free variables ore handled in 9ener~Jl cmd on the opporo.tus +'or binding theM) for example, in processing the de+'inition: "dei~\]nition:are~:length times width" when applied ~o q class> say "areas of ;~hips", how does one ensure ~hat he will ob rain : "lengTh(i) ~k width(i) fop i = I to number of ship~" rather Thonl "lengTh(i) ~ width(j) ?or i~j = i to nut.~ber o? ship..=".?
It coMe~ down to how variables qre MainTained in The underlying knowledge represen'tat ion, One is £or'ced to conclude ~hat the basis ~'or the integrcltion of the syntax cu,d ~emonTics o? coMput,~tionr~l linguistic systems i~ -ccoMplished wh..n tile d¢ci~4ion~ on knowledge r'epre~en~tiun ~r'e Made, Di~Jcussions 0£ #ur w:~rLous sotut.En.n to ~he J~sues of coMputaTional linguistics can Meaningfully ~uke pl<~ce only in terM~ uf the,:,~ underlying knowledge repr'eser~tot ions. 171
