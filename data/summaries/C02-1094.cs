For comparison, we also show the results reported by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990) from running their rule-based model on the same corpus.6 The German version of the model was evaluated using 7,409 words of the news corpus of the Institute of Natural Language Processing (IMS), University of Stuttgart (Rapp, 1998).

Although a0 -structure has been used by others to assign prosodic structure algorithmically (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), there is no generally accepted method for bundling a0 -phrases into I-phrases.
J90-3003
Gee and Grosjean (1983) (and subsequently, Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990)) construct Iphrases by comparing the length of the prosodic constituents on both the left-hand side and the righthand side of the utteranceâ€™s main verb (or the a0 phrase containing the verb), and grouping the verb with the shorter neighbouring constituent.
