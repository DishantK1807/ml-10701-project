Finally, the fourth and fifth feature functions corresponded to two lexicon models based on IBM Model 1 lexical parameters p(t|s) (Brown et al., 1993).

Once the training data was preprocessed, a wordto-word alignment was performed in both directions, source-to-target and target-to-source, by using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000).

This algorithm adjusts the log-linear weights so that BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is maximized over a given development set.

During the last decade, statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (Brown et al., 1993) into phrase-based translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003).

Similarly, the noisy channel approach has been expanded to a more general maximum entropy approach in which a log-linear combination of multiple models is implemented (Och and Ney, 2002).
