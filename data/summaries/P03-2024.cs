The same training example will also induce several lower-level rules, the least trivial of which are rules for VBAR and POSTMODS with context-free skeletons VBAR --> are, NP, ADV POSTMODS --> P, NP The grammar specialisation method is described in full detail in (Rayner et al., 2000b).

Here, the source-language representation is [[utterance_type,ynq], [tense,present], [symptom,headache], [event,cause], [cause,fatigue]] and the target-language one is [[utterance_type,sentence], [tense,present], [symptom,zutsu], 1This non-standard definition of VBAR has technical advantages discussed in (Rayner et al., 2000c) do your headaches often appear at night ! yoku yoru ni zutsu ga arimasu ka (often night-AT headache-SUBJ is-PRES-Q) is the pain in the front of the head ! itami wa atama no mae no hou desu ka (pain-TOPIC head-OF front side is-PRES-Q) did your headache start suddenly ! zutsu wa totsuzen hajimari mashita ka (headache-TOPIC sudden start-PRES-Q) have you had headaches for weeks ! sushukan zutsu ga tsuzuite imasu ka (weeks headache-SUBJ have-CONT-PRES-Q) is the pain usually superficial ! itsumo itami wa hyomenteki desu ka (usually pain-SUBJ superficial is-PRES-Q) is the severity of the headaches increasing ! zutsu wa hidoku natte imasu ka (headache-TOPIC severe becoming is-PRES-Q) Table 1: Examples of utterances covered by the prototype [event,okoru],[postpos,causal], [cause,tsukare]] Each line in the source representation maps into the corresponding one in the target in the obvious way.

This language model is compiled from a linguistically motivated unification grammar using the Open Source REGULUS 2 platform (Rayner et al., 2003; Regulus, 2003); the compilation process is driven by a small corpus of examples.
