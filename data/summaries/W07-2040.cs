101 Other than a lexicon (which is used to identify the base form of a term), our approach uses no background knowledge, such as WordNet (Miller, 1995), extensive dictionaries (Litkowski, 2006) or custom-built knowledge-bases (Hickl et al., 2006) that have been successfully employed by other systems.

However, it has been suggested (Stetina&Nagao 1997, Dekang 1997) that structural words, especially prepositions and particles, play an important role in computing the lexical preferences considered to be the most important clues for disambiguation.

The data used in this task was developed in The Preposition Project (TPP, Litkowski & Hargraves (2005) and Litkowski & Hargraves (2006)),1 with further refinements to fit the requirements of a SemEval task.

Closed class words, prepositions in particular, are ambiguous (Litkowski&Hargraves2006).

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.

Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

More recently researchers have begun to employ deeper syntactic analysis, such as dependency parsing (Yangarber et al., 2000; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005; Sudo et al., 2001; Sudo et al., 2003; Yangarber, 2003).

A number of numerical studies based on this principle have been reported in literature (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986; Schwartz et al., 1997).
