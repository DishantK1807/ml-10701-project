They include lexical similarity scores calculated from the TextTiling algorithm.(Hearst, 1997), which determines the lexical similarity of blocks of text by analyzing the cosine similarity of a sequence of sentences; this algorithm tests the likelihood of a topic boundary between blocks, preferring locations between blocks which have minimal lexical similarity.

We also calculate scores from (Galley et al., 2003)â€™s LCseg 1JRip is implemented in the Weka (Witten et al., 1999) machine learning environment.

In these tables, we report the F-measure of identifying the precise location of a story boundary as well as three metrics designed speci cally for this type of segmentation task: the pk metric (Beeferman et al., 1999), WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002) and Cseg (Pseg = 0.3) (Doddington, 1998).

Work on non-English BN, generally use this combination of lexical and acoustic measures, such as (Wayne, 2000; Levow, 2004) on Mandarin.

On CNN and Reuters stories from the TDT-1 corpus, (Stokes, 2003) report a Pk score of 0.25 and a WD score of 0.253.

work Previous approaches to story segmentation have largely focused lexical features, such as word similarily (Kozima, 1993), cue phrases (Passonneau and Litman, 1997), cosine similarity of lexical windows (Hearst, 1997; Galley et al., 2003), and adaptive language modeling (Beeferman et al., 1999).

And (Palmer et al., 2004) report results from feature selection experiments that include Arabic sources, though they do not report on accuracy.

The value of even errorful lexical information in identifying story boundaries has been con rmed for many previous story segmentation systems (Beeferman et al., 1999; Stokes, 2003)).
