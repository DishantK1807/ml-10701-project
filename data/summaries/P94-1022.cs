Schabes and Waters (1993a; 1993b) define Lexicalized Context-Free Grammars (LCFGs), a class of lexicalized TAGs (with restricted adjunction) that not only lexicalizes CFGs, but is cubic-time parsable and is weakly equivalent to CFGs.
P93-1017
In Schabes et al.(1988) and Schabes (1990) a general notion of lexicalized grammars is introduced.
C88-2121
A CKY-style style parsing algorithm for TAGs (the one given in Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1993), for example) can be modified to work with a two-dimensionM array, storing in each slot \[i, j\] a set of structures that encode a node in an elementary tree that can occur at the root of a subtree spanning the input from position i through j in some tree derivable in G, along with a stack recording the nesting of elementary auxiliary trees around that node in the derivation of that tree.
J93-4002
Proof: This follows directly from the equivalent lemma in Schabes and Waters (1993a).
P93-1017
Further, lexicalization supports strategies that can, in practice, improve the speed of recognition algorithms (Schabes et M., 1988).
C88-2121
Thus the structures that can be captured in these trees are restricted by the mechanism itself, and Schabes and Waters (in (1993a)) cite two situations where an existing LTAG grammar for English (Abeill@ et at., 1990) fails to meet this restriction.
P93-1017
investigations were initially motivated by the work of Schabes, Joshi, and Waters in lexicalization of CFGs via TAGs (Schabes and Joshi, 1991; Joshi and Schabes, 1992; Schabes and Waters, 1993a; Schabes and Waters, 1993b; Schabes, 1990).
