With these pairs we are also following (Nakov and Hearst, 2003) who suggest that if one is introducing ambiguity by creating pseudo—words or conflating names, then these words should be related in some way (in order to avoid the creation of very sharp or obvious sense distinctions).

We have shown the method to be language independent (Pedersen et al., 2006), which is to say we can apply it to English contexts as easily as we can apply it to Romanian or French.

Note that we are currently developing methods to automatically select the number of clusters in the data (e.g., (Pedersen and Kulkarni, 2006)), although we have not yet applied them to this particular work.

by Clustering Contexts Our method of name discrimination is described in more detail in (Pedersen et al., 2005), but in general is based on an unsupervised approach to word sense discrimination introduced by (Purandare and 25 Pedersen, 2004), which builds upon earlier work in word sense discrimination, including (Sch¨utze, 1998) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).

In fact, results on word sense discrimination (Purandare and Pedersen, 2004) suggest that first order representations are more effective with larger number of context than second order methods.
