25 118 O0 Praha I, Czechoslovakia ABSTRACT The paper characterizes natural language inferencing in the TIBAQ method of question-answering, focussing on three aspects: ~i) specification of the structures on which the inference rules operate, (ii) classification of the rules that have been formulated and implemented up to now, according to the kind of modification of the input structure ti~e rules invoke, an~ (iii) discussion of some points in which a proverly designed inference procedure may help the searc~ of the answer, and vice versa.
I SPECIFICATION OF THE I:~PUT STRUCTURES FOR INFE~ENC I\[IG A.
Outline of the TIBAQ ~lethod hhen the TIBA~ (~ext-and-~nference based ~nswering of ~uestions) project was ~esigned, main emphasis was laid on the automatic build-up of the stock of knowledge from the (non-~re-edited% input text.
The experimental system based 6n this method converses automatically the natural language input (both the questions and new Fieces of information, i.e.
Czech sentences in their usual form) into the reDresentations of n,eaning (tectogranmlatical representations, TR's\]; these TR's serve as input structures for the inference procedure tilat enriches the set of TR's selected by the system itself as possibly relevant for an answer to the input question.
In this enriched set suitable TR's for direct and indirect answers to the given question are retrieved, and then transfered by a synthesis procedure into the output (surface) form if sentences (for an outline of the method as such, see Haji~ov~, 197~; 3aji~ov~ and Sgall, 19~i; Sgall, 1982).
B. :?hat Kind of Structure Inferences ~houl~i Be Based on To decide what kind of structures the inference procedure should operate, one has to take into account several criteria, some of which seemingly contradict each other: the structures should be as simple and transparent as possible, so that inferencing can be perfor,ued in a well-defined way, and at the s~e ti~ue, these structures ~hould be as"exDressive"as the natural language sentences are, not to lose any piece of information captured by the text.
"~atural language has a major drawback in its ambiguity: when a listener is told that the criticisl~ of the Polish delegate was fully justified, one does not know (unless indicated by the context or situation) whether s/he should infer that soE~eone criticized the Polish delegate, or whether the Polish delegate criticized someone/something.
On the other hand, there are means in natural language that are not preserved by most languages that logicians have used for drawing consequences, but that are critical for the latter to be drawn correctly: when a listener is told that ~ussiau is ~poken in SIBERIA, s/he draws conclusions partly different from those when s/he is told that in Siberla, RUS3IAN is spoken (caoitals denoting the intonation center); or, to borrow one of the widely discussed examples in linguistic writings, if one hears that Jonn called :ary a ~U~LICA~ and that then she insulted I~IM, one should infer that the sneaker considers "being a ~eoublican" an insult~ this is not the case, if the speaker said that then she I~SULTED hi~.
These and similar considerations have led the authors of TIDAn to a stronc conviction that the structures representing F.nowledge and serving as the base for inferencing in a q-uestion-answerin\[~ system with a natural language interface should be linguistically based: they should be deprived of all ambiguities of natural language and at the same til:ie they should preserve all the information relevant for drawing conclusions that the natural lanciuage sentences encompass.
The exr.erir,~ental syster~, based on TI~A(:, which was carried out by the group of formal linauistics at Charles University, Prague \[implemented on ~C 1040 c~:n?11ter, compatible with 15::4 360) works with representations of :~eaning (tectogrammatical representations, fR's2 worked nut in the framework of functional generahive descrintion, or ~GD (for the linguistic background of this aopro~ch we refer to Sgall, 1964; ~;~all et ai.,1959; 291 Haji~ov~ and Jgall, 19:~O ).
C. l ectocrar.~n~tical ~eor:_'sentations One of the b~sic tenets of VGD is the articulation of the sc'~antic relation, i.e. th_relation bet.:een sound and r,~eaning, into a hierarchy o\[ levels, connected with the relativiz~tion o\[ the rel~tion of form" an~ 'function' a:~ known from the • ~;ritings of Prague &chool sc'nolar,3.
This relativizatio~.iakes it i~ossibl.., to di'~tingui.~h t::o levels of se:,tence structure: the level of surface syntax and that of t~e underlying or tectogramomatical structure of sentences.
As for a forn~al specification of the comolex unit oFthis lev,;l, that is the T!~., the \[)re~{ent version (see :'l.<ite\]-, Sgall an/ qgall, in }~ress) w~rks ::ith the notion of basic .\]e})endency structure (5DR),;hich is defined a~ \] structure over the alohabet A (corres\~onding to tne labels of no~les) and the set of sy~,~ools C (corres~onding.to the labels of e'lqes).
'i'he set of 5Drs is the sec of the tectogra:unatical representations of sentences containing no coordinated structures.
'fi%e ~-\]Dq s are generated by the gra:,~.~ar G = (V.,V,5,q), where V = A ka C, A = {(a ~,,~)\], a is inT terpreted as a lexical unit, g is a variaole standing for t and f (contextually bound and non-bound, res~ectively\] an., ~ is internreted as a set of <Ira,~,~aten~es belonging to a; C is a '~et of com~)lementations (c ~ C, where c is an inter;or denoting a certain type of comi~ler.'entation, called a functor),C" lenotes the set \[<, >, %, >c~ for uvery C ~ C.
%'o reuresent coordination, the formal a~paratus for sentence generation is to be complemented by another aluhabet Q, ..,here q ~ e is interpreted as tynes of coordination (conjun~ive, disjunctive, adversative, ..., ap}9osition), .Ind by ~ ne',,! kinu of brackets denotinq the boundary of coordinated structures; .3"={\[, ~, \] for every q ~ ~.
The structures generated oy the grammar are then called comT~lex '.\]e:gendency str~ctures (CD~).
Coming back to the notions of elementary and com~!ex units of the tectogra~c, atical level, we can say that the comnlex unit of the TR is the com?lex dependency structure as briefly characterized above, while the ele.nentary units are the symbol~ of ti~e shaoes a, g, c, q, the ele\[:ents of 3"~, and the ~arentheses.
'i'he lexical units a are conceiv..,<~ of as elementary rather th~n zom:_~lex, since for the time being we .1o not work with anv kind of lexical d~co.,;>osition.,'.very le:~ical unit is assig~le\] V.n~: \[eat:/re conte.':tually bound" or 'non-bound" . The set of gra.'nmate~,~zs GR cov:_'rs a :;ide ranme o£ \[}henomena; they can be classifie,i into two groups.
Grammatemes representing morphological rleanin C in the narrow sense are specific for different (semantic) word classes: for nouns, w~ distinguish grammatemes of number an~ of delimitation (indefinite, definite, specifying):for adjectives and adverbs, grammate~es of degree, for verbs, we work with grammatemes of aspect (processual, complex, resultative), iterativehess (iterative, non-iterative), tense (simultaneous, anterior, posterior), im:nediateness (immediate, non--immediate), predicate modality (indicative, Dossibilitive, necessitive, voluntative), assertive modality (affirmative, negative), and sentential modality (ieclarative, interrogative, imperative).
The other group o~ gr~mmatemes is not with some exceptions %~ord-class specific and similarly as the set of the types of complementations is closely connected with the kinds of the dependency relations between the governor and the dependent node; thus the Locative is accom}~anied by one member of the set {in, on, under, between ....
\]. %'he dependency relations are very rich and varied, and it is no wonder that there were many efforts to classify them.
In FGD, a,lear boundary is being made between -~tJcipants (deep cases) and(free) modifications: participants are those com!~lementations that can occur with the same verb token only once and that have to be sr~uci~ied for each verb (and similarly for each noun, adjective, etc.), while free modifications are those comolementations that may appear more than once with the same verb token and that can be listed for all the verbs once for all; for a ~ore detaile:i discussion and the use of operational criteria for this classification, see ?anevov~ 1974; 1980; Eaji~ov~ and Panevov~, in press; Haji~ov~, 1977; 1983.
Doth ;~articipants and modifications can be (semantically) optional or obligatory; ~oth optional and obligatory oarticiDants are to be stated in the case frames of verbs, while modificatiors belong there only with such verbs with which they are obligatory.
In the nresent version of FGD, the following five participants are distinguished: actor/bearer, patient (objective), addressee, origin, an~ effect.
The list o4 ~odifications is by far richer and more differentiated; a good starting ~oint for tills differentiation can be found in Czech gram~lars (esp.
~milauer, 1947).
%'bus one can arrive at the following grou~?ings: (a) local: where, lirection, "~lhich ~:ray, (b) tem~3oral: when, since when, till when, how long, for ho%J long, luring, (c) causal: cause, condition real and unrdal, aim, concession, consequence, (d) manner: manner, regard, extent, norm (criterion), substitution, accompaniment, means (instrument), difference, 292 benefit, comparison.
In our discussion on types of complementations we have up to now concentrated on complementations of verbs; with Zhe FGD framework, however, all word classes have their frames.
Specific to nouns (cf.
Pi\[ha, 1980), there is the partitive participant (a glass of water) and the free modifications of appurtenance (a leg of the table\], of general relationship (nice weather), of identity (the city of Prague\] and of a descriptive attribute (golden Prague).
To illustrate the structure of the representation on the tectogrammatical level of FG;), we present in Fi~.
$ a com21ex dependency structure of one of the readings of of the sentence "Before the ~ar began, Charles lived in P~AGUE and Jane in BFRLIN" (which it has in cormnon with "Before the beginning of the war, Charles lived in PRAGUE and Jane lived in rSERLIN ~) ;to make the graph easier to survey, we omit there the values of the gram.~atemes.

\[q_eans of Implementation The inference rules are progranm~ed in 9-1anguage (Colmerauer, 1982), which provides rules that carry out transforr~at~ ions of oriented graphs.
Since the structures accepted by the rules must not contain complex labels, every complex sy~bol labelling a no~e in WR's has the form of a whole subtree in the Q-language notation (in a "~-tree).
The set of TR's constitutes a semantic network, in which the individu~l T!{'s are connected into a com\[~lex whole hy means of pointers between tl\]e occurrences of lexical units and the corresponding entries in the lexicon.
(Ouestions of different objects of the same kind referred to in different TR's will be handled only in the future ex\]~eriments).
The following procedures eperate o~n TI "s : (i\] the extraction of (possibly\] relevant pieces of information from the stock of kno,:?led~e ; (ii\] the application of inference rules on the relevant }?ieces of information, (iii) the retrieval of the answer(s).

In order to avoid infinite cycles, the whole proced :r= oI inferencing is divided into several Q-systems (notice that rules within a single Q-system are applied s ~o,:g as the conditions for their application are fulfilled, i.e. there is no ordering of the rules ).
E. Types of Inference Rules I.
Rules operatin@ on a single TR: (i) the structure of the tree is preserved; the transformation concerns only (a) part(s) of the .o..p~ex symbol of some node of the CDS (i.e.
label(s) of some node(s)in the Q-tree of the TR): (a) change of a grammateme: V exform-POssib (Ndevice-ACt) (X-Pat) ...
== Vperform-lndic INdevice -Act) ~X-Pat) ...
A0te:, In our highly simplified and schematic shapes of the rules we quote only thos~ labels of the nodes that are relevlnt for the rule in question; the sign == stands for "rewrite as"; Ndevice stands for any no~n,,i%h the sem~,~t£u f=ature of "device", Vperfor m for a verb with the semantic feature of action ve£b=, ~ossib and II~dic denote the |raimnatemes of predicate modality.
E x.: An implifier can activate a Das,-ive network to form an active analogue.
== An amplifier activates a passive network to form an active anal~gue.
(b) change of a functor (type of complementation): V-use (Ni-Pat) (Nj-Accomp) ...
== V-use (Ni-Regard) (~j-Pat) ...
E__x.: Operational amplifier is used with negative feedback.
== With operational a,uplifier negative feedback is used.
Vperfor m LNi-Act ) (Nj-Pat) ...
== Vperfor m (Dgen-ACt) (~li-Instr) (Nj-Pat)..
E x.: Operational amplifiers perform mathematical operations == Mathematical operations are performed by means of operational amplifiers.
Note: Act, Pat, Instr, Accomp, Regard stand for the functors of Actor, Patient, Instrument, Accompaniment and Regard, respectively; D denotes a general participant, gen ~g~ change of the lexical part of the complex symbol accompanied by a change of some gramnlateme or functor: V.-Possibl ((few)Ni) (V-use(Nk-ACc°mpneg) ...)...
==Vi-Necess ((most)Ni) (V-use ( Nk-ACcompposit)...)...
Ex.: With few hlgh-performance opera-~ional amplifiers it is possible to maintain a linear relationship between input and output without employing negative feedback.== Hith most &i.
it is necessary to maintain ...
employing negative feedback.
(ii) a whole subtree is replaced by another subtree: Ex.: a negative feedback == a negative feedback circuit (iii) extraction of a subtree to create an independent TR: relative clause in the topic part of the TR V i (Vj-Gener-L(...))...
== Vj-Gener-L ()...
Ex.: An operational amplifier, which a--~tivates a passive network to form an active analogue, is an unusually versatile device.
== An operational amplifier activates a passive network to form an active analogue.
Note: L stands for the grammateme "contextually bound", R for "non-bound", Gener for the functor of general relationship.
causal clause in TR's with affirmative modality Vi-Affirm (Vj-Cause (...))...
== vj t)...
EX.: Since an operational amplifier i-~ designed to perform mathematical operations, such basic operations as ...
are performed readily.
== An operational amplifier is designed to perform mathematical operations.

to minimize loading of reference ~\]iod~ vermittlng full exploitation of the diode's precision temperature stability.
== Operational amplifiers are used as regulators ...
to minimize loading of reference diodes.
(iv) the transformation gives rise to two TR s distributivity of conjunction and disjunction (under certain conditions: e.g. for the distributivity of disjunction to hold, the grammateme of Indic with the main verb is replaced by the grammateme of Possib) E x.: Operational amplifiers are used in active filter networks to provide gain and frequency selectivity.
== Operatinal amplifiers are used in active filter networks to provide gain.
Operational amplifiBrs are used in active networks to provide frequency selectivity.
2. Rules operatin 9 (simultaneously) on two TR s left-hand side of the rule refers to two TR's) conjoining of TR's with the same Actor Ex.: An operational amplifier activates a passive network to form an active analogue.
An operational amplifier performs mathematical operations.
=~ An operational amplifier activates .... and performs .... use of definitions: the rule is triggered by the presence of an assertion of the form "X is called Y" and substitutes all occurrences of the lex~cal labels X in all TR's by the lexical label Y III EFFECTIVE LINKS BETWEEN INFERENCING AND ANSWER RETRIEVAL A.
The Retrieval Procedure Th~ retrieval of an answer in the enriched set of assertions (TR's) is performed in the following stepsl (a) first it is checked whether the lexical value of the root of the TR is identical with that of the TR of the question; if the question has the form "What is performed (done, carried out) by X?", then the TR from the enriched set must include an action verb as a label of its root; (b) the path leading from the root to the wh-word is checked (yes-no questions are.
excluded from the first stage of our experiments); the rightmost path in the relevant TR must coincide with the wh-path in its lexical labels, contextual--boundness, grammatemes and functors (with some possible deviations determined by conditions of substitutability: Singular Plural, Manner Accompaniment, etc.); the wh-word in the question must be matched by ~-lexical unit of the potential answer, where the latter may be further expanded; (c~ if also the rest of the two compared TR s meet the conditions of identity or substitutability, the relevant TR is marked as a full answer to the given question; if this is not the case but at least one of the nodes depending on a node included in the wh-path meets these conditions, then the relevant TR is marked as an indirect (partial) answer.
B. Towards an Effective Application of Inference Rules In the course of the experiments it soon became clear that even with a very limited number of inference rules the memory space was rapidly exceeded.
It was then necessary to find a way how to achieve an effective application of the inference rules and at the same time not to restrict the choice of relevant answers.
Among other things, the following issues should be taken into consideration: The rules substituting subtrees for subtrees are used rather frequently, as well as those substituting only a label of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one element of the complex symbol in the CDS), preserving the overall structure of the tree untouched.
These rules operate in both directions, so that it appears as useful to use in such cases a similar strategy as with synonymous expressions, i.e. to decide on a single representation both in the TR of the question and that included in the stock of knowledge; this would lead to an important decrease of the number of TR's that undergo further inference transformations.
Only those TR's are selected for the final steps of the retrieval of the answer (see point (a) in III.A) that coincide with the TR of the question in the lexical label of the root, i.e. the main verb.
If the inference rules are ordered in such a way that the rules changing an element of the label of the root are applied before the rest of the rules, then the first step of the retrieval procedure can be made before the application of other inference rules.
This again leads to a con295 siderable reduction of the number of TR's on which the rest of the inference rules are applied; only such TR's are left in the stock of relevant TR's (i)that agree with the TR of the question in the label of the root (its ~exical label may belong to superordinated or subordinated lexioal values: device amplifier, etc.), (ii) that i~clude the lexical label of the root oC the question in some other place than at the root of the relevant TR, (iii) if the question has the form "Which N " (i.e the wh-n~de depends on its • o-, o head in the relation of general relationship), then also those TR's are preserved that contain an identical N node (noun) on any level of the tree.
The use of Q-language brings about one difficulty, namely that the rules have to be formulated for each level for the tree separately.
It is possible to avoid this complication by a simple temporary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which results in a tree in which all nodes with lexical labels are on the same level; the rules for a substitution of the lexical labels can be then applied in one step, after which the tree is "returned" into its original shape.
These and similar considerations have led us to the following ordering of the individual steps of the inference and retrieval procedure: I.
application of rules transforming the input structure to such an extent that the lexlcal label of the root of the tree is not preserved in the tree of a potential answer; 2.
a partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 3.
application of rules substituting other labels pertinent to the root of the tree; 4.
partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 5.
application of inference rules operatinq on a single tree; 6.
application of inference rules operating on two trees; 7.
the steps (b) and (c) from the retrieval of the answer (see III.A above).
