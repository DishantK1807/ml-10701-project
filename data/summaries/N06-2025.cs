The sentences were processed with the Collins’ parser (Collins, 1997) to generate automatic parse trees.

As shown in (Moschitti, 2004), we can label semantic roles by classifying the smallest subtree that includes the predicate with one of its arguments, i.e. the so called PAF structure.

However, the complexity burden of working in the dual space can be alleviated with recent approaches proposed in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004).

The formal can be found in (Moschitti, 2006).

We run ST, SST and PT kernels along with the linear kernel of standard features (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) on PropBank training sets of different size.

(2) Such kernel generates a feature space richer than those defined in (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002; Collins and Duffy, 2002; Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; ShaweTaylor and Cristianini, 2004).

on SRL dataset We used two different corpora: PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/∼ace) along with Penn Treebank 2 (Marcus et al., 1993) and FrameNet.

In this paper, we study the impact of the subtree (ST) (Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002), subset tree (SST) (Collins and Duffy, 2002) and partial tree (PT) kernels on Semantic Role Labeling (SRL).
