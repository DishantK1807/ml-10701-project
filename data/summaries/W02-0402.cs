Description We have implemented our randomized local search method for sentence selection as part of the RIPTIDES (White et al., 2001) system.

System The IE system combines existing language technology components (Bikel et al., 1997; Charniak, 1999; Day et al., 1997; Fellbaum, 1998) in a traditional IE architecture (Cardie, 1997; Grishman, 1996).

In addition, a Figure 1: Hypertext Summary Overview Figure 2: Tables of Death Toll Estimates heuristic-based clustering algorithm organizes the extracted concepts into output templates specifically designed to support multi-document summarization: the IE system, for example, distinguishes different reports or views of the same event from multiple sources (White et al., 2001).

Barzilay et al.(2001) present an improved method of ordering sentences in the context of MultiGen, a multidocument summarizer that identifies sets of similar sentences, termed themes, and reformulates their common phrases as new text.

We chose to use TDT2 topic 89 so that we could assess the impact of the IE quality on the results, given that we had previously created manual IE annotations for these articles (White et al., 2001).1 1Although our decision to use subsets of TDT2 topic 89 as inputs meant that our training/tuning and test data overlapped, we do not believe that this choice overly compromises our results, since — as will be discussed in this section and the next — the impact of the IE groups For each input document set, we ran the RIPTIDES system to produce overview summaries of 200 words or less.
