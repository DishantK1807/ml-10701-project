It remains true that for a fixed grammar, the time to do generation is close to linear on the size of the input (Ellison, 1994), which is heartening if we intend to optimize long utterances with respect to a fixed phonology.

Timelines like these could be assembled morphologically from one or more lexical entries (Bird & Ellison, 1994), or produced in the course of algorithm (14).

In contrast to less restricted theories using Generalized Alignment, OTP's optimal surface forms can be generated with finite-state methods adapted from (Ellison, 1994).

}. It is always possible to recover the old representation (4a) from the new one (4b), under the convention that two constituents on the timeline are linked if their interiors overlap (Bird & Ellison, 1994).

The idea is essentially due to (Ellison, 1994), and can be boiled down to two lines: (14) Ellison's algorithm (variant).

4Weighted versions of the state-labeled finite automata of (Bird & EUison, 1994) could be used instead.

A similar argument for weighted CFGs (using two tones) shows this constraint to be too hard even for (Tesar, 1996).

We saw above to set up the representations and constraints efficiently using deterministic finite-state automata, and how to remedy some hidden inefficiencies in the seminal work of (Ellison, 1994), achieving at least a 100-fold observed speedup.
