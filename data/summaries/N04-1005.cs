This lattice is flattened to an N-best list and passed to a multimodal dialog manager (MDM) (Johnston et al., 2002b), which re-ranks them in accordance with the current dialogue state.

Figure 2: Multimodal Architecture 2.2 Multimodal Integration and Understanding Our approach to integrating and interpreting multimodal inputs (Johnston et al., 2002b; Johnston et al., 2002a) is an extension of the finite-state approach previously proposed (Bangalore and Johnston, 2000; Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).

MATCH application MATCH (Multimodal Access To City Help) is a working city guide and navigation system that enables mobile users to access restaurant and subway information for New York City (NYC) (Johnston et al., 2002b; Johnston et al., 2002a).

In a recent paper (Rayner and Hockey, 2003), the authors address this issue by employing a decision-list-based speech understanding system as a means of progressing from rule-based models to data-driven models when data becomes available.

All these operations are achieved using finite-state transducer operations (See (Bangalore and Johnston, 2000; Johnston and Bangalore, 2000) for details).

Although we are not aware of any attempts to address the issue of robust understanding in the context of multimodal systems, this issue has been of great interest in the context of speech-only conversational systems (Dowding et al., 1993; Seneff, 1992; Allen et al., 2000; Lavie, 1996).

The identification of the linguistic units in the out-of-domain corpus is done automatically using a supertagger (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).

An LTAG consists of a set of elementary trees (Supertags) (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) each associated with a lexical item.

These tags are drawn from a tagset which is constructed by extending each argument label by three additional symbols a11 a24 a35 a24a4a12, following (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995).

The issue of combining rule-based and data-driven approaches has received less attention, with the exception of a few (Wang et al., 2000; Rayner and Hockey, 2003; Wang and Acero, 2003).

These are then combined and assigned a meaning representation using a multimodal finite-state device (MMFST) (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000; Johnston et al., 2002b).

In related work (Rambow et al., 2002), it has been shown that for a restricted version of LTAG, the combinations of a set of supertags can be represented as an FSM.
