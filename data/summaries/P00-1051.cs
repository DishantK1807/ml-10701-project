Annotation Previous empirical studies of centering theory typically involved a single annotator annotating her corpus according to her own subjective judgment (Passonneau, 1993; Kameyama, 1998; Strube and Hahn, 1999).
J99-3001
A notable exception is (Tetreault, 1999), which used an annotated corpus to compare the performance of two variants of centering theory.

As a result, centering theory is best viewed as a cluster of theories, each of which specifies the parameters in a different ways: e.g., ranking has been claimed to depend on grammatical function (Kameyama, 1985; Brennan et al., 1987), on thematic roles (Cote, 1998), and on the discourse status of the CFs (Strube and Hahn, 1999); there are at least two definitions of what counts as ‘previous utterance’ (Kameyama, 1998; Suri and McCoy, 1994); and ‘realization’ can be interpreted either in a strict sense, i.e., by taking a CF to be realized in an utterance only if an NP in that utterance denotes that CF, or in a looser sense, by also counting a CF as ‘realized’ if it is referred to indirectly by means of a bridging reference (Clark, 1977), i.e., an anaphoric expression that refers to an object which wasn’t mentioned before but is somehow related to an object that already has, as in the vase ...the handle (see, e.g., the discussion in (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b)).

The relations we mark up are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ version of the MATE scheme (Poesio et al., 1999) and include set membership (ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes part-of relations as well as more traditional ownership relations.

The Data The aim of our project, which is called GNOME and whose home page is at http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/ DI gnome, is to develop NP generation algorithms whose generality is to be verified by incorporating them in two distinct systems: the ILEX system developed at the University of Edinburgh, that generates Web pages describing museum objects on the basis of the perceived status of its user’s knowledge and of the objects she previously looked at (Oberlander et al., 1998); and the ICONOCLAST system, developed at the University of Brighton, that supports the creation of patient information leaflets (Scott et al., 1998).

Using functional centering (Strube and Hahn, 1999) to rank the CFs led to no improvements, because of the almost perfect correlation in our domain between subjecthood and being discourse-old.
J99-3001
Because any attempt at directly annotating a corpus for ‘utterances’ and their CBs is bound to force the annotators to adopt some specification of the basic notions of the theory, previous studies have tended to study a particular variant of the theory (Di Eugenio, 1998; Kameyama, 1998; Passonneau, 1993; Strube and Hahn, 1999; Walker, 1989).
J99-3001 P89-1031
One of our goals was to use for our study only information that could be annotated reliably (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Carletta, 1996), as we believe this will make our results easier to replicate.

separation among a ‘center of coherence’ and a ‘center of salience’ is independently motivated by considerations about the division of labor between the text planner and the sentence planner in a generation system; see, e.g., (Kibble, 1999).
W99-0109
Theories of focusing such as (Sidner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999), as well as our own early experiments with centering, suggested that indirect realization can play quite a crucial role in maintaining the CB; however, previous work, particularly in the context of the MUC initiative, suggested that while it’s fairly easy to achieve agreement on identity relations, marking up bridging references is quite hard; this was confirmed by, e.g., Poesio and Vieira (1998).

OF CENTERING THEORY Centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is an ‘object-centered’ theory of text coherence: it attempts to characterize the texts that can be considered coherent on the basis of the way discourse entities are introduced and discussed.

Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998b) is best characterized as a ‘parametric’ theory: its key definitions and claims involve notions such as ‘utterance’, ‘realization’, and ‘ranking’ which are not completely specified; their precise definition is left as a matter for empirical research, and may vary from language to language.
J95-2003
Suri and McCoy (1994) did a study that led them to propose that some types of adjuncts–in particular, clauses headed by after and before–should be treated as ‘embedded’ rather than as ‘permanent updates’ as suggested by Kameyama; these results were subsequently confirmed by more controlled experiments Pearson et al.(2000). Neither Kameyama nor Suri and McCoy discuss parentheticals; Kameyama only briefly mentions relative clauses, but doesn’t analyze them in detail.

rank: whether CFs should be ranked according to grammatical function or discourse status in Strube and Hahn’s sense 2 (Cristea et al., 2000) showed that it is indeed possible to achieve good agreement on discourse segmentation, but that it requires intensive training and repeated iterations; we intend to take advantage of a corpus already annotated in this way in future work.

The agreement on identifying the boundaries of units, using the AK statistic discussed in (Carletta, 1996), was AK BP BMBL (for two annotators and 500 units); the agreement on features(2 annotators and at least 200 units) was follows: Attribute AK Value utype .76 verbed .9 finite .81 subject .86 NPs Our instructions for identifying NP markables derive from those proposed in the MATE project scheme for annotating anaphoric relations (Poesio et al., 1999).
