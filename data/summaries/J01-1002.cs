The method of Hearst (1994, 1997) uses cosine similarity in a word vector space as an indicator of topic similarity.

Reynar (1994) presented a method that finds topically similar regions in the text by graphically modeling the distribution 32 Ttir, Hakkani-Tiir, Stolcke, and Shriberg Integrating Prosodic and Lexical Cues of word repetitions.

Based on Discourse and Combined Cues Previous work on both text and speech has found that cue phrases or discourse particles (items such as now or by the way), as well as other lexical cues, can provide valuable indicators of structural units in discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Passonneau and Litman 1997, among others).

1 Similarly, it is sometimes assumed for topic segmentation purposes that topics change only at paragraph boundaries (Hearst 1997).

Kozima (1993) used mutual similarity of words in a sequence of text as an indicator of text structure.
P93-1041
Using HMM posteriors as decision tree features is similar in spirit to the knowledge source combination approaches used by Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty (1999) and Reynar (1999), who also used the output of a topical word usage model as input to an overall classifier.
P99-1046
Major shifts in topic typically show longer pauses, an extra-high F0 onset or "reset," a higher maximum accent peak, greater range in F0 and intensity (Brown, Currie, and Kenworthy 1980; Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Nakajima and Allen 1993; Geluykens and Swerts 1993; Ayers 1994; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996; Nakajima and Tsukada 1997; Swerts 1997) and shifts in speaking rate (Brubaker 1972; Koopmans-van geinum and van Donzel 1996; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996).
P96-1038
An early study by Litman and Passonneau (1995) used hand-labeled prosodic boundaries and lexical information, but applied machine learning to a training corpus and tested on unseen data.
P95-1015
Topic segmentation research based on prosodic information has generally relied on hand-coded cues (with the notable exception of Hirschberg and Nakatani \[1998\]), or has not combined prosodic information with lexical cues (Litman and Passonneau \[1995\] is one example where lexical information was combined with hand-coded prosodic features for a related task).
P95-1015
The general framework for combining lexical and prosodic cues for tagging speech with various kinds of "hidden" structural information is a further development of our earlier work on sentence segmentation and disfluency detection for spontaneous speech (Shriberg, Bates, and Stolcke 1997; Stolcke and Shriberg 1996; Stolcke et al.1998), conversational dialogue tagging (Stolcke et al.2000), and information extraction from broadcast news (Hakkani-T~ir et al.1999). In the next section, we review previous work on topic segmentation.
