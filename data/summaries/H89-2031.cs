Recently, we have begun porting our ACFG natural language system (Boisen, et al, 1989b) to a personnel database domain, a domain for which Parlance had been configured using the Learner.

Since the database system used in the ACFG system--described in (Boisen, 1989)---is essentially a modified version of that used by Parlance, these rules are straightforwardly usable.

BBN has developed a software package, the Learner, as a porting tool for non-expert users (Bates, 1989; BBN Parlance Learner Manual, 1989).

WORDS AND WORD CLASSES We have also used the Learner to acquire a set of vocabulary items and word classes for a class grammar (Derr and Schwartz, 1989) for use in HARC, the BBN Spoken Language System (Boisen, et al, 1989a), which incorporates the ACFG system as its natural language component.

Previous work with the Learner (Bates, 1989) has demonstrated a speed-up of ten times or more, compared to manual acquisition of the same information.
H89-1008
Such acquisition tools include the acquisition component of TEAM (Grosz, 1983), the LapltUp lexical acquisition package for the JANUS system (Cumming and Albano, 1986), and the TELI system's semantic acquisiton facility (Ballard and Stumberger, 1986).

First, it suggests that the great boost in productivity reported in (Bates, 1989) by using the Learner to port the Parlance system may be extended to the ACFG system.
