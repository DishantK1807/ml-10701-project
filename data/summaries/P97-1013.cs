Such constructs can include tense 96 and aspect (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Webber, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993), certain patterns of pronominalization and anaphoric usages (Sidner, 1981; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Sumita et al., 1992; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995),/t-clefts (Delin and Oberlander, 1992), and discourse markers or cue phrases (Ballard, Conrad, and Longacre, 1971; Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Van Dijk, 1979; Longacre, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Cohen, 1987; Redeker, 1990; Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996; Moser and Moore, 1997).

On one hand, efforts such as those described by Asher (1993), Lascarides, Asher, and Oberlander (1992), Kamp and Reyle (1993), Grover et al.(1994), and Pr0st, Scha, and van den Berg (1994) take the position that discourse structures can be built only in conjunction with fully specified clause and sentence structures.

Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases.

On the other hand, although the theories described by Grosz and Sidner (1986), Polanyi (1988), and Mann and Thompson (1988) are successfully applied manually, they,are too informal to support an automatic approach to discourse analysis.

The intuition behind our choice relies on the following facts: â€¢ Psycholinguistic and other empirical research (Kintsch, 1977; Schiffrin, 1987; Segal, Duchan, and Scott, 1991; Cahn, 1992; Sanders, Spooren, and Noordman, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Costermans and Fayol, 1997) has shown that discourse markers are consistently used by human subjects both as cohesive ties between adjacent clauses and as "macroconnectors" between larger textual units.

corpus analysis of discourse markers 3.1 Materials We used previous work on cue phrases (Halliday and Hasan, 1976; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Martin, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Knott, 1995; Fraser, 1996) to create an initial set of more than 450 potential discourse markers.
