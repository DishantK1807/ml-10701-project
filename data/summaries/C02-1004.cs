The cooccurrence values for verb V and noun N1 correspond to the probability estimates in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) except that Ratnaparkhi includes a back-off to the uniform distribution for the zero denominator case.
P98-2177
Supervised methods are as varied as the Backoff approach by Collins and Brooks (1995) and the Transformation-based approach by Brill and Resnik (1994).

If we force a default decision (noun attachment) on the remaining cases, the overall accuracy is at 79.14%. 4 Results for the supervised methods One of the most successful supervised methods is the Back-off model as introduced by Collins and Brooks (1995).

Pantel and Lin (2000) increased the training corpus, added a collocation database and a thesaurus which improved the accuracy to 84%.
P00-1014
The cooccurrence values are also very similar to the probability estimates in (Hindle and Rooth, 1993).
J93-1005
The most prominent unsupervised methods are the Lexical Association score by Hindle and Rooth (1993) and the cooccurrence values by Ratnaparkhi (1998).
J93-1005 P98-2177
(Collins and Brooks, 1995) and (Pantel and Lin, 2000)) has shown that it is advantageous to include the noun from within the PP (called N2) in the calculation.
P00-1014 W95-0103
Even better results were reported by Stetina and Nagao (1997) who used the WordNet thesaurus with a supervised learner and achieved 88% accuracy.
