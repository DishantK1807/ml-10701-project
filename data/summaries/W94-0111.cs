Brill's results demonstrate that this approach can outperform the Hidden Markov Model approaches that are frequently used for part-of-speech tagging (Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992; Weischedel et al., 1993), as well as showing promise for other applications.

upenn, edu Introduction Eric Brill in his recent thesis (1993b) proposed an approach called "transformation-based error-driven learning" that can statistically derive linguistic models from corpora, and he has applied the approach in various domains including part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994) and building phrase structure trees (Brill, 1993a).

1; they closely replicate Brill's results (1993b, page 96), allowing for the fact that his tests used more templates, including templates like "if one of the three previous tags is A".
