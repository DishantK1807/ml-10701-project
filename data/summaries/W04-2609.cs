(Rosario and Hearst 2001) focused on the medical domain making use of a lexical ontology and standard machine learning techniques.

Several approaches have been proposed for empirical noun-compound interpretation, such as syntactic analysis based on statistical techniques (Lauer and Dras 1994), (Pustejovsky et al.1993). Another popular approach focuses on the interpretation of the underlying semantics.

More recently, (Rosario and Hearst 2001), (Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002), (Lapata 2002) have proposed automatic methods that analyze and detect noun compounds relations from text.

Other researchers have identified other sets of semantic relations (Levi 1979), (Vanderwende 1994), (Sowa 1994), (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), (Rosario and Hearst 2001), (Kingsbury, et al.2002), (Blaheta and Charniak 2000), (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002), (Gildea and Palmer 2002).

Noun noun (adjective noun, respectively) sequences of words were extracted using the Lauer heuristic (Lauer 1995) which looks for consecutive pairs of nouns that are neither preceded nor succeeded by a noun after each sentence was syntactically parsed with Charniak parser (Charniak 2001) (for XWN we used the gold parse trees).

Many researchers that followed this approach relied mostly on hand-coded rules (Finin 1980), (Vanderwende 1994).
