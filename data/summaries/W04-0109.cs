By making strong independence assumptions and some approximations, and assuming that all prefixes and suffixes are equally likely, this is equivalent to:1 P(γδsψs|ψprimepγδprimesψprimes) = max ψprimep,γδprimes,ψprimes P(δprimes →δs|γδprimes) Note we are using a slightly different, but equivalent, notation to that used in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000).

This “end-of-string model” of morphology was used again in Yarowsky et al.(2001) where it was applied to English, French and Czech.

Goldsmith (2001) uses minimum description length to successfully find paradigmatic classes of suffixes in a number of European languages, including Dutch and Russian, though the approach has been less successful in handling prefixation.

The Boas project (Oflazer et al., 2001), (HakkaniT¨ur et al., 2000), and (Oflazer and Nirenburg, 1999) has produced excellent results bootstrapping a morphological analyzer, but rely on direct human supervision to produce two-level rules (Koskenniemi, Barcelona, July 2004 Association for Computations Linguistics ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Phonology (SIGPHON) Proceedings of the Workshop of the 1983) which are then compiled into a finite state machine.

We propose no new solutions to handling irregular verb forms, but suggest using non-string-based techniques, such as those presented in (Yarowsky and Wicentowski, 2000), (Baroni et al., 2002) and (Wicentowski, 2002).

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) use latent semantic analysis to find prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes in German, Dutch and English.

Presentation The WordFrame model is constructed explicitly as an extension to the end-of-string model proposed by Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000); as such, we first give a brief presentation of the model, then introduce the WordFrame model.

Much previous work has been done in automatically acquiring such affix lists, most recently the generative models built by Snover and Brent (2001) which are able to identify suffixes in English and Polish.

WordFrame Algorithm 3.1 Motivation The supervised morphological learner presented in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000) modeled lemmatization as a word-final stem change plus a suffix taken from a (possibly empty) list of potential suffixes.

Work The development of the WordFrame model was motivated by work originally presented in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000).
P00-1027
In Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), the end-of-string model is trained from inflection-root pairs acquired through unsupervised methods.
