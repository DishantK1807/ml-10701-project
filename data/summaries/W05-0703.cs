We tackle these requirements by implementing the multitape approach of Kiraz (2000), which we 17 extend by adding an additional tape for independently modeling phonology and orthography.

Automata We follow (Kiraz, 2000) in using a multitape analysis.

Kay (1987) devised a framework with which each of the autosegmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form.
E87-1002
In this work we follow the multi-tape approach, and specifically that of (Kiraz, 2000).
J00-1006
Kiraz (2000,2001) extended Kay’s approach and implemented a working multi-tape system with pilot grammars for Arabic and Syriac.

This is the first large-scale implementation of (Kiraz, 2000).

The first large scale implementation of Arabic morphology within the constraints of finite-state methods was that of Beesley et al.(1989) with a ‘detouring’ mechanism for access to multiple lexica, which later gave rise to other works by Beesley (Beesley, 1998) and, independently, by Buckwalter (2004).
