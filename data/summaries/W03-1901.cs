For examples of morphological and syntactic annotation in GMT format, see Ide and Romary, 2001a; 2003; and Ide and Romary, 2001b.
P01-1040 W03-0804 W03-1905
The overall design of the architecture and the data model that it will instantiate have been described in Ide et al., 2003.
W03-0804 W03-1905
The choice of this model is indicated by its almost universal use in defining general-purpose annotation formats, including the Generic Modeling Tool (GMT) (Ide and Romary, 2001, 2002) and Annotation Graphs (Bird and Liberman, 2001).
P01-1040
Its applicability to diverse annotation types, including terminology, dictionaries and other lexical data (Ide, et al., 2000), morphological annotation (Ide and Romary, 2002) and syntactic annotation (Ide and Romary, 2001b, 2003) demonstrates its generality.
P01-1040 W03-0804 W03-1905
Development of this model has been discussed extensively within the language engineering community and tested on a variety of annotation types (see Ide and Romary, 2001a, 2001b, 2002).
