The EFW arose in reaction to the CAT forrealism for MT (Arnold & des Tombe (1987), Arnold et al (1986)).

The general route of the EFW to solving these problems is to separate the output of the t-grammar from the finished representation in the following way, as described in Bech & Nygaard (1988): (3) Repni I t-grammar DI'~SCIIIP'I'OR~ I g r gill lit arj J.

There is a well-motivated research programme with the aim of making the transfer 2 67 stage of MT as simple as other factors permit (van Eynde (1986); Arnold, des Tombe & Jaspaert (1985, section 2.2.3); Leermakers & Kous (1986)).
