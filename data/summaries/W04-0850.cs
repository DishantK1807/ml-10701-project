In (Pedersen, 2001a) we introduced the use of decision trees based strictly on bigram features.

The SyntaLex system (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004b) also participated in the English lexical sample task of SENSEVALâ€“3 and is a sister system to DuluthELSS.

While the level of redundancy between supervised systems can be rather high (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004a), we are optimistic that a corpus based supervised approach and a dictionary based unsupervised approach might be highly complementary.

Work The Duluth-xLSS system was originally inspired by (Pedersen, 2000), which presents an ensemble of eighty-one Naive Bayesian classifiers based on varying sized windows of context to the left and right of the target word that define co-occurrence features.

We will also conduct an analysis of the complementary and redundant nature of lexical and syntactic features, as we have done in (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004a) for the SENSEVAL-1, SENSEVAL2, and line, hard, serve, and interest data.

The supervised lexical sample system that participated in SENSEVAL-3 is the Duluth3 (English) or Duluth8 (Spanish) system as used in SENSEVAL2 (Pedersen, 2001b).

They have a long history of use in word sense disambiguation, dating back to early work by (Black, 1988), and have fared well in comparative studies such as (Mooney, 1996) and (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997).
