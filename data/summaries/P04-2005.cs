For example, Resnik and Yarowsky (1999) sug2See: http://cn.yahoo.com/dictionary/ gested that for the purpose of WSD, the different senses of a word could be determined by considering only sense distinctions that are lexicalised cross-linguistically.
P99-1068
Diab and Resnik (2002) presented an unsupervised method for WSD using the same type of resource.
P02-1033
To solve the problem of different senses not being distinguishable mentioned in the previous paragraph, we chose a language very distant to English â€“ Chinese, since the more distant two languages are, the more likely that senses are lexicalised differently (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).
P99-1068
Mining the Web for bilingual text (Resnik, 1999) is not likely to provide sufficient quantities of high quality data.
P99-1068
One set was extracted from a hand-tagged corpus (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994) and the other by our algorithm.
P94-1020
Chklovski and Mihalcea (2002) presented another interesting proposal which turns to Web users to produce sense-tagged corpora.
