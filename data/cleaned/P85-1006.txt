Malda and Shapiro lq82): iS) There is a I-I ~orrespondence betv, een nodes and represented concepts.
A concept is "anything about whtch mlormat~on can he stored and/or transmitted" (Shapiro 197q: 179).
Widen a semantic network such as SNePS ~s u~d to model "the behel structure ol a thinking, rea.~onlnt.,, language using be,ng" (Matda and Shaptru 1982: 296: of.

It t'ollov,'s I rc,m (%) that the arcs do not represent concepr-s.
Rather. they repre',ent binary, structural relations between concept.s.
If ~t )s des)red to talk about certain relations between concepts, then tho~e relations must be represented by nodes, smce they have r.neJt become objects o= thought, =.~, concepts.
In terms of Oume's dictum that "t~ be is to be the value of a \[hound\] variable" (Qume 1980: 15; cf.
Shapiro 1971a: 7q-80).

It ~s because m) prorxts~ t~ons :are represented hv arcs that SNel)% ts a "pr()rx)sltlonal" semantic network (c:.
Maida and Shapiro 1982: 292).
When a ~manttc network such as SNePS is u~d to model a mind, the nodes represent only intensional ~tems (Maida and Shapiro 1982; of.
Rapaport 1978).
Simil-',rly, if such a network were to be used ~s a notation for a fully lntensional naturallanguage semantics (such as the semantics presented in Rapaport 198-1 ), the n(~es would represent only mtensional items.
Thus, a semantics for such a network ought )tsetf to be fully mtensional.
There are two pairs of t3tpes of nodes in S.Nel)S: constant and variable nixies, and atomic (or individual) and molecular (or propositumal) nodes.

4. MEINONG'S TIIEORY OF OKJEC'TS.
A!cxlus Metnong's (19(M) theory of the oh)e~ts of psvchologl~i acts ~s a more appropriate foundation for a semantics of propositional semantic networks as well a.s for a natural-language semantics.
in brier, 5,1emong's the()rv camsists of the f~)llo~ing theses (c|'.
Rapap)rt 1976, 1978): (MI) Thes/s oj" Intentionality: livery mental act (e.g., thmkmg, believing, judging, etc).
is "directed" towards an "ob.)ect".
l'here are two kmds of Memongian objects: (I) objecta, the individual-like oh}ectx of such a mental act as thmking-of, and (2) 44 objectives, the proposttlon-hke objects tat such mental acts as believlng(-that) or knowing(-that).
E.g.. the object of my act of thinking of a unicorn is: a unicorn; the object or mv act of believing that the I~rth is flat is: the Earth is flat.
(M2) Not every object of thought exists (technically, "has being").
(M3) It is not self-contradictory to deny.
nor tautologous to al'firm.
existence of an object of thought.
(M4) Thesis of Au~sersein: All objects of thought are ausserse/~nd ("beyond being and non-being").
For present pur~ Aussersein ts most easily explicated as a domain of quantification for non-existentially-loaded quanttfiers.
required by (M2) and (M3).
(MS) I!verv oblect of thought has properties (technically.
"Sosein"). (M6) Principle of Independence: (M2) and (MS) are not inconsistent.
( For more d,~'ux, c,on.
if. Rapal~rt I984c).
('atoll'dry: liven oblectx of thought that do not exist have properties.

It should be obvious that there is a close relationship between Memong's theory and a rullv mtensnonat ~mantlc network hke %NePS.
SNel)S it.'.,elf ts much hke .4usse~ein; %haplro (personal communication) has said that all nixies are :mpIncntlv m the network,ill the ume.
In particular, a SNePS base (i.e..

5. RAPAPOIIT'S THEORY.
On my own reconstruction of Meinong's theory (Rapaport 1976, 1978--which bears a coincidental r~mblance to McCarthy 1979).
there are two types of objecLs: M-objecta (i.e~ the objects of thought, which are intensional) and actual objects (which are extensional).
There are two modes of predication of properties to these: M-objects are constituted by properties, and both Mand actual objects can exemplify properties.
For instance, the pen with which l wrote the manumnpt of this paper is an actual object that exemplifies the property of being while.
Right now.
when I think about that pen.
the object of my thought is an M-oblect that is constitLaed (in part) by that property.
The M-object Jan's pen can be represented as: <belonging to Jan.
being a pen> (or.
for short, as: *J.
P>). Ileing a pen is also a constituent of this M-object: P c <J.
P >; and 'Jan% pen is a pen' is true in virtue of this objective.
\[n addition.
<J. P > exemplifies (ex) the property of being constituzed by two properties.
There might be an actual (abject, .say.
~. corresrxmding to <J.
P >, that exemplifies the property of being a pen (iv ex /" ) as well as (say) the property of being 6 inches &rag.

and 'The round ~uare ts not .~luare" ts fal~,n virtue of it.

Terence Parsons's theory of nonexistent oh\]eeLs (1980; cf.
Rapa~x~rt 1976.

But it has two 45 Fig.

types ill" properties: nuclea~ and extranuclea~.
Tile tormer includes all "ordinary" properties such as: being red.
being round, etc.
the latter includes such properties as: existing, being ~ml~t~sthJe.
etc. I~u\[ the thstlnctnon ts SlurrY, s, nce for each extranuclear pn~perty, there Is a ct)rresl~)ndlng nuclear one.

Existing ohlects must he ct~mplete (and.
~tf ct~urse, ctmslstent).
though not all such ohle~ts exist.
For instance, the Morning Star and the I:'vening Slat don't exist (tl th~ are taken to ct)nsnst, roughly, of only two properties each).

Parstms's the~lrv could pn~ tdea semantics for SNeI>S.
though the use of two types of properties pla~ restrictions on the po~tble uses of SNePS.
On the other hand, SNePS could he used to represent Parsons's theory (though a device would be needed for marking the d~sttoctlon between nuclear and extranuclear properties) and, hence.

7. CASTANIrDA'S THEORY.
Ilector-N~ri Castan'eda's theory of "guises" (1972, 1975a-c.
1977, 197q.
1980) is a better .~ndidate.
It is a fully intensional theory with one type of oh!oct: guises (intensional items corr~ponding to ~t.q,if properties), and one type of property.
More prettily, there are properties (e.g., being round, being square, being blue ....
). ~ees of these (called guise cores: e.g., {being round, being squaret), and an ontic counterpart, c, or the detimte-descriptlon operator, which ns used to form guises; e.g.. cbeing round, being square| is the round square.
Guises can be understood, roughly, as things-under-a-descrtptmn.
~,s "facets" of (physical and nonphysical) ob.l~t.s, as "roles" that ohjecr,s play, or, in general, as objects t)l" thought.
Gui~ theory has two modes of predication: internal and external In general, the gui~ cl...
F... } is-internally t'.
I:..g., the gut~ (named by) the round square is-mternally only round and square.
The two guises the tallest mountain and &It.
Everest are related hv an external mode of predication called consubstantialion (C'*).
Consuh~tantmtnon is an equivalence relation that is u~d in the analyses of (I) external predication, (2) co-reference, and (3) existence: l,et a = c {...
/"... } be a guise and let a\[fi l =~f c({.
. . 1" ...} u l(; }).
Then(I)a ~s-externally(; (in one,sense) if C~(a.
a\[G \]).
For instance.
"the Morning Star ts a planet' is true because C~( c t M.
S }, c { M . S, P }): i.e.. the Morning Star and the Morning Star that is a planet are consul~tantlated.
(2)Gut~ a "is the ~me as" gul~ b .I and ~mlv d" ('*ab.
