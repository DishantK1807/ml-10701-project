Grosz and Sidner's (1986) model of discourse interpretation is one where the same discourse elements are related simultaneously on the informational and intentional levels.

Lascarides and Asher (1991) use DICE to yield the discourse structures and temporal structures for simple discourses.

For instance, consider another discourse from Moore and Pollack (1992): 38 (2)a.
J92-4007
A logical framework in which all those plausible relations between constituents that are consistent with each other are inferred, such as a nonmonotonic logic like that in DICE (Lascarides and Asher, 1993a), would achieve this.

It is well reflected in this discourse from Moore and Pollack (1992): (1)a.

Lascarides and Asher (1991) introduce default rules representing the role of Gricean pragmatic maxims and domain knowledge in calculating the value of the update function (r, a, fl), which means "the representation fl of the current sentence is to be attached to a with a discourse relation, where a is an open node in the representation r of the text so far".

Moore and Pollack (1992) also discuss one of I's possible responses to (2): (4)We don't need to go to the hardware store.

I has sufficient information about the semantic content of a and fl to infer Result(a, fl), via a rule given in Lascarides and Asher (1991): • Result (if, a, fl) ^ fl)) > ResetS(a, fl) Resull(a, fl) has the Belief Property, and I reasons that from believing a, he will now come to believe ft.
P91-1008
We will extend the logical engine used to infer rhetorical relations--DiCE (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993a, 1993b, Lascarides and Oberlander 1993)--to model inferences about intentional structure and its interaction with informational structure.
E93-1030 E93-1031 P91-1008
Moore and Pollack (1992) show via discourse (2) that the current commitment to the nucleus-satellite distinction in RST precludes this.
