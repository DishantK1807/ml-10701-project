It has been shown in (Och et al., 2004) that true BLEU oracle scores on lists with much smaller n â‰¤ 4096 are more or less linear in log(n).

Many research groups use a decoder based on a log-linear approach incorporating phrases as main paradigm (Koehn et al., 2003).
N03-1017
In (Zens and Ney, 2005), an improved method is reported that overcomes some shortcomings, such as duplicate removal by determinization of the word graph (represented as a weighted finite state automaton) and efficient rest-cost estimation with linear time complexity.

work The idea of n-best list extraction from a word graph for SMT was presented in (Ueffing et al., 2002).
W02-1021
This is in contrast to a word graph, where a linear increment of its density yields disproportionately high improvements in oracle BLEU for lower densities (Zens and Ney, 2005).

Syntactic features were investigated in (Och et al., 2004) with moderate success.
