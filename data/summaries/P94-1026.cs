EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS A module realizing this scheme has been implemented and applied to the very setup used for the previous experiments with the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria, see \[Samuelsson 1994a\].

The resulting specialized grammar was compiled into LR parsing tables, and a special LR parser exploited their special properties, see \[Samuelsson 1994b\].

This has turned out to be possible -speedups compared to using the original grammar of in median 60 times were achieved at a cost in coverage of about ten percent, see \[Samuelsson 1994a\].1 Another benefit from the method is a decreased error rate when the system is required to select a preferred analysis.
