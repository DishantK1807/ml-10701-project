But Lascarides and Oberlander (1992a) urge that the temporal coherence of text is characterised in terms of, among other things, the stronger basic relation of causal proximity.

Now, on the one hand, Polanyi and Scha (1984), Hobbs (1985), and Thompson and Mann (1987) have argued that 'genre' or 'rhetorical schemata' can influence the relations used in discourse attachment.

The rules introduced below are shown in Lascarides and Asher (1991a) to be manifestations of Griceanstyle pragmatic maxims and world knowledge.

We also have laws relating the discourse structure to the topic structure (Asher, in press): for example, A Common Topic for Narrative states that any clauses related by Narration must have a distinct, common (and perhaps implicit) topic: â€¢ A Common Topic for Narrative Narration(a, fl) -* ^ ^ /3) ^ The hierarchical discourse structure is similar to that in Scha and Polanyi (1988): Elaboration and Explanation are subordinating relations and the others are coordinating ones.

We therefore first introduce a domain-specific contextual constraint, following Sibun, and then place it in a formal theory of discourse attachment called DICE, developed in Lascarides and Asher (1991a).
