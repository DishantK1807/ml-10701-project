uam. es Abstract This paper presents a gratmnar and style checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers developed within the project GramCheck.
Besides a brief grmnmar error typology for Spanish, a linguistically motivated approach to detection and diagnosis is presented, based on the generalized use of PROLOG extensions to highly typed unification-based grammars.
The demonstrator, currently including flfll coverage for agreement errors and certain head-argmnent relation issues, also provides correction by means of an analysis-transfer-synthesis cycle.
Finally, fltture extensions to the (:urrent system are discussed.
1 Introduction
Grammar checking stelnmed as a logical application from forlner attelni)ts to natural language.
ulMerstanding by comtmters.
Many of the NLU systems developed in the 70's indu(le(l a kind of error recovery Inechanisln ranging flom the treatment only of spelling e.rrors, PARRY (1)arkin son c't al., 1977), to tile inclusion also of incomplete int)ut containing some kind of ellipsis, LADDEll,/LIFEll (Hendrix et al., 1977).
The interest in the 80's begun to turn considering grammar checking as an enterprise of its own right (Carbonell & Hayes, 1983), (Ilayes & Mouradian, 1981), (Heidorn et al., 1982), (.lensen at al., 1983), though many of the approaches were still in I;t1(: NLU tradition ((\]harniak, 198a), (Granger, 1983), (Kwasny & Sondheimer, 1981), (Weischedel & Black, \]980), (Weisehedel & Sondheimer, 1983).
A 1985 Ovum report on nal;llral language applications (.lohnson, 1985) already identifies grammar and style checking as one of the seven major apt)lications of NLP.
Currently, every project in grammar checking has as its goal the creation of a writing aid rather than a robust man-machine interface (Adriaens, 1994), (llolioli ctal., 1992), (Vosse, 1992).
Current systems dealillg with grammatical deviance have be(m inainly involve(t in the integi~> don of special techniques to detect and correct, when possible, these, deviances.
In some case.s, these have be.en incorporated to traditional parsing techniques, as it is the case with feature relaxation in the context of unification-based formalisms (Bolioli et al., 1992), or the addition of a set of catching error rules si)ecially handling the deviant constructions (Thurlnair, 1990).
In other eases, the relaxation component has heen included as a new add-in feature to the parsing algoril,hm, as in the IBM's PLNLI' aI)proach (Heidorn et al., 1982), or in the work developed for tim Tra.nslator's Workbench t)roject using the METAL MTsystem (TWB, 1992).
Besides, an increasing concern in current projects is that of linguistic relevance of the analysis t)erformed by the grammar correction system.
In this sense, the adequate integration of error detection and correction techniques within mainstream grammm" formalisms has l)een addressed by a nunl|)er of these projects (\[Iolioli eta/., 1992), (Vosse, 1992), ((\]enthia.l ctal., t992), (O(~uthial et al., 1994).
l~bllowing this concern, this paper presents resuits fl'om the project GramCheck (A Grammar and Style Checker, MLAP93-11), flmded by the CEC.
GramCheck has developed a grammar checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers using ALEP (ET6/1, 1991), (Simpkins, 1994) as the NLP development platform, a client-server architeeUlre as implenmnted in the X Windows system, Motif as the 'look ~md fe, el' interface and Xminfo as the kllowh!dge t)ase, storage format.
Generalized use of extensions to the highly typed and unifi(:ation based formalism imi)Iemented in ALEP has been 1)erformed.
These extensions (called Constraint Solvers, CSs) are nothing but pieces of PR()I,OG code l)erforlning different l)oolean and relational operations over feature wdues.
Besides, GramCheck has used ongoing results Dora LS-GRAM (LRE61029), a project alining at the implementation of middle 175 coverage ALEP grammars for a number of European languages.
The demonstrator checks whether a document contains grammar errors or style weaknesses and, if found any, users are provided with messages, suggestions and, for grammar errors only, autoinatic correction(s).
2 Brief
grammar error typology for Spanish The linguistic statements made by developers of current grammar checkers based on NLP ted> niques are often contradictory regarding the types of errors that grammar checkers must correct automatically.
(Veronis, 1988) claims that native writers are unlikely to produce errors involving morphological features, while (Vosse, 1992) acce.t)ts such morpho-syntactic errors, in spite of tile fact that an examination of texts by the author revealed that their appearance in native writer's texts is not frequent.
Both authors agree in characterizing morpho-syntactic errors as a sainple of lack of competence.
On the other hand, an examination of real texts produced by Spanish writers revealed that they do produce morpho-syntactic errors I. Spanish is an inflectiolml language, which increases the possibilities of such exrors.
Nevertheless, other errors related to structural configuration of the language ark: produced as well.
Errors found fall into one of the following subtypes, assuming that featurization is the technique used in t)arsing sentences: 1.
Mislnatching of features that do It(it affect representational issues (intraor intersyntactic agreement on gender, number, person and cask' for categories showing this phenonmnon).
These mismatchings produce rto~?,St'l"ttct~K/'ttl e7"l'O~'S.
2. Mismatching of fl:atures which describe certain representational properties for categories, as wrong head-argument relations, word order and substitution of certain categories.
These mismatchings produce structural errors.
Table 1 shows rite percentages of diflhrent types of errors tbund in the corpus.
Punctuation errors must be considered as structural violations, while for style weaknesses, it depends on its subtype.
Errors at the lexical level are diflh:ult to classit~y and itios(; of them must regaMed as spelling rather than gralnlnar errors.
The nulnl)er of erroIs identiffed in this corpus is 543.
These statisti(:s couhl 1The corims used contains nearly 7(I,000 words including text fragments from literature, newspal)(:rs, technical and administradw: documentation.
It has been provided to a large extent by GramCheck pilot user, ANAYA, S.A. be regarded as a representative average of the fi'equency of errors/mistakes oc(:urring in Spanish texts.

A presupposition adopted in the project led to the idea that violations at the featm'e level can be capl:ured by means of the relaxation of the possibly violated features while violations at (;he level of configuration may not be relaxed withou(; raising unpredictable parsing results, thus being candidates for the implementation of explicit rules encoding such incorrect structures.
Under this view, a comprehensive gralnlnar checker must make use of both strategies, called in the literature feature or constraint relaxation and error anticipation, respectively.
However, given the relevance of features ill the encoding of linguistic information in TFSs, SOIIlO strllcttlral errors (;ail t)e re.analyzed as agrcelilent errors in a wide sense (as feature nfisma.tching violal;ions rather than structural ones).
This allows the implementatioll of a uniforn) apt)roach to grammar ('orrcction, thus a.voitting explicit rules for ill-formed illpUt.
This paI)er describes such ilnpleinentatioI~ for both Ilon-sl;rnctural and strltt:tura.I violations.

detection, diagnosis and correction techniques The overall strate.gy for detection, diagnosis and (:orre(;tion of gramnmr a,n(1 style errors wil;hin GramCheck relies on three axes: • For detection, a combined fcal, ure rela:,:atiorl, and error anticipation apI)roach is adopt(xl.
In order to iml)le.mcnt the former, extensiv(~ use of external CSs is performe(1 in the anal-ysis grammar, whereas for the latter, exl)licit rules, adequate.ly detined either in the core gralnlilar or in satellite, subgranlnlars~ are iml)lenmnte(l 2 . 2Gram(Hwck checks texts belonging I,o the s(;andard language and ix) the ~(hninisl;rativ(: subl~mguagc.

gmMer v~flue ot! the h('.ml a~ 1'7 7 the value which commands the whole phrase, the munber of elements that share the same feature values, if in contrast to those of the head and if the head takes its agreement properties from morphology --ie.
are susceptible of keystroke errors-, can influence the final decision.
Finally, for cases where equal scores are obtained, as it happens with a non-inherent masculine noun and a fen> inine determiner, both possible corrections should be pertbrmed, since there is not enough information so as to decide the correct value (unless this can be obtained from other agreeing elements in the sentence --for instance an attribute to this NP).
Basically, the final operation to be performed with the scores is to determine that the higher the score of an element the severer its substitution.
Thus, scores are clues for the correction of those elements having the lowest scores.
The initialization steps in order to perform the heuristic technique are related to the assignment of values and scores to lexical projections depending on its inherentness.
The values for gender and number of the head of the projection serve as a parameter for the computation of values and scores for the possible modifier which could appear closed to it.
Note that; agreement in Spanish is based on a binary value system.
Thus, the computation of values for the modifier of a given head simply relies on the instantiation of opposite values to those of the head.
In the case of underspecification of the head for gender, for instance, the presupposition is that this value is the same as the one of the modifier, if this is not underspecified.
Otherwise, both elements remain underspecified.
Besides, the weight given to controlling elements (50) ensures that there is no way for modifiers to overpass this score.
Note as well that the weight given to inherentless values, as number (10), ensures that there are no promoted elements in this calculation.
The following schematic CS illustrates the assignment of scores: and(=(Score'number'head,10), and( or (and (: (lnherm~t~ess'head,yes), = (Score'gender'head,50)), ~u~d(= (lnherel~tness'head,no), (Score'gender'head, 10))), =(Score'ntmlher'mod,0))) The following steps to be performed by CSs are related to the addition of all those scores associated to a given value in the successive rules building the nominal prbjection and the percolation of morphosyntaetic features: or( and(or(:((lender'head'mother,Oendcr'mod), --(Gendcr'mod,mase'fem)), and(num'add(MG\]gN 'SCOI,tF,'H I,\]A D, MGEN'SCORE'MOI), M(~ EN'SCORE' MOTI IP, I), and(= (Gender'mod'head,(lender'mod'mother), hum'add (It (I EN'SCO l/,\]'Y 11EAD, HGEN'SOOII,E'MOD, IlGEN'SCORE'MOTI\[EII~)))), alld(=(Gender'nmd,Gender'mod'head), and (nu re'add (H GEN'SCO IE'ftEA I), MCIEN'SCORE'MOD, HGEN'SOORE'MOTIIER), and(=(Gender'mod'head,Gendcr'mod'mothcr), num'add(MGEN'SCORE'HEAD, HGEN'SCOR, I~'MOD, MGEN'SCOI~E'MOTHER))))) The final evahlation performed by CSs is done when categories showing agreement overpass their maximal projection, only if no other inter-syntagmatic agreement must be taken into account (as it is the case with subject-attribute agreement, for instance).
Postponing in this way the final ewfluation ensures that the CS will take into account all the previous parameters to give an appropriate diagnosis about the complete XP containing the agreement violation.
This evaluation is based on the comparison of scores by means of the 'greater than' predicate in order to determine (a) the correct wflue for the feature(s) checked corresponding to the highest score(s) (Right_Gender, Right_Number in the example below), to be used by the transfer module, and (b) the error diagnosis (gender, number and gender_number below), to be used by the error handling module that will display appropriate error information to the user: 178 and( or( or (and (mun'gt (I 1 (I EN'S CO 1/.1,'" NO l \] N, M ('I,;NN (\]() It.I,;' N O U N), =:((-lender' N ram, ltlght' (hulder)), and (nuln' gl,(M C I'\]N'H(X) 11 E" N O U N,I 1 (I |,\]N'F,C\]O|I\]",' N O I l N), ~ ((lender' Mod,night'.

(iii) Addition of a p,'eposition resulting in a (:}tang(; of the subcategorized argmnent (NP/S,-} l)P) Las emprcsa.s dcma'ndan \[*dc\] 'm~!todo,s.
In the IIPSG-likc grammar used, bound prel)Ositions at(, considered NI's attached t() the subcat list (ie.
the subcategorization \]i:ature) of a t)re(lieative unit.
These NPs have the feature pform instantiated to the value of the preposition, if atty.
If the argmnent does not }lave a bound i)reposilion, the vahle for pform is none.
Thus, the approach adopted within GramCheck is that these err()r cases have a (;orrect rei)reselltation of the det)enden('y structure where the only offending infl)rmation is stored as a thature in the governed e.lement.
Tit(', linguistic principle behind the patternrelated t(;chni(tue is based on the fact that native writers substitute a l)reposition by another one when certain a,qsodations between 1)atterns, showing either the same }exi(:o-semantic and/or syntactic protmrtics, are performed.
Thus, this kind of error is not.
so a(:cidental as it could lm imagined.
t, br instance, Spanish speakers/writers usually associate the argument structure of the comtmrat(re adje(:tiv(~ it@riot (lower), which sul)catcgorizes the l)rei)osition a (to), with the Spanish (:omparative syntactic pattern (inches ...
que., less ...
than) whose second term is introduced by the conjun(:tion q*u', producing phrases such as *i'~@rior q'ae instead of i'nferior a.
With the verb relacionar' (to relate), something similar occurs: t;his verb sulmatcgorizes for t,he preposition con; however, due.
to the fact; that there exists tilt: prel)ositional multi-word units ~:n rclo, cidn a an(l c'n r('.lac.idn con, st)eakers tend to think that the same 1)ret)osiI;ional alternation can be 1)crfornm(t with tin,.

Following this idea, configurational ruh:s are regarded, R)r grammar dmcking, as desc:riptions of l)atl;erns~ each of them having associated a wrong pattern linked to the correct pattern.
Both pat;-terns are in a complementary distribution.
This way, structural errors can be foreseen and controlled, and the systeln is provi(led with a mechanism which establishes the way rule constraints lnust }to re}axed.
To cope with this error, a CS operating on lists (:he(ks whether the prel)osition in 1;tlo (:onstitu(mt attached to the predicative sign belongs to the head of the list or to the tail.

coverage The current version of the GrmnCheck demonstrator is able to deal with the following types of erI'OFH: • lntraand inter-syntagmatie agreement errors (gender att(l/or number in act, lye with both predicative and (:opu}ative verbs and passive sentences).
• Direct obje.cts: omission of tit(: preposition a with an animate entity and addition of such a preposition with a non-animate entity.
• Addition, omission and sul)stitution of a bomM prepositi(m covering what is (:a}}ed 179 deqne£smo the addition of a false bound preposition de with clausal arguments and quegsmo the omission of the bound preposition de with clausal arguments.
• Errors Oil portmanteau words (use.
de el, a el instead of del, a O.
Regarding style issues, three different types of weaknesses are detected: structural weaknesses, lexical weaknesses and abusive use of passive, gerunds and rammer adverbs.
While structural weaknesses are detected in tim phrase structure rules using CSs (noun + "a" + infinitive), by means of an error anticipation strategy, lexical weaknesses arc detected at the lexical level, with no st)octal mechanisms other than simple CSs.
Lexieal errors currently detected are related with the use of Latin words which it is better to avoid, foreign words with Spanish deriwttion, cognitive erl'ors, foreign words for which a Spanish word is recommended and verbosity.
5 Further
developments i,esults obtained with the cmTent demonst;rator are very promising.
The performance of the system using CSs is similm' to that shown widlout them, hence its us(; in conjunction with the detection techniques proposed, rather than a burden, may be seen as a means to add robustness to NLP systems.
In fact, CSs may provide more natural solutions to grammar implemental;ion issues, like PP-attachmellt control.
Several directions for further developments have a\]ready been defined.
These include the integration of these grammar checking techniques into the final release of the LS-GRAM Spanish grammar, which will have a more realistic coverage ill terms both of linguistic i)henomena and lexicon.
Besides, on this new version of the grammar, hybrid teehniques will be used, taking advantage of the preproco.ssing facilities included in ALEP.
In particular, while for errors like those presented in this paper the approach adopted is linguistically motivated, for certain imnctuation errors (or simply ill order to reduce lexi(:al arab*girl(y) other relatively simple iHeailS C~Lli be defined that illchide (:ertain extended pattern ma.tching on regular expressions or the passing of linguist*(: information gathered in a t)reproeessing phase to the unifh:ation-bas('.d parser.
It; is also foreseen to inchlde a treatlnent for own*tire spelling errors, usually not dealt with by conventional st)elling checkers.
