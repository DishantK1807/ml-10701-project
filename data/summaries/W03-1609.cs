In this experiment, we used a modified version of a Japanese Extended Named Entity tagger (Uchimoto et al., 2000).
P00-1042
First the system obtained a set of IE patterns from corpora (Sudo and Sekine, 2001), and then calculated the score for each candidate paraphrase by counting how many times that expression appears as an IE pattern in the whole corpus.
H01-1009
(Pang et al., 2003) also used text alignment and obtained a finite state automaton which generates paraphrases.
N03-1024
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) applied text alignment to parallel translations of a single text and used a part-of-speech tagger to obtain paraphrases.
P01-1008
(Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) used pairs of questions and answers to obtain varied patterns which give the same answer.
P02-1006
