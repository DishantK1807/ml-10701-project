Clark and Curran (2003) present a method for learning the parameters of a log-linear CCG parsing model from fully annotated normal–form parse trees.
W03-1013
Our models are similar to several other approaches (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 1999; Lafferty et al., 2001; Collins, 2004; Taskar et al., 2004).

In Step 3, a simple perceptron update (Collins, 2002) is performed.
W02-1001
Watkinson and Manandhar (1999) present an unsupervised approach for learning CCG lexicons that does not represent the semantics of the training sentences.
W99-0909
For example, consider the sentences shown in figure 1, which were taken from the ATIS travel-planning domain (Dahl et al., 1994).

of techniques have been considered including approaches based on machine translation techniques (Papineni et al., 1997; Ramaswamy and Kleindienst, 2000; Wong and Mooney, 2006), parsing techniques (Miller et al., 1996; Ge and Mooney, 2006), techniques that use inductive logic programming (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Thompson and Mooney, 2002; Tang and Mooney, 2000; Kate et al., 2005), and ideas from string kernels and support vector machines (Kate and Mooney, 2006; Nguyen et al., 2006).

In this sense it is related to the algorithm of Liang et al.(2006). However it has the additional twist of also performing grammar induction (lexical learning) in an online manner.
P06-1096
Bozsahin (1998) presents work on using CCG to model languages with free word order.
P98-1025
Bos et al.(2004) present an algorithm that learns CCG lexicons with semantics but requires fully–specified CCG derivations in the training data.
