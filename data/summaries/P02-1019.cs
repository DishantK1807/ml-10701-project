Individual Error Models The error model LTR was trained exactly as described originally by Brill and Moore (2000).
P00-1037
Brill and Moore (2000) showed that adding a source language model increases the accuracy significantly.
P00-1037
Brill and Moore (2000) present an improved error model for noisy channel spelling correction that goes beyond single insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions.
P00-1037
At ACL 2000, Brill and Moore (2000) introduced a new error model, allowing generic string-to-string edits.
