For example, van Noord (1991; 1994) suggests that the head-corner parsing strategy should be particularly well-suited for parsing with grammars that admit discontinuous constituency, illustrated with what he calls a "tiny" fragment of Dutch, but his more recent development of the head-corner parser (van Noord, 1997) only documents its use with purely concatenative grammars.

One type of parser that we believe to be particularly well-suited to this type of grammar is the head-corner parser, introduced by van Noord (1991; 1994) based on one of the parsing strategies explored by Kay (1989).

implementation of the head-corner parser adapts van Noord's (1997) parser to the ConTroll environment.

Reape uses bitstring codes for a tabular parsing algorithm, different from the head-corner algorithm used here, and attributes the original idea to Johnson (1985).
