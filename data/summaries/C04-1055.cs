The parser 2 Parseable utterances exclude utterances that are incomplete or ungrammatical (see (Tetreault et al., 2004).) is an agenda-driven best-first chart parser that supports experimentation with different parsing strategies, although in practice we almost always use a straightforward bi-directional bottom-up algorithm.

It has been reported that stochastic parsers degrade in performance on domains different than what they were trained on (Hwa, 1999; Gildea, 2001), so there really was an issue whether the output would be good enough.

The grammar computes a flattened and unscoped logical form using reified events (see also (Copestake et al., 1997) for a flat semantic representation), with many of its word senses derived from FrameNet frames (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000) and semantic roles (Fillmore, 1968).

the XLE system (Kaplan et al., 2004)) because there is insufficient training data and it is as yet unclear how such as model would perform at the detailed level of semantic representation produced by the TRIPS parser (see Figure 2 and discussion below).

The TRIPS structure generally has more levels of structure (roughly corresponding to levels in X-bar theory) than the Penn Treebank analyses (Marcus et al., 1993), in particular for base noun phrases.
