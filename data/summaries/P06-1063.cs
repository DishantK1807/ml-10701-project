Work on more radical domain variance and on adapting treebank-induced LFG resources to analyse ATIS (Hemphill et al., 1990) question material is described in Judge et al.(2005). The research established that even a small amount of additional training data can give a substantial improvement in question analysis in terms of both CFG parse accuracy and LFG grammatical functional analysis, with no signi cant negative effects on non-question analysis.

Clark et al.(2004) worked speci cally with question parsing to generate dependencies for QA with Penn-II treebank-based Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG’s).

We use the parser output tree in Figure 9(a) (without empty productions and coindexation) and automatically annotate the tree with f-structure information and compute LDD-resolution at the level of f-structure using the resources of Cahill et al.(2004). This generates the f-structure annotated tree6 and the LDD resolved f-structure in Figure 10.

The CCG 5500 questions come from a number of sources (Li and Roth, 2002) and some of these questions contain minor grammatical mistakes so that, in essence, this corpus is more representative of genuine questions that would be put to a working QA system.

Johnson (2002) presents a tree-based method for reconstructing LDD dependencies in PennII trained parser output trees.

Large treebanks are available for major languages, however these are often based on a speci c text type or genre, e.g. nancial newspaper text (the Penn-II Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993)).

In our work we use the f-structure-based method of Cahill et al.(2004) to reverse engineer empty productions, traces and coindexation in parser output trees.

Cahill et al.(2004) present a method for resolving LDDs 5Collins’ Model 3 computes a limited number of whdependencies in relative clause constructions.

Previous work on parser performance and domain variation by Gildea (2001) showed that by training a parser on the Penn-II Treebank and testing on the Brown corpus, parser accuracy drops by 5.7% compared to parsing the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) based Penn-II Treebank Section 23.
