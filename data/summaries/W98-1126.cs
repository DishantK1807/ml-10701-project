For example, one can ignore infrequent collocations entirely (e.g., Ng & Lee), consider only the single best property (e.g., Yarowsky 1993), or ignore negative evidence, i.e., the absence of a property (e.g., Hearst 1992).

The data consists of 2,544 main clauses from the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus (Marcus et al., 1993).

Ss. 4.1.1 Per-Class Method In the per-class method (also used by Ng and Lee 1996), a set of words, WordsCiSj, is selected for each combination of Class Ci and subproperty Sj.

In experiments performing an event categorization task, Wiebe et al.(1997a) co-varied four types of organization and three types of collocational property.

4.2.2 Over-Range Enumerated (ORe) This organization is used by, for example, Ng & Lee 1996.

Following are two organizations for each selection method (Wiebe et al.1997a). 4.2.1 Over-Range Binary (ORb) This organization is commonly used in NLP, for example by Gale et al.1992. A binary feature is defined for each word in each set WordsSj, l<j<s.

The experiments performed here use collocational properties defined in Wiebe et al.1997a to perform the event categorization task described in section 2.

Collocations Following are two methods for selecting collocation words of a given collocational property (Wiebe et al.1997a). Assume there are c classes, C1...

In fact, we experimented (using the CoCo search algorithm) with per-class variations not presented in Wiebe et al.(1997a), specifically with different sets of subproperties (e.g., PCe with s= 1).

For example, the constraint might be that the word must appear immediately to the right of the target word (see, for example, Ng & Lee 1996 and Bruce & Wiebe 1994); the actual collocations would be words that occur there.

(Hirschberg & Litman 1993)); and words that suggest states versus events (Siegel 1997).

In experiments performing an event categorization task, Wiebe et al.(1997a) found that different organizations are best for different properties.
