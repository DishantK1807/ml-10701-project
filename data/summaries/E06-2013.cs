Building English semantic parsers for the FrameNet standard has been studied widely (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004).

For all path features, we used both the traditional constituent parse tree path (as by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002)) and a dependency tree path (as by Ahn et al.(2004)). We produced the parse trees using the parser of Collins (1999).

Stage 2, most of them are well-known from previous literature on FE identification and labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004).

to FrameNet FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2003) is a comprehensive lexical database that lists descriptions of words in the frame-semantic paradigm (Fillmore, 1976).

Semantic parsers, which are typically based on the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or PropBank formalisms, have proven useful in a number of NLP projects, such as information extraction and question answering.
