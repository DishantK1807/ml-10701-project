Finally, given that our previous studies showed that preceding dialogue context may affect correction behavior (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001), we included a feature (diadist) reflecting the distance of the current turn from the beginning of the dialogue, and a set of features summarizing aspects of the prior dialogue: for the latter features, we included both the number of times prior turns exhibited certain characteristics (e.g.
N01-1027
We also found that user corrections of system misrecognitions exhibit certain typical prosodic features, which can be used to identify such turns (Swerts et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2001).
N01-1027
We represent each user turn using the feature set shown in Figure 2, which we previously found useful for predicting corrections (Hirschberg et al., 2001).
N01-1027
These findings are consistent with previous research showing that corrections tend to be hyperarticulated â€” higher, louder, longer...than other turns (Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al., 1996; Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999).
P98-1122
In particular, we found that prosodic features, in combination with other information already available to the recognizer, can distinguish user turns that are misrecognized by the system far better than traditional methods used in ASR rejection (Litman et al., 2000; Hirschberg et al., 2000).
