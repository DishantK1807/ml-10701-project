Events Paralleling work in summarization, it is hypothesized that the quality of a rewritten story can be defined by the presence or absence of “semantic content units” that are crucial details of the text that may have a variety of syntactic forms (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).

as Events We represent a story as a sequence of events, p1...ph, represented as a list of predicatearguments, similar to the event calculus (Mueller, 2003).

The application of a series of rules, mainly mapping verbs to predicate names and nouns to arguments, to the results of the chunker produces events from chunks as described in our previous work (McNeill et al., 2006).

This task is reminiscent of the well-known “War of the Ghosts” experiment used in psychology for studying memory (Bartlett, 1932) and related to work in fields such as summarization (Lemaire et al., 2005) and narration (Halpin et al., 2004).

Unlike previous work, the use of both the plot comparison results and LSA did not improve performance for Naive Bayes, so the results of using Naive Bayes with both are not reported (Halpin et al., 2004).

This leads a traditional parsing system with a direct mapping from the parse tree to a semantic representation to fail to achieve a parse on 35% percent of the stories, and as such could not be used (Bos et al., 2004).
