YamCha is a powerful tool for sequence labeling(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).

For all languages, our system provided better results than average performance of all the systems(Nivre et al., 2007).
D07-1096
As described in (McDonald et al., 2006), we treat the labeling of dependencies as a sequence labeling problem.
W06-2932
At the second stage, we use a SVM-based approach(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) to tag the dependency label for each arc.

We took part the Multilingual Track of all ten languages provided by the CoNLL-2007 shared task organizers(Hajiˇc et al., 2004; Aduriz et al., 2003; Mart´ı et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2003; B¨ohmov´a et al., 2003; Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Prokopidis et al., 2005; Csendes et al., 2005; Montemagni et al., 2003; Oflazer et al., 2003). In this paper, we describe a two-stage parsing system consisting of an unlabeled parser and a sequence labeler, which was submitted to the Multilingual Track.

The CoNLL-2007 shared tasks include two tracks: the Multilingual Track and Domain Adaptation Track(Nivre et al., 2007).
D07-1096
(Chen et al., 2006) defined the special features for coordinations for chunking.
