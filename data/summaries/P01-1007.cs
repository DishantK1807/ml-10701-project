As already noted by many authors (see for example (Carroll, 1994)), the choice of a (parsing) algorithm, as far as its throughput is concerned, cannot rely only on its theoretical complexity but must also take into account practical experiments.
P94-1040
In particular, experiments with regular approximation of CFLs related in (Nederhof, 2000) show that most reported methods are not practical for large CF grammars, because of the high costs of obtaining the minimal DFSA.

Moreover, this guiding structure is (part of) the usual parse forest output by the guiding parser, without any transduction (see for example in (Nederhof, 1998) how a FSA can guide a CF parser).
