Nobata et al.(1999) and Collier et al.(2000) trained their model with only 100 annotated paper abstracts from the MEDLINE database (National Library of Medicine, 1999), and Yamada et al.(2000) used only 77 annotated paper abstracts.

Several representations to encode region information are proposed and examined (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).

Vector Machines Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) are powerful methods for learning a classifier, which have been applied successfully to many NLP tasks such as base phrase chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) and part-of-speech tagging (Nakagawa et al., 2001).

A polynomial function defined as (sxi x j + r)d is popular in applications of SVMs to NLPs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Yamada et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), because it has an intuitively sound interpretation that each dimension of the mapped space is a 3For many real-world problems where the samples may be inseparable, we allow the constraints are broken with some penalty.

“Thus, CIITAPROTEIN not only activates the expression of class II genesDNA but recruits another B cell-specific coactivator to increase transcriptional activity of class II promotersDNA in B cellsCELLTYPE.” Machine learning approach has been applied to biomedical named entity recognition (Nobata et al., 1999; Collier et al., 2000; Yamada et al., 2000; Shimpuku, 2002).

Another reason for low accuracies is that biomedical named entities are essentially hard to recognize using standard feature sets compared with the named entities in newswire articles (Nobata et al., 2000).

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) and Maximum Entropy (ME) method (Berger et al., 1996) are powerful learning methods that satisfy such requirements, and are applied successfully to other NLP tasks (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000; Nakagawa et al., 2001; Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

We use the maximum entropy tagging method described in (Kazama et al., 2001) for the experiments, which is a variant of (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) modified to use HMM state features.

Even with a more feasible method, pairwise (Kreßel, 1998), which is employed in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), we cannot train a classifier in a reasonable time, because we have a large number of samples that belong to the non-entity class in this formulation.
