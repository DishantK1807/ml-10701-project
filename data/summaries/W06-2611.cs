This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexicon that is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin classification called Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).
P98-1046
The newly created knowledge base allows us to surpass the shortcomings that arise when FrameNet, VerbNet and PropBank are used separately while, at the same time, we benefit from the extensive research involving each of them (Pradhan et al., 2004; Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004).

A very recent example in this sense was provided by the CONLL 2005 Shared Task on PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) role labeling (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005).

The sentences were processed using Charniak’s parser (Charniak, 2000) to generate parse trees automatically.

The kernel that we employed in our experiments is based on the SCF structure devised in (Moschitti, 2004).
P04-1043
A very good candidate seems to be the Intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998) that can be found as well in other predicate resources like PropBank and VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2000).
P98-1046
Several models have been developed for the automatic detection of the frame elements based on the FrameNet corpus (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003; Litkowski, 2004).

Also from these 321 frames only 100 were considered to have enough training data and were used in Senseval-3 (see Litkowski, 2004 for more details).

These are the initial features adopted by Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) (henceforth G&J) for both frame element identification and role classification.
J02-3001
On the FrameNet (Johnson et al., 2003) role labeling task, the Senseval-3 competition (Litkowski, 2004) registered similar results (~80%) by using the gold frame information as a given feature.
W04-0803
Also, we considered some of the features designed by (Pradhan et al., 2004): First and Last Word/POS in Constituent, Subcategorization, Head Word of Prepositional Phrases and the Syntactic Frame feature from (Xue and Palmer, 2004).
W04-3212
Based on our observation and previous studies (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), we assume that each Levin class has a distinct frequency distribution of roles on different grammatical slots.
