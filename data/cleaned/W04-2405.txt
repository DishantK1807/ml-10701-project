Co-training and Self-training for Word Sense Disambiguation Rada Mihalcea Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of North Texas rada@cs.unt.edu Abstract This paper investigates the application of cotraining and self-training to word sense disambiguation.
Optimal and empirical parameter selection methods for co-training and self-training are investigated, with various degrees of error reduction.
A new method that combines cotraining with majority voting is introduced, with the effect of smoothing the bootstrapping learning curves, and improving the average performance.
1 Introduction
The task of word sense disambiguation consists in assigning the most appropriate meaning to a polysemous word within a given context.
Most of the efforts in solving this problem were concentrated so far towards supervised learning, where each sense tagged occurrence of a particular word is transformed into a feature vector, which is then used in an automatic learning process.
While these algorithms usually achieve the best performance, as compared to their unsupervised or knowledge-based alternatives, there is an important shortcoming associated with these methods: their applicability is limited only to those words for which sense tagged data is available, and their accuracy is strongly connected to the amount of labeled data available at hand.
In this paper, we investigate methods for building sense classifiers when only relatively few annotated examples are available.
We explore bootstrapping methods using co-training and self-training, and evaluate their performance on the SENSEVAL-2 nouns.
We show that classifiers built for different words have different behavior during the bootstrapping process.
If the right parameters for co-training and self-training can be identified (growth size, pool size, and number of iterations, as explained later in the paper), an average error reduction of 25.5% is achieved, with similar performance observed for both co-training and self-training.
However, with empirical settings, the error reduction is significantly smaller, with a 9.8% error rate reduction achieved for a new method that combines co-training with majority voting.
We first overview the general approach of bootstrapping for natural language learning using co-training and self-training.
We then introduce the problem of supervised word sense disambiguation, and define several local and topical basic classifiers.
We investigate the applicability of co-training and self-training to supervised word sense disambiguation, starting with these basic classifiers, and perform comparative evaluations of optimal and empirical bootstrapping parameter settings.
2 Co-training and Self-training for Natural Language Learning Co-training and self-training are bootstrapping methods that aim to improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by incorporating large amounts of unlabeled data into the training data set.
2.1 Co-training Starting with a set of labeled data, co-training algorithms (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) attempt to increase the amount of annotated data using some (large) amounts of unlabeled data.
Shortly, co-training algorithms work by generating several classifiers trained on the input labeled data, which are then used to tag new unlabeled data.
From this newly annotated data, the most confident predictions are sought, and subsequently added to the set of labeled data.
The process may continue for several iterations.
In natural language learning, co-training was applied to statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001), reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2003), part of speech tagging (Clark et al., 2003), and others, and was generally found to bring improvement over the case when no additional unlabeled data are used.
One important aspect of co-training consists in the relation between the views used in learning.
In the original definition of co-training, (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) state conditional independence of the views as a required criterion for co-training to work.
In recent work, (Abney, 2002) shows that the independence assumption can be relaxed, and co-training is still effective under a weaker independence assumption.
He is proposing a greedy algorithm to maximize agreement on unlabelled data, which produces good results in a co-training experiment for named entity classification.
Moreover, (Clark et al., 2003) show that a naive co-training process that does not explicitly seek to maximize agreement on unlabelled data can lead to similar performance, at a much lower computational cost.
In this work, we apply co-training by identifying two different feature sets based on a “local versus topical” feature split, which represent potentially independent views for word sense classification, as shown in Section 4.
2.2 Self-training While there is a common agreement on the definition of co-training, the literature provides several sometimes conflicting definitions for self-training.
(Ng and Cardie, 2003) define self-training as a “single-view weakly supervised algorithm”, build by training a committee of classifiers using bagging, combined with majority voting for final label selection.
(Clark et al., 2003) provide a different definition: self-training is performed using “a tagger that is retrained on its own labeled cache on each round”.
We adopt this second definition, which also agrees with the definition given in (Nigam and Ghani, 2000).
Self-training starts with a set of labeled data, and builds a classifier, which is then applied on the set of unlabeled data.
Only those instances with a labeling confidence exceeding a certain threshold are added to the labeled set.
The classifier is then retrained on the new set of labeled examples, and the process continues for several iterations.
Notice that only one classifier is required, with no split of features.
Figure 1 illustrates the general bootstrapping process.
Starting with a set of labeled and unlabeled data, the bootstrapping algorithm aims to improve the classification performance, by integrating examples from the unlabeled data into the labeled data set.
At each iteration, the class distribution in the labeled data is maintained, by keeping a constant ratio across classes between already labeled examples and newly added examples; the role of this step is to avoid introducing imbalance in the training data set.
For co-training, the algorithm requires two different views (two different classifiers a0a2a1 and a0a4a3 ) that interact in the bootstrapping process.
By limiting the number of views to one (one general classifier a0a2a1 ), co-training is transformed into a self-training process, where one single classifier learns from its own output.

a8 Pool size (P) Number of examples selected from the unlabeled set U for annotation at each iteration.
a8 Growth size (G) Number of most confidently labeled examples that are added at each iteration to the set of labeled data L.
As previously noticed (Ng and Cardie, 2003), there is no principled method for selecting optimal values for these parameters, which is an important disadvantage of these algorithms.
In the following, we show that there is a big gap between the performance achieved for some optimal parameter settings, selected through measurements performed on the test data, and the performance level when these parameters are set empirically, suggesting that more research is required to narrow this gap, and make these bootstrapping algorithms useful for practical applications.
First, we describe the general framework of supervised word sense disambiguation, and introduce several basic sense classifiers that are used in co-training and selftraining experiments.
Next, through several experiments, (1) we determine the optimal parameter settings for cotraining and self-training, and (2) explore various algorithms for empirical selection of these three parameters for best performance.
3 Supervised
Word Sense Disambiguation Supervised word sense disambiguation systems work under the assumption that several annotated examples are available for a target ambiguous word.
These examples are used to build a classifier that automatically learns clues useful for the disambiguation of the given polysemous word, and then applies these clues to the classification of new unlabeled instances.
First, the examples are pre-processed and annotated with morphological or syntactic tags.
Next, each sensetagged example is transformed into a feature vector, suitable for an automatic learning process.
There are two main decisions that one takes in the construction of such a classifier: (1) What features to extract from the examples provided, to best model the behavior of the given ambiguous word; (2) What learning algorithm to use for best performance.
3.1 Preprocessing
During preprocessing, SGML tags are eliminated, the text is tokenized and annotated with parts of speech.
Collocations are identified using a sliding window approach, where a collocation is considered to be a sequence of words that forms a compound concept defined in WordNet.
During this process, all collocations that include the target word are identified, and the examples that use a collocation are removed from the training/test data.
For instance, examples referring to short circuit are removed from the data set for circuit, so that a separate learning process is performed for each lexical unit.

3.2 Features
that are good indicators of word sense Previous work on word sense disambiguation has acknowledged several local and topical features as good indicators of word sense.
These include surrounding words and their part of speech tags, collocations, keywords in contexts.
More recently, other possible features have been investigated: bigrams, named entities, syntactic features, semantic relations with other words in context.
Table 1 lists commonly used features in word sense disambiguation (list drawn from a larger set of features compiled by (Mihalcea, 2002)).
3.3 Supervised
learning for word sense disambiguation Related work in supervised word sense disambiguations includes experiments with a variety of learning algorithms, with varying degrees of success, including Bayesian learning, decision trees, decision lists, memory based learning, and others.
(Yarowsky and Florian, 2002) give a comprehensive examination of learning methods and their combination.
3.4 Basic
Classifiers for Word Sense Disambiguation Several basic word sense disambiguation classifiers can be implemented using feature combinations from Table 1, and feature vectors can be plugged into any learning algorithm.
We use Naive Bayes, since it was previously shown that in combination with the features we consider, can lead to a state-of-the-art disambiguation system (Lee and Ng, 2002).
Moreover, Naive Bayes is particularly suitable for co-training and self-training, since it provides confidence scores and is efficient in terms of training and testing time.
The two separate views required for co-training are defined using a local versus topical feature split.
For selftraining, a global classifier with no feature split is defined.
A local classifier A local classifier was implemented using all local features listed in Table 1.
A topical classifier The topical classifier relies on features extracted from a large context, in particular keywords specific to each individual sense.
We use the SK feature, and extract at most ten keywords for each word sense, each occurring for at least three times in the annotated corpus.
A global classifier Finally, the global classifier integrates all local and topical features, also in a Naive Bayes classifier.
This classifier is basically a combination of the previous two local and topical classifiers.
4 Co-training and Self-training for Word Sense Disambiguation We investigate the application of co-training and selftraining to the problem of supervised word sense disambiguation, and explore methods for selecting values for the bootstrapping parameters.
The data set used in this study consists in training and test data made available during the English lexical sample task in the SENSEVAL-2 evaluation exercise.
In addition to these data sets, a large raw corpus of unlabeled examples is constructed for each word, with text snippets consisting of three consecutive sentences extracted from the British National Corpus.
Given the large number of runs performed for each word, the experiments focus on nouns only.
Similar observations are however expected to hold for other parts of speech.
For co-training, we use the local and topical classifiers described in Section 3.4, which represent two different views for this problem, generated by a “local versus topical” feature split.
Self-training requires only one basic classifier, and we use a global classifier, which combines the features from both local and topical views for a complete global “view”.
Unlike previous applications of co-training and selftraining to natural language learning, where one general classifier is build to cover the entire problem space, supervised word sense disambiguation implies a different classifier for each individual word, resulting eventually in thousands of different classifiers, each with its own characteristics (learning rate, sensitivity to new examples, etc.).
Given this heterogeneous space of classifiers, our hypothesis is that co-training and self-training will themselves have a heterogeneous behavior, and therefore best co-training and self-training parameters are different for each classifier.
To explore this hypothesis, a range of experiments is performed.
First, for all the words in the experimental data set, an optimal parameter setting is determined.
This can be considered as an upper bound for improvements achieved with co-training and self-training, since the selection of parameters is performed through measurements that are collected directly on test data.
Second, we explore several algorithms to select the bootstrapping parameters, independent of the test set: (1) Best overall parameter setting; (2) Best individual parameter settings; (3) Best perword parameter selection; (4) A new method consisting in an improved bootstrapping scheme using majority voting across several bootstrapping iterations.
4.1 Optimal
settings Optimal parameter settings are determined through measurements performed directly on the test set.
For the growth size G, a value is chosen from the set: a0 1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, 200 a1 . The pool size P takes one of these values: a0 1, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000 a1 . For each setting, 40 iterations are performed.
This results in an average of 2,120 classification runs per word.
At each run, a pool of P raw examples is annotated, and G most confidently labeled examples are added to the training set from the previous iteration.
The performance of the classifier using the augmented training set is evaluated on the test data, and the precision is recorded.
Separate experiments are performed for both cotraining and self-training, for all the nouns in the SENSEVAL-2 data set (for a total of about 120,000 runs).
For each word, the parameter setting (growth size G / pool size P / iterations I) leading to the highest improvement is determined.
Table 21 lists, for each word: size of training, test, raw data2; precision of the basic classifier (the global classifier is used as a baseline); maximum precision obtained with co-training and self-training, and the parameters for which this maximum is achieved.
When several parameter settings lead to the same performance, the first setting is recorded.
Discussion Surprisingly, under optimal settings, both co-training and self-training perform about the same, leading to an average error reduction of 25.5%.
Self-training leads to the highest precision for nine words, while co-training is winning for eight words; there is a tie with equal performance for both co-training and self-training for the remaining twelve words.
There are three words (chair, holiday, spade) for which no improvement could be obtained with either co-training or self-training, and therefore no optimal setting is indicated.
These are among the four words with the best performing basic classifier (baseline higher than 75%).
The fact that no improvement was obtained agrees with previous observations that classifiers that are too accurate cannot be improved with bootstrapping (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).
Note that even very weak classifiers, with precisions below 40%, can still be improved, sometimes with as much as 45% error reduction (e.g.
the classifier for feeling).
There are no clear commonalities between the parameters leading to maximum precision for different classifiers.
Some classifiers benefit more from an “aggressive” augmentation of the training data with new examples – for instance the self-trained classifier for nature achieves its highest peak for a growth size of 200 from a pool of 500 examples.
Others instead work better by taking “short steps” – for instance self-training for the word dyke works better for a growth size of 1 from a pool of 1.
1The numbers listed in Table 2 for training/test data size and basic classifier precision refer to data sets obtained after removing examples with collocations that include the target word.
This explains why the numbers do not always match figures previously reported in SENSEVAL-2 literature.
If collocations are added back to the data sets, the precision of the basic classifier is measured at 60.2% – comparable to figures obtained by other systems participating in SENSEVAL-2 2The raw corpus for each word is formed with all examples retrieved from the British National Corpus.
While this ensures a natural distribution for each word (in terms of number of examples occurring in a balanced corpus), it also leads to discrepancies in terms of raw data size.
For words with less than 5000 raw examples, the pool size recorded in the “optimal setting”’ column represents a round-up to the nearest number from the set of allowed pool values.

The optimal settings column lists the values for the three parameters (growth size G / pool size P / iteration I) for which the maximum precision was observed.
The improvements obtained under these optimal settings can be considered as an upper bound for self-training and co-training.
Under some ideal conditions, where the optimal parameters can be identified, this is the highest improvement that can be achieved for the given labeled set.
However, most of the times, it may not be possible to find these optimal parameter values.
In the following, we explore empirical solutions for finding values for these parameters, independent of the test data.
4.2 Empirical
Settings The methods described in this section make use of the data collected during self-training and co-training runs, for different parameter settings.
Evaluations are performed on a validation set consisting of about 20% of the training data – which was set apart for this purpose.
For each run, information is collected about: initial size of labeled data set, growth size, pool size, iteration number, precision of basic classifier, precision of boosted classifier.
With the range of values for growth size, pool size, and number of iterations specified in Section 4.1, about 60,000 such records are collected for both co-training and self-training.
4.2.1 Best
overall parameter setting One simple method to select a parameter setting is to determine a global setting that leads to the highest overall boost in precision.
Starting with the information collected for the 60,000 runs, for each possible parameter setting, the total relative growth in performance is determined, by adding up the relative improvements for all the runs for that particular setting.
For co-training, the best global setting identified in this way is growth size of 50, pool size of 5000, iteration 2.
For self-training, the best setting is growth size of 1, pool size of 1500, iteration 2.
The precision obtained for these settings is listed in Table 3 under the global settings column.
On average, using this scheme for parameter selection, co-training brings 4% error reduction, while self-training has only a small error reduction of 1%.
In a similar approach, the value for each parameter is determined independent of the other parameters.
Instead of selecting the best value for all parameters at once, values are selected individually.
Again, for each possible parameter value, the total relative growth in performance is determined, and the value leading to the highest growth is selected.

The average results are however worse than the baseline – only 53.49% for co-training, and 53.67% for self-training.
4.2.2 Best
per-word parameter setting In a second experiment, best parameter settings are identified separately for each word.
The setting yielding to maximum precision on the validation set is selected as the best setting for a given word, and evaluated on the test data.
If multiple settings are identified as leading to maximum precision, settings are prioritized based on (in this order): smallest growth size; largest pool size; number of iterations.
Results for both co-training and self-training are listed in Table 3 under the per-word settings column, together with the setting identified as optimal on the validation set.
There are several words for which significant improvement is observed over the baseline.
However, on the average, the performance of the boosted classifiers is worse than the baseline.
4.2.3 Smoothed
co-training and self-training with majority voting There is a common trend observed for learning curves for co-training or self-training, consisting in an increase in performance followed by a decline.
Different classifiers exhibit however a different point of raise or decline in precision, depending on the number of iterations.
For instance, the classifier for circuit achieves its highest peak at iteration 10 (see Table 2), while the classifier for nation has the highest boost at iteration 21 – where the performance for circuit is already below the baseline.
Given this heterogeneous behavior, it is difficult to identify a point of maximum for each classifier, or at least a point where the performance is not below the baseline.
Ideally, we would like the learning curves to have a more stable behavior – without sharp raises or drops in precision, and with larger intervals with constant performance, so that the chance of selecting a good number of iterations for each classifier is increased.
We introduce a new bootstrapping scheme that combines co-training or self-training with majority voting.
During the bootstrapping process, the classifier at each iteration is replaced with a majority voting scheme applied to all classifiers constructed at previous iterations.
This change has the effect of “smoothing” the learning curves: it slows down the learning rate, but also yields a larger interval with constant high performance3.
3Notice that in smoothed co-training, majority voting is applied on classifiers consisting of iterations of the co-training process itself, and therefore voting is applied on bootstrapped clas35 40 45 50 55 60 65 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Precision (%) Number of iterations Learning curves for simple and smoothed co-training simple co-training smoothed co-training baseline Figure 2: Learning curves for the classifier for the noun authority: baseline, simple co-training, and co-training smoothed with majority voting.
To some extent, smoothed co-training is related to boosting, since both algorithms rely on a growing ensemble of classifiers trained on resamples of the data.
However, boosting assumes labeled data and is error-driven, whereas smoothed co-training combines both labeled and unlabeled data and is confidence-driven4.
Figure 2 shows the learning curves for simple cotraining, and co-training “smoothed” with majority voting, for the word authority (for a growth size of 1 and pool size of 1).
Notice that the trend for the smoothed curve is still the same – a raise, followed by a decline – but at a significantly lower pace.
With smoothed co-training, any number of iterations selected in the interval 5-40 still leads to significant improvement over the baseline, unlike the simple unsmoothed curve, where only iterations in the range 3-10 bring improvement over the baseline (followed by two other iterations at random intervals).
The methods for global parameter settings and perword parameter settings are evaluated again, this time using smoothed co-training or self-training.
Table 4 lists the results obtained with basic and smoothed co-training for the same global/per-word setting.
Since the majority voting scheme requires an odd number of classifiers, sifiers across co-training iterations, with the effect of improving the performance of basic co-training.
This is fundamentally different from the approach proposed in (Ng and Cardie, 2003), where they also apply majority voting in a bootstrapping framework, but in a different setting.
They use a majority voting scheme applied to classifiers build on subsets of the labeled data (bagging) to induce several views for the co-training process.
In their approach, majority voting is used at each co-training iteration to enable co-training by predicting labels on unlabeled data.

The same type of experiments were also performed for self-training, but the majority voting scheme did not bring any significant improvements.
We believe that the learning curves for self-training are less steep, and therefore majority voting applied to classifiers across various iterations does not have the same strong smoothing effect as with co-training.
Discussion For parameter selection using global settings (Table 3) cotraining improves over the basic classifiers, and outperforms self-training.
As previously noticed (Nigam and Ghani, 2000), it is hard to identify conditionally independent views for real-data problems.
Even though we use a “local versus topical” feature split, which divides the features into two separate views on sense classification, there might be some natural dependencies between the features, since they are extracted from the same context, which may weaken the independence condition, and may sometime make the behavior of co-training similar to a self-training process.
However, as theoretically shown in (Abney, 2002), and then empirically in (Clark et al., 2003), co-training still works under a weaker independence assumption, and the results we obtain concur with these previous observations.
Despite the fact that parameters observed for optimal settings (Table 2) are different for each classifier, in empirical settings, one unique set of parameters for all classifiers seems to perform better than an individual set of parameters customized to each word.
The bootstrapping scheme is improved even more when coupled with majority voting across various iterations.
Overall, the highest error reduction is achieved with smoothed co-training using global parameter settings, where an average error reduction of 9.8% is observed with respect to the basic classifier.
A comparative analysis of words that benefit from basic/smoothed co-training with global parameter settings, versus words with little or no improvement obtained through bootstrapping reveals several observations: (1) Words with accurate basic classifiers cannot be improved through co-training, which agrees with previous observations (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).
For instance, no improvement was obtained for chair, holiday, or spade, which have the basic classifier performing above 75%.
(2) Words with high number of senses (e.g.
bar – 10 senses, channel – 7 senses, grip – 11 senses) achieve minimal improvements through co-training.
This is probably explained by the fact that the classifiers are misled by the large number of classes (senses), and a large number of errors is introduced since the early stages of co-training.
(3) Words that have a large number of senses not belonging to well-defined topical domains show little or no benefit from a bootstrapping procedure.
Using the domains attached to word senses, as introduced in (Magnini et al., 2002), we observed that words that have a large subset of their senses not belonging to a specific domain (e.g.
restraint, facility) achieve little or no improvement through co-training, which is perhaps explained again by the noisy automatic annotation that introduces errors since the early iterations of co-training.
Even though not all words show benefit from cotraining, smoothed co-training with global parameter settings does bring an overall error reduction of 9.8% with respect to the basic classifier, which proves that bootstrapping through co-training is a potentially useful technique for word sense disambiguation.
5 Conclusion
This paper investigated the application of co-training and self-training to supervised word sense disambiguation.
If the right parameters for co-training and self-training can be identified for each individual classifier, an average error reduction of 25.5% is achieved, with similar performance observed for both co-training and self-training.
Given that these optimal settings cannot always be identified in practical applications, several algorithms for empirical parameter selection were investigated: global settings determined as the best set of parameters across all classifiers, and per-word settings, identified separately for each classifier, both using a validation set.
An improved cotraining method was also introduced, that combines cotraining with majority voting, with the effect of smoothing the learning curves, and improving the average performance.
This improved co-training algorithm, applied with a global parameter selection scheme, brought a significant error reduction of 9.8% with respect to the basic classifier, which shows that co-training can be successfully employed in practice for bootstrapping sense classifiers.
