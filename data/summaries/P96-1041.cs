Smoothing is a technique essential in the construction of n-gram language models, a staple in speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer, 1983) as well as many other domains (Church, 1988; Brown et al., 1990; Kernighan, Church, and Gale, 1990).

In addition, it would be interesting to see whether these results extend to fields other than language modeling where smoothing is used, such as prepositional phrase attachment (Collins and Brooks, 1995), part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988), and stochastic parsing (Magerman, 1994).

They present a class of smoothing models that involve linear interpolation, e.g., Brown et al.(1992) take i--1 PML(Wi IWi-n+l) "Iv ~Wi__ 1 i--1 i-n-\]-I P~ /W i-1, (1-)~to~-~ ) inte~pt i wi_n+2) (3) i-u-I-1 That is, the maximum likelihood estimate is interpolated with the smoothed lower-order distribution, which is defined analogously.
