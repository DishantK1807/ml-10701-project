While DEP has been described in general terms before (Byrd et al., 1987; Neff eta/., 1988), this paper draws on our experience in parsing the Collins German-English / Collins English-German (CGE/CEG) and LDOCE dictionaries, which represent two very different types of machinereadable sources vis-~t-vis format of the typesetting tapes and notational conventions exploited by the lexicographers.

Two principles ate at work here: meiintaining implicit e~dence of synonymy among terms in the target langtmge responds to the "do not discard anything" philosophy; placing common data items as high as possible in the tree (the 'Peter-minus-1 princaple') is in the spirit of Flickinger et al.(1985), and implements the notion of placing a t~al node at the hi~.

Ideally, all MRD's should be mapped onto LDB structures of the same type, accessible with a sin~le query language that preserves the user s intuition about tile structure of lexical data (Neff et a/., 1988; Tompa, 1986), Dictionary entries can be naturally represented as shallov~ hierarchies with a variable number of instances of certain items at each level, e.g. multiple homographs within an entry or multiple senses within a homograph.

Within the taxonomy of normal forms .(NF) defreed by relational data base theo~, dictionary entries are 'unnormalized relations in which attributes can contain other relations, rather than simple scalar values; LDB's, therefore, cannot be correctly viewed as relational data bases (see Neff et al., 1988).
