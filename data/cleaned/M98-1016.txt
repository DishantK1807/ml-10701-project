DESCRIPTION OF THE KENT RIDGE DIGITAL LABS SYSTEM USED FOR MUC-7 Shihong Yu, Shuanhu Bai and Paul Wu Kent Ridge Digital Labs 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace Singapore 119613 Email: shyu@krdl.org.sg, bai@krdl.org.sg, paulwu@krdl.org.sg BASIC OF THE SYSTEM We aim to build a single simple framework for tasks in text information extraction, for which, to a certain extent, the required information can be resolved locally.
Our system is statistics-based.
As usual, language model is built from training corpus.
This is the so-called learning process.
Much e#0Bort has been spent to absorb domain knowledge in the language model in a systematic and generic way, because the system is designed not for one particular task, but for general local information extraction.
For the information extraction part #28tagging#29, the system consists of the following modules: #0F Sentence segmentor and tokenizer.
This module accepts a stream of characters as input, and transforms it into a sequence of sentences and tokens.
The way of tokenization can vary with di#0Berent tasks and domains.
For example, most English text is tokenized in the same way, while tokenization in Chinese itself is a research topic.
#0F Text analyzer.
This module provides analysis necessary for the particular task, be it semantic, syntactic, orthographic, etc.
This same analyzer is also applied in the learning process.
#0F Hypothesis generator.
The possibilities for each word #28token#29 are determined.
Rules can be captured by letting one word have one choice, as is the case in the recognition of time, date, money and percentage terms for the Chinese Named Entity #28NE#29 task.
These are identi#0Ced by pattern matching rules.
#0F Disambiguation module.
This is essentially implementation of Viterbi algorithm.
All the above modules will be described in detail in the following sections.
TEXT INFORMATION EXTRACTION TO TAGGING First of all, a brief of the modeling of the problem is in order.
Each word in text is assigned a tag, information can then be obtained from tags of all words.
For example, for the English NE task, Example 1: The#2FBritish#2Fballoon#2F-,#2Fcalled#2Fthe#2FVirgin#2FGlobal#2FChallenger#2F-,#2Fis#2Fto#2Fbe#2F#0Down#2Fby#2FRichard#2FPERSON Branson#2FPERSON,#2Fchairman#2Fof#2FVirgin#2FORG Atlantic#2FORG Airways#2FORG ;#2FGrouping all adjacent words with tag PERSON gives a person name, grouping those with tag ORG gives an organization name, etc.
The problem becomes, for any given sequence of words w = w 1 w 2 :::w n, #0Cnding the tags t = t 1 t 2 :::t n correspondingly.
Note that there are di#0Berent ways of assigning tags.
For the above example, tags can also be: Example 1: The#2FBritish#2Fballoon#2F-,#2Fcalled#2Fthe#2FVirgin#2FGlobal#2FChallenger#2F-,#2Fis#2Fto#2Fbe#2F#0Down#2Fby#2FRichard#2FPERSON-start Branson#2FPERSON-end,#2Fchairman#2Fof#2FVirgin#2F ORG-start Atlantic#2FORG-continue Airways#2FORG-end ;#2FThisway, extra informationsuch as common surnames, #0Crst names, organization endings #28Corp., Inc.
etc#29 and so on can be obtained.
It is observed that di#0Berent tags for a same task make di#0Berence.
We feel that choosing an appropriate tag set is a problem worthyof careful investigation.
Intuitively, a tag set for a particular task must be: su#0Ecient, meaning that the information extracted must be su#0Ecient for the task; and e#0Ecient, meaning that there should be no redundant and nonrelevant information.
LEARNING PROCESS: INFORMATION DISTILLATION OF TRAINING CORPUS Learning Process in General Careful consideration has been given to study how to absorb domain knowledge in language model#28s#29 in a generic and systematic way.
The basic idea is, as much as possible relevant and signi#0Ccant information #28to the task#29 contained in the original corpus should retain in back-o#0B corpora where back-o#0B features are stored, so that correct decisions can be made from the statistics generated from the back-o#0B corpora when they can not be done from the statistics from the original training corpus.
The original training corpus is in the form of word#2Ftag, statistics about words and tags including local contextual information can be obtained.
Eachword in the corpus is given a back-o#0B feature by the principle that the back-o#0B features of all words should extract the most information from the corpus relevant to the particular task.
The information loss is compensated by gain of generosity.
A back-o#0B corpus in the form of back-o#0B feature#2Ftag is then generated, and statistics can be obtained in the same manner.
The original corpus is processed this way for a certain number of times.
Every time, a less descriptive back-o#0B corpus which gains more in generosity is generated, and thus the corresponding statistics.
For example, semantic classes can be used as back-o#0B features for all the words in Example 1, which gives the back-o#0B corpus of the following form: seman1#2Fseman2#2F-...
semanM-1#2FPERSON semanM#2FPERSON ...
semanN-3 #2FORG semanN-2#2FORG semanN-1#2FORG semanN#2For part-of-speech as back-o#0B features, which gives 1st backoff corpus original training corpus 2nd backoff corpus Nth backoff corpus ...

Learning Process for Chinese NE #0F Training Corpus and Supporting Resources We have a text corpus of about 500,000 words from People Daily and Xinhua News Agency, all of whichwere manually checked for both word segmentation and part of speech tagging.
In addition, we have a lexicon of 89,777 words, in which 5351 words are labeled as geographic names, 304 words are people's name and 183 are organization names.
1167 words consist of more than 4 characters.
The longest word #28meaning #5CGreat Britain and North Ireland United Kingdom"#29 contains 13 characters.
About 50,000 di#0Berentwords appeared in the 500,000 words corpus.
We also have three entity name lists: people name list #2867,616 entries#29, location name list #286,451 entries#29 and organization name list #286190 entries#29.
#0F Observation: Problems and Solutions 1.
Intuitively, case information of proper names in English writing system provides good indication about locations and boundaries of entity names.
There are successful systems #5B2#5D which are built upon this intuition.
Unfortunately, the uniformity of character string in Chinese writing system does not contain such information.
One should look for such analogous indicative characteristics which may be unique in Chinese language.
2. Word in Chinese is a vague concept and there is no clear de#0Cnition for it.
There are boundary ambiguities between words in texts for even human being understanding, and inevitably machine processing.
Tokenization, or word segmentation is still a problem in Chinese NLP.Word boundary ambiguities exist not only between commonly used words which are not in entity names, but also between commonly used words and entity names.
3. Besides the uniformity appearance of characters, proper names in Chinese can consist of commonly used words.
As a matter of fact, almost all Chinese characters can be a commonly used words themselves, including those in entity names such as people's names, location names, etc.
Therefore, unlike English, the problem of Chinese entity recognition should not be isolated from the problem of tokenization, or word segmentation.
#0F Building Language Models One level of back-o#0B features, which are also called word classes, are obtained by the following way: We extend the idea in the new word detection engine of the integrated model of Chinese word segmentor and part of speech tagger #5B1#5D.
The idea is to extend the scope of an interested word class of new word, the proper names, into named entities by looking into broader range of constituents.
Under this framework, we believe contextual statistics plays important rules in deciding word boundary and predicting the categories of named entities, while local statistics, or information resides within words or entities, can provide evidence for suggesting the appearance of named entity and deciding the validity of these entities.
We need to make full use of both contextual and local statistics to recognize these named entities, thus contextual language model and entity models are created.
The basic process to build the model is like this: 1.
Change the tag set of the part-of-speech tagger by splitting the tag NOUN into more detailed tags related to the particular task, which include the symbolic notions of person, location, organization, date, time, money and percentage.
2. Replace the tag NOUN in the training corpus with the above extended new tags.
Only ambiguous words are manually checked.
3. Build contextual language model with the training corpus with the new tag set.
4. Build entity models from the entity name lists.
Eachentity has its own model.
Learning Process for English NE #0F Training Corpus and Supporting Resources SGML marked up #28for NE task only#29 Brown corpus and corpus from Wall Street Journal.
In total the size of words is 7.2MB, words with SGML-markup is 9.5MB.
Supporting resources include the location list, country list, corporation reference list and the people's surname list provided by MUC.
Only the single-word entries in these lists are in actual use.
#0F Observation: Problems and Solutions Case information, or more generally, orthographic information, gives good evidence of names, as was observed in #5B2#5D.
Although things get muddled up when one really gets deep into it: e.g.
#0Crst words of sentences, words which do not have all normal #28lower#29 case form #28e.g.
#5CI"#29, or words whose cases are changed due to other reasons such as formatting #28e.g.
titles#29, being artifacts, etc.
Nevertheless, this is an very important information for identifying entity names.
Prepositions are also helpful, so are common su#0Exes and pre#0Cxes of the entities, such as Corp., Mr., and so on.
In general, all such useful information should be somehow sorted out.
Word classes tailored for this particular purpose will be ideal.
#0F Building Language Models There are two levels of back-o#0B features represented byword classes.
For the following words, the two back-o#0B features are the same: #7B Hand-crafted special words for NE task.
Each possesses a di#0Berent word class #28represented by word itself#29.
These special words include #5CI", #5Cthe", #5Cpast", #5Cpound", #5Cfollowing", #5Cof", #5Cin", #5CMay", etc.
In total there are about 100 such words; #7B Words from the supporting resources #28as stated in the beginning of this section#29.
Words from a same list possess a same word class.
#7B Hand-crafted lists of words, which include week words #28Monday, Tuesday, ...#29, month words #28January, February, ...#29, cardinal numbers #28one, two, 1 #18 31, ...#29, ordinal numbers #281st, #0Crst, 2nd, second, ...#29, etc.
For the rest of words, the #0Crst level features are word classes provided by a machine auto classi#0Ccation of words, while the second level of features include: word class example oneDigitNum 1 containsDigitAndColon 2:34 containsAlphaDigit A4 allCaps KRDL capPeriod M.
#0CrstCommonWordInitCap #0CrstNonCommonWordIC CommonWordInitCap Department initCapNotCommonWord David mixedCasesWord ValueJet charApos O'clock allLowerCase can compoundWord ad-hoc In total, the number of orthographic features is about 30.
To give a sense what information is extracted from the original training corpus, for example, the two back-o#0B sentences for Example 1 are: Level 1: the#2FCOUN ADJ#2FWordClass1#2F-,#2FWordClass2#2Fthe#2FWordClass3#2FWordClass4#2F WordClass5#2F-,#2FWordClass6#2Fto#2FWordClass7#2FWordClass8#2Fby#2FWordClass9#2F PERSON WordClass10#2FPERSON,#2FWordClass11#2Fof#2FWordClass12#2FORG Loc#2F ORG WordClass13#2Fslash ORG ;#2FLevel 2: the#2FCOUN ADJ#2FLowerCaseWord#2F-,#2FLowerCaseWord#2Fthe#2FCommonWordInitCap#2FCommonWordInitCap#2FCommonWordInitCap#2F-,#2FLowerCaseWord#2Fto#2FLowerCaseWord#2FLowerCaseWord#2Fby#2FinitCapNotCommonWord#2FPERSON initCapNotCommonWord#2FPERSON,#2FLowerCaseWord#2Fof#2FCommonWordInitCap#2FORG Loc#2FORG CommonWordInitCap#2FORG ;#2FStatistics such as the possibilitiesof CommonWordInitCap#28whichare NOT #0Crstwords of sentences#29 and the corresponding frequencies can be obtained from the second backo#0B corpus.
From our corpus, these are: Organization 7525 None of the named entities 8493 Location 896 Person 195 Date 8 Money 2 From the above statistics, it's interesting to notice that non-#0Crst common words which are initial capitalized have a far more chance to be organization than person #28frequencies 7525 vs 195#29 and location #28frequencies 7525 vs 896#29.
This agrees with general observations.
Also interesting is that suchwords have a higher chance not to be any of the seven entities.
This comes as a bit surprise.
For NLP researchers, though, it may not be a surprise at all.
This example also gives a sense how general observations are represented in a precise way.
Further research is to be carried out to justify quantitively the merits of this learning process.
Its full potential has yet to be exploited.
So far, our experimentation has proved that: 1.
Various kinds of text analysis #28syntactic, semantic, orthographic, etc#29 can be incorporated into the same framework in a precise way, which will be used in the information extraction #28tagging#29 stage in the same way; 2.
It provides an easy way to absorb human knowledge as well as domain knowledge, and thus customization can be done easily; 3.
It gives great #0Dexibilityashow to optimize the system.
1 and 2 are somehow clear from the above discussion.
Details on the disambiguation module will reveal 3.
DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM MODULES 1.
Sentence segmentor and tokenizer: initial tokenization by looking up dictionary for Chinese, standard way for English.
2. Text analyzer.
What has been done for training corpus in the learning stage is done here.
After the analysis, eachword possesses a given number of back-o#0B features.
3. Hypothesis generator.
#0F Chinese: based on entities' pre#0Cxes, su#0Exes, trigger words and local context information, guesses are made about possible boundaries of entities and categories of entities.
Time, date, money, andpercentage are extracted by pattern-matching rules.
#0F English: for each word basically look for all the possibilities from the database #0Crst.
If the word is not found, look for the possibilities of its back-o#0B features.
4. Disambiguation module.
Recall that information extraction from word sequence w becomes #0Cnding the corresponding tag sequence t.
In the paradigm of maximum likelihood estimation, the best set of tags t is the one such that prob#28tjw#29 = max t 0 prob#28t 0 jw#29.
Thisisequivalentlyto #0Cndtsuchthat prob#28tw#29 = max t 0 prob#28t`w#29 because prob#28t 0 jw#29=prob#28tw 0 #29=prob#28w#29 and prob#28w#29 is a constant for any given w.
The following equalityiswell-known: prob#28tw#29 = prob#28t 1 #29 prob#28w 1 jt 1 #29 prob#28t 2 jt 1 w 1 #29 prob#28w 2 jt 1 w 1 t 2 #29 #01#01#01prob#28t n jt 1 w 1 :::t n,1 w n,1 #29prob#28w n jt 1 w 1 :::t n,1 w n,1 t n #29: #281#29 Computationally, it is only feasible when some #28actually most#29 dependencies are dropped, for example, prob#28t k jt 1 w 1 :::t k,1 w k,1 #29#19prob#28t k jt k,1 t k,2 #29; #282#29 prob#28w k jt 1 w 1 :::t k,1 w k,1 t k #29#19prob#28w k jt k t k,1 #29: #283#29 #282#29 and #283#29 can be justi#0Ced by Hidden Markov Modeling for the generation of word sequences.
As always, Viterbi algorithm is employed to compute the probability #281#29, given any approximations like #282#29 and #283#29.
When sparse data problem is encountered, back-o#0B and smoothing strategy can be adopted, e.g. prob#28w k jt k t k,1 #29 backoff to ! prob#28w k jt k #29; #284#29 or for unknown words, substitute word in #284#29 with its back-o#0B features, e.g. prob#28w k jt k t k,1 #29 backoff to ! prob#28bof1 k jt k t k,1 #29 backoff to ! prob#28bof2 k jt k t k,1 #29 ::: backoff to ! prob#28bofN k jt k t k,1 #29 backoff to ! prob#28bof1 k jt k #29 ::: backoff to ! prob#28bofN k jt k #29; where N is the total number of back-o#0B features for the word.
Note that no smoothing is employed in the abovescheme.
From this scheme one can see that there exist various ways of back-o#0B and smoothing.
This characteristics, as well as the free choices of back-o#0B features, is where the #0Dexibility of the system lies.
Remark. In the actual system, back-o#0B and smoothing schemes are di#0Berent from the above.
The actual schemes are not included because they are more complicated, and yet no systematic experimentation has been done to show that they are better than other options.
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS The system currently processes one sentence at a time, and no memory is kept once the sentence is done.
Furthermore, due to limitation of time, the guidelines for both Chinese and English NE are not entirely followed, as we didn't have time to read the guidelines carefully!
The F-measures of formal run for Chinese and English are 86.38#25 and 77.74#25, respectively.
Given the limited time #28less than six months#29 and resources #28three persons, all half time#29, we are satisfactory with the performance.

1. Modeling of the problem: currently information and knowledge is represented in the form of word#2Ftag.
This may pose too much restriction.
A better way of representing information and knowledge, in other words, a better modeling of the problem, should be studied.
2. Quantitive justi#0Ccation of the learning process #28knowledge distillation#29 should also be studied.
The system should be able to compare di#0Berent set of back-o#0B features and thus the best one can be chosen.
3. The system provides great #0Dexibilityashow to optimize it.
The optimization should be done systematicly, rather than trial by trial as is the case for the time being.
