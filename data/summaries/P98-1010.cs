Work Two previous methods for learning local syntactic patterns follow the transformation-based paradigm introduced by Brill (1992).
A92-1021 H92-1022
Surprisingly, though, rather little work has been devoted to learning local syntactic patterns, mostly noun phrases (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Vilain and Day, 1996).
C96-1047 W95-0107
We used the NP data prepared by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), hereafter RM95.
W95-0107
Other implementations of the memory-based paradigm for NLP tasks include Daelemans et al.(1996), for POS tagging; Cardie (1993), for syntactic and semantic tagging; and Stanfill and Waltz (1986), for word pronunciation.
W96-0102
We refer here only to the DOP (Data Oriented Parsing) method (Bod, 1992) which, like the present work, is a memory-based approach.
C92-3126
The last line shows the results of Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) (recognizing NP's) with the same train/test data.
W95-0107
Inspired by Satta (1997), we build two suffix trees for retrieving the positive and total counts for a tile.
P97-1057
Vilain and Day (1996) identify (and classify) name phrases such as company names, locations, etc.
C96-1047
Ramshaw and Marcus (1995) detect noun phrases, by classifying each word as being inside a phrase, outside or on the boundary between phrases.
