In the research presented here, we concentrate on the first step of the summarization process and follow Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) in employing lexical chains to extract important concepts from a document.

Basically, lexical chains exploit the cohesion among an arbitrary number of related words (Morris and Hirst 1991).

Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) proposed lexical chains as an intermediate step in the text summarization process.

To select these, we use the idea of “strong chains” introduced by Barzilay and Elhadad (1997).

First, previous methods for computing lexical chains have either been manual (Morris and Hirst 1991) or automated, but with exponential efficiency (Hirst and St.-Onge 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad 1997).

Additionally, some research has explored cutting and pasting segments of text from the full document to generate a summary (Jing and McKeown 2000).

Other recent work looks at summarization as a process of revision; in this work, the source text is revised until a summary of the desired length is achieved (Mani, Gates, and Bloedorn 1999).
P99-1072
Hybrid approaches such as extracting phrases instead of sentences and recombining these phrases into salient text have been proposed (Barzilay, McKeown, and Elhadad 1999).
