Furthermore, in order to determine the extent of the reparanduin, one needs to take into account the parallel structure that typically exists between the reparandum and alteration, which relies on at identifying the s:?ntactic roles, or part-of-speech (POS) tags, of the words involved (Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992; Heeman and Allen, 1994).
P92-1008 P94-1041
The POS tagset, based on the Penn Treebank tagset (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993), includes special tags for denoting when a word is being used as a discourse marker.

Example 5 (d93-14.3 utt42) we need to um manage to get the bananas to Dansville T editing term interruption point There is typically a correspondence between the reparandum and the alteration, and following Bear et al.(1992), we annotate this using the labels m for word matching and r for word replacements (words of the same syntactic category).
P92-1008
(Hindle, 1983; Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg, 1992; Nakatani and Hirschberg, 1994; Heeman and Allen, 1994; Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996b)).
P83-1019 P92-1008 P94-1041
However, speech repairs disrupt the context that is needed to determine the POS tags (Hindle, 1983).
P83-1019
Example 4 (d92a-l.3 utt65) so that will total will take seven hours to do that reparandumT alteration interruption point 1This classification is similar to that of Hindle (1983) and Levelt (1983).
P83-1019
Discourse markers (Schiffrin, 1987; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Byron and Heeman, 1997) are used to relate new speech to the current discourse state.
J93-3003
We introduce null tokens between each pair of consecutive words wi-1 and wi (Heeman and Allen, 1994), which wilt be tagged as to the occurrence of these events.
P94-1041
(Black et al., 1992; Materman, 1995)), we treat the word identities as a further refinement of the POS tags; thus we build a word classification tree for each POS tag.
H92-1023
Bear et al.(1992) used a simple pattern matching approach on ATIS word transcriptions.
P92-1008
To allow the decision tree to ask about the words and POS tags in the context, we cluster the words and POS tags using the algorithm of Brown et al.(1992) into a binary classification tree.
