They have also provided useful models in morphology (Kay 1983, Koskenniemi 1983) and phonology (Church 1983), 172 Computational Linguistics, Volume 10, Numbers 3-4, July-D~cember 1984 C.

Shieber et al.(1983) present several examples, namely the treatment of discontinuous noun phrases in Walpiri, adverb distribution in German, and causatives in Japanese, that cannot be handled under the finite closure constraint.

has always been interest in finite-state grammars to account for some perceptual constraints on sentence recognition, such as the difficulty of center-embedded sentences e.g., "The rat that the cat that the dog chase ate died" (Langendoen 1975, Church 1981, Langendoen and Langsam 1984).
P84-1007
This is also a good place to recall the difference between recognition and parsing: if parsing requires that distinct structures be produced for all parses, it will be TIME(2n), since in some grammars sentences of length n may have 2 n parses (Church and Patil 1982).

Both crossing and noncrossing dependencies can be represented (Joshi 1983)).

Berwick (1982) shows that a set of strings whose recognition problem is known to be NP-complete, namely, the set of satisfiable Boolean formulas, is an LFL.

Berwick and Weinberg (1982) give examples of how algorithms of low complexity may have different implementations differing by large constant factors.

7. Tree Adjunct Grammar The tree adjunct grammars (TAG) of Joshi and his colleagues (1982, 1984) provide a different way of accounting for syntactic dependencies.

Shieber et al.(1983) argue that a generalization is lost in so doing, in the sense that the class of instantiations of the variable must be defined bye extension rather than by intension.

Pereira and Shieber (1984) use techniques from the denotational semantics of programming languages to investigate the feature systems of several unification-based theories.

However, the recognition complexity of GB languages, as formalized in Berwick (1984) or in more "faithful" models, remains open, and may arise from other constraints.

Another case is that of sentences that, in most grammars, are ambiguous because of attachment choices, such as those discussed by Church and Patil (1982).

Berwick and Weinberg (1982) point out that, since the complexity of parsing algorithms is generally at least linearly dependent on the size of the grammar, this requirement may make CKY less than optimal for parsing short sentences.

The formal properties of TALs are fully discussed by Joshi, Levy, and Takahashi (1975); Joshi and Levy (1982); and Yokomori and Joshi (to appe~ar).
