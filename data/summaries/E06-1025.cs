determining document orientation (or polarity), as in deciding if a given Subjective text expresses a Positive or a Negative opinion on its subject matter (Pang and Lee, 2004; Turney, 2002); 3.

When tested on the same benchmarks, the methods of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Turney and Littman, 2003) have performed with comparable accuracies (however, the method of (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005) is much more efficient than the one of (Turney and Littman, 2003)), and have outperformed the method of (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) by a wide margin and the one by (Kamps et al., 2004) by a very wide margin.

The methods of (Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005) are instead difficult to compare with the other ones since they were not evaluated on publicly available datasets.

This amounts to performing binary text categorization under categories Objective and Subjective (Pang and Lee, 2004; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003); 2.

Takamura et al.(2005) determine term orientation (for Japanese) according to a “spin model”, i.e. a physical model of a set of electrons each endowed with one between two possible spin directions, and where electrons propagate their spin direction to neighbouring electrons until the system reaches a stable configuration.

term subjectivity Riloff et al.(2003) develop a method to determine whether a term has a Subjective or an Objective connotation, based on bootstrapping algorithms.

This hypothesis is confirmed by an experiment performed by Kim and Hovy (2004) on testing the agreement of two human coders at tagging words with the Positive, Negative, and Objective labels.

This suggests that good performance at orientation detection (as e.g. in (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003)) may not be a 198 Table 2: Human inter-coder agreement values reported by Kim and Hovy (2004).

The methods described in (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) is also limited by the fact that it can only decide the orientation of adjectives, while the method of (Kamps et al., 2004) is further limited in that it can only work on adjectives that are present in WordNet.
P97-1023
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1997) attempt to predict the orientation of subjective adjectives by analysing pairs of adjectives (conjoined by and,or,but,either-or,orneither-nor) extracted from a large unlabelled document set.

ThesystemofKimandHovy(2004) tackles orientation detection by attributing, to each term, a positivity score and a negativity score; interestingly, terms may thus be deemed to have both a positive and a negative correlation, maybe with different degrees, and some terms may be deemed to carry a stronger positive (or negative) orientation than others.

The conceptually simplest approach to this latter problem is probably Turney’s (2002), who has obtained interesting results on Task 2 by considering the algebraic sum of the orientations of terms as representative of the orientation of the document they belong to; but more sophisticated approaches arealsopossible (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Riloff et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004).

To aid these tasks, recent work (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Kamps et al., 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Turney and Littman, 2003) has tackled the issue of identifying the orientation ofsubjective terms contained in text, i.e.determiningwhether atermthat carries opinionated content has a positive or a negative connotation (e.g.
