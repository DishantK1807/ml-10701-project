In fact there is an argument to be made in favour ofa scoping framework which undergenerates with respect to Hobbs and Shieber's as a general approach to quantifier scoping (Park 1995).

Keywords: lexical choice, realisation, quantifiers 121 An Algorithm for Generating Quantifiers Quantifiers, and their associated scoping phenomena are ubiquitous in English and other natural languages, and a great deal of attention has been paid to their treatment in the context of natural language analysis (Alshawi 1990, Creaney 1995, Grosz et al.1987, Hobbs and Shieber 1987, Park 1995, Saint-Dizier 1984).

It is well documented (Webber 1978, Park 1995) that some plural noun phrases are capable of collective interpretations which are not sensitive to quantifer scoping.

They are: o quantifier scoping choices o choice of focus sets o choice of individual quantifiers constrained by the above two choices A great deal has been written about the quantifier scoping problem for natural language analysis (Hobbs & Shieber 1987) and much of this is applicable to the generation problem in the sense that any particular description must assume some particular quantifier scoping arrangement.

Inputs to the algorithm The inputs to the algorithm are: a model like (1) a predicate argument structure for the target sentence A predicate argument structure (PAS) is essentially an unscoped logical form of the form taken as input to Hobs and Shieber's algorithm (Hobbs & Shieber 1987).
