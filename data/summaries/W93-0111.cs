This approach is similar in spirit to the iterative computational approaches of the Hidden Markov Models (Kupiec, 1989; Kupiec, 1992; Rabiner, 1989), though our zeroth order solution begins quite close to the desired result, so it should converge very close to a global optimum.

Excellent methods have been developed for part-of-speech (POS) tagging using stochastic models trained on partially tagged corpora (Church, 1988; Cutting, Kupiec, Pedersen & Sibun, 1992).

In our approach, we take into account both the relative positions of the nearby context words as well as the mutual information (Church & Hanks, 1990) associated with the occurrence of a particular context word.

FURTHER DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Our corpus of 220,000 words is much smaller than ones of 40 million words (Finch & Chater, 1992) and certainly of 360 million (Brown, Della Pietra, deSousa, Lai & Mercer, 1992).
