Following Dagan, Pereira, and Lee (1994), we modify Katz's formulation by writing Pr(w2\]wl) instead P(w2), enabling us to use similarity-based estimates for unseen word pairs instead of basing the estimate for the pair on unigram frequency P(w2).
P94-1038
However, other variations are possible, such as interpolating with the unigram probability P(w2): P,.(w2lwl) = 7P(w2) + (1 7)PsiM(W2lWl), where 7 is determined experimentally (Dagan, Pereira, and Lee, 1994).
P94-1038
Class-based methods (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993; Resnik, 1992) cluster words into classes of similar words, so that one can base the estimate of a word pair's probability on the averaged cooccurrence probability of the classes to which the two words belong.

Essen and Steinbiss (1992) and Karov and Edelman (1996) (implicitly) set 8(wl) = V1.

We used a statistical part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988) and pattern matching and concordancing tools (due to David Yarowsky) to identify transitive main verbs and head nouns of the corresponding direct objects in 44 million words of 1988 Associated Press newswire.

We compared several such methods, including that of Dagan, Pereira, and Lee (1994) and the cooccurrence smoothing method of Essen and Steinbiss (1992), against classical estimation methods, including that of Katz, in a decision task involving unseen pairs of direct objects and verbs, where unigram frequency was eliminated from being a factor.

The function itself is implicit in earlier work on distributional clustering (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993}, has been used by Tishby (p.e).
