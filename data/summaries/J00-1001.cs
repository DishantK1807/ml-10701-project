Fueled by the theoretical contributions of Kaplan and Kay (1994), Mohri's recent contributions on the use of finite-state techniques in various NLP problems (Mohri 1996, 1997), the success of finite-state approaches especially in computational morphology, for example, Koskenniemi (1983), Karttunen (1983), and Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen (1992), and, finally, the availability of state-of-the-art tools for building and manipulating large-scale finite-state systems (Karttunen 1993; Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen et al.1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1998; van Noord 1999), recent years have seen many successful applications of finite-state approaches in tagging, spell checking, information extraction, parsing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech applications.
