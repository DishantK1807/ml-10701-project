Relevancy recognition is similar to text segmentation (Hearst, 1994), but relevancy recognition focuses on the current question with the previous text while text segmentation has the full text available and is allowed to look ahead.

For example, the Path (path) measure is the inverse of the shortest path length between two word senses in WordNet; the Wu and Palmer’s (wup) measure (Wu and Palmer, 1994) is to find the most specific concept that two word senses share as ancestor (least common subsumer), and then scale the path length of this concept to the root note (supposed that there is a virtual root note in WordNet) by the sum of the path lengths of the individual word sense to the root node; the Lin’s (lin) measure (Lin, 1998) is based on information content, which is a corpus based measure of the specificity of a word; the Vector (vector) measure associates each word with a gloss vector and calculates the similarity of two words as the cosine between their gloss vectors (Patwardhan, 2003).

The tools we tried, including GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), LingPipe (http://www.alias-i.com/lingpipe/) and JavaRAP (Qiu et al., 2004), tend to use the nearest noun phrase as the referents for pronouns.

Features As the first step, we tagged each question with part-of-speech tags using GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), a software tool set for text engineering.
