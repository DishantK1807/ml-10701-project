Second, we follow Snow et al.’s work (2006) on taxonomy induction in incorporating transitive closure constraints in our probability calculations, as explained below.
P06-1101
Coreference resolution systems (e.g., (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Ng and Cardie, 2002)), like SR systems, try to merge references to the same object (typically pronouns, but potentially other types of noun phrases).
J94-4002 P02-1014
This second source of evidence is sometimes referred to as “distributional similarity” (Hindle, 1990).
P90-1034
We follow the work of Snow et al.(2006) in incorporating transitive closure constraints in probabilistic modeling, and make the same independence assumptions.
P06-1101
Several supervised learning techniques make entity resolution decisions (Kehler, 1997; McCallum and Wellner, 2004; Singla and Domingos, 2006), but of course these systems depend on the availability of training data, and often on a significant number of labeled examples per relation of interest.
