A pair of sentences is rst fed to a syntactic parser (Charniak, 2000) and then passed to a semantic role labeler (ASSERT; (Pradhan et al., 2004)), to label predicate argument tuples.

A thesaurus constructed from corpus statistics (Lin, 1998) is utilized for the content similarity.

It models the syntactic connection between the constituents on both ends of the path (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004).

PR systems that can be broadly categorized as IR-based include (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005; Brockett and Dolan, 2005).

The system performance reported in (CM05; (Corley and Mihalcea, 2005)), which is among the best we are aware of, is also included for comparison.

The Microsoft Research Paraphrase coupus (Dolan et al., 2004) consists of 5801 newswire sentence pairs, 3900 of which are annotated as semantically equivalent by human annotators.

Barzilay and Lee (2003) proposed to apply multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) for traditional, sentence-level PR.
N03-1003
Brockett and Dolan (2005) represented sentence pairs as a feature vector, including features (among others) for sentence length, edit distance, number of shared words, morphologically similar word pairs, synonym pairs (as suggested by WordNet and a semi-automatically constructed thesaurus).

Weeds et al.(2005) addressed this problem by utilizing parses for PR.
W05-1202
One weakness of our system is that we rely on a thesaurus (Lin, 1998) for word similarity information for predicate argument tuple pairing.
P98-2127
Experiments on the widely-used MSR corpus (Dolan et al., 2004) show favorable results.
C04-1051
Wu (2005)â€™s approach relies on the generative framework of Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) to measure how similar two sentences arrange their words based on edit distance.
