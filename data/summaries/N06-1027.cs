Inspired by the idea of graph based algorithms to collectively rank and select the best candidate, research efforts in the natural language community have applied graph-based approaches on keyword selection (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), text summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea, 2004), word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004; Mihalcea, 2005), sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004), and sentence retrieval for question answering (Otterbacher et al., 2005).

Most of the current work on discourse processing focuses on sentence-level text organization (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) or the intermediate step (Sporleder and Lapata, 2005).
