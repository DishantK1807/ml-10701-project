485 3 The Model Instead of employing the source-channel paradigm for tagging (more or less explicitly present e.g. in (Merialdo, 1992), (Church, 1988), (Hajji, Hladk~, 1997)) used in the past (notwithstanding some exceptions, such as Maximum Entropy and rule-based taggers), we are using here a "direct" approach to modeling, for which we have chosen an exponential probabilistic model.
A88-1019
This idea is not new, but as far as we know it has been implemented in rule-based taggers and parsers, such as (Brill, 1993a), (Brill, 1993b), (Brill, 1993c) and (Ribarov, 1996), but not in models based on probability distributions.
