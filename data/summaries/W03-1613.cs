This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

At current state two linguistic resources have been analyzed and adapted in order to be incorporated into the ADVICE project: Brill tagger, Brill (1992), and EuroWordNet, Vossen et al.(1998). The paper is structured as follows: next section focuses on a brief description of the NL module of ADVICE project; section 3 is devoted to explain how the corpus study has influenced the customization of the lexical resources; sections 4 and 5 outline the Brill tagger and EuroWordnet extension to cover specific domain peculiarities and, finally, in section 6 some conclusions and future work are presented.
