However, this mismatch is significantly less than the 23% mismatch reported in (Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003) between the CCGBank and an earlier version of the PropBank.

Support vector machines for SRL were first used in (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003) as word-by-word (W-by-W) classifiers.

Semantic role labeling based on predicateargument structure was first explored in detail by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

In the P-by-P and W-by-W methods (Hacioglu, 2004; Hacioglu and Ward, 2003) the problem is formulated as a chunking task and the features are derived for each base phrase and word, respectively.

Large semantically annotated databases, like FrameNet (Baker et.al, 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) have been used to train and test the classifiers.

Since then several variants of the basic approach have been introduced using different features and different classifiers based on various machine learning techniques (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Surdeanu et.
