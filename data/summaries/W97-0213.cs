Some clusters of studies have used common test suites, most notably the 2094-word Hne data of Leacock et al.(1993), shared by Lehman (1994) and Mooney (1996) and evaluated on the system of Gale, Church and Yarowsky (1992).

see (McRoy, 1992; Ng and Lee, 1996; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994)); it seems possible to obtain benefit from sources ranging from local collocational clues (Yarowsky, 1993) to membership in semantically or topically related word classes (Â¥arowsky, 1992; Resnik, 1993) to consistency of word usages within a discourse (Gale et al., 1992); and disambignation seems highly lexically sensitive, in effect requiring specialized disamhignators for each polysemous word.
