For our gold standard of manual opinion classifications (dubbed MANUAL for the rest of the paper) we will follow Riloff and Wiebeâ€™s (2003) convention (also used by Wiebe and Riloff (2005)) and consider a sentence to be opinion if it contains at least one opinion of intensity medium or higher, and to be fact otherwise.

We investigate whether such information can be useful for MPQA by using the automatic sentence level opinion classifiers of Riloff and Wiebe (2003) and Wiebe and Riloff (2005).

Riloff and Wiebe (2003) use a bootstrapping algorithm to perform a sentence-based opinion classification on the MPQA corpus.
