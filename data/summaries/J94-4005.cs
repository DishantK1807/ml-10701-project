The difference in performance between our syntactic and semantic preference functions is broadly in line with the results presented by Chang, Luo, and Su (1992), who use probabilities of semantic category tuples.

Lexical collocation functions, especially those determined statistically, have recently attracted considerable attention in computational linguistics (Calzolari and Bindi 1990; Church and Hanks 1990; Sekine et al.1992; Hindle and Rooth 1993) mainly, though not exclusively, for use in disambiguation.

E-mail: dmc@cam.sri.com (~ 1994 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 20, Number 4 For example, Ostendorf et al.(1991) improve recognition performance by using a linear combination of several scoring functions.

In addition, we had access to a hand-parsed subcollection of the ATIS corpus built as part of the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).

The method for computing scaling factors described here has more recently been applied to optimizing preference selection for the task of choosing between analyses arising from different word hypotheses in a speech recognition system (Rayner et al.1994) and is applicable to other problems, such as choosing between possible target representations in a machine translation system.

2. The Experimental Setup Disambiguation Task All the experiments we describe here were done with the Core Language Engine (CLE), a primarily rule-based natural language-processing system (Alshawi 1992).

(See Dunning 1993, for a fuller explanation of the use of likelihood ratios).

For example, Hindle and Rooth (1993) and Resnik and Hearst (1993) give experimental results on the effectiveness of functions based on lexical associations, or lexical-class associations, at selecting appropriate prepositional phrase attachments.

The third function is an original variant of the second; the fourth is original; and the fifth is prompted by the arguments of Dunning (1993).

McCord (1993) gives very specific information about the weights he uses to combine preference functions, though these weights are chosen by hand.

Finally, it would be interesting to combine the work on semantic collocation functions with that on similarity-based clustering (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993), with the aim of overcoming the problem of sparse training data.

Although multiple functions have been used in other systems (for example, McCord 1990; Hobbs and Bear 1990), little is typically said about how the functions are combined to produce the overall score for an analysis, the weights presumably being determined by intuition or trial and error.

Another reason for choosing ATIS was that it consists of several thousand sentences in a constrained discourse domain, which helped avoid sparseness problems in training collocation functions} In the various experiments, the alternatives we are choosing between are analyses expressed in the version of quasi logical form (QLF) described by Alshawi and Crouch (1992).
