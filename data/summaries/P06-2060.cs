Similar to our earlier work (Kambhatla, 2004), we used a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features including all the words in between the two mentions, the entity types and subtypes of the two mentions, the number of words in between the two mentions, features derived from the smallest parse fragment connecting the two mentions, etc.

Xu et al (1992) and Florian et al (2002) consider three approaches for combining classifiers.

Statistical classifiers are widely used for diverse NLP applications such as part of speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1999), chunking (Zhang et al., 2002), semantic parsing (Magerman, 1993), named entity extraction (Borthwick, 1999; Bikel et al., 1997; Florian et al., 2004), coreference resolution (Soon et al., 2001), relation extraction (Kambhatla, 2004), etc.

Classifiers Numerous methods for combining classifiers have been proposed and utlized to improve the performance of different NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998), identifying base noun phrases (Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000), named entity extraction (Florian et al., 2003), etc.

Henderson et al (1999) use a Majority Vote scheme where different parsers vote on constituentsâ€™ membership in a hypothesized parse.
