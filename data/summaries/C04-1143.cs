Non-extractive systems are less common – previous related work included reformulation of extracted models (McKeown et al., 1999), gist extraction (Berger and Mittal, 2000), machine translation-like approaches (Witbrock and Mittal, 1999) and generative models (De Jong, 1982; Radev and McKeown, 1998; Fum et al., 1986; Reihmer and Hahn, 1988; Rau et al., 1989).

The large size of this list contributed significantly to the NER’s resulting accuracy and compares favourably with previously compiled lists (Stevenson and Gaizauskas, 2000).
A00-1040
A simple linear model is adopted, where the system focuses mainly on nominal and clausal antecedents (Cristea et al., 2000).
C00-1031
The search scope for candidate antecedents is set to the current sentence together with the three preceding sentences as suggested in (Mitkov, 1998) as empirical studies show that more than 85% of all cases are handled correctly with this window size (Mitkov, 2002).
P98-2143
Candidate antecedents being discarded after ten sentences have been processed without the presence of anaphora as suggested in (Kameyama, 1997).

Previous related work on extractive systems included the use of semantic tagging and coreference/lexical chains (Saggion et al., 2003; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Azzam et al., 1998), lexical occurrence/structural statistics (Mathis et al., 1973), discourse structure (Marcu, 1998), cue phrases (Luhn, 1958; Paice, 1990; Rau et al., 1994), positional indicators (Edmunson, 1964) and other extraction methods (Kuipec et al., 1995).
