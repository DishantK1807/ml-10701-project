A number of Machine Learning approaches for Information Extraction have been developed recently, e.g., (Collins, 2002; Bikel et al., 1999), including some that use active learning, e.g., (Thompson et al., 1999) or offer automated support, e.g, (Ciravegna et al., 2002), in order to lower the overhead of annotating training data.
