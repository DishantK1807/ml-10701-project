Many recent efforts toward reducing the time and level of expertise needed to produce a new grammar have focused on adapting an existing grammar of another language (Butt et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003; Bateman et al., ip).

and Sag, 1994), the most extensive grammars are those of English (Flickinger, 2000), German (Hinrichs et al., 1997; M¨uller and Kasper, 2000; Crysmann, ip), and Japanese (Siegel, 2000; Siegel and Bender, 2002).

The original Grammar Matrix consisted of types defining the basic feature geometry, types associated with Minimal Recursion Semantics (e.g., (Copestake et al., 2001)), types for lex203 ical and syntactic rules, and configuration files for the LKB grammar development environment (Copestake, 2002) and the PET system (Callmeier, 2000).

of modularity Recent computational work in HPSG has asked whether different parts of a single grammar can be abstracted into separate, independent modules, either for processing (Kasper and Krieger, 1996; Theofilidis et al., 1997) or grammar development (Keˇselj, 2001).

Our work on the ‘Grammar Matrix’ has pursued an alternative approach, identifying a set of language-independent grammar constraints to which language-specific constraints can be added (Bender et al., 2002).
