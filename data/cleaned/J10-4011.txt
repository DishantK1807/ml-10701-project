The book consists of eight chapters of main material, an appendix of linguistic
resources, and a bibliography. Chapter 1 gives an introduction by raising the unique
characteristics of Chinese. A couple of interesting examples are used to explain the
problem of ambiguity caused by the lack of clear delimiters between words in Chi-
nese text. Then it proceeds to illustrate how other types of difﬁculties are produced
at morphological, syntactic, and semantic levels. From these discussions, Chapter 1
highlightsandconcludesthat“ThemaindifferenceinNLPbetweenChineseandother
languagestakesplaceintheﬁrststage.Thislaysdowntheobjectiveofthebook,namely,
tointroducethebasictechniquesinChinesemorphologicalanalysis.”
Chapter 2 describes the basic forms of morphological construction in Chinese
written script, providing the necessary preparation for morphological analysis in the
laterchapters.Itintroducestheconceptsofcharacters,morphemes,andwords,aswell
as the typical morphological processes of word formation. In particular, the authors

provide sufﬁcient details on the nature of the compounding that plays a predominant
roleinChinesewordformationandappearsmuchmoreprevalentthanthatinEnglish.
A number of examples make the content easy to follow, especially for international
learnerswhoarenotfamiliarwithChinese.
Given these primary linguistic characteristics, Chapter 3 particularizes the chal-
lenges that arise from a wide spectrum of morphological problems of Chinese. Com-
pared to an alphabetic system like English, the difﬁculties of Chinese morphological
processing not only result from its representation and writing conventions, such as a
large character set, multiple co-existing variants of character sets and encoding stan-
dards, dialectal variations, special genres of punctuation, and so on, but also from
its underlying linguistic heritage and distinctions. For example, the lack of formal
morphological markers may render part-of-speech tagging troublesome due to few
part-of-speech clues and multiple parts of speech for the same word; the indetermi-
nacy may be worsened by homophony and homography. The authors emphasize the
inﬂuences of different kinds of ambiguities and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and
suggestthatexternalknowledgeandcontextualinformationareimportanttoambiguity
resolution.
Chapter 4 reviews Chinese word segmentation, a major challenge unique to Chi-
nese and a few other Asian languages. A tree-based taxonomy is used to classify
segmentationalgorithmsintocharacter-andword-basedapproaches.Besidestherudi-
mentary methods, emphasis is given to those methods using statistics and machine
learningthattaketheadvantageoflarge-scaleannotatedcorporatosolvethesegmen-
tation ambiguity issue. Three main Chinese word segmentation standards are intro-
duced, together with the performance measures and benchmark data widely used for
evaluation.
As one of the major challenges in Chinese word segmentation, unknown word
identiﬁcation(UWI)isdiscussedseparatelyinChapter5,probablybecauseofitslarger
impact on accuracy and greater difﬁculty. Unknown words account for 60% of word
segmentationerrors.Propernounsrepresentingperson,place,andorganizationnames
that are missing from the dictionary are common sources of unknown words. New
namesmayappearonadailybasis,tendingtointensifytheOOVproblem.Thischapter
describes various means for UWI from both generic and speciﬁc point of views. The
general statistical methods based on co-occurrence statistics are depicted, followed by
the techniques for identifying speciﬁc types of proper nouns based on their particular
formation patterns. Two general methods worthy of review but missing are class-
basedlanguagemodels(FuandLuke2004)anddiscriminativeMarkovmodels(Zhou
2005), both of which make signiﬁcant improvements by leveraging various types of
features.

thesauri,namelyCILIN,HowNet,andCCD,aresurveyedincomparisonwiththewell-

relations, and examples of collocations selected from real corpora with quantitative

In summary, the book is clear and self-contained, discussing fundamental and
criticalissuesinChineseNLP.AsthefoundationofanyNLPtechnology,morphological

bemoreintegratedtoincludesyntacticandsemanticanalysis,Idobelievetheauthors
have made this choice wisely. Given the limited number of pages, it makes sense to
focus on the essence with sufﬁcient details to draw quick attention from many NLP
readerswhoaresensitivetothemostsalientanddistinctivesubjectmatters.Insteadof
elaborating the Chinese part alone, the authors adopt a helpful writing style so that,
whenever applicable, comparative discussions are made on the corresponding issues
in other languages, especially English. This bilingual perspective sheds more light on
what constitutes the noteworthy features in Chinese and the reason why customary
techniqueshavetobeornotbeemployedinChineseNLP.Thereadermighthavehoped
