This represents an essential information in various NLP applications and is extensively discussed in the literature e.g. (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001). Many measures have already been investigated and implemented for Princeton WordNet, however, there are only few publications addressing measures based on GermaNet e.g. (Gurevych and Niederlich, 200</context>

The research on relatedness measures both for GermaNet and Princeton WordNet among others (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) shows that the established algorithms are not yet able to satisfactorily represent the semantic relations between two words. Namely, human-judgement experiments stress that the correlation between t</context>

In addition, during the course of our research on lexical chaining for German corpora (Cramer and Finthammer, 2008), we also investigated semantic relatedness and similarity measures based on GermaNet as a resource. The results of this work led us to the implementation of eight GermaNet-based relatednessmeasures,</context>
