Previous translation methods 2 (Covington, 1989; Hirsh, 1988; SchSter, 1993; Erbach, 1995) are problematic in that they cannot deal with disjunctive feature descriptions, which reduce redundancies in grammar.

Since formalisms (i) are used in the family of the PATR parsing systems (Shieber, 1984), hereafter they will be called PATR-Iike formalisms.

Such a method of satisfaction is called constraint transformation (Hasida, 1986).

Although we did not treat type hierarchies in this paper, we can incorporate them by using the method proposed by Erbach (1995).
E95-1025
It employs constraint projection (Nakano, 1991) as an efficient constraint transformation method.
P91-1040
Obtaining compact constraints corresponds to avoiding unnecessary expansions of disjunctions in graph unification (Kasper, 1987; Eisele and DSrre, 1988).
P87-1033 P88-1035
Analysis systems that are based on unification grammars can be classified into two groups from the viewpoint of the ways feature structures are represented: (a) those using labeled, directed graphs (Shieber, 1984) and (b) those using first-order terms (Pereira and Warren, 1980; Matsumoto et al., 1983; Tokunaga et al., 1991).
P84-1075
Some constraint transformation methods whose resulting constraints are compact have been proposed (Hasida, 1986; Nakano, 1991).

935 (9) sign(v, agr( sing, 3rd), sign(_, agr( sing, 3rd), _)) Feature structure (8) is a O'ped feature structure used in typed unification grammars (Emele and Zajac, 1990).

Moreover, incorporating disjunctive information into internal representation makes parsing more efficient (Kasper, 1987; Eisele and DSrre, 1988; Maxwell and Kaplan, 1991; Hasida, 1986).
