NUMEX : SPECIFIC GUIDELINES 12 319 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Scope The Named Entity task consists of three subtasks (entity names, temporal expressions, number expressions) . The expressions to be annotated are "unique identifiers" of entities (organizations, persons, locations), times (dates, times), and quantities (monetary values, percentages) . For many text processing systems, such identifiers are recognized primarily using local pattern-matchin g techniques . The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange cove r such identifiers (plus abbreviations) together in section 6 .4 and explain that the identifiers comprise "textual feature s which it is often convenient to distinguish from their surrounding text . Names, dates and numbers are likely to be of particular importance to the scholar treating a text as source for a database ; distinguishing such items from the surrounding text is however equally important to the scholar primarily interested in lexis ." The task is to identify all instances of the three types of expressions in each text in the test set and to subcategorize the expressions . The original texts contain some SGML tags already ; the Named Entity task is to be performe d within the text delimited by the TXT, HL, DATELINE, and DD tags .
2:48	(Note, however, that the DD tag sometimes doesn't appear at all, sometimes appears once, and sometimes appears twice.
3:48	When it appears twice, only the second instance is to be marked up for the Named Entity task.)
4:48	Lines within the <TXT> portion of the article that start with the "@" sign signify a table or other special line formatting within the text and should NOT be annotated .
5:48	(However, such lines may also appear within the <HL > portion of the article, and these should be annotated . The system must produce a single, unambiguous output for any relevant string in the text ; thus, this evaluation i s not based on a view of a pipelined system architecture in which Named Entity recognition would be completel y handled as a preprocess to sentence and discourse analysis . The task requires that the system recognize what a string represents, not just its superficial appearance.
6:48	Sometimes, the right answer is superficially apparent, as in th e case of most, if not all, NUMEX expressions, and can be obtained by local pattern-matching techniques . In other cases, the right answer is not superficially apparent, as when a single capitalized word could represent the name of a location, person, or organization, and the answer may have to be obtained using techniques that draw informatio n from a larger context or from reference lists.
7:48	The three subtasks correspond to three SGML tag elements : ENAMEX, TIMEX, and NUMEX.
8:48	The subcategorization is captured by a SGML tag attribute called TYPE, which is defined to have a different set o f possible values for each tag element.
9:48	The markup is described in section 2, below . 1.2 Performance Evaluation Scoring of this task will be done using the same kinds of metrics that are used for scoring template-filling (information extraction) tasks . For specific information on the scoring, refer to "MUC-6 Scoring System User' s Manual," prepared for MUC-6 by SAIC . Cumulative scores will be generated at several levels of description of the task, e .g. ,  across subtasks,  for each subtask,  for the subcategorization aspect of each subtask,  for each part of the article that is included in the task (<HL>,<DATELINE>, <DD>, <TXT>) . 2 TASK OVERVIEW 2.1 Markup Description The output of the systems to be evaluated will be in the form of SGML text markup.
10:48	The only insertions allowed during tagging are tags enclosed in angled brackets . No extra whitespace or carriage returns are to be inserted ; otherwise, the offset count would change, which would adversely affect scoring . The markup will have the following form : 321 <ELEMENT-NAME ATTR-NAME="ATTR-VALUE" . . .>text-string</ELEMENT-NAME> Example: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Taga Co .</ENAMEX> The markup is defined in SGML Document Type Descriptions (DTDs), written for MUC-6 use by personnel at MITRE and maintained by personnel at NRaD . The DTDs enable annotators and system developers to use SGML validation tools to check the correctness of the SGML-tagged texts produced by the annotator or the system . The validation tools are available to MUC-6 participants in the file called muc6-sgml-tools . Annotators are using a software tool provided for MUC-6 by SRA Corporation to assist in generating the answer keys to be used fo r system training and testing.
11:48	2.2 Named Entities (ENAMEX tag element ) This subtask is limited to proper names, acronyms, and perhaps miscellaneous other unique identifiers, which ar e categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : ORGANIZATION: named corporate, governmental, or other organizational entity PERSON : named person or famil y LOCATION : name of politically or geographically defined location (cities, provinces, countries, international regions, bodies of water, mountains, etc .) 2.3 Temporal Expressions (TIMEX tag element) This subtask is for "absolute" temporal expressions only; explanation is provided in appendix B . The tagged tokens are categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : DATE: complete or partial date expressio n TIME: complete or partial expression of time of da y 2.4 Number Expressions (NUMEX tag element) This subtask is for two useful types of numeric expressions, monetary expressions and percentages . The numbers may be expressed in either numeric or alphabetic form . The task covers the complete expression, which is categorized via the TYPE attribute as follows : MONEY: monetary expressio n PERCENT: percentage 3 NOTATION RESERVED FOR USE IN THE ANSWER KEY S 3.1 Expressing Alternative Attribute Value s A vertical bar is being used to separate alternative TYPE attribute values in the answer key . Alternative values will be given when the annotator does not have enough information to make a uniqu e categorization, even considering the context and the annotator's knowledge of the world . 3.2 Expressing Optional Markup (STATUS Attribute) When it is not certain that a string should be marked up, the annotator will include the STATUS attribute in th e markup to indicate that the markup is optional . The only value of the STATUS attribute is "OPT ".
12:48	Examples of it s possible use can be found in the appendices, such as in appendix B (holiday names) . 3.3 Expressing Alternative String Boundaries (ALT Attribute ) The ALT attribute will be used when the tagged string contains one or more substrings that should be considere d correct for the purposes of scoring the system response . Certain premodifiers ("a," "an," and "the") are automatically ignored by the scoring program (via the "configuration" file) and thus do not need to be speciall y marked in the key.
13:48	322 The ALT attribute will be used sparingly . A possibleTIMEX example is shown below . "all of 1987" <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="1987">all of 1987</TIMEX> 4 GUIDELINES FOR MARKUP OF EXCEPTIONAL CONSTRUCTION S 4.1 Expressions Involving Elision Multi-name expressions containing conjoined modifiers (with elision of the head of one conjunct) should be marke d up as separate expressions.
14:48	"North and South America " <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX> A similar case involving elision with number expressions : "10and 20-dollar bills " <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10</NUMEX>and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">20-dollar</NUMEX> bills In contrast, there is no elision in the case of single-name expressions containing conjoined modifiers ; such expressions should be marked up as a single expression . "U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service</ENAMEX> The subparts of range expressions should be marked up as separate expressions.
15:48	"175 to 180 million Canadian dollars " <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">175</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">180 million Canadia n dollars</NUMEX> "the 1986-87 academic year" the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>-<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" ALT="87">87 academic year</TIMEX> 4.2 Effects of Tokenization Conventions The systems must incorporate certain tokenization conventions.
16:48	These conventions are contained in a separate document titled "Tokenization Rules ." The tokenization conventions for MUC-6 have an impact on the boundaries of the strings to be tagged . For example, the conventions call for treating possessive forms, e.g., "California's," as multiple tokens, unless there is a name such as "McDonald's [burger company]" that is inherently possessive . See the separate documentation titled "Tokenization Rules" for further information and examples . 4.3 Nested Expression s There are cases where LOCATION (ENAMEX) expressions are to be tagged when they occur within TIMEX an d NUMEX expressions.
17:48	See Appendices B and C for a description of cases where markup of nested expressions ma y occur.
18:48	Entity names that appear within ENAMEX tags are *not* to be tagged . 323 APPENDIX A. ENAMEX : SPECIFIC GUIDELINES Al Guidelines That Pertain to All Three TYPEs A.1 .1 Entity names used as modifiers in complex NPs that are not proper names are to be tagged when it is clea r to the annotator from context or the annotator's knowledge of the world that the name is that of an organization or person.

TIMEX: SPECIFIC GUIDELINES B.1 Only "absolute" time expressions are to be tagged . To be considered an absolute time expression, th e expression must indicate a specific segment of time, as follows :  An expression of minutes must indicate a particular minute and hour, such as "20 minutes after 10" (not "a fe w minutes after the hour," "20 minutes after the hour") .  An expression of hours must indicate a particular hour, such as "midnight," "twelve o'clock noon," "noon" (no t "mid-day," "morning") .
