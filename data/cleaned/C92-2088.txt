1 Introduction
It has become widely accel)ted that developing a large scale semantic dictionary is indispensable to future natural language research.
ILL recent years, several research activities for compiling selnantic dictionaries tot natural language processing have been uudcrtaken One of the approaches in this research is attempts to compile dictionaries by band.
Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute (El)R).
is now compiling conceptual dictionaries\[5\] by hand with the help of software tools.
\[nformation-4echnology Promotion Agency (IPA), Japan, has also compiled IPA Lexicon of the Japanese Language for computers (II'AL)\[4\].
IPAL has 861 entries for basic Jalranese verbs.

Anothcr approach is to compile dictionaries using some teclxmques of lexical knowledge acquisition.
One ~nch approach is to extract hierarclfical relations or it thesanrtm of conceptual items froln hunLall dictionaries in an automatic way.

lie sidcs these rcseasches, there are other several research activitics tbr lexical knowledge acquisition, which syntactically anMyze the sentences m large corpora and attcmpt to extract lcxical knowledge from statistical data \[3\] \[1\].
Most of the works undertake shallow analysis of texts and they extract only superticial lexical information.
For the development of tile techniques of knowledge acquisition from natural language texts, it is very important to improve the httter approach of cornpiling semantic dictionaries by comimter l)rograuL~.
Ilowever, there are at least two basic difficulties in this at)preach 1.
Tire i~robh~m (ff syntactic ambiguities When analyzing a sentence., syntactic ambiguities often remain.
So i~ is not easy to obtain correct parsed results automatically.
2. The, probh~rrr of polyue,my it often happens that one word has several meanings and corre.sponrls to,~cveral concepts.
So it is not easy to associate one sm'fa~e word with olle correct conceptHal item.
Our approach to solve these diiliculties is to make use of translatitm cxarnples in two distinct languages that have quite different syntactic structures and word mf~anings (such as English and Japanese), and to c(nnt~are analyzed results from each language, h| many (:asc~, the two languagcs }Lave different types of syntactic ambiguities, anti comparison of syntactic structures of both bmguagcs helps to resolve the ambiguities.
Also, a pair of bilingually equivalent snrface words helps to a~'4ociate tile words with conceptual Ac~s DECOLING-92, NANTIiS, 23-28 AOIJT 1992 5 8 1 l'~oc.

23-28, 1992 words helps to associate the words with conceptual items, because the intersection of conceptual items that each surface word has could be considered as one conceptual item\[ll\] \[2\].
\["or example, in tire case of the translation example given in Example 1, both syntactic and semantic ambiguities are resolved.
Example 1 E: I hung my coat on the hook.
J: ~:L (I) ;~ (topic) ~2~ (coat) ~ (ca.se-m~trker) ~'5" (hook) lZ (case-marker) zi'$~'f: (hung)o 1.
Syntactic disumbiguation The English sentence in Example 1 is syntactically ambiguous because the prepositional phrase "on the hook" can modify both the verb "hung" aad tim noun phrase "my coat" using grammatical knowledge only.
On the other band, in the Japanese sentence, the phrase "7)~ ~', Is_" can modify nothing but the verb "~t;tf:".
Thus, if knowledge about word equivalence pairs such as ( I, ~, ), (hung, ~'~t t: ), (coat, _t-.a ), (hook, ~' g ) are available from bilingual dictionaries, the ambiguity of pp-attachment is resolved by syntactically matching the structures of the two sentences.
2. Semantic disambiguation The verb "~)~l~ ~" in tile Japanese sentence is a typical Japanese polyserny.
This verb has six subentries in a Japanese dictionary that has about 70,000 entries, and ten English equivalent verbs ( "hang", "spend", "play", etc).
in a JapaneseEnglish dictionary that has about 50,000 entries.
So, it is not easy to associate the surface word "~qJ'~" with its exact meaning.
Ilowever, with the translation examl)le, the corresponding English verb such ms "hang" helps to find the meanirrg of the Japanese verb "7~19 ~,5''.
In this paper, we propose a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples in bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring lexical knowledge, such as case frames of verbs and attribute sets of nouns.
In our framework, first a pair of sentences of both languages are syntactically analyzedtand translated into feature descriptions, which represent dependency structures of the pbrases in the sentences.
Although feature descriptions are generated by grarnmatical knowledge only, they are quite suitable to represent case frames of verbs.
Then these feature descriptions of the two languages are compared, or unified, using knowledge about word equivalence from bilingual dictionaries.
In this matching process, one word in the English sentence could be eqnivalent to several words in the translated Japanese 1Tbe Japanese morphological analyT~r lm.s 14 part of apeech and about 36,000 words.

sentence. Also one word in the Japanese sentence could be equivalent to several words in the translated English sentence.
In order to realize the matching process between two languages including these several word equivalence cases, we introduce a unification algorithm based on sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels in Chapter 2.
In Chapter 3, we statistically evaluated the process of syntactic disambiguation.
The success ratio of disambiguation is about 63~68 % for translation exampies in a Japanese-English dictionary.
At present, we have already collected about 50,000 translation exampies from a machine readable Japanese-English dictionary (Kodansha Japanese-English Dictionary \[10\]) and an English learners' textbook.
We have extracted case frames for several verbs as a simple experiment.
The results are described in Chapter 4.
2 Unification
of Feature Descriptions of Two Languages 2.1 Unification based on Sets of Compatible Pairs of Features and Values In our framework of sentence analysis, a sentence in each language is parsed and translated into feature descriptions, which represent dependency structures of the phrases in the sentence.
Ill this section, we basically use and extend Kasper and Rounds' notation of feature description logic (FDL \[6\]) to describe our unification algorithm of feature descriptions, except that we don't use path equivalence.
When unifying feature descriptions of two languages, knowledge about word equivalence taken from bilingual dictionaries is used to decide whether all atomic value of one language is compatible with an atomic value of the other language.
This is also the casc with feature labels.
Knowledge about word equivalence from bilingual dictionaries can be regarded as knowledge about compatibility of atomic values and feature labels of feature descriptions.
From this standpoint, we introdnce a unification algoritlHn based on sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels.
Data Structure Let A and L be sets of symbols used to denote atomic values and feature labels.
Let CA and CL be sets of compatible pairs of atomic values and feature labels.
That is, (/A is the set of pairs of atomic values such as (ai,aj)(al, aj ~_ A), where al and u i are consistent and mfifiable, and Ct.
is the set of pairs of feature labels like {li,lj)(li,lj C L), where li and lj are consistent AC't'ES DE COLING-92, NANTES, 23-28 AOt~rr 1992 5 8 2 PROC.

The syntax for formulas of the FDL with Sets of Compatible Pairs (FDLC) is given below.

When applying this algorithm to unify fe.aturc descriptions between two languages, we col lect all possible unified feature descriptions and lind the most overlapping Ulfifier by a scoring function, which is introdneed later.
The following detinition of UNIFY returns one possible unified feature description.
We collect all possible nnitied feature descriptions.
Function UNIFY(f,g) returns one possible unified feature description: where f attd g are featur)e descmptions.
1. If f =NIL, then return g 2.
Else if g = N1L, then return f 3.
Else if f = TOP or g = TOP, then return "1'01" 4.

tense : past t:~ : pred : ?eL \] pred : ~ \] ~¢ pred : ~ \] Set of Compatible Pairs of Atomic Values Knowledge about word equivalence is extracted from bilingual dictionaries m order to construct CA.
First, for each word in the English sentence, equivalent Japanese words are extracted from English-Japanese dictionaries, and for each word in the Japanese sentence, equivalent English words are extracte.d from Japanese-English dictionaries 4, Using this knowledge, any possible pairs of equivalent cotttent words s that are included in the original sentences are collected, and CAD, the set of these equivalent (i.e.
coml)atible ) word pairs, is constructed.
Then for all other content words WND~, s in the English ~ntenee and WN1)Jap in the Japanese sentence, any possible pairs (WN:)¢~g, WNDiap) are collected, which comprise CAN9.
Finally, CA is defined ms CA:) U CAND.
In the case of Example 2, CA:), CAN:) and CA are shown below.
CA~9 and CAND are constructed only for the content words, so ill this ease CaN9 is ~ (an empty set).
CAn = {(write, ~ (), (I, ~1,), (letter, :~\]~ ), (pencil, ~t~)}, CAN\]) = ~, CA = CAD tJ CAND Set of Compatible Pairs of Feature Labels In our framework of unification between two languages, we assmne that the set of compatible pairs of feature labels, CL, is constructed based on statistical data.
That is, each feature label pair (li,lj) in CL has a probability plj(O < Pij <_ 1) calculated from statistical data.
This Pij represents the probability that the semantic role of feature Ii in a specific feature description of one lamguage is the same as that of feature l.i ill another specific feature description of the other language.
For exaurple, for a specific English Japanese verb pair (write, ~~ ), the feature label pair (sub j, ¢)¢ ) is,~ssumed to have a probability P,ubL ~" And for anotlmr English--Japanese verb pair (read, ~t2 ), ttle feature label pair (subj, :b ¢ ) is assmned to have another probahility qsubj, h'.
Since we are at the starting point of our project of lexical knowledge acquisition, we initially assign 1 to tire probability of each feature label pair, except 4At pre~ent, we use a Japan~e-English dictionary only, which has about 50,0(}0 entries.
5Words are divided into two categories: content words mid fmlctional word~.
Content words are ones which can be the head of a phrase, such ms i1o1111$ and verbs.
for pairs that are known not to have ttle same case role from some grammatical knowledge.
These exceptional pairs are not contained ill CL, i.e., tlmir probabilities are 0.
In fact, for the purpose of lexical knowledge acquisition, it is sufficient to assume the probability as 1 or 0, because we need credible results for extracting lexical knowledge about the usages of words.
The Most Overlapplng Unifier The scoring function SCOR.E(h) calculates the validity of a unified feature description h.
This function returns a 2-tnple of real numbers s, (xl,x2) (xl,x2 E R(set of real numbers)), where xl is the number of word pairs extracted from bilingual dictionaries and contained ill the unified feature description, on the other hand x~ is tile number of word pairs aLso contained in the unified feature description but not extracted from bilingual dictionaries.
More precisely, xl corresponds to tile number of word pairs (Wo,~9, WDjop) in the unified feature description that are elements of CAD, and x~ corresponds to the number of word pairs (WND~,s, WNOj,p) in the unified feature description that are elements of CAN D . The order among scores is defined as follows: {xt,x2) is greater tban (Yl,~) iff.
xl >yl or (xt =yt,x2 >y2) The most overlapping unifiers are the ones with the greatest score.
The complete definition of the scoring function is given below.
Function SCORE(h) returns (xl, x~) (xl, x2 (5 R(set of real numbers)): where h is a unified feature description.
1. If h E CAJg, then return (1, 0) 2.
Else if h E CAND, then return (0, 1) 3.

3 Syntactic
Disambiguation: Experiment and Evaluation in order to evaluate how well syntactic ambiguities of translation examples are resolved, we made all experiment of syntactic disambiguation using 189 translation examples extracted from a J apanese-English dictionary.
Firstly, each sentence of a translation exampie is syntactically analyzed and translated into feature descriptions.
For 44 translation examples, syntactic analysis of tile Japanese or English sentence is faile.d.
For those which are successfully analyzed, the average number of feature descriptions generated from one scntcncc is 4.4 for Japanese and 17.1 for English.
Secondly, these feature descriptions are unified.
After this process of syntactic disamhiguation, from 86 translation examples, a uniquc ee~sc framc of the unified verb pair of Japanese and English is acquired.
Calculating from this result, the success ratio of acquiring unified case frames of verbs, (the number of translation examples such that a unique unified case frame of verbs is acquired from each translation exampie)/ (tile uumher of translation examples such that each sentence is successfully analyzed), is 86/145 = 59.3%.
And the success ratio of syntactic disambiguation, (tile number of sentences such that a unique ease frame of the verb is acquircd from more than one feature descriptions)/ (tile number of sentences such that more than one feature descriptions are originally generated), is 70/103 = 68.0% for Japanese, and 84/133 = 63.2% for English.
4 Lexical
Knowledge Acquisition of Verbs 4.1 Acquiring Case Frames of Verbs As described ill 2.2, a feature description unified between English aud Japanese is as below.
pred : (write, ~ < ) tense : past obj ¢~ pred : (letter ~5.\]~ ) F pred <p,,,ea, ) I ( h -c ) / .wtt, " : L spec : a J This feature description tells that tile verbal concept represented hy tile pair of the English verb "tv~te" and the Japane~qe verb "~ <" have at least three eases that are marked by some syntactic information mid some surface functional words such as (subj, *2 ), (obj, ~ ), (with, T' ).
it also tells that each case takes a certain nominal coueept represented by tile pair of English and Japanese words, such as U, *h >, <fetter, ~;:~ ), (pe,leit, ~ ).
Once a large amount of this kind of data is collected, statistical data ahout case frames of verbs eaal he extracted, making use of a thesaurus of nominM concepts 7.
In the remainder of this section, we will illustrate a general procedure for acquiring case frames of verbs.
Lct us start with a collection of a large amount of unified feature descriptions like above for a specific Japanesc verb V~.
Suppose that we want to get possible case frames of this verb.
By a case frame, we mean something tikc a feature description for this verb, consisting of surface cases each of which is marked hy a postpositional particlc p~ and some specific semantic categories taken from a thesaurus like BGI\[.
Usually, a verh has several distinct case frames.
However, it is not easy to extract those case frames automatically only from the collected unified feature descriptions.
So the system finds critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verh using some heuristics, then it asks tile human instructor whether the distinctions of ease frames arc correct.
These heuristics and human interactions arc smmnarized as follows.
7At present, ~m oiL-line thesaurus called 'Bunrui Goi Hyou'(BGH)\[8\] is available for Japanese.
BGII has a sixlayered abstraction hierarchy mrd more t|mat 60,OOO words are assigned at the leaves.
At the presettt stage, it is ntot certain whether this the~sautim is reliable enouglt for our initial research target of acquiring case frames of verbs.
It is, however~ the most precise and broad coveri|kg 3apsmeae thesaurus obtahtable for us, currently.

OF COLING-92, NAN'I'ES, AUG.
23-28, 1992 Heuristics 1.
Semantic Categor'y in a Thesaurus First, collect the nouns marked by pj in a feature description of the verb Vj from the set of unified feature descriptions.
Then mark each collected noun in the thesaurus.
If the most specific common layer of the marked nouns is low enough, then we assume that the case marked by pj takes a noun of the semantic category that corresponds to that layer.
But if the most specific common layer is higher than a predetermined layer s, the information provided by that layer is too general for tile semantic categories of the case marked by pj.
For instance, it is quite rare that both an animate concept and an abstract concept can be the subject of a certain verb.
Such a case strongly suggests that the verb has at least two distinct conceptual meanings or two distinct case frames.
It then becomes necessary to classify the marked nouns in the thesaurus.
2. Bilingual Intersection of Concepts Some of the heuristics come from the advantages of bilingual intersection of concepts, which we have already shows in Chapter 1 as semantic disambiguation.
For a Japanese verb Vj and its case marked by a postpositional particle p j, suppose that unified feature descriptions such as \[ pred:(VEl,Vj), (IEI,pj):{NE1,NJI) \] and \[ pred:(VE2, Vj), (IE2,pJ):(NE2,NJ2) \] are ohtained.
Both of these two feature descriptions have a feature label pj for Vj.
llowever, if VE1 and V~2 are different verbs or IEl and IE2 are different feature labels, these two feature descriptions may be classified into different case frames of the verb Vj.
3. Correlation of Cases Another heuristics are related to sentence patterns of verbs.
Sometimes the ease marked by pj has a correlation with other eases in sentence patterns.
If the correlations between cases are detected, then it helps tile classification, and some sentence patterns (or c0.se frames) of the verb Vj will be aeqnired.
Human Interactions As described above, the system can find critical points to distinguish possible case frames for a verb by those heuristics.
The system, however, cannot determine the distinction only with positive data collected from examples.
The main purpose of human interaction is to obtain negative examples.
The system asks the human instructor whether a case marked by p J1 and another case marked by P J2 call co-occur or not.
If STile \])redetermined layers depend on tile thesaurus we are dealing with.

they cannot co=occur, then the system learns that Vj }lets at least two sentence patterns (or case frames) and that one of them has the case marked by P J1 and tile other has the case marked by P J2An example of human interactions of this type is shown in next section.
It is often said that hand-made semantic dictionary contains quite unstable data, which means that it strongly depends on the human composer.
In order to acquire stable lexicat knowledge base, we decided to limit hmnan interactions to yes-no type of questions and answers, such that the system asks the human instructor whether something is true or false so that he can answer only yes or no.
4.2 Examples
and Evaluations Wc have collected about 50,000 translation exampies from a machine readable dal)anese-English dictionary and an English learners' textbook.
In this bilingual corpus, about 70 distinct Japanese verbs appear in more than 100 examples.
We have obtained unified feature descriptions for several verbs which appeared more than 200 times.
From them we have gotten some case frames.
In this experiment we used the set of semantic markers defined in IPAL \[4\], listed in Table 1.
Table 2 shows the case slots of "~ < (write)" extracted from 207 translation examples.
In the process of extraction, bilingual feature label pairs are quite uscfut to find different case slots that are marked by the same postpositional particle in Japanese.

One of them represents things on which smnething is written like in "wrile something on, sh~:et of paper", and the other reI)resents someone to whom a correspondence is written, like ill "wtalc a letter to a lover".
The difference of these two usages is clear by tit(: bilingual feature label pairs (on, ~= ) and (to, {~ ).
'File human instructor answers that only these two ease slots cannot co-occur.
Then two case frames are obtained as in Table 3.
This simple experiment suggests that it is quite possible to acquire case frames of verbs from bilingual corpora if enough translation examples are available.
Actually, on tim assumption that 200 translation examples arc necessary for acquiring case framcs of onc verb, 100,000 translation examples are necessary for 70 verbs.
If a bilingual corpus of 1,000,000 translation examples is obtained, it is possible to compile a semantic dictionary with the same scale as IPAI, through a little interaction with a human instructor for each verb.
Wc think it possible to construct a bilingual corl)us of that scale or more in the near fitlure, 5 Concluding Remarks We haw~ proposed a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples of bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring case frames of verbs.
At present, we are extending our prototype system for acquiring case frames of verbs, attd the detail of the extended system will be reported in the future.
