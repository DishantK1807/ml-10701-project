Such action may include verifying the user's input, reprompting for fresh input, or, in cases where many errors have occurred, changing the interaction strategy or switching the caller to a human attendant (Smith, 1998; Litman et al., 1999; Langkilde et al., 1999).

We included these features to determine the extent to which particulars of task, subject, or interaction influenced ASR success rates or our ability to predict them; previous work showed that these factors impact TOOT's performance (Litman and Pan, 1999; Hirschberg et al., 1999).

Several other studies (Wade et al., 1992; Oviatt et al., 1996; Swerts and Ostendorf, 1997; Levow, 1998; Bell and Gustafson, 1999) report that hyperarticulated speech, characterized by careful enunciation, slowed speaking rate, and increase in pitch and loudness, often occurs when users in human-machine interactions try to correct system errors.

TOOT Corpus Our corpus consists of a set of dialogues between humans and TOOT, an SDS for accessing train schedules from the web via telephone, which was collected to study both variations in SDS strategy and user-adapted interaction (Litman and Pan, 1999).
