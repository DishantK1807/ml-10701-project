The results of our experiments are computed using mention-based CEAF scoring (Luo, 2005), and are reported in Table 2.

The weights are then averaged across all iterations of the perceptron, as in (Collins, 2002).
W02-1001
(Nakano et al., 2003) shows that body posture predicts turn boundaries, but does not show that these features improve performance beyond a text-only system.

There are few other reported results for coreference resolution on spontaneous, unconstrained speech; (Strube and MÂ¨uller, 2003) similarly finds low overall scores for pronoun resolution on the Switchboard Corpus, albeit by a different scoring metric.
