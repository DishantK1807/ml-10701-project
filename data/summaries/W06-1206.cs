In this paper we investigate semi-automatic methods for error mining and detection of missing lexical entries, following van Noord (2004), with the subsequent handling of the MWEs among them.

of Errors: Overview van Noord (2004) reports on various errors that have been discovered for the Dutch Alpino Grammar (Bouma et al., 2001) semi-automatically, using the Twente Nieuws Corpus.

While Baldwin (2005) makes predictions for each unknown word, we create a new lexical entry for each occurrence of the unknown word.

To do this, first we propose to use the World Wide Web as a very large corpus from which we collect evidence that enables us to rule out noisy cases (due to spelling errors, for instance), following Grefenstette (1999), Keller et al.(2002), Kilgarriff and Grefenstette (2003) and Villavicencio (2005).

The approach presented is based on that of van Noord (2004) and proposes a set of MWE candidates.

van Noord (2004), for instance, takes a statistical approach towards semi-automated error detection using the parsability metric for word sequences.

Among them, one common error, and subsequently very common cause of parse failure is due to Multiword Expressions (MWEs), like phrasal verbs (break down), collocations (bread and butter), compound nouns (coffee machine), determiner-less PPs (in hospital), as well as socalled “frozen expressions” (by and large), as discussed by both Baldwin et al.(2004) and van Noord (2004).

With the efficient parameter estimation algorithms discussed by Malouf (2002), the training of the model is now very fast.

Similar to Baldwin (2005), we also treat the problem as a classification task.

> can be evaluated by maximising the pseudo-likelihood on a training corpus (Malouf, 2002).

of MWEs and related constructions Recently, many researchers have started using the World Wide Web as an extremely large corpus, since, as pointed out by Grefenstette (1999), the Web is the largest data set available for NLP ((Grefenstette, 1999), (Keller et al., 2002), (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003) and (Villavicencio, 2005)).

The idea pursued by van Noord (2004) has been to locate those n-grams in the input that might be the cause of parsing failure.
P04-1057
In the case of van Noord (2004), the word sequences are used, mainly because the cost to compute and count the word sequences is minimum.
P04-1057
In order to pinpoint the errors, we used the error mining techniques proposed by van Noord (2004) on the grammar and corpus.
