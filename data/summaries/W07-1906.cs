To develop a model of nonverbal grounding, Nakano et al.(2003) studEarly Late Time of Interaction I m po r t a n c e f o r R a ppo r t Mutual Attention Positivity Coordination Figure 1.

In order to do this, we replicate the task we used in our earlier grounding study (Nakano et al., 2003); that is we use a direction-giving task, where half the subjects can see one another, and half are divided by a screen.

This technique, which we used in our earlier grounding experiment (Nakano et al., 2003) allows us insight into the probable causality of the behaviors of speaker and hearer, across verbal and nonverbal behavior.

Nonverbal behavior in giver and receiver was coded using the following categories, based on Nakano, et al.(2003): • Look at Speaker – looking at the speaker’s eyes, eye region or face.

This work has in turn, received a significant amount of attention in computational linguistics, specifically in the study of dialogue (Matheson, Poesio, & Traum, 2000; Nakano, Reinstein, Stocky, & Cassell, 2003; Traum, 1994; Traum & Dillenbourg, 1998).

In the sense that we are modifying the linguistic style of the dialogue based on psychological attributes, our approach is similar to work by Mairesse & Walker (2007) and Isard et al.(2006). In both cases, a broad set of natural language generation parameters is employed to generate language that differs along a personality dimension, based on a number of previous empirical studies.

In order to handle the multimodal phenomena that participate in grounding in face-to-face conversation, as Nakano et al.(Nakano et al., 2003) have shown, a model of knowledge coordination needs to have more frequently updated access to potential grounding events.
