You could map a non-projective dependency tree to a projective one, learn and predict the tree, then bring it back to the non-projective dependency tree (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).

We use the terminology in (Taskar et al., 2004) for a generic structured output prediction, and define a part.

It is not rare to see dependency relations used as features, in tasks such as relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) and machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005).

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of (McDonald et al., 2005) in the various languages given by the CoNLL 2006 shared task for non-projective labeled dependency parsing.

The following is a nice summary by (McDonald et al., 2005).

The paper is structured as follows: in section 2 and 3, we review the decoding and learning aspects of (McDonald et al., 2005), and in section 4, we describe the extension of the algorithm and the features needed for the CoNLL 2006 shared task.

Non-projective dependency parsing can also be represented as search for a maximum spanning tree in a directed graph, and this technique has been shown to perform well in Czech (McDonald et al., 2005).

Using a variant of the voted perceptron (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004; Crammer and Singer, 2003), we discriminatively trained our parser in an on-line fashion.

Learning Again following (McDonald et al., 2005), we have used the single best MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003), which is a variant of the voted perceptron (Collins, 2002; Collins and Roark, 2004) for structured prediction.

Spanning Tree Algorithm As in (McDonald et al., 2005), the decoding algorithm we used is the Chu-Liu-Edmonds (CLE) algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) for finding the Maximum Spanning Tree in a directed graph.

We have extended non-projective unlabeled dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005) to a very simple non-projective labeled dependency and showed that the parser performs reasonably well with small number of features and just one iteration of training.
