The parsers can be tested via WWW t. 2 Background Our work is partly based on the work done with the Constraint Grammar framework that was originally proposed by Fred Karlsson (1990).

A concise introduction to the formalism is also to be found in Samuelsson et al.(1996) and Hurskainen (1996).

This kind of restriction is present in many dependency-based parsing systems (McCord, 1990; Sleator and Temperley, 1991; Eisner, 1996).

The ENGCG results compare to those reported elsewhere (J~rvinen, 1994; Tapanainen and J/~rvinen, 1994).
