Several researchers (Brent, 1993; Brent et al., 1995; Goldsmith, 2001) used Minimum Description Length (MDL) for morphology learning.

to Linguistica We compared our system with Linguistica, a publicly available unsupervised corpus-based morphology learner (Goldsmith, 2001).

Snover and Brent (2001) proposed a generative probability model to identify stems and suffixes.
P01-1063
Monson (2004) concentrated on languages with limited resources.
P04-2012
The WordFrame model (Wicentowski, 2004) uses inflection-root pairs, where unseen inflections are transformed into their corresponding root forms.
W04-0109
Schone and Jurafsky (2001) used latent semantic analysis to find affixes.
N01-1024
Baroni et al.(2002) produced a ranked list of morphologically related pairs from a corpus using orthographic or semantic similarity with minimum edit distance and mutual information metrics.
W02-0606
Creutz and Lagus (2002) proposed two unsupervised methods for word segmentation, one based on maximum description length, and one based on maximum likelihood.
W02-0603
We then compare our results from the whole TurEng data with the state-of-the-art Linguistica (Goldsmith, 2001) algorithm.

The Whole Word Morphologizer (Neuvel and Fulop, 2002) uses a POS-tagged lexicon as input, induces morphological relationships without attempting to discover or identify morphemes.
