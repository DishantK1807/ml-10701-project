Example of Template Element Objects 1 1 347 1 Overview of Information Extraction Task 1.1 Scenario-Dependent and Scenario-Independent Subtasks The overall goal of the Information Extraction (IE) task is to provide an evaluation of IE technology with reduced overhead and reduced non-NU requirements, as compared to recent MUCs . To enforce the requirements for reduced overhead, the participant preparation for the evaluation will consist of two stages . The first stage will be scenario-independent, and will begin well in advance of the evaluation ; the second stage of participant preparation, which is scenario-dependent, will start just one month prior to the evaluation . As currently envisioned, the task to be performed during test week will consist of two subtasks : SUBTASK 1.
2:85	Scenario Template evaluation, the so-called "Mini-MUC," is the traditional template-level subtask, where the participants are evaluated on whether the templates contain exactly the instantiated objects an d filled slots as specified in the scenario definition (and reflected in the answer key), with penalties for spurious, missing, and wrong objects and slot fills . SUBTASK 2.
3:85	Template Element evaluation, the so-called "predefined objects" evaluation . There are three types of Template Element objects, ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ARTIFACT.
4:85	One difficulty with the Scenario Template subtask is that it is subject to the "lynchpin" or "keystone" effect, where a decision whether to instantiate an object carries a high penalty if wrong (points off for each slot fill in that object under the All Objects scorin g method) . We can reduce the lynchpin effect by having a subtask which does not involve scenario-dependen t relevance criteria . Furthermore, this subtask is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step u p from the aggregation of the Named Entity task and the Coreference task . For example, for the Template Element evaluation, an ORGANIZATION object and all possible slots defined fo r that object type are to be instantiated for each organization mentioned in a given text, even if a given Scenari o Template task confines itself to organizations which are airplane manufacturers and requires an organization's typ e but not its location . For the Scenario Template evaluation, only those Template Element object and slot types that appear in the scenario task definition will be tested . ARTIFACT objects are handled somewhat differently fro m ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects . For ARTIFACT objects, the Scenario Template will define the particula r kind of artifact to be reported and the particular slots to be used from the Template Element BNF for ARTIFACT . The Template Element test for ARTIFACT will be limited to that type of artifact and to the scenario-define d ARTIFACT slots . 1.2 Evaluation Stage s STAGE 1 (with the announcement of the evaluation) . The participants are given the definitions for th e scenario-independent and scenario-neutral template elements (defined in this document) . The definitions in thi s document do not reflect the requirements of any particular scenario . The participants are also given one or more example IE scenario definitions and data sets, similar in nature (but not in content) to the Scenario Template task(s ) to be used for the actual evaluation . During stage 1, it is expected that the participants will develop their systems to perform on the Template Element evaluation subtask (especially ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects) and wil l design their system to be able to accomodate the template design requirements of Scenario Template task definition s to be released during stage 2 of the evaluation . STAGE 2 (one month prior to test week) . The participants are given one or two scenario definitions . During the course of this one-month period, the participants configure their system to produce the appropriate subset of the Template Elements and to produce the higher-level object(s) as defined in the scenario statement . The entire template for any given task is therefore fairly simple, consisting of one or more Template Element objects, only one scenario-specific (high-level) object, and perhaps a relational object . The number of slots (other than pointer slots ) that do not come from the set of Template Elements will be five or less . 1.3 Levels of Template Structure Four levels of template objects are defined : LEVEL 1 (Template Element) . The objects and slots defined in this document.
5:85	These are generic Template Elements which may play a role in virtually any task scenario . These template elements are not oriented toward s any particular task, but instead attempt to capture the sort of information that may be needed for a wide range of tasks.
6:85	All of these objects are fairly simple and have no relational information (i .e. , no pointers to other objects) . For 349 a given IE scenario, only a subset of the predefined Template Element objects will be used ; in addition, one or more slots might be ignored from the Template Element objects that are used . LEVEL 2 (Relational Object -optional).
7:85	Objects which define a relation between generic Templat e Elements and scenario-specific ones . These relations are not included in the Template Element objects, for th e purpose of generality and simplicity.
8:85	For example, a Relational object may consist of a pointer to a n ORGANIZATION object (generic), a pointer to a PERSON object (generic), a slot representing the role that the : person has in that organization (scenario-specific), and, perhaps, a slot containing temporal information (generic) . LEVEL 3 (Scenario Template Object).
9:85	For each IE scenario, it is envisioned that there will be exactly one scenario-specific object type.
10:85	It captures the essential relation or event of interest in the task . This object type wil l have pointers to the Template Element object types appropriate for the task, as well as pointers to any Relationa l objects defined for the task.
11:85	It may also contain slots that are defined as part of the Template Element subtask . LEVEL 4 (Top-Level Template Object).
12:85	For each text that is relevant to an IE scenario, there will be exactly one Top-Level Template object . It will identify the text and will contain one or more pointers to Scenario Templat e objects.
13:85	2 Scenario-Dependent Subtask: General Descriptio n An IE scenario task is to identify all information in each input text that is defined to be relevant by the tas k definition in the scenario Fill Rules document, and to construct a representation of the relevant information in th e format specified by the BNF.
14:85	For any given IE scenario, the following will be provided : NARRATIVE . Paragraph that briefly describes the scenario topic and the relevance criteria . The narrative will be used by the evaluation designers in formulating a text retrieval query that will return candidate test se t documents from the MUC-6 corpus . BNF DEFINITION . Will include one or more of the Template Element objects or slots defined in thi s document, plus any scenario-specific and relational objects needed for the scenario.
15:85	Primarily defines the syntax o f the template . FILL RULES.
16:85	Will describe the reporting conditions and the semantics of each object and slot . The Template Element objects will have separate minimum conditions and slot descriptions that are available during the first stag e of evaluation ; additional reporting conditions may be imposed in the fill rules for a particular scenario (e .g. , instead of reporting all organizations, a scenario may only require reporting airplane manufacturing companies) . EXAMPLE BASE.

It should be noted that for purposes of scoring, normalized fills and string fills are equivalent, i .e. , the scoring software strips off external double quotes from fills for slots that are defined as taking normalized fills or string fills . SET FILL.
19:85	To be filled in by selection from a prespecified list of categories defined in the fill rules for a give n slot.
20:85	35 1 STRING FILL.
21:85	To be filled in with an exact copy of a text string from the article under analysis.
22:85	The fill may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired . See the "Tokenization Rules" document for information on wha t counts as a word token in certain special cases . NORMALIZED FILL.
23:85	To be filled with a text string that is converted to a canonical form in accordance wit h the fill rules for a given slot.
24:85	The fill may be enclosed in double quotes, if desired . INDEX FILL (POINTER).
25:85	To be filled with the index of an object, i .e. , a pointer to an object . The fill is to be enclosed in angled brackets . 3.1.2.2 Object Identifiers All objects are identified by the object name (from the template BNF), the document number (from the DOCNO ta g in the text), and a one-up number; a dash is used to separate those three elements.
26:85	For Wall Street Journal articles, the dash internal to the value of DOCNO must be suppressed ; thus, a valid ORGANIZATION object identifier for DOCNO 891026-0100 would be <ORGANIZATION-8910260100-1> . 3.1.2.3 Notation Reserved for Use in Answer Key s Legitimate ambiguity or vagueness in the text is reflected in the answer key by the presence of alternative acceptable fills . The "I" notation is reserved for this use ; such fills are *not* to be generated by the system unde r evaluation . The notation allows the answer key to present alternate acceptable single fills for a slot, alternate sets o f fills for a slot, optional fills (one fill or zero fills), and combinations thereof.
27:85	An object is treated as optional if al l pointers to it are either optional or in a list of alternatives . Since the Template Element subtask does not include the creation of pointers to the template element objects, th e optionality of ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ARTIFACT objects is indicated via the OBJ_STATUS slot within the optional object itself.
28:85	The OBJ_STATUS slot is not used for the Scenario Template subtask . The COMMENT slot may contain notes that the analyst wants to record concerning the answer key . The slot is not scored.
29:85	(Analysts should avoid entering double quotes within the comment, as they will prevent the template-fillin g tool, Tabula Rasa, from being able to reload the template file .) 3.2 Fill Rules The input text contains some SGML tags, including TXT ; the IE task is to be performed on the text delimited by the TXT, HL, DATELINE, and DD tags .
30:85	(Note, however, that the DD tag sometimes doesn't appear at all, sometime s appears once, and sometimes appears twice .) Lines within the <TXT> portion of the article that start with the "@" sign signify a table or other special lin e formatting within the text and should NOT be used for extraction .
31:85	(However, such lines may also appear within the <HL> portion of the article, and these should be analyzed for extractable material .) 3.2.1 TEMPLATE Objec t DEFINITION : Top-level object . Applies to Scenario Template subtask only . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : For every Scenario Template, instantiate one TEMPLAT E object.
32:85	3.2.1.1 DOC_NR Slot DEFINITION : Article identifier.
33:85	To be copied from the DOCNO tagged string in the text.
34:85	Normalize the string to remove any internal dashes, e .g. , 870101-0001 becomes 8701010001 . This slot is not scored; it is used only to assist people in associating the template with the original article . 3.2.1.2 CONTENT Slot DEFINITION : Pointer to object that captures info relevant to a given scenario . It is possible for CONTENT to have multiple values, corresponding to different relevant events described . Relevant events are defined as bein g different when the value of one slot in the scenario object is incompatible with the value of another . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . 3.2.2 ORGANIZATION Object 352 DEFINITION : Corporate, governmental, or other kind of organization . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Text must refer to a particular organization and must provide fill for at least one of the following slots : ORG_NAME, ORG_DESCRIPTOR . 3.2.2.1 ORG_NAME Slot DEFINITION : The proper name of the organization, including any corporate designators (see referenc e document titled "Table of Corporate Designator Abbreviations") . If a document contains more than one variant of the name, the ORG_NAME slot is to be filled with the most complete variant . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The name must appear in the text . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
35:85	This slot has a 0 or 1 valence to allow the situation where an unnamed organization participates in an even t (or relation) of interest and is perhaps referenced only by a descriptive phrase . 2.
36:85	If an organization is changing name, report the current name as ORG_NAME and the past or future name a s ORG_ALIAS.
37:85	3.
38:85	See "Named Entity Task Definition" for information on treatment of names such as "McDonald's of Japan ." 3.2.2.2 ORG_ALIAS Slot DEFINITION: Variant of the proper name entered in the ORG_NAME slot . There may be more than on e value for this slot . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The variant must appear explicitly in the text.
39:85	This slot ca n be filled only if ORG_NAME is filled also . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
40:85	Misspelled variants of the name reported in ORG_NAME are to be reported in ORG_ALIAS . 2.
41:85	If the organization is involved in a name change, report the current name as ORG_NAME, and the past or future name as ORG_ALIAS . 3.2.2.3 ORG_DESCRIPTOR Slot DEFINITION : Noun phrase describing or referring to an organization without naming it . This slot is not permitted to have more than one value . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Text must provide a string that describes the organizatio n and that does not fit the definition of the ORG_NAME slot . Strings that are used in the article to describe a set o f organizations are not candidates for this slot, e .g. , "the two new subsidiaries."
42:85	SPECIAL USAGE NOTES: 1.
43:85	This slot is intended to capture information on the organization other than its name or alias . Therefore, the string fill for this slot is not permitted to contain the name or alias, which means that the fill will sometimes be a substring of a full noun phrase . The substring could be a premodifier noun or noun phrase or a head noun o r noun phrase; it cannot be a non-NP (e .g. , cannot be a possessive, prepositional phrase, or a pure adjective) . Below are a few examples of complex NPs with descriptor substrings : "the law firm Smith Blarney" (descriptor is "the law firm" ) "ABC Corp's XYZ subsidiary" (descriptor is "subsidiary " 2.
44:85	The answer key will not contain any "insubstantial" descriptors, which includes pronouns (e .g. , "it") and simple noun phrases whose head is one of the following nouns : "administration" "agency" "board" "committee" "company" "concern " "corporation" "firm" "government" 353 "institution" "unit" By "simple noun phrases," we mean ones that consist only of the bare head and ones that are modified onl y by a determiner (e.g. , "the," "his," "this") or by an optional determiner and a proper noun string containing th e name/alias of the company in question . Taking the word "unit" as an example, the following usages of it would be regarded as insubstantial, where the expressions constitute the complete NP : "unit" (as a bare noun, perhaps in a headline ) "the unit" "his unit" "that unit" "the ABC Corp . unit" (where "unit" refers to "ABC Corp .") "XYZ Corp.'s ABC Corp . unit" ("unit" refers to "ABC Corp.") As a consequence of this guideline, an ORGANIZATION object will not be instantiated if the text provide s no name and if the only descriptive information on it is an insubstantial descriptor . 3.
45:85	All other descriptive noun phrases will be included as alternatives in the answer key . Thus, even the "insubstantial" head nouns listed above may occur in substantial noun phrases . For example, the following usages of "unit" would be regarded as substantial, and the entire phrase would be generated a s ORG_DESCRIPTOR : "a unit of ABC Corp ." "the ABC Corp. unit" (where "unit" refers to an org *other* than "ABC Corp .") "the new unit" "the New York unit" (even though "New York" would also appear in ORG_LOCALE ) "the unit based in New York" 4.
46:85	The answer key will contain alternative fills when the full NP contains one of the following types o f modifiers/adjuncts, which are considered to be either of no interest to the database or of questionable parse an d limited interest to the database: a. possessive pronoun premodifier, e .g. , "its most profitable subsidiary" (alternate fill is "most profitable subsidiary") b. temporal adverbials, e .g. , "now the most profitable subsidiary"(alternate fill is "most profitabl e subsidiary") c. loose adjunct, e.g., a nonrestrictive relative clause or similar type of full or reduced clause, as in "th e profitable subsidiary, which announced increased earnings again this quarter" (alternative fill is "the profitabl e subsidiary") or "the profitable subsidiary, being the second-smallest of all the company's subsidiaries" (alternative fill is "the profitable subsidiary" ) 5.
47:85	To qualify as a descriptor, the noun phrase does not have to be definite (e .g. , it may be modified by th e indefinite article "a").
48:85	Thus, the phrases enclosed between asterisks in the following examples are allowabl e fills for ORG_DESCRIPTOR for General Dynamics Corp.: "*A major government contracting firm* announced today that it has won a new contract . General Dynamics Corp . said" "General Dynamics Corp . is *a major government contracting firm* ." "General Dynamics Corp ., *a major government contracting firm*,  ." 3.2.2.4 ORG_TYPE Slot DEFINITION : Categorization of organization as a corporate entity, a government entity, or some other kin d of organizational entity.
49:85	MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The ORG_TYPE fill should be based on evidence from the text or on world knowledge; the slot should never be left blank . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
50:85	The categories that are to be used for ORG_TYPE are defined as follows : COMPANY -any profit-making or nonprofit legal (usually) entity, including universities, partnerships, corporations, proprietorsips, consortiums, enterprises, government-owned corporations, etc . GOVERNMENT -the government of a country, state, municipality, etc ., or government body such as a government ministry, agency, commission, or committee . In the case of a string such as "IBM announced a 354 joint venture with China," report "China" as type GOVERNMENT unless there is evidence for a different typ e elsewhere in the text . OTHER -organizational entities that do not fit the above categories, such as "the Apache Indian tribe, " "OPEC," "the Medellin cartel," "NATO ." 3.2.2.5 ORG_LOCALE Slot DEFINITION : Specific place where an organization is located.
51:85	Only the most specific place is to be reported.
52:85	(This will enable accurate, automatic scoring).
53:85	The literal string that appears in the text, plus a categorization of the place name, appear in this slot as a complex (two-part) fill . DO NOT ENCLOSE TH E LITERAL STRING IN DOUBLE QUOTES . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The locale name must be specifically mentioned in the tex t in either noun or adjective form . NOTE: Except in the case of organizations of type GOVERNMENT, the nam e itself is not to be used as a source of information for the ORG_LOCALE slot . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES: 1.
54:85	NAMES a. The "MUC-6 Reference Gazetteer" does not contain an exhaustive list of the place names that may b e used to fill the ORG_LOCALE slot, nor does it usually provide alternative spellings for place names . If the place name is given in the text in adjective form, e.g., "Philadelphian," and does not appear anywhere in the text in noun form, e .g. , "Philadelphia," report the name in adjective form . b. If the text provides only a relative locale such as "near Tokyo" or "60 miles from Tokyo", report "Tokyo" as ORG_LOCALE name . 2.
55:85	TYPES a. The location categories that are to be used for ORG_LOCALE are defined as follows : CITY -a town, city, port, suburb, or other local settlemen t PROVINCE -a state, province, island or similar subnational geographically or politically defined are a COUNTRY -a nation, country, colony, federation of countries such as the Confederation of Independent States (the former USSR), or other similar national entit y REGION -an international region such as Eastern Europe, the Pacific Rim, or the Malay Archipelago UNK -a location whose possible type cannot be identified from evidence in the text or from worl d knowledge.
56:85	Use UNK as locale type only if the type cannot be determined from the text . b. The "MUC-6 Reference Gazetteer" uses more location categories than are to be reported in ORG_LOCALE.
57:85	The following mappings apply : PORT and AIRPORT in gazetteer are to be reported as CITY in ORG_LOCALE.
58:85	ISLAND in gazetteer is to be reported as PROVINCE in ORG_LOCALE.
59:85	ISLAND-GROUP in gazetteer is to be reported as either PROVINCE (if part of a single country) or as REGION (if part of an international region) . CONTINENT in gazetteer is to be reported as REGION in ORG_LOCALE.
60:85	3.2.2.6 ORG_COUNTRY Slo t DEFINITION : The country or region in which ORG_LOCALE is located . A defining list of names i n contained in "MUC-6 Country and Region List ".
61:85	(This list contains only canonical forms.
62:85	NLP system developers must define their own mappings from the "MUC-6 Reference Gazetteer" and/or other gazetteer resources to thi s list.)
63:85	MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : To be filled if ORG_LOCALE is filled, even if fill must be inferred.
64:85	Also to be filled if country can be inferred from certain other text expressions (see item 5 under Specia l Usage Notes, below) . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.If ORG_LOCALE is filled in by a name of type COUNTRY or REGION, report the name in this slot as a normalized form drawn from "MUC-6 Country and Region List" . 2.
65:85	Adjective forms such as "Asian" and "Japanese" should be mapped to the noun form on the list, and th e noun form should be used as the slot fill . 355 3.
66:85	Note that the "MUC-6 Country and Region List" may not contain a complete list of countries and regions . If a canonical form for the name of the country or region does not appear on the list, report the name in noun or adjective form (whichever appears in the text) as a string fill . 4.
67:85	As a default, assume that "American" refers to "United States ." 5.
68:85	Certain text expressions that indicate an organization's country, such as "the domestic" and "the nation's" i n the examples below, occasion the ORG_COUNTRY slot to be filled, if the country referent can be inferred . "the domestic" <org> /* "the domestic company" */ "the nation's" <org> /* "the nation's largest carrier" */ 3.2.3 PERSON Object DEFINITION : An (unincorporated) person or family . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Text must supply fill for PER_NAME slot . The guideline s for instantiating a PERSON object are the same as the guidelines given in "Named Entity Task Definition" fo r annotating person names.
69:85	3.2.3.1 PER_NAME Slot DEFINITION : The proper name of the person or family . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The text must supply a person or family name.
70:85	3.2.3.2 PER_ALIAS Slot DEFINITION : Variant of the proper name reported in the PER_NAME slot . There may be more than one value for this slot . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The variant must appear explicitly in the text . This slot ca n be filled only if PER_NAME is filled also.
71:85	SPECIAL USAGE NOTES: 1.
72:85	Misspelled variants of the name reported in PER_NAME are to be reported in PER_ALIAS . 3.2.3.3 PER_TITLE Slot DEFINITION : An innate title such as "Dr".
73:85	or "Ms .," as distinct from a person's role such as "President" o r "CEO".
74:85	(The latter would be captured by a scenario-specific template element such as a Relational object .) MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : To be reported only if PER_NAME is filled . The text mus t explicitly mention the person's title . 3.2.4 ARTIFACT Object DEFINITION : A product or natural commodity . The nature of the specific artifact(s) to be reported is task dependent and is therefore defined for a given Scenario Template subtask in the scenario task documentation . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : The text must supply a fill for at least one of the followin g slots : ART_ID, ART_DESCRIPTOR . 3.2.4.1 ART_ID Slot DEFINITION : A unique identifier for the artifact . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . 3.2.4.2 ART_DESCRIPTOR Slot DEFINITION : Noun phrase describing or referring to an artifact without naming it.
75:85	This slot is not permitted to have more than one value.
76:85	MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Text must provide a string that describes the artifact an d that does not fit the definition of the ART_ID slot . The string cannot be a pronoun, e .g. , "it" SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
77:85	The answer key will provide alternative correct answers if the text supplies more than one substantiv e descriptor string . If the text provides only uninformative descriptors, e.g., "the product," the fills in the answer 356 key will all be marked as optional . 3.2.4.3 ART_TYPE Slot DEFINITION : A categorization of the artifact.
78:85	Inventory of categories depends on scenario definition . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . 3.2.5 Template Element Slot s DEFINITION : Task-independent slots (location and time data) that are separate from the predefined objects . They may be defined selectively for a given scenario, e .g. , to provide the location and time of an event . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
79:85	These slots will not be part of the Template Element evaluation . Instead, one or more of them may play a role in one or more Scenario Template subtasks . In such cases, their role will be defined in the scenario tas k documentation . 3.2.5.1 LOCALE Slot DEFINITION: Specific locale of an entity or event . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . 3.2.5.2 COUNTRY Slot DEFINITION: Country locale of an entity or event . MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . 3.2.5.3 DATE Slot DEFINITION: An absolute or relative date or date range.
80:85	MINIMUM INSTANTIATION CONDITIONS : Depends on scenario definition . SPECIAL USAGE NOTES : 1.
81:85	The YY option and DESCRIPTOR option are to be used only if the article contains no DD tags . Use YY if only a partial date is given in the text, e.g., "on 27 March ;" the output of extraction for that example would b e "ON 2703YY" . Use descriptor string option if a time phrase is used that cannot be represented in the usua l date format; for example, "last week" ("ON last week") or "Tuesday" ("ON Tuesday") . 2.
82:85	See separate documentation titled "A Revised Template Description for Time (v3)" and "Supplement t o Time Treatment Used for MUC-5" for further information . 357 APPENDIX A. Example of Template Element Object s These are examples of fills for the Template Element subtask that are extracted from a text in the MUC-5 corpus . The extracted information and the text itself appear below.
