The increased complexity leads to results contradicting Banko and Brill (2001), which we explore using ensembles of different contextual complexity.

222-229. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural 2 Automatic Thesaurus Extraction The development of large thesauri and semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), has allowed lexical semantic information to be leveraged to solve NLP tasks, including collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), model estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir, 2001) and text classi cation (Baker and McCallum, 1998).

Brill and Wu (1998) call this complementary disagreement complementarity.
P98-1029
The poorly constrained window methods, where contextual correlation is often low, outperformed the ensembles, which parallels results from (Banko and Brill, 2001).

term is modi ed by a prepositional phrase The relation tuple is then converted to root form using the Sussex morphological analyser (Minnen et al., 2000) and the POS tags are stripped.

All the systems use the JACCARD similarity metric and TTEST weighting function that were found to be most effective for thesaurus extraction by Curran and Moens (2002a).
P02-1030 W02-0908
Banko and Brill (2001) found that for confusion set disambiguation with corpora larger than 100 million words, the best individual classi ers outperformed ensemble methods.
P01-1005
Many systems extract co-occurrence and syntactic information from the words surrounding the target term, which is then converted into a vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).
P93-1024
Curran and Moens (2002b) have demonstrated that more complex and constrained contexts can yield superior performance, since the correlation between context and target term is stronger than simple window methods.
P02-1030 W02-0908
Curran and Moens (2002b) evaluate thesaurus extractors based on several different models of context on large corpora.
P02-1030 W02-0908
Ensemble learning has been successfully applied to numerous NLP tasks, including POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 1998), chunking (Tjong Kim Sang, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Pederson, 2000) and statistical parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999).

This section explores possible explanations for why our results disagree with Banko and Brill (2001).
P01-1005
Contrary to work reported by Banko and Brill (2001), the ensemble methods continue to outperform the best individual systems for very large corpora.
P01-1005
Recent work by Banko and Brill (2001) suggests that this would not necessarily be true if very large training corpora were available.
P01-1005
These results disagree with those Banko and Brill (2001) obtained for confusion set disambiguation.
