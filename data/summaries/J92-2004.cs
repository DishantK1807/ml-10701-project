And Daelemans (1987a,b, 1988) uses the object-oriented knowledge representation language KRS to implement default orthogonal inheritance networks for the lexical representation of phonological, orthographic, and morphological knowledge of Dutch and shows how such a lexicon architecture can be used for both language generation and automatic dictionary construction.

Kilbury et al.(1991) show how a DATR lexicon can be linked to a PATR syntax, while Andry et al.(in press) employ a DATR lexicon in the context of a Unification Categorial Grammar.

Perrault (1990) uses default logic to express a theory of speech acts, while Appelt and Konolige (1988) have deployed an extension to Moore's (1985) autoepistemic logic for the same purpose.

Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow (1985) proposed a treatment of lexical organization in which English subcategorization frames and inflectional morphology were handled within a default multiple inheritance network implemented in HPRL.

The work of Calder (1989) and his associates at Edinburgh and Stuttgart on "paradigmatic morphology" also fits within this tradition in that it invokes a restricted kind of default orthogonal inheritance for morphophonological description.

Thus Gibbon and Reinhard have made extensive use of DATR networks to describe lexical morphophonological phenomena such as German umlaut, Kikuyu tone, and Arabic vowel intercalation (Gibbon 1990b, in press; Reinhard 1990; Reinhard and Gibbon 1991).
E91-1023
Thus Joshi et al.(1984) and Lascarides and Asher (1991) have made the case for nonmonotonic logics in formalizing Gricean maxims, while Schubert and Hwang (1989) show how a probabilistic logic might be Used in story understanding.

Evans and Gazdar (1989a) outline the syntax and theory of inference for DATR, a language for lexical knowledge representation, and (1989b) they provide a semantics for the language that is loosely based on the approach taken by Moore (1985) in his semantics for autoepistemic logic.

212-213). A concern to preserve monotonic inheritance in HPSG is likewise evident in more recent work, such as Carpenter and Pollard (1991) and Zajac (this issue).
P91-1002
The latter is unusual in that stipulated exceptions do not automatically override an inherited default: the latter has to be explicitly negated if the grammar requires its suppression (compare Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow's (1985) approach to "blocking," noted above).

And Jacobs (1986, 1987) proposes a uniform hierarchical encoding of both linguistic and conceptual knowledge in a framebased formalism called ACE.

Examples include papers by Porter (1987), Emele and Zajac (1990), and Emele et al.(1990), who all use a semantics based on Ait-Kaci (1984); the use of sorts in Unification Categorial Grammar (Moens et al.1989); the CLE project (Alshawi et al.1989) and theoretical work by Smolka (1988).

A semantic analog of the monotonic type hierarchies discussed above in connection with syntax is manifested in the situation theoretic "infon lattices" introduced by Kameyama et al.(1991) to deal with meaning mismatches in machine translation.
