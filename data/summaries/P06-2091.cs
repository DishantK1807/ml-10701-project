3Method In this section, we present a method to derive TDL semantic representations from HPSG parse trees, adopting, in part, a previous method (Bos et al., 2004).
C04-1180
We measured the coverage of the construction of TDL semantic representations, in the manner described in a previous study (Bos et al., 2004).
C04-1180
Although this number is slightly less than 92.3%, as reported by Bos et al., (2004), it seems reasonable to say that the proposed method attained a relatively high coverage, given the expressive power of TDL.
C04-1180
For example, a system that translates the output of a robust CCG parser into semantic representations has been developed (Bos et al., 2004).
