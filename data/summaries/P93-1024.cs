Moving further in the direction of class-based language models, we plan to consider additional distributional relations (for instance, adjectivenoun) and apply the results of clustering to the grouping of lexical associations in lexicalized grammar frameworks such as stochastic lexicalized tree-adjoining grammars (Schabes, 1992).

Hindle (1990) proposed dealing with the sparseness problem by estimating the likelihood of unseen events from that of "similar" events that have been seen.

More recently, we have constructed similar tables with the help of a statistical part-of-speech tagger (Church, 1988) and of tools for regular expression pattern matching on tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 1992).

The data for this test was built from the training data for the previous one in the following way, based on a suggestion by Dagan et al.(1993). 104 noun-verb pairs with a fairly frequent verb (between 500 and 5000 occurrences) were randomly picked, and all occurrences of each pair in the training set were deleted.
