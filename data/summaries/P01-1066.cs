The ABOUT-COMMUNICATION domain reflects the system goal of managing the verbal channel and providing evidence of what has been understood (Walker, 1992; Clark and Schaefer, 1989).

The objective metrics focus on measures that can be automatically logged or computed and a web survey was used to calculate User Satisfaction (Walker et al., 2001).

Recent research on dialogue has been based on the assumption that dialogue acts provide a useful way of characterizing dialogue behaviors (Reithinger and Maier, 1995; Isard and Carletta, 1995; Shriberg et al., 2000; Di Eugenio et al., 1998).

Several research efforts have explored the use of dialogue act tagging schemes for tasks such as improving recognition performance (Reithinger and Maier, 1995; Shriberg et al., 2000), identifying important parts of a dialogue (Finke et al., 1998), and as a constraint on nominal expression generation (Jordan, 2000).

The experiment was designed to make it possible to apply the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 2000), which integrates and unifies previous approaches to evaluation (Price et al., 1992; Hirschman, 2000).
