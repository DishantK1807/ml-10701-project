The rules introduced below are shown in Lascarides and Asher (1991) to be manifestations of Gricean-style pragmatic maxims and world knowledge; we assume they form part of the reader's KB.

We will use a representation framework for discourse structure called SDRT (standing for Segmented Discourse Representation Theory) (Asher 1993), and a theory of discourse attachment called DICE (standing for Discourse and Commonsense Entailment), which is designed to compute temporal implicatures for natural language texts (Lascarides and Asher 1991).

A third problem with the Reichenbachian account of tense is that the purely temporal specification fails to explain why the pluperfect clause can initiate a perspective shift such as those that occur in free indirect style, where the control over the proposition shifts from the author to a character in the text (Leech and Short 1981, Quirk et al.1985). For example, consider text (6), taken from Nakhimovsky (1988): (6) a.

So our semantics of the perfect is like that in Moens and Steedman (1988): a perfect transforms an event into a consequent state, and asserts that the consequent state holds.
