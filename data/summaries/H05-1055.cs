This result was comparable to other state-of-the-art statistical name transliteration systems (Virga and Khudanpur, 2003).

Alternatively, (Qu and Grefenstette, 2004) applied language identification of name origins to select language-specific transliterations when back-transliterating Japanese names from English to Japanese.

Although some frequently occurring NEs can be reliably translated using information from existing bilingual dictionaries and parallel or monolingual corpora (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Huang and Vogel, 2002; Lee and Chang, 2003), less frequently occurring NEs, especially new names, still rely on machine transliteration to generate their translations.

(Knight and Graehl, 1997) proposed a generative transliteration model to transliterate foreign names in Japanese back to English using finite state transducers.
