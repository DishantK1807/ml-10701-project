For example, a typical NLP system, such as TRAINS (Allen et al., 1996), employs different knowledge representations for parsing, action planning and generation, despite the fact that what is being represented is common to all those representations, e.

Additional application of the semantic coherence scoring method is the calculation of a semantic coherence score for SRHs taking into account their conceptual context (Porzel and Gurevych, 2003).

For example, in our data (Gurevych et al., 2002) a user expressed the wish to get more information about a specific church, as: (3) Kann May ich I bitte please Informationen Information zur about the Heiliggeistkirche Church of Holy Spirit bekommen get Looking at two SRHs from the ensuing n-best list we found that Example (5) constituted a suitable representation of the utterance, whereas Example (4) constituted a less adequate representation thereof, labeled accordingly by the human annotators: (4) Kann May ich I Information Information zur about the Heiliggeistkirche Church of Holy Spirit kommen come (5) Kann May ich I Information Information zur about the Heiliggeistkirche Church of Holy Spirit bekommen get According to the lexicon entries, the SRHs are transformed into two alternative concept representations: a0a2a1a2a3 : a4 Person; Information Search Process; Church; Motion Directed Transliterated Processa5 ; a0a2a1a7a6 : a4 Person; Information Search Process; Church; Transaction Processa5. The scores are normalized as numbers on a scale from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating better semantic coherence.

Processes The modeling of Process as a kind of event that is continuous and homogeneous in nature, follows the frame semantic analysis used for generating the FRAMENET data (Baker et al., 1998).

Coherence Scoring We introduced the notion of semantic coherence as a special measurement which can be applied to estimate how well a given speech recognition hypothesis (SRH) fits with respect to the existing knowledge representation (Gurevych et al., 2003).
