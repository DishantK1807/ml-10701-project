Treebank Lexeed definition and example sentences are syntactically and semantically parsed with HPSG and correct results are manually selected (Tanaka et al., 2005).

Snyder and Palmer (2004) report 62% of all word types on the English all-words task at SENSEVAL-3 were labelled unanimously.

In this paper we discuss the (lexical) semantic annotation for the Hinoki Corpus, which is part of a larger project in psycho-linguistic and computational linguistics ultimately aimed at language understanding (Bond et al., 2004).
W04-1901
Other corpora, such as the English Redwoods Corpus (Oepen et al., 2002), combine both syntactic and structural semantics in a monostratal representation, but still have no lexical semantics.

4 Inter-Annotator Agreement We employ inter-annotator agreement as our core measure of annotation consistency, in the same way we did for treebank evaluation (Tanaka et al., 2005).
P05-1041
Nouns and verbal nouns (vn) have the highest agreements, similar to the results for the English all-words task at SENSEVAL-3 (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).
