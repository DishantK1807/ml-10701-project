Those differences are considered as segmentation inconsistencies by some researchers (Wu, 2003; Chen, 2003).

Chen (2003) describes inconsistency problem found in cases S1, S2 and S3.1 of PK corpora.

impact to the evaluation caused by segmentation errors in corpora of Bakeoff1 In order to show the impact to the evaluation result caused by EIs existing in test data of Bakeoff1, we conduct the baseline close test with PK and AS corpora, i.e. we compile lexicons only containing words in their training data and then use the lexicons with a forward maximum matching algorithm to segment their test data respectively (Sproat and Emerson, 2003).

For example, Dickinson and Meurers (2003) used variation to describe POS (Part-of-Speech) inconsistency in an annotated corpus.

That is if we collect all words seen in the training data and store them into a lexicon, then each word in a test set is either a lexicon word or an OOV (out of vocabulary) word (Gao et al., 2003).
