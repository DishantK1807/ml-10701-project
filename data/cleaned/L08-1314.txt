<context> Sussi Olsen University of Copenhagen Njalsgade 80, Copenhagen S Denmark costanza@cst.dk, sussi@cst.dk Abstract In this paper we present an extension of the MATE/GNOME annotation scheme for anaphora (Poesio, 2004) which accounts for abstract anaphora in Danish and Italian. By abstract anaphora it is here meant pronouns whose linguistic antecedents are verbal phrases, clauses and discourse segments. The extend</context>

Introduction In this paper we describe an extension of the MATE/GNOME annotation scheme for (co)reference (Poesio, 2004) which allows the annotation of information which is relevant to the study and the automatic treatment of abstract anaphora. Abstract anaphora in the paper indicate third-person singular pronouns who</context>
<context>ntecedent and mark it, but they must also annotate alternative interpretations in a special “comment” element. 4. The annotation scheme We have extended the MATE/GNOME annotation scheme for anaphora (Poesio, 2004) with the information presented in section 3. because this scheme, as previously described, also accounts for the annotation of anaphora in general. The central elements in the MATE/GNOME scheme are </context>
<context>ted as different annotations in the present evaluation. 7. Concluding remarks and ongoing and future work In the paper we have presented an extension of the MATE/GNOME scheme for anaphora annotation (Poesio, 2004). The extended scheme accounts for information which is relevant for the study and treatment of abstract anaphora in Danish and in Italian. The work described in the project has been done under the D</context>
