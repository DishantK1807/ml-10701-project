(Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1990) also give a method for removing "one well-known source" of spurious ambiguity from restricted CCGs; ยง4.2 above shows that this is in fact the only source.

(Hepple & Morrill, 1989), who introduced the idea of normalform parsing, consider only a small CCG fragment that lacks backward or order-changing composition; (Niv, 1994) extends this result but does not show completeness.

Although similar work has been attempted in the past, with varying degrees of success (Karttunen, 1986; Wittenburg, 1986; Pareschi & Steedman, 1987; Bouma, 1989; Hepple & Morrill, 1989; KSnig, 1989; Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1990; Hepple, 1990; Moortgat, 1990; ttendriks, 1993; Niv, 1994), this appears to be the first full normal-form result for a categorial formalism having more than contextfree power.

(Karttunen, 1986) suggests enforcing that property directly--by comparing each new analysis semantically with existing analyses in the cell, and refusing to add it if redundant--but (Hepple & Morrill, 1989) observe briefly that this is inefficient for large charts.

In particular, the polynomial-time, polynomialspace CCG chart parser of (Vijay-Shanker & Weir, 1993) can be trivially adapted to respect the constraints by tagging chart entries.

(Bouma, 1989) proposes to replace composition with a new combinator, but the resulting product-grammar scheme as2This formalization sweeps any type-raising into the lexicon, as has been proposed on linguistic grounds (Dowty, 1988; Steedman, 1991, and others).

(Pareschi & Steedman, 1987) do tackle the CCG case, but (Hepple, 1987) shows their algorithm to be incomplete.

83 R S ::~ ~ def =Q-~7~1~1~'/72 NF (/72~7) = NF(~) This construction resembles a well-known normalform reduction procedure that (Hepple & Morrill, 1989) propose (without proving completeness) for a small fragment of CCG.
E89-1002
(Wittenburg, 1987) assumes a CCG fragment lacking order-changing or higherorder composition; furthermore, his revision of the combinators creates new, conjoinable constituents that conventional CCG rejects.

(Wittenburg, 1987; Hepple & Morrill, 1989) anticipate this result, at least for some fragments of CCG, but leave the proof to future work.
