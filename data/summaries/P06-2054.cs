Following (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), the slot labels are drawn from a set of classes constructed by extending each label by three additional symbols, Beginning/Inside/Outside (B/I/O).

The L-BFGS method converges super-linearly to the solution, so it can be an efficient optimization technique on large-scale NLP problems (Sha and Pereira, 2003).

In a language understanding task, the head word dependencies or parse tree path are successfully applied to learn and predict semantic roles, especially those with ambiguous labels (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

An additional consistent edge of a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) explicitly models the dependencies between distant occurrences of similar words (Sutton and McCallum, 2004; Finkel et al., 2005).
P05-1045
The second group includes governing category and parse tree paths introduced by semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).
J02-3001
In a semantic role labeling task, the syntax and semantics are correlated with each other (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), that is, the global structure of the sentence is useful for identifying ambiguous semantic roles.
