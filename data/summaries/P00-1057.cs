Then all meta-level adjunction is regular adjunction in the sense of #28Rogers, 1994#29.

A more recent instance is D-Tree Substitution Grammars #28DSG#29 #28Rambow et al., 1995#29, where the derivations are also interpreted as dependency relations.

It was shown in Dras #281999#29 that when the meta-level grammar is in the regular form of Rogers #281994#29 the formalism is weakly equivalenttoTAG.

Because of the #0Crst restriction, we depict tree sets with the components connected by a dominance link #28dotted line#29, in the manner of #28Becker et al., 1991#29.

and Raising Verbs S NP John VP V thinks S . . . S#03 S C that S . . . VP V seems VP#03 S NP Mary VP V to sleep Figure 7: Trees for #281#29 Consider the case of sentences which contain both bridge and raising verbs, noted by Rambow et al.#281995#29. In most TAG-based analyses, bridge verbs adjoin at S #28or C 0 #29, and raising verbs adjoin at VP #28or I 0 #29.

Other formalisms aiming to model dependency correctly similarly expand weak generative capacity, notably D-tree Substitution Grammar #28Rambow et al., 1995#29, and consequently end up with much greater parsing complexity.

This fact turnsout to be connected to several properties of RF-TAG #28Rogers, 1994#29.

3 3 Thanks to Anoop Sarkar for pointing out the #0Crst The CKY-style parser for regular form TAG described in #28Rogers, 1994#29 essentially keeps track of adjunctions using stacks, and the regular form constraint ensures that the stack depth is bounded.
