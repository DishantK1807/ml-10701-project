Thus, T gives the pattern matching of two structures formed by co-occurrence relations (Section 4.2). 2.2 The Choice of Co-occurrence ~qeasure and Matrix Distance There :~:c many alternatives to measure cooccurrence between two words x and y (Church, 1990; Dunning, 1993).

One of the problems of this method is that it needs a large amount of aligned corpus for training (Brown, 1993).
