Both systems are implemented using the SNePS knowledge representation and reasoning system (Shapiro 1979; Shapiro and Rapaport 1987) and an ATN grammar (Shapiro 1982).

In AI, Nakhimovsky (1988) suggests a discourse-processing approach to tracking POV, but does not develop it in any depth.

Nakhimovsky and Rapaport (1988) suggest that in narrative, paragraph breaks accompany changes in POV, but they did not investigate this hypothesis experimentally.

Because of space limitations, how the algorithm recognizes and processes such sentences is not discussed in this paper; see Wiebe and Rapaport (1988) and Wiebe (1990).

The idea of keeping track of entities evoked in the text in order to interpret later sentences is attributable to work on anaphora resolution (e.g., Sidner \[1983\] and Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein \[1983\]).

Examples are adverbs such as 'just', 'merely', and 'only' (when used as attitude diminishers (Quirk et al.1985)), as in "He just sat and drank" (it was expected that he would do something "more" than sit and drink) 7 Adverbials that are conjuncts, which connect units of discourse (Quirk et al.1985) (i.e., cue phrases; Reichman 1985, Grosz and Sidner 1986, Cohen 1987).
J86-3001 J87-1002
One example of a potential effect on pronoun resolution: if a sentence s is to be interpreted as a represented thought, and is to be incorporated into a discoursesegment structure among previous private-state objects, then pronouns in s can be resolved against the focus space(s) corresponding to the private-state-object segments (as in Grosz and Sidner's \[1986\] theory).

(Similar suggestions have been made by Carberry \[1989\] with respect to resolving intersentential ellipsis and by Sidner \[1983\] with respect to pronoun resolution).
