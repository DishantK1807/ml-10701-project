These features are common to many SRL systems and are described in Xue and Palmer (2004).

We apply conditional random fields (CRFs) to the task of SRL proposed by the CoNLL shared task 2005 (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005).

Full details of the data set are provided in Carreras and M`arquez (2005).

CRFs have been applied with impressive empirical results to the tasks of named entity recognition (McCallum and Li, 2003; Cohn et al., 2005), part-of-speech (PoS) tagging (Lafferty et al., 2001), noun phrase chunking (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and extraction of table data (Pinto et al., 2003), among other tasks.

While CRFs have not been used to date for SRL, their close cousin, the maximum entropy model has been, with strong generalisation performance (Xue and Palmer, 2004; Lim et al., 2004).

Additionally, the dashed lines show those edges which were pruned, following Xue and Palmer (2004) â€“ only nodes which are siblings to a node on the path from the verb to the root are included in the tree.
