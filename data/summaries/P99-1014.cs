of Clustering Models 3.1 Pseudo-Disambiguation We evaluated our clustering models on a pseudodisambiguation task similar to that performed in Pereira et al.(1993), but differing in detail.

The lexicalized probabilistic grammar for German used is described in Beil et al.(1999). We compared the German example of scalar motion verbs to the linguistic classification of verbs given by Schuhmacher (1986) and found an agreement of our classification with the class of "einfache Anderungsverben" (simple verbs of change) except for the verbs anwachsen (increase) and stagnieren(stagnate) which were not classified there at all.

Approaches to probabilistic clustering similar to ours were presented recently in Saul and Pereira (1997) and Hofmann and Puzicha (1998).
