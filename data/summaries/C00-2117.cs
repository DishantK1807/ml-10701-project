Genre l)etection In order to detect automatically tile text genre we used discriminant analy.vis, a well-known classification technique of lnultivariate statistics that has been used in previous work in text genre detection (Biber, 1993; Karlgrcn and Cutting, 1994).

Kessler el al., (1997) underlined this fact and attempted to avoid the problem by eliminating texts that did not fall nneqnivocally into one of their categories.

On the other hand, some computational models for detecting automatically the text genre have recently been available (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997).

Kessler et al.(1997) avoid structural markers since they require tagged or parsed text and replace them with character-level markers (e.g., punctuation mark counts) and derivative markers, i.e., ratios and variation measures derived from measures of lexical and character-level markers.

Ground 1.1 Corpora As regards the English language, in the previous work on text genre detection (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al., 1997) the Brown corpus was used as testing ground.
C94-2174 P97-1005
Karlgren and Cutting (1994) use a combination of structural markers (e.g., noun count), lexical markers (e.g., "it" count), and token-level markers (e.g., words per sentence average, type/token ratio, etc.).
