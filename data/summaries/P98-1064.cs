In Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) it is proposed an algorithm for anaphor resolution which is a modified and extended version of that developed by Lappin and Leass (1994).

As a consequence, current anaphor resolution implementations mainly rely on constraints and preference heuristics which employ information originated from morphosyntactic or shallow semantic analysis, e.g. in Baldwin (1997).

of the pp) will be postponed to the module of resolution of NLP problems, which could work jointly with the algorithm for anaphor resolution (in a similar way to the approach proposed in Azzam (1995)).

We have slightly 'Â° improved the accuracy (83%) in pronominal references to the work of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) (75%), but we have also improved that approach since we automatically 7 It is obvious that we will probably need more semantic information in order to solve these anaphors, but in this paper we are not going to consider this information since the tagger does not provide it.

The grammar in Figure 4 will only parse coordinated prepositional phrases (pp), coordinated noun phrases (np), pronouns (p), conjunctions (conj) and verbs (verb) in whatever order that they appear in the text and it will allow us to work in a similar way that the algorithm mentioned in Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).

In Lappin and Leass (1994) it is described an algorithm for pronominal anaphor resolution with a high rate of correct analyses: 85%.

Our framework will allow us a similar approach to that of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), but we will automatically get syntactic information from partial parsing.
