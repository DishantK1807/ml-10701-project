2:7	The papers in this volume were accepted for presentation at that workshop.
3:7	In the call for papers, we asked for papers addressing questions concerned either with computational morphology or phonology, and we listed the following topics as possible areas for discussion: a0 Speech technologies relating to phonology a0 Unsupervised learning of phonotactics, morphology, and phonology a0 Stochastic or probabilistic phonology a0 Computational evolutionary modeling of phonological systems a0 Language-independent learning algorithms relating to computational phonology a0 Finite-state formalizations of phonology a0 Computational morphology and morphological modeling a0 Speech generation a0 Assistive learning tools for second language speakers The papers were reviewed by a gracious committee, who agreed to read and evaluate papers in a very short period of time.
4:7	This committee consisted of the executive committee of SIGPHON as well as a volunteer panel of outside experts.
5:7	We thank this committee for their work, and we want to give an extra special expression of our gratitude to Jason Eisners efforts.
6:7	Jason helped us at every step of the way, always going the extra mile to make sure things were moving the right way and at the right time.
