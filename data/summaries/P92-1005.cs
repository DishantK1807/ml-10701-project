Scoping proceeds simply by the non-deterministic instantiation ofscoping constraints, subject to the restrictions imposed on evaluable QLFs (Section 5), plus techniques for ignoring logically equivalent scopings, as for example described by Moran (1988).

Monotonicity of unification means that algorithms such as head-driven generation (Shieber et al 1990) can be applied to grammars developed for analysis.

RELATED APPROACHES Viewed from a slightly different perspective, monotonic interpretation has a number of points of contact with Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990).
J90-1001
We believe that there are several advantages to the approach taken, including: • Order independence of resolution operations • Production of partial interpretations • Simpler interactions between phenomena • Reversibility for synthesis/generation The QLF formalism is a development of Alshawi 1990.
J90-3001
As with Lewin's scoping algorithm, (Lewin 1990), there are no constraints built explicitly into the QLF semantics on where a quantification rule for a term may be applied, or indeed on the number of times it may be applied.
C90-3034
These include pronouns, definite descriptions, implicit or vague relations, ellipsis and temporal relations (see Alshawi 1990 for an account of some kinds of reference resolution in an earlier QLF formalism).

Section 6 discusses the relationship between monotonic interpretation, Pereira's categorial semantics (Pereira 1990), and context change approaches to semantics.
J90-1001
3The benefits of being able to resolve determiners to quantifiers are discussed in Alshawi 1990.

(The computational analogue of S was implemented as a collection of 'resolution rules' in Alshawi 1990).
