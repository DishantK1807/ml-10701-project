to the specification of signatures in Goldsmith (2001), we list every morpheme with the set of morphemes it co-occurs.

Goldsmith (2001) and De Marcken (1996), explains the grammar induction process as an iterative minimization procedure of the grammar size, where the smaller grammar corresponds to the best grammar for the given data/corpus.

Goldsmith (2001), Schone and Jurafsky (2001)) and even the induction of syntactic structures (e.g.

Schone and Jurafsky (2001) or Goldsmith (2001) show that the morphological 1 See Batchelder (1998) for a discussion of these aspects.

Mintz (1996) selects a small set of all words, the most frequent words, to induce word types via clustering ; Schone and Jurafsky (2001) select words with frequency higher than 5 to induce morphological segmentation.

We use a simplified calculation, taken from Goldsmith (2001), of the cost of storing a string that takes the number of bits of information required to store a letter of the alphabet and multiply it by the length of the string.

A grammar rule consists of a stem and the suffixes and prefixes that can be attached to it, similar to the signatures used in Goldsmith (2001).
