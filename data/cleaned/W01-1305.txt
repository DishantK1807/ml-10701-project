China ycf@s1000e.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn Abstract Conventional information systems cannot cater for temporal information eectively.
For this reason, it is useful to capture and maintain the temporal knowledge (especially the relativeknowledge) associated to each action in an information system.
In this paper, weproposea model to mine and organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences.
Three kinds of event expressions are accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events and declared event(s).
Experiments areconducted to evaluatethe mining algorithm using a set of news reports and the results are signi cant.
Error analysis has also been performed opening up new doors for future research.
1 Introduction
Information Extraction (IE) is an upcoming challenging research area to cope with the increasing volume of unwieldy distributed information resources, such as information over WWW.
Among them, temporal information is regarded as an equally, if not more, important piece of information in domains where the task of extracting and tracking information over time occurs frequently, such as planning, scheduling and question-answering.
It may be as simple as an explicit or direct expression in a written language, such as \the company closed down in May,1997";; or it may be left implicit, to be recovered by readers from the surrounding texts.
For example, one mayknow the fact that \the company has closed down before the earthquake", yet without knowing the exact time of the bankruptcy.
Relative temporal knowledge such as this where the precise time is unavailable is typically determined by human.
An information system which does not account for this properly is thus rather restrictive.
It is hard to separate temporal information (in particular refers to temporal relations in this paper) discovery from natural language processing.
In English, tenses and aspects reected by dierent verb forms are important elements in a sentence for expressing temporal reference (Steedman, 97) and for transforming situations into temporal logic operators (Bruce, 72).
The pioneer work of Reichenbach (Reichenbach, 47) on tenses forms the basis of many subsequent research eorts in temporal natural language processing, e.g. the workof Priorin tense logic (Prior, 67), and of Hwang et al in tense tree (Hwang 92) and temporal adverbial analysis (Hwang 94), etc.
Reichenbach argued that the tense system provided predication over three underlying times, namely S (speech time), R (reference time), and E (event time).
Later, a multiple temporal references model was introduced by Bruce (Bruce, 72).
He de ned the set (S 1 ;;S 2 ;;:::;;S n ), whichisanelement of a tense.
S 1 corresponds to the time of speech.
Each S i (i =2;;:::;;n;1) is a time of reference, and S n, the time of an event.
To facilitate logic manipulation, Bruce proposed seven rst order logic relations based on time intervals and a method to map nine English tenses into temporal rst order logic expressions 1. His work laid down the foundation of temporal logic in natural language.
These relations were then gradually expanded to nine in (Allen, 81) and further to thirteen in (Allen, 83) 2 . In contrast, Chinese verbs appear in only one 1 The seven relations are symbolized asR(A;;B) for relation R and time intervals A and B, where R includes before, after, during, contains, same-time, overlaps or overlapped-by.
2 meet, met-by, starts, started-by, nishes and nished-by are added into temporal relations.
form. The lack of regular morphological tense markers renders Chinese temporal expressions complicated.
For quite a long time, linguists argued whether tenses existed in Chinese;; and if they did how are they expressed.
We believe that Chinese do have tenses.
But they are determined with the assistanceoftemporaladverbsandaspect auxiliary words.
For example, ó ...
 (being), . ² ...
ê (was/been)and ...
(will be) express an ongoing action, a situation started or nished in the past, and a situation which will occur in the future, respectively.
Therefore, the conventional theory to determine temporal information based on verb axations is inapplicable.
Over the past years, there has been considerable progress in the areas of information extraction and temporal logic in English (Antony, 87;; Bruce, 72;; Kaufmann, 97).
Nevertheless, only a few researchers haveinvestigated these areas in Chinese.
The objective of our researchisto design and develop a temporal information extraction system.
For practical and cultural reason, the application target is on-line nancial news in Chinese.
The nal system, referred to as TICS (Temporal Information-extraction from Chinese Sources), will accept a series of Chinese nancial texts as input, analyze eachsentence one by one to extract the desirable temporal information, representeach piece of information in a concept frame, link all frames together in chronological order based on interor intra-event relations, and nally apply this linked knowledge to ful ll users' queries.
In this paper, we introduce a fundamental model of TICS, which is designed to mine and organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences.
Three kinds of event expressions are accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events and declared event(s).
This work involved four major parts, (1) built temporal model;; (2) constructed rules sets;; (3) developed the algorithm;; and (4) set up the experiments and performed the evaluation.
2 A
Model for Temporal Relation Discovery 2.1 Temporal Concept Frame In IE, it is impossible as well as impractical to extract all the information from an incoming document.
For this reason, all IE systems are geared for speci c application domains.
The domain is determined by a pre-speci ed concept dictionary.
Then a certain concept is triggered byseveral lexical items and activated in the speci c linguistic contexts.
Each concept de nition contains a set of slots for the extracted information.
In addition, it contains a set of enabling conditions which are constraints that must be satis ed in order for the concept to be activated.
Due to its versatility, a frame structure is generally used to representconcepts (as shown in Figure 1).
Slots in a temporal concept frame are divided into twotypes: activity-related and time-related.
Activity-related slots provide the descriptions of objects and actions concerning the concept.
For example, company predator, company target and purchase value are the attributes of the concept (Bé, TAKEOVER).
Meanwhile, time-related slots provide information related to when a concept begins or nishes, how long does it last and how does it relate to another concept, etc.

The role of absolute temporal relations is to position situation occurrences on a time axis.
These relations depict the beginning and/or ending time bounds of an occurrence or its relevance to reference times, see TR(T) in Section 2.3.
Absolute relations are organized by Time Line in the system, see Figure 2.

Figure 2: The TimeLine organization for absolute relations in TICS In many cases, the time when an event takes place may not be known.
But its relevance to another occurrence time is given.
Relative temporal knowledge such as this is manifested by relative relations.
Allen has proposed thirteen relations.
The same is adopted in our system, see TR(E i ;;E j ) in Section 2.3.
The relative relations are derived either directly from a sentence describing two situations, or indirectly from the absolute relationsof two individual situations.
They areorganized by Relational Chains, as shown in Figure 3.
o o before o o before Rd Rd Rd Rd Rd Rd same_as o o o contains before before Event A Si Tong parent stock Event CEvent A Hua Ruen places company reorgnizes Event B decreases by 1.3% The price of Hua Ruen Event D Event E Event F CKI acquires 20% of Envestra Limited from Richard Li for $3.8 billion Event G Ba Ling buye 30% stock from Zhong Lian Rd Event B Event C Event D Event B Event E Event F Rd Rd Event C Event G Si Tong parent company goes public Tricom purchases 60% of PCC R: d:relative relation duration Figure 3: The Relational Chain organization for relative relations in TICS 2.3 Temporal Model This section describes our temporal model for discovering relations from Chinese sentences.
Suppose TR indicates a temporal relation, E indicates an event and T indicates time.
The absolute and relative relations are symbolized as: OCCUR(E i ;;TR(T)) 3 and TR(E i ;;E j ), respectively.
The sets of TRare: TR(T)=fON;; BEGIN;; END;; PAST, FUTUER;; ONGOING;; CONTINUEDg TR(E i ;;E j )=fBEFORE;; AFTER;; MEETS, METBY;; OVERLAPS;; OVERLAPPED, DURING;; CONTAINS;; STAREDBY, STARTS;; FINISHES;; FINISHEDBY, SAME ASg For an absolute relation of a single event, T is an indispensable parameter, which includes event time t e, reference time t r 4 and speech time t s : 3 OCCURis a predicate for the happening of a single event.
Under the situations where there are no ambiguity, E i can be omitted.
The OCCUR(E i ;;TR(T) is simpli ed as TR(T).
4 There
maybe exist more than one reference time in a statement.
T = ft e ;; t r ;; t s g Some Chinese words can function as the temporal indicators.
These include time word (TW), time position word (F), temporal adverb (ADV ), auxiliary word (AUX), preposition word (P), auxiliary verb (VA), trend verb (VC) and some special verbs (VV).
They are all regarded as the elements of the temporal indicator TI: TI= fTW;; F;; ADV;; AUX;; VA;;VC;;VV;;Pg Each type of the indicators, e.g.
TW, contains a set of words, such as TW = twlist = ftw 1 ;;tw 2 ;;:::tw n g, with eachword having an temporal attribute, indicated by ATT.
The core of the model is thus a rule set R which maps the combinational eects of all the indicators, TI,inasentence to its corresponding temporal relation, TR, R : TI!
 TR(T) TR(E i ;;E j ) Regarding to the temporal relations, the language has three basic forms in representation:  Single event statement: in which only one single event is stated.
 Multiple events statement: in which two or more events are stated.
 declaration statement: in which the event(s) are declared by a person or an organization.
3 Rule
Construction 3.1 General Rules for Temporal References (GR) Some general temporal characteristics, approximations and assumptions are examined to understand and uncover the hidden reference times, or to polish the identi ed solutions in order to make them more nature.
For example, PAST(çw Ï, reporting date) is probably better than ON( , a few days ago).
Or, when no explicit reference time is given, the default value of T, i.e. the \reporting date" (thereafter referred to as RD), would be assumed.
It must be noting that the rules given below are not for the immediate use of extracting TR.
But they are necessary to design the TICS program.
1. TR(T) (single event) supports the following rules: (1) Approximation: ON(t e )(ATT(T)=\present"))ON(RD) ON(t e )(ATT(T)=\past"))PAST(RD) ON(t e )(ATT(T)=\future") )FUTURE(RD) PAST(t r )(ATT(T)=\past"))PAST(RD) FUTURE(t r )(ATT(T)=\future") ) FUTURE(RD) TR(t r )(ATT(T)=\present"))TR(RD) TR(?))TR(RD) (2) Negation: :END(t r ) )CONTINUED(t r ) :BEGIN(t r ) )FUTURE(t r ) :PAST(t r ) )FUTURE(t r ) :FUTURE(t r ) )FUTURE(t r ) 2.
TR(E i ;;E j ) (multiple events) supports the following rules: (3) Symmetry: BEFORE(E i ;;E j ) AFTER(E j ;;E i ) CONTAINS(E i ;;E j ) DURING(E j ;;E i ) OVERLAPS(E i ;;E j ) OVERLAPPED(E j ;;E i ) STARTS(E i ;;E j ) STAREDBY(E j ;;E i ) FINISHES(E i ;;E j ) FINISHEDBY(E j ;;E i ) SAME AS(E i ;;E j ) SAME AS(E j ;;E i ) 3.
TR s (T) and TR e (T) (declared event) supports the following rules: (4) TR s (t s )TR e (t r ) ) TR e (t s ): ON(t s )TR()?
) TR(t s ) ON(t s )?()?
) ON(t s ) (5) TR s (t r )TR e (t r ) ) TR e (t r ): PAST(?)PAST()?
) PAST(RD) ?(?)TR()?
) TR(RD) ?(?)?()?
) PAST(RD) 3.2 Impact Coecients of Temporal Indicators (R0) The combined eect of all the temporal indicators in a sentence determines its temporal relation.
However, in dierent situations, a certain indicator may have dierent eects.
Compared (a) ;ÞÆêç (This morning, he read the newspaper) and (b) %·ÖêÜýV (I read two books yesterday), the two sentences are alike as they both embody an indicator ê, which implies PAST in principle.
The sole dierence is that a de nite time present in (b).
(a) means the reading is nished at the speech time and the person must have known some news or information from his reading.
Thus TR= PAST(t s ) for (a).
However, (b) means the event took place yesterday but not before yesterday.
Consequently, for (b), TR= ON(%, yesterday) is appropriate.
In the database, the impact coecients are de ned for the temporal indicators when T does or does not present in the sentence.
Remark: It is likely for a sentence to contain two or more indicators.
For example, adverbs .² and aspectual auxiliary word ê together express a past tense and they both share the same reference time t r . The same kind instances include R... (will) and t...ø (being) etc.
Another example, such as )?
 .² (before the National Day, one has already), however includes two reference times.
Here, )?
(National Day) is t r, location word  (before) indicates PAST between t r and t 0 r (i.e.
t 0 r < t r ), and adverb .² indicates the samerelativitybut betweent e andt 0 r (i.e.
t e <t 0 r ).
|{+||||+||||+|{> t e t 0 r t r )? )?
The current proposed algorithm is unable to mine the implicit reference time (i.e.
t 0 r ).
But this does not aect the work at all.
It does not matter even we cannot discover a relation like PAST(t 0 r ).
As we know t 0 r < t r and t e < t 0 r, we can deduce a conclusion such as t e < t r by rule PAST(t 0 r )PAST(t r ) ) PAST(t r ) (for t e ).
Thus, for this example, a relation of PAST()?, National Day) is enough to provide sucient information to the users.
To cater for these cases, we de ne a general rule: if all the indicators in a sentence indicate the same relation, then it is identi ed as TR(hereafter this rule together with impact coecients is referred as R0).
3.3 Rules
for Resolving Conicts (R1) In many situations, the indicators in a sentence mayintroduce more than one relation.
For example, adverbs .² (have already) and ó (being) indicate PAST and ONGING, respectively.
But they could be collocated to represent some event which began in the past and continued to the reference time.
For example Æ .²óç (He has been reading newspaper).
Such a problem is regarded as conict.
In the following, ve cases are illustrated with examples.
To resolve this conict, asetof rules are being de ned in Table 1 (R1).

In general, one of them is treated as the reference event, say E 1,which is expressed by the subordinate clause.
Another one, say E 2, i.e. the event concerned, is expression by the main clause.
The position words (F), suchas(before) and(after), and some special nouns, suchas (when) and Ï(during) between the twoevent expressions play an important role in determining their relevance in time.
Also, it is noticed that the impact of TR(E 2 ) cannot be ignored.
Practically, TR(E 2 ) relates E 2 to t s or E 1 . Especially for the latter, the inuence of TR(E 2 ) is indispensable.
The rules for this are being de ned in the rule set R2.
In addition, some special templates are also necessary for relating twoevent, which are being de ned in the rule set R3, when F is absent.

END. 5 Experiment Setup and Error Analysis 943K bytes of test data are collected from one month of nancial pages of LÚç (Ta Kung Bao).
In total, 7924 temporal relations are discovered from the data.
The distribution of temporal relations in test data is shown in Table 4.
Considering the ultimate objective of this researchisto nd out the temporal relations embedded in sentences, the focus of the evaluation is therefore to gure out the number of the temporal relations of single event (i.e.
TR(E)) and of multiple events (i.e.
TR(E i ;;E j )), which are correctly marked by the program.
Table 5 shows the results.
Table 6 gives the order of TRclassi ed by the program.
After analyzing the outputs, it was discovered that most errors were due to: (1) t as a noun modi er;; Since the proposed method does not integrate the mechanism of parsing, the association between a modi er and its corresponding modifyee is not clear.
In view of the task engaged, a time expression (indicated by t) could either modify a verb as an adverb, or modify a noun as a restricted modi er.
Only the adverb t, determines the temporal reference of the event described by the verb.
Thus, the mistakeisunavoidable when a noun modi er t appears in the text.

The majority attributes is taken to be the nal inferences.
However, some special words may lead to exceptional results.
These special words are possible sources of errors.
Following is the example of a typical ambiguous rule.

As the connections between two sentences are ignored, it is incapable to resolvethecoreference problem.
As such, the following two sentences are all identi ed as TR= PAST, which is acceptable for the rst and correct for the second.
Nevertheless, since 3  links the currenteventtothe event described in the last sentence (indicated by ?), a solution of SAME AS(?, zI) would be more accurate.
Similarly, BEFORE($?,ñ) is more proper in the second sentence with $ refering to the event stated before.
The problem of coreference will be studied in our future work.

These mapping is preconditioned on the temporal indicators and achieved on a set of pre-de ned rules.
The mapping mechanism was validated.
On 7429 sentences describing temporal relevance, we achieved 92.77% accuracy in average.
These relations will be useful to for information extraction, information retrieval and questionanswering application.
Once the corresponding frames have been instantiated and their slots lled after temporal natural language processing.
The related temporal concepts will be linked together according to their chronological orders, to be applied as the knowledge to ful ll users' queries.
We nd two interest questions as our future work.
(1) Reference Time Shift In the currentwork, we considered sentences as independent units.
The evaluation is also performed on this basis.
However, some sentences in a article maybetemporally related.
They may share the same reference time which is indicated in a preceding sentence or the event time in one sentence servers as a reference point for the next.
How to identify whether a reference time is continued from the preceding sentence or is the same as a omitted speech time, and how the reference times shift should be a good topic in the future work.
(2) The focus of Negation The negation form of a verb mayhavetwo focuses.
One emphasizes the event, which is expected to become the fact but, still has not yet happened.
It implies that the event will take place in the future.
Anotheremphasizesastatus wherethe event didn't happen throughout a speci ed duration.
Is it possible to nd out the focus of the negation?
