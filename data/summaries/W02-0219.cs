In the PARADISE framework, user satisfaction is composed of maximal task success and minimal dialogue costs (Walker et al., 1997), — thus a type of efficiency in the way it was defined here.

P97-1035
Walker et al.(1997) identified three factors which carry an influence on the performance of SDSs, and which therefore are thought to contribute to its quality perceived by the user: agent factors (mainly related to the dialogue and the system itself), task factors (related to how the SDS captures the task it has been developed for) and environmental factors (e.g.

Walker et al.(1998) also state that “user satisfaction ratings [...] have frequently been used in the literature as an external indicator of the usability of an agent.” As Kamm and Walker (1997), we assume that user satisfaction is predictive of other system designer objectives, e.g. the willingness to use or pay for a service.

The PARADISE framework (Walker et al., 1997) produces such a relationship for a specific scenario, using multivariate linear regression.

As stated above, the separation of environmental, agent and task factors was motivated by Walker et al.(1997). The same categories appear in the characterization of spoken dialogue systems given by Fraser (1997) (plus an additional user factor, which obviously is nested in the quality aspects due to the fact that it is the user who decides on quality).
