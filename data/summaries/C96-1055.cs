Previous research in automatic acquisition focuscs primarily on the use of statistical techniques, such as bilingual alignment (Church and Hanks, 1990; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1996; Wu and Xia, 1995), or extraction of syntactic constructions from online dictionaries and corpora (Brant, 1993; Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995).

tlowever, a number of researchers (l,'ilhnore, 1968; Grimshaw, 1990; Gruber, 1965; Guthrie et al., 1991; Hearst, 1991; Jackendotr, 1983; Jackendoff, 1990; l,evin, 1993; Pinker, t989; Yarowsky, 1992) have demonstrated conclusively that there is a clear relationship between syntactic context and word senses; it is our aim to exploit this relationship for the acquisition of semantic lexicons.
