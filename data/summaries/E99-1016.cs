(Cardie and Pierce, 1998) present an approach to chunking based on a mixture of finite state and context-free techniques.
P98-1034
For our experiments, we use the NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1997).
A97-1014
States of a Markov Model represent syntactic categories (or tuples of syntactic categories), and outputs represent words and punctuation (Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988, and others).
A88-1019 J88-1003
This type of model is used to facilitate the syntactic annotation of the NEGRA corpus of German newspaper texts (Skut et al., 1997).
A97-1014
are slightly below those presented by (Skut and Brants, 1998).

J88-1003
Results for chunking Penn Treebank data were previously presented by several authors (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Argamon et al., 1998; Veenstra, 1998; Cardie and Pierce, 1998).
P98-1010 P98-1034 W95-0107
(Roche, 1994) uses the fix point of a finite-state transducer.
C94-1071
(Pereira et al., 1994; Mohri, 1997).
H94-1050 J97-2003
Brants et al.(1997) showed that the technique of statistical tagging can be shifted to the next level of syntactic processing and is capable of assigning grammatical functions.
