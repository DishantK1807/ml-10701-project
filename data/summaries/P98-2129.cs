The notion of a cooperative response has been the focus of considerable research in natural language and spoken dialogue systems (Allen and Perrault, 1980; Mays, 1980; Kaplan, 1981; Joshi et al., 1984; McCoy, 1989; Pao and Wilpon, 1992; Moore, 1994; Seneff et al., 1995; Goddeau et al., 1996; Pieraccini et al., 1997).

â€¢ To assess the relative contribution of each evaluation measure to performance, we use PARADISE (Walker et al., 1997) to derive a perfo rmance function from our data.
P97-1035
We plan to evaluate additional cooperative response strategies in TOOT (e.g., intensional summaries (Kalita et al., 1986), summarization and constraint elicitation in isolation), and to combine TOOT data with data from other agents (Walker et al., 1998).

Following PARADISE (Walker et al., 1997), we defined a "key" for each scenario using an attribute value matrix (AVM) task representation, as in Table 2.
P97-1035
To measure task success, we compared the scenario key and scenario execution AVMs for each dialogue, using the Kappa statistic (Walker et al., 1997).
P97-1035
We analyze our data using both traditional hypothesis testing methods and the PARADISE (Walker et al., 1997; Walker et al., 1998) methodology for estimating a performance function.

Each question was designed to measure a partic4Questionnaire-based user satisfaction ratings (Shriberg et al., 1992; Polifroni et al., 1992) have been frequently used in the literature as an external indicator of agent usability.

CT presents a subset of the matching trains using a summary response (Pao and Wilpon, 1992), followed by an option to reduce the information to be retrieved (Pieraccini et al., 1997; Goddeau et al., 1996; Seneff et al., 1995; Pao and Wilpon, 1992).
H92-1008
CT's response is more cooperative since identifying the source of a query failure can help block incorrect user inferences (Pieraccini et al., 1997; Pao and Wilpon, 1992; Joshi et al., 1984; Kaplan, 1981; Mays, 1980).
