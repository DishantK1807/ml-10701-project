The Recall Predictor's filtering function is accomplished by means of a multiple regression formula that successfully predicts a ranked-list cut-off criterion for individual queries based on the similarity of documents to the query in terms of their SFC, Proper Noun, Complex Nominal, and Text Structure requirements (Liddy et al, 1993b).

In terms of extensibility, the Subject Code vector approach to implicit semantic level representation of text content has been proposed for extension into a multilingual environment, where it will be used to provide crosslanguage semantic representation and access to documents in six languages (Liddy et al, 1993a).

The negative impact of these errors manifest itself when the retrieval results from the 24th month evaluations are compared to those with manually constructed queries in 18th month evaluations (Myaeng & Liddy, 1993).

One effort is to extend the symbolic level of natural language processing developed during Phase I of TIPSTER by such efforts as the extension of the subject code vector algorithm into the multi-lingual environment (Liddy et al, 1993a); the development of new corpus analysis techniques for the expansion of complex nominals into their synonymous phrasings, and; the automatic construction of proper noun knowledge bases over time and multiple texts, for the purpose of cross-document inferencing in response to complex queries requiring extensive relational information (Paik, In press).
