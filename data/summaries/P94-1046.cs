Introduction Tense interpretation has received much attention in linguistics (Partee, 1984; Hinrichs, 1986; Nerbonne, 1986, inter alia) and natural language processing (Webber, 1988; Kameyama et al., 1993; Lascarides and Asher, 1993, inter alia).

Several researchers (Partee, 1984; Hinrichs, 1986; Nerbonne, 1986; Webber, 1988) have sought to explain the temporal relations induced by tense by treating it as anaphoric, drawing on Reichenbach's separation between event, speech, and reference times (Reichenbach, 1947).

This may not be the case; for instance the use of a past perfect may signal the start of an embedded discourse segment, as in Webber's flower shop example (Webber, 1988; Kameyama et al., 1993).
