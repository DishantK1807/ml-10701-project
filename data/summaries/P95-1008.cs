This goal was addressed in one of the first publications on the language (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b).

In more recent work, the language has been used to provide a concise encoding of Lexicalised Tree Adjoining Grammar (Evans et al., 1994; Evans et al., 1995).

Indeed, in the absence of such a standard, it is impossible to demonstrate formally the correctness of novel implementation strategies (for an example of such a strategy, see (Langer, 1994)).

DATR was introduced by Evans and Gazdar (1989a; 1989b) as a simple, declarative language for representing lexical knowledge in terms of path/value equations.

DATR has been applied to problems in inflectional and derivational morphology (Gazdar, 1992; Kilbury, 1992; Corbett and Fraser, 1993), lexical semantics (Kilgariff, 1993), morphonology (Cahill, 1993), prosody (Gibbon and Bleiching, 1991) and speech (Andry et al., 1992).

DATR Theories and DATR Models Bill Keller School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences The University of Sussex Brighton, UK email: billk@cogs.susx.ac.uk Abstract Evans and Gazdar (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a; Evans and Gazdar, 1989b) introduced DATR as a simple, non-monotonic language for representing natural language lexicons.

In particular, the formal apparatus introduced by Evans and Gazdar in (1989b) provides no explicit model of DATR's notion of global contexL Rather, local and global inheritance are represented by distinct semantic functions £: and G.

On the other hand, the value of 2It is not clear why one would wish to do this anyway, but the possibility is explicitly left open in the original definitions of (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a).

vn) undefined otherwise if vi = \[di\]e is defined for each i (1 < i < n), then = ~¢(d)(d) where c = (u, v) and d = (u, Vl..-v,) undefined otherwise = i¢(d)(e) where c = (u, v) and d= (F(N), v) Figure 3: Denotation function for DATR Descriptors There have been a number of formal treatments of defaults in the setting of attribute-value formalisms (Carpenter, 1993; Bouma, 1992; Russell et al., 1992; Young and Rounds, 1993).

The purpose of the present paper is to remedy the deficiencies of the work described in (Evans and Gazdar, 1989b) by furnishing DATR with a transparent, mathematical semantics.

There are around a dozen different implementations of the language and large DATR lexicons have been constructed for use in a variety of applications (Cahill and Evans, 1990; Andry et al., 1992; Cahill, 1994).

The theory 7is said to be definitional if it consists solely of definitional sentences and it is said to be functional if it meets the following condition: 1The syntax presented in (Evans and Gazdar, 1989a; Evans and Gazdar, 1989b) permits nodes and paths to stand as local descriptors.
