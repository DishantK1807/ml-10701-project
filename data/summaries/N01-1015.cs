However, without additional guidance, that algorithm cannot be directly applied to the phonetic modeling task due to data sparseness and/or lack of sufficient bias (Gildea and Jurafsky, 1995).
P95-1002
The alignment problem in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990) is too general: longdistance displacement of large chunks of material may occur frequently when translating whole sentences, but are unlikely to play any role for the letter-to-sound mapping, though local reorderings do occur (Sproat, 2000).

4. For reasons of space efficiency, certain computations are deferred until run-time (Mohri et al., 1996; Mohri et al., 2000), with a significant impact on time efficiency.
P96-1031
In particular, decision trees can be converted into implicational rules that an expert could inspect and can in principle be compiled back into finite-state machines (Sproat and Riley, 1996), although that would re-introduce the original efficiency problems.
P96-1029
One exception to this is (Gildea and Jurafsky, 1995), where the target function space are the subsequential transducers, for which a limit-identification algorithm exists (Oncina et al., 1993).
P95-1002
In the system described in (Sproat, 1998) text analysis is performed using finite-state transducers compiled from rewrite rules (Kaplan and Kay, 1994; Mohri and Sproat, 1996) and other high-level descriptions.
