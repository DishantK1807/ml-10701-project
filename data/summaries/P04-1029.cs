We used the EFD-based modification of this algorithm (Penn and Munteanu, 2003), which needs no active edges, and requires a constant two copies per edges, rather than the standard one copy per retrieval found in Prolog parsers.

One (Penn and Munteanu, 2003) addresses only the cost of copying large categories, and was found to reduce parsing times by an average of 25% on a large-scale TFSG (MERGE).
P03-1026
That analysis, rule filtering (Kiefer et al., 1999), reduces parse times by filtering out mother-daughter unifications that can be determined to fail at compile-time.
