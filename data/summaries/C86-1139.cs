The caseframes are~unlike in other systems ( Brietzmann 1984, Hayes 1985), static data structures that are not instantiated, nor do they trigger any actions.

Although the algorithm is not based on pattern-matching like some other frame based approaches (Hayes 1981 and Hayes 1985), the entries in the case-frame lexicon sometimes do have to come very close to it, in order to be of a power that not only describes case indicators and fillers that may occur, but at the same time excludes the wrong ones; a feature that is generally referred to as strong generative power.
