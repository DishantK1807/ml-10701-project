This idea is the same as (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
The original idea was represented in our previous paper (Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2006).

Popescu and Etzioni applied relaxation labeling to polarity identification (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005).

Turney. 2002.
P02-1053
In Turney’s work, the co-occurrence is considered as the appearance in the same window (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
Its size is compatible to (Turney and Littman, 2002).
P02-1053
The polarity value proposed by (Turney, 2002) is as follows.
P02-1053
(Turney, 2002) is one of the most famous work that discussed learning polarity from corpus.
P02-1053
This method utilizes synonyms or glosses of a thesaurus in order to determine polarity of words (Kamps et al., 2004; Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005).

Some studies addressed supervised approach to learning polarity of phrases (Wilson et al., 2005; Takamura et al., 2006).
E06-1026 H05-1044
Typically, a small set of seed polar phrases are prepared, and new polar phrases are detected based on the strength of co-occurrence with the seeds (Hatzivassiloglous and McKeown, 1997; Turney, 2002; Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).
P02-1053 P97-1023 W06-1642
Their method covers wider range of cooccurrence than other work such as (Hatzivassiloglous and McKeown, 1997).
P97-1023
Some work examined the importance of such layout (Liu et al., 2005; Kim and Hovy, 2006).
P06-2063
Kanayama and Nasukawa used both intraand inter-sentential co-occurrence to learn polarity of words and phrases (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).
W06-1642
The importance of neutral category is also discussed in other literatures (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).
E06-1025
Takamura et al.built lexical network from not only such co-occurrence but other resources including thesaurus (Takamura et al., 2005).

The agreement between the two judges was 93.5% (Kappa value was 0.90), and thus we can conclude that the polar sentence corpus has enough quality (Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2006).
P06-2059
Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown constructed lexical network and determine polarity of adjectives (Hatzivassiloglous and McKeown, 1997).
P97-1023
Esuli et al.utilized glosses of words to determine polarity (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2005; Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006).

It is worth pointing out that lexico-syntactic patterns have been widely used in English lexical acquisition (Hearst, 1992).
C92-2082
Turney’s method did not work well although they reported 80% accuracy in (Turney and Littman, 2002).
P02-1053
According to Kanayama’s investigation, the hypothesis is appropriate in only 60% of cases if co-occurrence is defined as the appearance in the same window 1. In Kanayama’s method, the co-occurrence is considered as the appearance in intraor inter-sentential context (Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006).
W06-1642
In summary, the strength of our approach is to exploit extremely precise structural clues, and to use 5 Semantic Orientation in (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
As a baseline, we built lexicon similarly by using polarity value of (Turney, 2002).
P02-1053
Kim and Hovy proposed two probabilistic models to estimate the strength of polarity (Kim and Hovy, 2004).
C04-1200
(Kanayama and Nasukawa, 2006) reported that it was appropriate in 72.2% of cases.
