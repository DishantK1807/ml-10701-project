The ‘summary’ dataset is part of a sentence extraction task (Osborne, to appear), and the ‘shallow’ dataset is drawn from a text chunking application (Osborne, 2002).

In natural language processing, recent years have seen ME techniques used for sentence boundary detection, part of speech tagging, parse selection and ambiguity resolution, and stochastic attribute-value grammars, to name just a few applications (Abney, 1997; Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Johnson et al., 1999).

A conditional maximum entropy model qθ(xjw) for p has the parametric form (Berger et al., 1996; Chi, 1998; Johnson et al., 1999): qθ(xjw) = exp θT f (x) ∑y2Y(w) exp(θT f (y)) (1) where θ is a d-dimensional parameter vector and θT f (x) is the inner product of the parameter vector and a feature vector.

Many features are nearly ‘pseudo-minimal’ in the sense of Johnson et al.(1999), and so receive weights approaching ∞.
