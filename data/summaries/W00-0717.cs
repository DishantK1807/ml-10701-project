Brown et al.(1992) use a very large amount of data, and a well-founded information theoretic model to induce large numbers of plausible semantic and syntactic clusters.

I therefore chose to use an objective statistical measure, the perplexity of a very simple finite state model, to compare the tags generated with this clustering technique against the BNC tags, which uses the CLAWS-4 tag set (Leech et al., 1994) which had 76 tags.
