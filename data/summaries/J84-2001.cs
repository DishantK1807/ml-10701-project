Our approach differs in that we have built our own retrieval processor and endowed it with the ability Â¢o act as a knowledge-base by directly processing complex semantics of English modifiers (Ballard 1984).

A complete discussion of the query language produced can be found in Ballard and Lusth 1984.

However, the inadequacies of a pure context-free formulation of natural language syntax are well recognized, and various treatments have been used to overcome them (Bobrow and Webber 1980; Heidorn 1975; Colmerauer 1978; Kimball 1972; Marcus 1980; Pereira 1981; Pratt 1975; Rieger and Small 1979; Robinson 1982; Sager andGrishman 1975; and Woods 1970, 1980).

The reader may notice that our grammatical formalism resembles both transition network and phrase-structure grammars (Woods 1970, 1980; Heidorn 1975), and our later speaking of grammar rules as "commands" further reveals an affinity with ATNs.

The syntactic processing of a representative input for LDC was indicated in Figure 1, and information of the scope of the current syntactic and semantic coverage of LDC can be found in Ballard (1984).

We now summarize the operation of the knowledge acquisition and English processing components, referring the reader to Ballard and Lusth (1984) for details concerning retrieval processing.

Our current grammar is eight pages in length and, due to consolidations made possible by enhancements to the formalism, allows both whand yes-no questions, imperatives, passives, deep raisings, several forms of fronting, a few discontinuous constituents, and some exotic modifier types mentioned in Ballard (1984).

The system is loosely based upon strategies developed for our English-language programming system NLC (Ballard and Biermann 1979; Biermann and Ballard 1980; Sigmon 1981; Fink 1982; Geist, Kraines and Fink 1982; and Biermann, Ballard and Sigmon 1983), and has been designed to provide a natural language query capability for office domains whose data are stored on the computer as informally structured textedited data files (Ballard and Lusth 1984).

Accordingly, prototype systems that permit user customizations or rapid customizations by a designer have included REL, POL and ASK (Thompson and Thompson 1975, 1981, 1983), CONSUL (Mark 1981; Wilczynski 1981), IRUS (Bates and Bobrow 1983), KLAUS (Haas and Hendrix 1980), TEAM (Hendrix and Lewis 1981; Grosz 1983), a system developed at Bell Labs (Ginsparg 1983), and our own LDC system (Ballard 1982, 1984; Ballard and 1 This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers MCS-81-16607 and IST-83-01994 and in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant Number 81-0221.

Tinkham A Phrase-Structured Grammatical Framework for Transportable NLP Since the problem of mis-recognitions is especially troublesome in our projected voice-input environment (Biermann et al.1983), this distinction can be important.

A second departure of our formalism from conventional ATNs is that we have systematically avoided the temptation to introduce opportunities for making arbitrary tests (a provision shared, evidently, with even more glee, in various logic grammars, e.g., Pereira 1981).

with Augmented Transition Network Formalisms As remarked earlier, our grammatical formalism, which is based on what we regard as phrase-structure rules, bears some resemblance to ATN grammars (Woods 1970, 1980), but there are important differences.

Experiments with the LDC Grammar and Parser Having completed the parser and constructed a suitably broad grammar for use in several layered domains, we have begun to experiment with our parser in the manner of Slocum (1981) to see how significantly certain of our Computational Linguistics Volume 10, Number 2, April-June 1984 89 Bruce W.

The existing LDC scanner assumes typed input but, as described in Biermann et al.(1983), we have used a Nippon DP-200 voice recognition unit, and more recently a continuous-speech Verbex device, with our previous NLC system, and its introduction into LDC is being contemplated.
