Kudo and Matsumoto(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) applied SVMs to English chunking and achieved the best performance in the CoNLL00 shared task(Sang and Buchholz, 2000).

Furthermore, compared with the other languages, there are some special problems for Chinese chunking(Li et al., 2004).
W04-1107
Ramshaw and Marcus(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) first represented base noun phrase recognition as a machine learning problem.
W95-0107
However, there are many different Chinese chunk definitions, which are derived from different data sets(Li et al., 2004; Zhang and Zhou, 2002).

Voting This is traditional voting method, which is the same as Uniform Weight in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).
N01-1025
In the weighted voting method, we can assign different weights to the results of the individual system(van Halteren et al., 1998).
P98-1081
Transformation based learning(TBL), first introduced by Eric Brill(Brill, 1995), is mainly based on the idea of successively transforming the data in order to correct the error.
J95-4004
Methods Kudo and Matsumoto(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) reported that they achieved higher accuracy by applying voting of systems that were trained using different data representations.
N01-1025
Chinese chunking is a difficult task, and much work has been done on this topic(Li et al., 2003a; Tan et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2000).
W00-1211
We only describe these models briefly since full details are presented elsewhere(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003; Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Sang, 2002).

TBL was applied to Chinese chunking by Li et al.(Li et al., 2004) and TBL provided good performance on their corpus.
W04-1107
Sha and Pereira(Sha and Pereira, 2003) showed that stateof-the-art results can be achieved using CRFs in English chunking.
N03-1028
The SVMs and CRFs approaches were used in the experiments because they provided good performance in chunking(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001)(Sha and Pereira, 2003).
N01-1025 N03-1028
Tjong Kim Sang et al.(Sang and Buchholz, 2000) reported similar results by combining different systems.

Additionally, many machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs)(Vapnik, 1995), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)(Lafferty et al., 2001), Memory-based Learning (MBL)(Park and Zhang, 2003), Transformation-based Learning (TBL)(Brill, 1995), and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)(Zhou et al., 2000), have been applied to text chunking(Sang and Buchholz, 2000; Hammerton et al., 2002).
