Repetitions and prompts also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988).

We then used the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996) to assess the level of agreement between the three coders with respect to the 2 An agent holds the task initiative during a turn as long as some utterance during the turn directly proposes how the agents should accomplish their goal, as in utterance (3c).

Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990) have previously identified a set of utterance intentions that serve as cues to indicate shifts or lack of shifts in initiative, such as prompts and questions.
P88-1015 P90-1010
Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991) developed a plan-based dialogue understanding model that tracks the conversational initiative based on the domain and discourse plans behind the utterances.
P91-1004
It can be further classified into two groups: repetitions, a subset of the informationally redundant utterances (Walker, 1992), in which the speaker paraphrases an utterance by the hearer or repeats the utterance verbatim, and prompts, in which the speaker merely acknowledges the bearer's previous utterance(s).

Carletta suggests that content analysis researchers consider K >.8 as good reliability, with.67< /~" <.8 allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn (Carletta, 1996).

Guinn (1996) subsequently developed a system that allows change in the level of ini262 tiative based on initiative-changing utterances and each agent's competency in completing the current subtask.

On the other hand, they may propose problem-solving actions (Allen, 1991; Lambert and Carberry, 1991; Ramshaw, 1991) that contribute not directly to the agents' domain goal, but to how they would go about achieving this goal, such as "Let's look at the first \[problem\]first".

3 3 Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker treat subdialogues initiated as a result of these cues as interruptions, motivated by their collaborative planning principles (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990).

The third cue class, analytical cues, includes cues that cannot be recognized without the hearer performing an evaluation on the speaker's proposal using the heater's private knowledge (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1994; Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995).
P95-1019
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) devised rules for allocating dialogue control based on utterance types, and Walker and Whittaker (1990) utilized these rules for an analytical study on discourse segmentation.

Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988).
