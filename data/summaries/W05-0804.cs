In our case, epsilon1 is 0.05, the same value used in (Och, 1999).
E99-1010
The (Och and Ney, 2003) model includes other refinements such as special treatment of a jump to a Null word, and a uniform smoothing prior.
J03-1002
This approach was shown to give the best results in (Och, 1999).
E99-1010
A later study by (Och, 1999) showed improvements on perplexity of bilingual corpus, and word translation accuracy using a template-based translation model.
E99-1010
Motivated by the work in both (Och and Ney, 2000) and (Toutanova et al., 2002), we propose the two following simplest versions of extended HMMs to utilize bilingual word clusters.
C00-2163 W02-1012
Practically, we can use word alignment as used in (Och, 1999).
E99-1010
Och. 1999.
E99-1010
These scores are used in a local greedy search to extract phrase pairs (Zhao and Vogel, 2005).
W05-0825
Previous work from (Wang et al., 1996) showed improvements in perplexity-oriented measures using mixture-based translation lexicon (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003
2.1 HMM-based Translation Model HMM is one of the effective translation models (Vogel et al., 1996), which is easily scalable to very large training corpus.
