We intend to investigate any potential linkages between the word groups in the texts and other theories that provide pre-determined structures of text, such as Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu, 1997).

In recent lexical cohesion research in linguistics (Hasan, 1984; Halliday and Hasan, 1989; Martin, 1992) non-classical relations are largely ignored, and the same is true in implementations of lexical cohesion in computational linguistics (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999; Silber and McCoy, 2002), as the lexical resource used is WordNet.

The lexical chains of Morris and Hirst (1991) had no such restriction, and frequently nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs were joined together in one chain.

Lexical cohesion analysis has been used in such NLP applications as determining the structure of text (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and automatic text summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999).
