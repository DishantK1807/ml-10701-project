In previous work (Walker et al., 2001c), the DATE labelling of the June-2000 corpus was done using a semi-automatic method that involved collection of a large number of utterance patterns from the different sites participating in the collection and subsequent hand labelling of these patterns.

In order to label the HH corpus of 1062 utterances, we started with 10 dialogues (305 utterances) labelled with the CSTAR dialogue act tagging scheme (Finke et al., 1998; Doran et al., 2001).

In previous work, Walker and Passonneau de ned the DATE scheme, and labelled the system utterances in the June 2000 data collection of 663 dialogues from nine participating Communicator systems (Walker et al., 2001c; Walker et al., 2001a).

For example, the dialogue act representation can be used to provide a broad range of text-planning inputs for a stochastic sentence planner in the travel domain (Walker et al., 2001b), or to represent the systems’ dialogue strategies for reinforcement learning (Walker, 2000; Schef er and Young, 2002).
N01-1003 P01-1066
Previous work has also reported results for dialogue act taggers, using similar features to those we use, with accuracies ranging from 62a0 to 75a0 (Reithinger and Klesen, 1997; Shriberg et al., 2000; Samuel et al., 1998).
P98-2188
They then derived dialogue act metrics from the DATE tags and showed that when these metrics were used in the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 1997) that they improved models of user satisfaction by an absolute 5a0, and that the new metrics could be used to understand which system’s dialogue strategies were most effective.

Previous research has used dialogue act tagging for tasks such as improving recognition performance (Shriberg et al., 2000), identifying important parts of a dialogue (Finke et al., 1998), evaluating and comparing spoken dialogue systems (Walker et al., 2001c; Cattoni et al., 2001; Hastie et al., 2002), as a constraint on nominal expression generation (Jordan, 2000), and for comparing HH to HC dialogues (Doran et al., 2001).

Furthermore, users in the HC dialogues rarely took initiative and their utterances showed very little variation (Doran et al., 2001).
W01-1607
Recent research on dialogue is based on the assumption that dialogue acts provide a useful way of characterizing dialogue behaviors in both humanhuman (HH) and human-computer (HC) dialogue (Isard and Carletta, 1995; Shriberg et al., 2000; Di Eugenio et al., 1998; Cattoni et al., 2001).

Assignment The classes used to train the DATE tagger are derived directly from the DATE tagging scheme (Walker et al., 2001c).
