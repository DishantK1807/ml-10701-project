The studied algorithm recognizes auxiliary trees without considering the substring dominated by the foot node, as is the case of the CYK-like algorithm in Vijay-Shanker and Joshi (1985).

6, Discussion Within the perspective of Lexicalized TAGs, known methods for TAGs recognition/parsing present some limitations: these methods behave in a left-to-right fashion (Schabes and Joshi, 1988) or they are purely bottom-up (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985, Harbusch, 1990), hence they cannot take advantage of anchor information in a direct way.

As for Lexicalized TAGs, in (Schabes et al., 1988) a two step algorithm has been presented: during the first step the trees corresponding to the input string are selected and in the second step the input string is parsed with respect to this set of trees.

Various parsing algorithms for TAGs have been proposed in the literature: the worst-case time complexity varies from O(n 4 log n) (Harbusch, 1990) to O(n 6) (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985, Lang, 1990, Schabes, 1990) and O(n 9) (Schabes and Joshi, 1988).

Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (Schabes et al., 1988) are a refinement of TAGs such that each elementary tree is associated with a lexieal item, called the anchor of the tree.

Our algorithm can be easily modified in these directions, adopting the same proposals advanced in (Schabes and Joshi, 1988).
