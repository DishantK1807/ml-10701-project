For examples: a0a2a1a4a3a4a5a7a6a9a8a11a10a7a12a4a13 a3a4a14a16a15a18a17a4a19a9a20a22a21 these words should be obtained: a1a16a3a24a23a18a5a4a6a24a23a18a6a9a8a7a23a25a8a11a10a24a23a18a10a4a12a9a23a11a13a9a23a26a3a9a23a26a14 a15a25a23a26a17a7a19a9a27 The ambiguous string is a0a28a5a7a6a24a8a11a10 a12a29a20.There are some methods to resolve this problem: the one is the method forward maximum matching, backward maximum matching and minimum matching are used to find out the possible word strings from the character string [Guo 1997; Sproat et al.1996; Gu and Mao 1994; Li et al.1991; Wang et al.1991b; Wang et al.1990]. The second is The words finding automaton based on the Aho-Corasick Algorithm [Hong-I and Lua].
