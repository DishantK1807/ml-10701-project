We used the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) to measure similarity (Melamed, 1995).

First, it would be useful to combine our method for filtering out non-parallel texts with methods for detecting omissions in translations (Melamed, 1996).
C96-2129
Resnik and Smith (2003) suggested three approaches to filtering non-parallel texts: STRAND, tsim, and a combination of the two.

There is also some recent work on distinguishing parallel texts from pairs of unrelated texts (Resnik and Smith, 2003).
J03-3002
For this purpose, we used the STRAND corpus, which consists of 326 candidate bitexts in French and English1 (Resnik and Smith, 2003).

Modification to SIMR Our work is based on a modification of the SIMR bitext mapping algorithm (Melamed, 1999).
J99-1003
Resnik and Smith (2003) trained tsim using 32 of the 326 available STRAND candidate pairs to achieve their published result.
