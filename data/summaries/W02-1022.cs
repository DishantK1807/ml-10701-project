While recent proposals for evaluation of MT systems have involved multi-parallel corpora (Thompson and Brew, 1996; Papineni et al., 2002), statistical MT algorithms typically only use one-parallel data.

Using alignment for grammar and lexicon induction has been an active area of research, both in monolingual settings (van Zaanen, 2000) and in machine translation (MT) (Brown et al., 1993; Melamed, 2000; Och and Ney, 2000) | interestingly, statistical MT techniques have been used to derive lexico-semantic mappings in the \reverse" direction of language understanding rather than generation (Papineni et al., 1997; Macherey et al., 2001).

Simardâ€™s (1999) trilingual (rather than multiparallel)corpusmethod,whichalsocomputesMSAs, is a notable exception, but he reports mixed experimental results.

The main idea behind our paraphrase thesaurus induction method, motivated by Barzilay and McKeown (2001), is that paths through lattice \sausages" often correspond to alternate verbalizations of the same concept, since the sausage endpoints are contexts common to all the sausage-interior paths.

Some systems learn from verbalizations annotated with semantic concepts (Ratnaparkhi, 2000; Oh and Rudnicky, 2000); in contrast, we use un-annotated corpora.

Other work focuses on surface realization | choosing among difierent lexical and syntactic options supplied by the lexical chooser and sentence planner | rather than on creating the mapping dictionary; although such work also uses lattices as input to the stochastic realizer, the lattices themselves are constructed by traditional knowledge-based means (Langkilde and Knight, 1998; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).
