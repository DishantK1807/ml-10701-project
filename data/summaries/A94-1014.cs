We are studying mechanisms under which the interpreter will override the parser and will get it out of trouble in processing very complex sentences (Krupka et al., 1991; Jacobs et al., 1991).

Hence, our system does not start with a frame containing the main slots to be filled for a topic, say "diet," as in recent MUC projects (Sundheim, 1992), but rather it will build everything relevant to diet from the output of the interpretation phase.

For instance, in dealing with anaphora we have incorporated in our system some of the ideas reported in (Grosz, 1983; Hobbs, 1978), but our work is clearly insufficient in that regard.

We think that the same critique applies to skimmers (Lehnert et al., 1991), but for very different reasons.
M91-1033
In approaching the problem of unrestricted texts, we agree with those researchers (Hobbs, 1991; Grishman et al., 1991) who think that it is possible to build correct parses and interpretations for realworld texts.

(Grishman et al., 1991; Hobbs, 1978; Tomita, 1985) and semantic-centered approaches (Riesbeck and Martin, 1986; Cardie and Lehnert, 1991; Slator and Wilks, 1991).
