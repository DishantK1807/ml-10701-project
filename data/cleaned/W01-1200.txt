2:8	When users have specific questions, such as What countries did Clinton visit in 1999? or How much does a ThinkPad cost?, they would like to see one (or a few) succinct answer(s).
3:8	This workshop focuses on technical issues that directly apply to this challenge, and, in particular, on theoretical and pragmatic issues involved in the creation, evaluation and implementation of QA techniques.
4:8	We concentrate on QA that is automatic and either domain independent or working within a large open domain, such as news or technical support.
5:8	To accommodate this need for automatically finding answers to open-domain questions, several different fields of research come together information retrieval, natural-language processing and knowledge representation.
6:8	This workshop provides a forum for discussions of QA as the combination and integration of techniques from these three fields.
7:8	The papers in this volume discuss QA topics such as question analysis and answer selection; logical formalisms for representing QA semantics; new sources of knowledge, such as the Web; and tools for evaluating the results of QA.
8:8	The invited talk, represented here by its abstract, examines future directions in this field.
