Some of the systems that use a KLONE knowledge representation \[Bobrow and Webber, 1980, Sondheimer ct el., 1984\] perform a similar function, but use specific interpretation rules to place concepts in more specific categories, rather than to attempt an algorithm for combining lexical and conceptual knowledge.

The examples above represent potential inputs from several disparate real and "toy" domains of TRUMP (TRansportable Understanding Mechanism Package)\[Jacobs, 1986b, Jacobs, 1987\].

Unification-based systems \[Pereira and Warren, 1980, Pereira and Shieber, 1984, Gawron et al., 1982\] tend to refine semantic representations by adding semantic FEATURES, represented as variables with assignments.

Associations between concepts that are analogous or metaphorically related are represented as VIEWs\[Jacobs and Rau, 1985, Jacobs, 1986a\], which also associate related roles.

Most systems that perform semantic interpretation \[Bobrow and Webber, 1980, Sondheimer et al., 1984, Lytinen, 1984, Hirst, 1987\] address this imprecision by offering means of selecting among alternative interpretations.
