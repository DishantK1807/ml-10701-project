We analyzed a set of articles and identified six major operations that can be used for editing the extracted sentences, including removing extraneous phrases from an extracted sentence, combining a reduced sentence with other sentences, syntactic transformation, substituting phrases in an extracted sentence with their paraphrases, substituting phrases with more general or specific descriptions, and reordering the extracted sentences (Jing and McKeown, 1999; Jing and McKeown, 2000).

The system also uses a largescale, reusable lexicon we combined from multiple resources (Jing and McKeown, 1998).
P98-1099
(Chandrasekar et al., 1996) discussed text simplification in general.
C96-2183
(Corston-Oliver and Dolan, 1999) proposed to remove clauses in sentences before indexing documents for Information Retrieval.
