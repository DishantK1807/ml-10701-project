Li and Abe (1998) model selectional preferences of a verb (for an argument position) as a set of nodes in the semantic class hierarchy with a probability distribution over them.

Abney 42 and Light (1999) use a different representational approach: they train a separate hidden Markov model for each verb, and the selectional preference is represented as a probability distribution over words instead of semantic classes.

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

Both Jiang and Conrath (1997) and Lin (1998) propose extentions of Resnik?s measure.

Clark and Weir (2002) also find an appropriate set of concept nodes to represent the selectional preferences for a verb, but do so using a ?2 test over corpus frequencies mapped to concepts to determine when to generalize from a node to its parent.

3Computational models of verb selectional preference have been evaluated through disambiguation tasks (Li and Abe, 1998; Abney and Light, 1999; Ciaramita and Johnson, 2000; Clark and Weir, 2002), but for to evaluate our cognitive model, the experiments from Resnik (1996) are the most interesting.

Ciaramita and Johnson (2000) use a Bayesian network with the same topology as WordNet to estimate the probability distribution of the relevant set of nodes in the hierarchy.

We use 20,000 sentences randomly selected from the British National Corpus (BNC),4 automatically parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and further processed with TGrep2,5 and an NP-head extraction software.6 For 2To our knowledge, the only work that considers selectional preferences of subjects and prepositional phrases as well as direct objects is Brockmann and Lapata (2003).
