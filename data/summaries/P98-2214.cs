Feature Selection by One-by-one Feature Adding The feature selection process presented in Della Pietra et al.(1997) and Berger et al.(1996) is an incremental procedure that builds up S by successively adding features oneby-one.

Resnik (1993) and Li and Abe (1995) studied how to find an optimal abstraction level of an argument noun in a tree-structured thesaurus.

Li and Abe (1996) also studied a method for learning dependencies between case slots and reported that dependencies were discovered only at the slotlevel and not at the class-level.

The probability of generating a verbnoun collocation from (partial) subcategorization frames is simply estimated as the product of the probabilities 4.2.2 Subcategorization Preference Test using Positive/Negative Examples The other type of the model evaluation criterion is the performance in the subcategorization preference test presented in Utsuro and Matsumoto (1997), in which the goodness of the model is measured according to how many of the positive examples can be judged as more appropriate than the negative examples.

Since the leaf class cc ("child") can be generated from either Chum or cream, and also the leaf class cj ('~uice') can be generated from either Cbe v or Cliq, e can be regarded as generated according to either of the four formulas (10) and (11),~(13): ga : Cma m ~ de : Cpl c ) e WO : Cbe v ga : Chum ' de : Cpl c > WO : Cliq ga : c .... de : %to, e (13) WO : Cliq 3 Maximum Entropy Modeling of Subcategorization Preference This section describes how we apply the maximum entropy modeling approach of Della Pietra et al.(1997) and Berger et al.(1996) to model learning of subcategorization preference.

For example, Magerman (1995), Collins (1996), and Charniak (1997) proposed statistical parsing models which incorporated lexical/semantic information.

As a model learning method, we adopt the maximum entropy model learning method (Della Pietra et al., 1997; Berger et al., 1996).

However, unlike the models of Magerman (1995), Collins (1996), and Charniak (1997), we assume that syntactic and lexical/semantic features are independent.
