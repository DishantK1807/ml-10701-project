(,~oox) \[CASE : case-2 case relation : r~SJECT \[NP : ~1 (Semantic Constraints: HUMAN) 3.2 Analysis of English Sentences The English sentences are analyzed using Brill's English ta~er (Bri\]l, 1992) and partially parsed using the tamed information for each English word.

These methods use categorized semantic and pragznatic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns.

Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1990; Â¥oshimoto, 1988; Dousa~a, 1994).

127 To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider appl/cations for a practical machine translation system with an n~\]imJted translation target area, have been proposed (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakalwa and Ikehara, 1996).

Several methods have been proposed with regard to aligning sentences (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Haruno and Yamazaki, 1996; Kay and l~osche/sen, 1993), alJs~nlng words (Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Wu, 1995; Yamada et al., 1996) and acquiring rules from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tana~, 1994; Yamada et al., 1995).

With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasukawa, 1996).
