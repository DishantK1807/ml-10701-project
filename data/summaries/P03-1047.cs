In the past few years there has been considerable activity in the development of formalisms for underspecified semantics (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Reyle, 1993; Bos, 1996; Copestake et al., 1999; Egg et al., 2001).

It shows the equivalence of a large fragment of MRSs and a corresponding fragment of normal dominance constraints, which in turn is equivalent to a large fragment of Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996) as proven in (Koller et al., 2003).

The requirement of hypernormal connections in islands replaces the notion of chain-connectedness in (Koller et al., 2003), which fails to apply to dominance constraints with weak dominance edges.

Recent work in semantic construction for HPSG (Copestake et al., 2001) supports our conjecture: the examples discussed there are compatible with our simplification.
P01-1019
The previous proof techniques for normal dominance constraints (Koller et al., 2003) do not apply.
