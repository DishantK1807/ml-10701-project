For example, in Ingria and Stallard (1989), an S node is taken to be the binding domain for every node it dominates.

For instance, Correa (1988) proposes an algorithm that builds lists of antecedents for pronouns and anaphors, and complements it with a Binding Rule, that selects, for each item, an indexation from such lists.

By fixing an upper bound, it has been shown that the computational complexity of the recognition problem of a language that encodes Principles A and B of BT is in p.~S These results are similar to those obtained by all authors who have studied BT from a computational point of view (Correa, 1988; Ingria and Sta\[lard, 1989; Berwick and Weinberg, 1984; Berwick, 1989).
