Automatic text summarization has been studied for decades (Edmundson 1969) and is still a very active area (Salton et al.1994; Kupiec et al.1995; Brandow et al.1995; Lin 1999; Aone et al.1999; Sekine and Nobata 2001; Mani 2001; McKeown et al.2001; Radev et al.2003). Only a few have tried using machine learning to accomplish this difficult task (Lin 1999; Aone et al.1999; Neto et al.2002). Most research falls into combining statistical methods with linguistic analysis.

However, due to the unavailability of other summarization systems to perform the same task, we designed three baseline methods, namely lead-based, randomly-selected, and random-lead-based, to generate summaries for performance comparison, which were also adopted by (Brandow et al.1995; Zechner 1996; Radev et al.2003). The baseline methods are detailed as 2 CMPLG corpus is composed of 183 documents from the Computation and Language (cmp-lg) collection, which has been marked up in XML.

Architecture In addition to the traditional way of extracting the highest ranked sentences in a document to compose a summary as in (Edmundson 1969; Lin 1999; Kupiec et al.1995; Brandow 1995; Zechner 1996), we embedded a machine learning mechanism in our system.
