This type of reference is different from the type that has been studied traditionally by researchers who have usually assumed that the agents have mutual knowledge of the referent (Appelt, 1985a; Appelt and Kronfeld, 1987; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Heeman and Hirst, 1992; Searle, 1969), are copreseut with the referent (Heeman and Hirst, 1992; Cohen, 1981), or have the referent in their focus of attention (Reiter and Dale, 1992).

One approach is to encode the salient properties in a static hierarchy as Davis (1989), and Reiter and Dale (1992) have done.
