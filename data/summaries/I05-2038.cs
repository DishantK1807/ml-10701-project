The Pennsylvania biology corpus (Kulick et al., 2004) partially solves this problem by separating a token where two or more subtokens are connected with hyphens, but in the cases where a shared part of the word is not separated by a hyphen (e.g.

In bio-textmining, for example, training on part-of-speech (POS)-annotated GENIA corpus was reported to improve the accuracy of JunK tagger (English POS tagger) (Kazama et al., 2001) from 83.5% to 98.1% on MEDLINE abstracts (Tateisi and Tsujii, 2004), and the FraMed corpus (Wermter and Hahn, 2004) was used to train TnT tagger on German (Brants, 2000) to improve its accuracy from 95.7% to 98% on clinical reports and other biomedical texts.

For further clean-up, we also tried to parse the corpus by the Enju parser (Miyao and Tsujii 2004), and identify the error of the corpus by investigating into the parse errors.

Similar attempt of constructing integrated corpora is being done in University of Pennsylvania, where a corpus of MEDLINE abstracts in CYP450 and oncology domains where annotated for named entities, POS, and tree structure of sentences (Kulick et al, 2004).
