These rules can either be hand-crafted (Garside et al., 1987; Klein & Simmons, 1963; Green & Rubin, 1971), or learned, as in Hindle (1989) or the transformation-based error-driven approach of Brill (1992).

The window size used by the algorithm will also dynamically change depending on the information present in the context for the disambiguation of a particular focus symbol (see Schfitze et al., 1994, and Pereira et al., 1995 1ACL Data Collection Initiative CD-ROM 1, September 1991.

Again, we take advantage of the data fusion capabilities of a memory-based approach by combining these two sources of information in the case representation, and having the information gain feature relevance weighting technique figure out their relative relevance (see Schmid, 1994; Samuelsson, 1994 for similar solutions).

Compared to learning rule-based approaches such as the one by Brill (1992), a k-nn approach provides a uniform approach for all disambiguation tasks, more flexibility in the engineering of case representations, and a more elegant approach to handling of unknown words (see e.g.
