While most of earlier approaches rely on handcrafted rules or dictionaries, many recent works adopt machine learning approaches, e.g, SVM (Lee, 2003), HMM (Zhou, 2004), Maximum Entropy (Lin, 2004) and CRF (Settles,2004), especially with the availability of annotated corpora such as GENIA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
