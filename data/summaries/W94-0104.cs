Some are well-known such as the association ratio, close to the concept of mutual information, introduced by \[Church and Hanks, 1990\]: a IM = log~ (a+b)Ca+c) (1) the O 2 coefficient introduced by \[Gale and Church, 1991\]: 02 = (adbe) 2 (a + b)(a + c)(b + c)(b + d) (2) or the Loglike coefficient introduced by \[Dunning, 1993\]: Loglike = a loga + blogb + clogc + dlogd -( a + b)log(a + b) ( a + c) logCa -Ic) -(b + d) logCb + d) ( c + d) logCc + d) +(a+b+c+d)logCa+b+c+d) (3) A property of these scores is that their values increase with the strength of the bond of the lemmas.

For the latter, several works (\[Lafon, 1984\], \[Church and Hanks, 1990\], \[Calzolari and Bindi, 1990\], \[Smadja and McKeown, 1990\]) have shown that statistical scores are useful to extract collocations from corpora.
