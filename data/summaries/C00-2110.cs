For Japmmse, Sekine et al.(Sekine et al., 2000) proposed a Japanese dependency analyzer which mmlyzes sentences in time quadratic in the sentence length using a backward search algorithm.
C00-2109
Theoretically, it takes time quadratic in the length and this is observed experimentally as well (see Figure 3 in (Sekine et al., 2000)).
C00-2109
There are a number of eflbrts to improve the accuracy of Japanese dependency analysis (Haruno et.al, 1997) (Fujio, Matsumoto, 1998) (Kanaymna et.al, 2000).

Roche built an English syntactic mmlyzer by finding a fixed point in a non-deterministic FST (Roche, 1994).
