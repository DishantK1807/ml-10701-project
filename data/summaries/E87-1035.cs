In the final section, we evaluate these predictions in the light of the Determinism Hypothesis (Marcus, 1980) and the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis (Briscoe & Boguraev, 1984; Briscoe, in press) and argue that the Lexicat parser in conjunction with the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis provides the most psychologically plausible and unified account of the parsing of unbounded dependencies.
P84-1056
Briscoe & Boguraev (1984) and Briscoe (in press) propose a different account of the relationship between parsing and other components of comprehension than that entailed by the Determinism Hypothesis, dubbed the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis (IDH).
P84-1056
Shieber (1983) and Pereira (1985) both provide grammars with a GPSG-style (Gazdar et al., 1985) SLASH feature analysis of unbounded dependencies.
P83-1017
One exception is the work of Shieber (1983) and Pereira (1985), who have proposed that a simple extension of the LALR(1) technique can be used to model human natural language parsing strategies.
P83-1017
In addition, Briscoe & Boguraev (1984) and Briscoe (in press) propose that a bounded context, deterministic parser in conjunction with an extended categorial grammar will also model these strategies.
P84-1056
An earlier version of the parser is briefly described in Briscoe & Boguraev (1984).
P84-1056
Shieber, 1983) and no conflict will arise parsing these examples with a grammar like that in (8).
