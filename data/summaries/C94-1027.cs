prediction). The performance of tl,e presented tagger is measured and compared to that of two other taggers (Cutting et al., 1992; Kempe, 1993).

It is similar to tile network of Nakamura et al.(1990) in so far as the same training procedure (Backpropagation) is used; but it differs in the structure of tile network and also in its purpose (disambignation vs.

They report rates of correctly tagged words which are comparable to that presented by Church (1988) and Kempe (1993).

In tabh; 2, the accuracy rate of the Net-Tagger is cOrolLated to that of a trigram l)msed tagger (Kempe, 1993) and a lIidden Markov Model tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) which were.

In this paper, a new part-of-speech tagging method hased on neural networks (Net-Tagger) is presented and its performance is compared to that of a llMM-tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and a trigrambased tagger (Kempe, 1993).

Jelinek (1985) and Cutting et al.(1992) circumvent this problem by training their taggers on untagged data using tile Itaum-Welch algorithm (also know as the forward-backward algorithm).

No documentation of tile construction algorithm of the su\[lix lexicon in (Cutting et al., 1992) was available.

LEXICON The lexicon which contains the a priori tag probabilities for each word is similar to the lexicon which was used by Cutting et al.(1992). it has three parts: a fullform lexicon, a suffix lexicon and a default enlry.
