Both determinization (Mohri 1994c) and minimization algorithms (Mohri 1994b) have been defined for the class of p-subsequential transducers, which includes sequential string-to-string transducers.
P94-1028
We do not give the proof of the theorem; it can be proved in a way similar to what is indicated in Mohri (1994b).
P94-1028
The algorithm extends our determinization algorithm for stringto-string transducers representing p-subsequential functions to the case of transducers outputting weights (Mohri 1994c).
P94-1028
The result of the computation described by Kaplan and Kay (1994) is not necessarily a p-subsequential transducer.

Their recent applications in natural language processing, which range from the construction of lexical analyzers (Silverztein 1993) and the compilation of morphological and phonological rules (Kaplan and Kay 1994; Karttunen, Kaplan and Zaenen 1992) to speech processing (Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996) show the usefulness of finite-state machines in many areas.

There exists an efficient algorithm for the general case of the composition of transducers (transducers subsequential or not, having e-transitions or not, and with outputs in ~*, or in ~* t2 {oo} x T4+ U {oo}) (Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996).

Finite-state machines are also currently used to represent local syntactic constraints (Silberztein 1993; Roche 1993; Karlsson et al.1995; Mohri 1994d).
P94-1028
In all those areas, the determinization algorithm can be used to obtain a p-subsequential transducer (Mohri 1996b), and the minimization algorithm to reduce the size of the p-subsequential transducer used (Mohri 1994b).
P94-1028 P96-1031
It can then be used, for instance, at any step in an onthe-fly cascade of composition of transducers in speech recognition to expand only the necessary part of a lattice or transducer (Pereira and Riley 1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1996).
P96-1031
Similarly, context-dependent phonological and morphological rules can be represented by finite-state transducers (Kaplan and Kay 1994).
J94-3001
We here define a minimization algorithm for subsequential power series defined on the tropical semiring, which extends the algorithm defined by Mohri (1994b) in the case of string-to-string transducers.
P94-1028
For a more detailed overview of the applications of sequential string to string transducers to language processing, see Mohri (1996a).
P96-1031
In order to deal with ambiguities, one can introduce p-subsequential transducers (Mohri 1994a), namely transducers provided with at most p final output strings at each final state.
P94-1028
In particular, subsequential power series allow for efficient results in indexation of natural language texts (Crochemore 1986; Mohri 1996b).
P96-1031
See Mohri (1996b) for a full description of this algorithm.
P96-1031
These observations can be extended to the case of weighted rewrite rules (Mohri and Sproat 1996).
P96-1031
As an example, a French morphological dictionary of about 21.2 Mb can be compiled into a p-subsequential transducer of 1.3 Mb, in a few minutes (Mohri 1996b).
P96-1031
The algorithm of Figure 10 used with the string semiring is exactly the determinization algorithm for subsequentiable string-to-string transducers, as defined by Mohri (1994c).
