Centering's Rule 1 states that if any element of the previous utterance's forward looking center list is realized in the current utterance as a pronoun, then the backward looking center must be realized as a pronoun as well (Grosz et al., 1995.

Nakhimovsky, Ao (1988).

Reichman (1985) and Grosz & Sidner (1986) indicate that discourse segmentation has an effect on the linguistic realization of referring expressions.

A shift in the deictic center can be signaled by a shift of topic, a shift of time scale, a shift in spatial scale, or a shift in perspective (Nakhimovsky, 1988; Wiebe, 1994).

Approaches which define discourse segments on the basis of reference resolution (Sidner, 1979; Suri & McCoy, 1994; Strobe & Hahn, 1997) are not useful for our purposes because they require referring expressions for recognizing segment boundaries.

Other researchers have indicated that fuller descriptions tend to bbe found at the beginning of discourse segments (Grosz & Sidaer, 1986; Reichman, 1985), even when the object being referred to is extzemely prominent in the preceding sentence.

Here, to distingni~h o~ notion from other notions of discmuse segmentation found in the literature (e.g., Reidmum (1985) or Grosz & Sidner (1986)), we use the term discomae thread to capture the structuring notion to whidz we refer.

For instance, in the kinds of discourses studied in Grosz & Sidner (1986) the threading device may be the intentional structures (and each of their discourse segments would constitute a thread of the discourse), in the discourses that we studied (New York Times a~cles), threads defined in terms of the time referenced in a clause appeared to be quite prominent.

To our knowledge, there are only two focus-based pronoun resolution algorithms that are specified in enough detail to work on unrestricted naturally occurring text: Brennan et al.(1987) using the definition of utterance according to Kameyama (1998), and Struhe (1998).

Changes in time scale or time, as we redefined the category, may require world knowledge reasoning to recoguize but are often indicated by either cue words and phrases (e.g., "n/he years ago ", " a year", "for months'; "several months ago"), a change in .grammatical time of the verb (e.g., past tense versus present tense), or changes in aspect (e.g., atomic versus extended events versus states as defined by Moens & Steedman (1988)).

A pronoun interpretation algorithm based on centering which relied on centering transition preferences was developed in Brennan et aL (1987)~ Using transition preferences in a pronoun generation rule would cover more cases of pronoun use than is covered by Rule 1, but the application of such transition preferences also proved unhelpful in explaining pronoun patterns in our corpus.

Nakhimovsky (1988) also uses changes in "`time scale" as a marker for changes in time.

1982; Vogt, 1990), "we determined that changes in the deictic center of the story (Nakhimoysky, 1988: Wiebe, 1994) not only must be part of the input to a sentence generator (e.g., for appropriate tense generation), but were also both well marked in the text and seemed to have an influence on anaphoric expression choice.
