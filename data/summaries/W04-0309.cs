Lang and Billot observe (1974; 1988; 1989) that the incremental state of a parser can be described by another, related grammar.

The present paper extends Lounsbury’s original idea to infinite languages, by applying two classical ideas in (probabilistic) formal language theory: Grenander’s (1967) closed-form solution for the entropy of a nonterminal in a probabilistic context-free phrase structure grammar, and Lang’s (1974; 1988) insight that an intermediate parser state is itself a specification of a grammar.

Branches of these derivation trees were viewed as PCFG rules with probabilities set according to the usual relative-frequency estimation technique (Chi, 1999).
