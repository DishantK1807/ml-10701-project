2:17	Interest in automatic summarization continues to grow, motivated by the explosion of on-line information sources and advances in natural language processing and information retrieval.
3:17	In fact, some form of automatic summarization may be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the 21 st century.
4:17	The problem of automatic summarization poses a variety of tough challenges in both NL understanding and generation.
5:17	A spate of recent papers and tutorials on this subject at conferences such as ACL/EACL, AAAI, ECAI, IJCAI, and SIGIR point to a growing interest in research in this field.
6:17	Several commercial summarization products have,also' appeared.
7:17	There have been several workshops in the past on this subject: in Dagstuhl (1994), Madrid (1997), and Stanford (1998).
8:17	It is our great pleasure to bring the fourth such event to you.
9:17	While the field continues to progress, there are also many problems that need to be addressed before the promises of automatic text summarization can be fully realized.
10:17	The papers included in this volume present a snapshot of recent progress in solving some of the problems: concept identification, identification of discourse markers, multi-document summarization, content visualization, evaluation, and use.
11:17	Out of 29 submissions to the workshop, 10 are included in these proceedings.
12:17	We would like to thank all authors for their hard work.
13:17	This workshop would not be possible without them.
14:17	We would also like to thank the program committee and all the reviewers for their valuable feedback.
15:17	In addition, we are grateful to the ACL for sponsoring the workshop and to the MITRE Corporation for supporting the publication of the proceedings.
