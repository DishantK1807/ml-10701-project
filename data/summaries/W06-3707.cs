The Regulus platform, on which MedSLT is based, supports rapid construction of complex grammar-based language models; it uses an example-based method driven by small corpora of disambiguated parsed examples (Rayner et al., 2003; Rayner et al., 2006), which extracts most of the structure of the model from a general linguistically motivated resource grammar.
