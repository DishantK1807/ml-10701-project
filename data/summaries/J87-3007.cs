An interesting perspective on the field is given in Miller (1985).

The work in lexicon has centered on a) studies concerned with the utilization of conventional humanoriented dictionaries, newly available in machine-readable form, for computational tasks (e.g., Amsler 1984a,b; Chodorow et al.1985; Ahlswede 1985; Markowitz et al.1986) improving the ancillary capabilities for lexicon systems, such as, for instance, morphological processors and descriptions (e.g., Nirenburg and Ben Asher 1984; Byrd et al.1986; Boguraev et al.1987); c) hand-building of lexicons necessary for natural language systems, often with considerations about extensibility (e.g., Zernik and Dyer 1985; Bessemer and Jacobs 1987).

the subworld concept lexicons, which contain representations, in the DRL knowledge representation language (Nirenburg, Raskin, Tucker 1986), of concepts that belong to a particular subworld, such as, for instance, the subworld of weather reports or of research papers in computer science; 2.

Such a distinction is common in certain knowledge representation languages (see Brachman and Schmolze 1985; Nirenburg et al.1986). Concept types belong in the lexicon; concept tokens are instantiations of concept types obtained as a result of analyzing natural language inputs.

Recent work on machine-readable dictionaries offers new and interesting possibilities both for the computerassisted lexicology (see Walker 1984) and for constructing lexical databases derived from the definitions in machine-readable dictionaries and utilized in NLP along with other fields (see Amsler 1982, 1984a; Walker, Amsler 1986, Calzolari 1984a,b).

Rather, we must carefully re-represent the encyclopedia's knowledge -by hand -into some more structured form' (Lenat et al.1986:75). Such re-representation would be necessary for Amsler's (1984a:458) 'lexical knowledge base \[which\] is a repository of computational information about concepts' and which contains information derived from machine-readable dictionaries, the full text of reference books, the results of statistical analysis of text usages, and data manually obtained from human world knowledge'.

In the area of machine translation the analysis and generation lexicons involve two different natural languages, which creates the task of building such resources as, say, an Englishsubworld and subworld -Russian lexicons, as is the case, for example, in TRANSLATOR, the knowledge-based machine translation project for the computer subworld (see Nirenburg et al.1985, 1986, 1987).

The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g., Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g., Lenat et al.1986). Ahlswede (1985) describes a typical approach to lexicon building in a constrained subworld.

Thus, TEAM (Grosz et al.1985), TEL1 (Ballard and Stumberger, 1986), IRACQ (Ayuso et al.1987) and some others are devoted to facilitating customizations in the framework of database query systems; INKA (Phillips et al.1986) and CYC (Lenat et al.1986) are examples of knowledge acquisition systems aimed at expert system design.
