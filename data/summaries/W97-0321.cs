Moreover, the effectiveness of this method on disambiguating words in large-scale corpora into fine-grained sense distinctions needs to be further investigated (Ng and Lee, 1996).

Recently, some kinds of learning techniques have been applied to cumulatively acquire exemplars form large corpora (Yarowsky, 1994, 1995).

Undoubtedly, effective disambiguation techniques are of great use in many natural language processing tasks, e.g., machine translation and information retrieving (Allen, 1995; Ng and Lee, 1996; Resnik, 1995), etc.

Exemplar-based method makes use of typical contexts (exemplars) of a word sense, e.g., verbnoun collocations or adjective-noun collocations, and identifies the correct sense of a word in a particular context by comparing the context with the exemplars (Ng and Lee, 1996).

Statistics-based method often requires large-scale corpora (e.g., Hirst, 1987; Luk, 1995), sense-tagging or not, monolingual or aligned bilingual, as training data to specify significant clues for each word sense.

1. Introduction Word sense disambiguation has long been one of the major concerns in natural language processing area (e.g., Bruce et al., 1994; Choueka et al., 1985; Gale et al., 1993; McRoy, 1992; Yarowsky 1992, 1994, 1995), whose aim is to identify the correct sense of a word in a particular context, among all of its senses defined in a dictionary or a thesaurus.
