(Cheng, 1998) describes interactions that need to be taken into account in aggregation.

Since semantic parataxis has a higher priority than embedding (Cheng, 1998), a good embedding should be less preferred than using a conjunct relation, but it should be preferred over a center continuation for it to happen.

(Mellish et al., 1998a) summarises the genetic algorithm roughly as follows: 1.

In the theory of discourse structure developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986), each discourse segment exhibits two types of coherence: local coherence among utterances inside the segment, and global coherence between this segment and other discourse segments.

Mellish et al.(1998a) present some scores for evaluating the basic features of a tree, but they make it clear that the scores are there for descriptive purpose, not for making any serious claim about the best way of evaluating RS trees.

As pointed out in (Grosz et al., 1995), different realisations (e.g.

For better coordination, we adopt the text planner based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as described in (Mellish et al., 1998a).

Figure 1: Aggregation examples of (Mellish et al., 1998a) which uses a joint relation to connect every two text spans that do not have a semantic relation other than objectattribute elaboration and conjunct/disjunct in between.

For such a genre, a domain-dependent bottom-up planner (Marcu, 1997) or opportunistic planner (Mellish et al., 1998b) suits better than a domainindependent top-down planner.
