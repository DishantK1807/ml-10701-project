Some present-day research in machine learning of morpho-phonology indeed focuses on satisfying linguistically-motivated constraints as a postprocessing or filtering step; e.g., see (Daya et al., 2004) on identifying roots in Hebrew word forms.

Also, we plan comparisons to the work of Stroppa and Yvon (2005) and Damper and Eastmond (1997) on sequence-global analogy-based models for morpho-phonological processing, since the main difference between this related work and ours is that both alternatives are based on working units of variable width, rather than our fixedwidth n-grams, and also their analogical reasoning is based on interestingly different principles than our k-nearest neighbor classification rule, such as the use of analogical proportions by Stroppa and Yvon (2005).
