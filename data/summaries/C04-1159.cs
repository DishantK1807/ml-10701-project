Although Matsubara and colleagues did investigate dependency structures in spontaneous speech (Matsubara et al., 2002), the target speech was dialogues where the utterances were short and sentence boundaries could be easily defined based on turn-taking data.

Sentences can also be analyzed deterministically without great loss of accuracy (Uchimoto et al., 1999).

Almost all previous research on Japanese dependency structure analysis dealt with dependency structures in written text (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Haruno et al., 1998; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).

The conventional statistical model (Collins, 1996; Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Haruno et al., 1998; Uchimoto et al., 1999) uses only the relationship between two bunsetsustoestimate the probability of dependency, whereas the model in this study (Uchimoto et al., 2000) takes into account not only the relationship between two bunsetsus but also the relationship between the left bunsetsu and all the bunsetsus to its right.

We used YamCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) as a text chunker, which is based on SVM and uses polynomial kernel functions.
