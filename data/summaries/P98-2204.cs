The S-list ranking criteria define a preference for hearer-old over hearer-new discourse entities (Prince, 1981) generalizing Strube & Hahn's (1996) approach.

The use of the centering transitions in Brennan et al.'s (1987) algorithm prevents it from being applied incrementally (cf.

3.2 S-List Ranking Strube & Hahn (1996) rank the Cfaccording to the information status of discourse entities.

The model has been motivated with evidence from preferences for the antecedents of pronouns (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) and has been applied to pronoun resolution (Brennan et al.(1987), inter alia, whose interpretation differs from the original model).

1251 Cb(Ui) = Cp(Vi) Cb(Ui) yÂ£ Cp(t:i) For their centering algorithm, Brennan et al.(1987, henceforth BFP-algorithm) extend the notion of centering transition relations, which hold across adjacent utterances, to differentiate types of shift (cf.

New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1987, p.60. 1256 The focus model (Sidner, 1983; Suri & McCoy, 1994) accounts for evoked discourse entities explicitly because it uses the discourse focus, which is determined by a successful anaphora resolution.

Walker et al.(1994)) consists of three basic steps: 1.

Grosz et al.(1995) and Brennan et al.(1987) use grammatical relations to rank the Cf (i.e., subj -.< obj -< )... but state that other factors might also play a role.

My proposal is inspired by the centering model (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995) and draws on the conclusions of Strube & Hahn's (1996) approach for the ranking of the forward-looking center list for German.

Table 1 taken from Walker et al.(1994)). Cb(Ui) = Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Ui) OR no Cb(Ui-1) Cb(Vi-1) CONTINUE SMOOTH-SHIFT RETAIN ROUGH-SHIFT Table 1: Transition Types Brennan et al.(1987) modify the second of two rules on center movement and realization which were defined by Grosz et al.(1983; 1995): Rule 1: If some element of Cf(Ui-1) is realized as a pronoun in Ui, then so is Cb(Ui).

To illustrate this algorithm, we consider example (1) (Brennan et al., 1987) which has two different final utterances (ld) and (ld~).

In Section 4, I compare the results of my algorithm with the results of the centering algorithm (Brennan et al., 1987) with and without specifications for complex sentences (Kameyama, 1998).

Its incremental character seems to be an answer to the question Kehler (1997) recently raised.

Following Walker (1989), a segment is defined as a paragraph unless its first sentence has a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun where none of the preceding sentence-internal noun phrases matches its syntactic features.

Method. I use the following guidelines for the hand-simulated analysis (Walker, 1989).

Also Lappin & Leass (1994), who give the subject of the current sentence the highest weight, have an implicit notion of evokedness.
