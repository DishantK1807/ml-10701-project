ac. uk Abstract We describe an information extraction system in which four classes of naming expressions organisation, person, location and tinm names are recognised and classified with nearly 92% combined precision and recall.
The system applies a mixture of techniques to perform this task and these are described in detail.
We have quantitatively evaluated the system against a blind test set of Wall Street Journal business articles and report results not only for the system as a whole, but for each component technique and for each class of name.
These results show that in order to have high recall, the system needs to make use not only of information internal to the naming expression but also information from outside the nmne.
They also show that the contribution of each system component w~ries fl'om one (:lass of name expression to another.
1 Introduction
The appropriate treatment of proper names is essential in a natural language understanding system which processes unedited newswire text, since up to 10 % of this type of text may consist of proper names (Coates-Stephens, 1992).
Nor is it only the sheer volume of names that makes them important; for some applications, such as information extraction (IE), robust handling of proper names is a prerequisite for successflflly performing other tasks such as template filling where correctly identifying the entities which play semantic roles in relational frames is crucial.
Recent research in the fifth and sixth Message Understanding Conferences (MUC5, 1993) (MUC6, 1995) has shown that the recognition and classification of proper names in business newswire text can now be done on a large scale and with high accuracy: the success rates of the best systems now approach 96%.
We have developed an IE system LaSIf (Large Scale Information Extraction) (Gaizauslms ct al, 1995) which extracts important facts from tmsiness newswire texts.
As a key part of the extraction task, the system recognises and classifies certain types of naming expressions, namely those specified in the MUC-6 named entity (NE) task definition (MUC6, 1995).
These include organisation, person, and location names, time expressions, percentage expressions, and monetary amount expressions.
As defined for MUC-6, the first three of these are proper names, the fourth contains some expressions that would be classified as proper names by linguists and some that; would not, while the last two would generally not be thought of as proper names.
In this paper we concentrate only the behaviour of the LaSIE system with regards to recognising and classifying expressions in the first four classes, i.e. those which consist entirely or in part of proper names (though nothing hangs on omitting the others).
The version of the system reported here achieves ahnost 92% combilmd precision and recall scores on this task against blind test data.
Of course the four name classes mentioned are not the only classes of proper names.
Brand narnes, book and movie names, and ship names are.just a few further classes one might chose to identify.
One might also want to introduce subclasses within the selected classes.
We have not done so here for two reasons.
First, and foremost, in order to generate quantitative evaluation results we have used tile MUC-6 data and scoring resources and these restrict us to the above proper name classes.
Secondly, these four name classes account for the bulk of proper name occurrences in business newswire text.
Our approach could straightforwardly be extended to account for additional classes of proper nalnes, and the points we wish to make about tile approach can be adequately presented using only this restricted set.
Our approach to proper name recognition is heterogeneous.
We take advantage of graphological, syntactic, semantic, world knowledge, and discourse level information to perform the task.
In the paper we present details of the approach, describing those data and processing componm~ts of the overall IE system which contribute to proper name recognition and classification.
Since name 418 recognition and classification is achieved through the activity of four successive components in the system, we quantitatively ewfluate tile successive contribution of each comt)onent in our overall approach.
We perform this analysis not only for all classes of names, but for each class separately.
The, resulting analysis 1.
supports McDonald's obse, rvation (McDoi> aid, 1993) that external evidence as well as internal evidence is essential for achieving high precision and recall ill the recognition and classification task; i.e. not just the name string itself must be examined, but other information in the text must be used as well; 2.
shows that all eoInponents in our heterogeneous apt)roach contribute significantly; 3.
shows that not all classes of prot)er naines benefit equally h'om the contritmtions of the different colnponents in our system: in particular, organisation names t)enefit most from the use of external evidence.
In tile second section an overview of the I,aSIE system is presented.
The third section explains in detail how proper names are reeognised and classified in the system.
The results of evaluating the system on a blind test set; of 30 articles are presented and discussed in section 4.
Section 5 concludes the paper.

N { TeC'e'l');;;"~ \[ \[ "e,,,7\[ .~ P.e!ul~/ "~ ~ _ ~ t~vAelnents~J Figure 1: LaSIE Systeln Architecture LaSIE has been designed as a general tmrpose IE research system, initially geared towards, but not solely restricted to, carrying out the tasks specified by the sixth Message Understanding Confe, rence: named entity recognition, coreference resolution, template element tilling, and scenario template filling tasks (see (MUC6, 1995) for fllrther details of the task descriptions).
In addition, the system can generate a brief natural language summary of the scenario it.
has detected in the text.
All of these tasks are carried out by building a single rich inodel of the text the discourse model from which the various results are read oil.
Tile high level structure of LaSIE is illustrated in Figure 1.
The system is a pipelined architecture which processes a text sentence-at-a-time and consists of three principal processing stages: lexical preproeessing, parsing plus semant;ic inter-pretation, and discourse interpretation.
The overall contributions of these stages may be briefly described as follows: • lexlcal preproeessing reads and tokenises tile raw inlmt text, tags the toke, ns with parts-of-speech, t)e, rforms morI)hological analysis, Imrtbrms phrasal matching against lists of proper names, and builds lexical and phrasal chart edges in a h'.ature-based formalism for hand-over to the parser; • parsing does two pass parsing, pass one with a special proper name grairlmal'~ pass two with a general grammar and, after selecting a 'best parse', passes on a semantic representation of the current senteliC(~ which includes nanle clans infi)rmation; • discourse interpretation adds the information ill its input semantic representation to a hierarchically structured selnantic ne, t which encodes the system's world model, adds additional ilffOl',natioi1 presupposed by the input to the world model, perforlns coreference resolution be, tween new instances added and others already ill the world model, and adds information consequent upon the addition of the input to the worhl Inodel.
For fltrther det~fils of the systeln see (Gaizauskas ct al, 1.995). 3 How proper names are recognised and classified As indicated in section 1, our approach is a heterogeneous one ill which the system makes use of graI)hological, syntactic, selnantic, world knowledge,, and discourse level intb,'mation for the recognition and classification of proper names.
The system utilises both the information which comes fl'oln the name itse.lf (internal evidence ill McDonald's sense (McDonaht, 1993)) as well as tile information which colnes from outside, the name, froln its context in the text: (external evidence).
In what tbllows we describe how proper names are recognised and classified in LaSIE by considering the contribution of each system component.
3.1 Lexieal
preproeessing The input text is first tokenise.d and then each token is tagged with a part-of-stmech tag from the, Penn qtYeebank tagset (Marcus ct al, 1993) using a slightly custolnised ~ version of Brill's tag1The tagger has been:customised by adding some entries to its lexicon and by adding several special tags 419 ger (Brill, :1.994).
The tagset contains two tags fin' proper nouns NNP for singular proper nouns and I~NPS for plurals.
The tagger tags a word as a proper noun as follows: if the word is timnd in the tagger's lexicon and listed as a proper noun then tag it, as such; otherwise, if the word is not found in the lexicon and is uppercase initial then tag it as a proper noun.
Thus, capitalised unknown tokens are tagged as proper nouns by default.
Before parsing an attempt is made to identi\[y proper naine phrases sequences of proper names and to classify them.
This is done by matching tile input against pre-stored lists of proper nalnes.
The.se lists are compiled via a flex program into a finite state recogniser.
Each sentence is fed to the recogniser and all single and multi-word matches are tagged with special tags which indicate the name (:lass.
Lists of names used include: • organisation : about 2600 company and governmental institution nmnes based on an organisation name list which was semiautomatically collected from the MUC-5 answer keys and training corl)us (Wall Street Journal articles); • location : about 2200 major country, province~state, and city names derived fl'om a gazetteer list of about 150,000 place naines; • person : about 500 given names taken Dom a list; of given names in the Oxford Advanced Le.arner's Dictionary (Hornby, 1980); • eompmly designator : 94 designators (e.g.
'Co.','PLC'), based on the company designator list provided in the MUC6 reference resources.
• human titles : about 160 titles, (e.g.
'President','Mr.'), manually collected; As well as name phrase matching, another technique is applied at this point, inside multi-word proper names, certain words m~y flmction as triqget words.
A trigger word indicates that the tokens surrounding it are' probably a proper name and may reliably pernfit the class or even subclass 2 of tile proper nmne to be determined.
For example, 'Wing and l'rwer Airlines' is ahnost certainly a company, given tile presence of the word 'Airlines'.
~Digger words are detected by matching against, lists of such words and are then specially tagged.
Subsequently these tags are used by the proper nmne parser to build complex proper name constituents.
The lists of trigger words are: • AMine company: 3 trigger words for finding airline company names, e.g.
'Airlines'; • Governmental institutions: 7 trigger words for governmental institutions, e.g 'Ministry'; for word classes such as days of the week and months.
2company and governmental institution are subclasses of the class organisation, airline is a subclass of company.
• Location: 8 trigger words for location nanle, s, e.g.
'Gulf'; • Organisation: 135 trigger words for organisation names, e.g 'Association'.
These lists of trigger words were produced by hand, though the organisation trigger word lists were generated semi-automatically by looking at organisation names in tile MUC-6 training texts and applying certain heuristics.
So, for example, words were (:ollected which come inmmdiately before 'of' in those organisation names which eOlltain 'of', e.g.
'Association' in ~Assoeiation of Air Flight Attendants'; l;he last; words of organisation names which do not contain 'of' were examined to find trigge.r words like 'International'.
3.2 Grammar
rules lbr proper names The LaSIE parser is a simple bottom-up chart parser iinplemented in Prolog.
The grammars it processes are unification-style feature-based context, fl'ee grammars.
During parsing, semantic representations of constituents are constructed using Prolog terin unification.
When parsing {:eases, i.e. when the parser can generate no further edges, a 'best parse selection' algorithm is rml on the final chart to chose ~ single analysis.
The semantics are then extracted fl'om this analysis trod passed on to the discourse interpreter.
Parsing takes place in two passes, each using a separate grammar.
In the first pass a special grammar is used to identify proper nanms.
These constituents are then treated as unanalysable units during the second pass which employs a more general 'sentence' grammar.
Proper Name Grammar The grammar rules for proper names constitute a subset of the system's noun t)hrase.
(NP) rules.
All the rules were produ(:ed 1)y hand.
There are 177 such rules ill total of which 94 are for organisation, 54 for person, 11 for location, and 18 for time exl)ressions.
Here are some examt)les of the i)roper nmne grammar rules: NP --> 0KGAN NP 0RGAN NP --> LIST_LOC NP NAMES_NP CDG NP 0RGAN_NP --> LIST_0RGAN_NP NAMES NP CDG_NP ORGAN_NP --> NAMES NP '&' NAMES_NP NAMES_NP --> NNP NAMES_NP NAMES_NP --> NNP PUNC(_) NNP NAMES NP --> NNP The non-terminals LIST_LOCJNP~ LIST_0RGAN_NP and CDG~IP are tags assigned to one or lnor(~ input tokens in the name phrase tagging stage of lexical preproeessing.
The non-terminal NNP is the tag for proper name assigned to a single token by the Brill tagger.
The rule 0RGAN_hIP--> NAMES_NP '&' NAMES_NP means that if an as yet unclassified or ambiguous proper name (NANES~P) is followed by '&' and another mnbiguous proper nmne, then it is an organisation name.
So, for example, 'Marks & Spell420 (:(n" and 'American Telct)hone & %le.gratth' will tie (:lassilicd as (/rganisat, i(m names by this rule.
Nearly half of the t/rol)('x name rules ard for (n'ganisation names be(:ausc they may contain fmther prOller name, s (e.g.

4 Results
and Evaluation After these processing stages, the results generator produces a version of the original text in which all the proper names which have been detected are marked up with pre-defined SGML tags, specifying their classes.
These marked up texts are then automatically scored against manually marked up texts.
A series of evaluations has been done on tile system using a blind test set consisting of 30 Wall Street Journal texts.
In these texts there are 449 organisation names, 373 person names, and 110 location names and 111 time expressions in total.
The overall precision and recall scores for the four classes of proper naines are shown in Table 1.
Proper Naine Class Recall Precision Organisation 91% 91% l'erson 90 % 95 % Location 88 % 89 % Time 94 % 97 % Overall 91% 93 % Table 1: Overall Precision and Recall Scores 4.1 System module contribution We have analysed tile results in terms of how much each module of the system contributes to the proper nmne task.
Table 2 illustrates the contribution of each system module to the task for all classes of proper names.
In addition to recall and t)recision scores, we have added Van Rijsbergen's F-measure which combines these scores into a single measure (Rijsbergen, 1979).
The F-measure (also called P&R) allows the differential weighting of precision and recall.
With precision and recall weighted equally it is computed by the formula: 2 x Precision x Recall F= Precision + Recall There are tour different settings of the system.
• setting 1 : Only the lexical preprocessing teehifiques are used tmrt-of-speeeh tagging and name phrase matching.
• setting 2 : Two-stage parsing is added to 1.
• setting 3 : Coreference resolution for proper names is added to 2.
• setting 4 : Full discourse interpretation is added to 3.
This is the full-fledged system Setting1 ~\[-Recall I Precisi°n49 N 89 ~ 7-§-N 94 ~~A 94 Table 2: Module Contribution Scores Table 2 shows thai; we can attain reasonable results using tagging, exact, phrase matching, trigger word detection, and parsing (setting 2).
Note that this amounts to making use of only internal evidence.
However, to achieve higher recall, we need coreference resolution for proper names (setting 3) and other context information (setting 4).
4.2 Different

5 Conclusion
We have described an IE system in which four classes of naming expressions (organisation, person, and location names and time expressions) are recognised and classified.
The system was tested Oil 30 unseen Wall Street Journal texts and the results were analysed in terms of inajor system components and ditti~rent (:lasses of referring expression.
