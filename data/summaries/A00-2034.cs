Additionally, the frequency information in corpora is helpful for estimating alternation productivity (Lapata, 1999).
P99-1051
Work There has been some recent interest in observing alternations in corpora (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999) and predicting related verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
E99-1007 P98-2247 P99-1051
Lapata (1999) identifies participation in the dative and benefactive alternations.
P99-1051
Estimations of productivity have been suggested for controlling the application of alternations (Briscoe and Copestake, 1996).

1998). Dang et al.(1998) modify it by adding new classes which remove the overlap between classes from the original scheme.

These subtle changes of meaning are important in natural language generation (Stede, 1998).
J98-3003
Most work using corpus evidence for verb classification has relied on a priori knowledge in the form of linguistic cues specific to the phenomena being observed (Lapata, 1999; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
E99-1007 P99-1051
We use the SCF acquisition system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), with a probabilistic LR parser (Inui et al., 1997) for syntactic processing.
A97-1052
The SCF acquisition system has been evaluated elsewhere (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).

They have also been suggested for the recovery of predicate argument structure, necessary for SCF acquisition (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987).
A97-1052 J87-3002
Recently, there has been interest in corpus-based methods to identify alternations (McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Lapata, 1999), and associated verb classifications (Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).
E99-1007 P98-2247 P99-1051
Stevenson and Merlo (1999) use syntactic and lexical cues for classifying 60 verbs in three verb classes: unergative, unaccusative and verbs with an optional direct object.
E99-1007
Dorr and Jones (1996) extend the classification by using grammatical information in LDOCE alongside semantic information in WordNet.
C96-1055
McCarthy and Korhonen (1998) proposed a method for identifying rtSAS using MDL.
P98-2247
To quantify the similarity between the probability distributions for the target slots we use the a-skew divergence (aSD) proposed by Lee (1999).

PP attachments are resolved using Hindle and Rooth's (1993) lexical association score.
