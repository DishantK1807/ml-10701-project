SUMMARY This paper has examined a two-level knowledge representation model for machine translation that integrates aspectual information based on theories by Bach (1986), Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), mourelatos (1981), Passonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler (1967), and more recently by Bennett et al.(1990) and Moens and Steedman (1988), with lexicalsemantic information based on Jackendoff (1983, 1990).

INTRODUCTION This paper discusses how the two-level knowledge representation model for machine translation presented by Dorr (1991) integrates aspectual information with lexical-semantic information by means of parameterization.

See Dorr (1991) and Dorr and Gaasterland (submitted) for more details about the relationship between temporal information and aspectual information and the actual procedures that are used for the selection of temporal connectives.

The parameter-based approach borrows certain ideas from previous work such as the lexical-semantic model of Jackendoff (1983, 1990) and models of aspectual representation including Bach (1986), Comrie (1976), Dowty (1979), Mourelatos (1981), Passonneau (1988), Pustejovsky (1988, 1989, 1991), and Vendler (1967).

Figure 1 shows some of the types of parametric diver9ences (Dorr, 1990a) that can arise cross-linguistically.

In Dorr (1991), we discussed the selection of the lexical connective when on the basis of the temporal relation between the main or matrix clause and the subordinate or adjunct clause.

has recently been pointed out by Michael Herweg (personal communication, 1991b) that the telic feature is not traditionally used to indicate a revoked consequence state (e.g., the consequence state that results after returning from the "going to the store" event), but it is generally intended to indicate an irrevocable, culminative, consequence state.

This paper will focus primarily on inherent features, z Previous representational frameworks have omitted aspectual distinctions among verbs, and have typically merged events under the single heading of dynamic (see, e.g., Yip (1985)).
