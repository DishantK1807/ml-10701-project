2:191	Hence, building resources (lexica, thesauri, ontologies or annotated corpora) and providing access to words become an important goal.
3:191	The lexicon is a vital resource for building applications.
4:191	It is also a crucial element in the study of human language processing.
5:191	The spirit of this workshop multidisciplinary, the goal being to gather experts with various backgrounds and to allow them to exchange ideas, to compare their methodologies and theoretical perspectives, to create synergy, and to encourage future collaborations.
6:191	In sum, the participants will be discussing questions concerning the cognitive aspects of the lexicon, and their answers should guide the design of on-line dictionaries.
7:191	While completeness is a virtue, the quality of a dictionary depends not only on coverage (number of entries) and granularity, but also on accessibility of information.
8:191	Access strategies vary with the task (text understanding vs. text production) and the knowledge available at the moment of consultation (word, concept, sound).
9:191	Unlike readers, who look for meanings, writers start from them, searching for the right words.
10:191	While paper dictionaries are static, permitting only limited strategies for accessing information, their electronic counterparts promise dynamic, proactive search via multiple criteria (meaning, sound, related word) and via diverse access routes.
11:191	Navigation takes place in a huge conceptual-lexical space, and the results are displayable in a multitude of forms (as trees, as lists, as graphs, or sorted alphabetically, by topic, by frequency).
12:191	Many lexicographers work nowadays with huge digital corpora, using language technology to build and to maintain the resource.
13:191	But access to the potential wealth in dictionaries remains limited for the common user.
14:191	Yet, the new possibilities of electronic media in terms of comfort, speed and flexibility (multiple inputs, polymorph outputs) are enormous and probably beyond our imagination.
15:191	More than just allowing electronic versions of paper-bound dictionaries, computers provide a freedom for rethinking dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedia, etc., a distinction necessary in the past for economical reasons, but not justified anymore.
16:191	The goal of this workshop is to perform the groundwork for the next generation of electronic dictionaries, that is, to study the possibility of integrating the different resources, as well as to explore the feasibility of taking the users needs, knowledge and access strategies into account.
17:191	To reach this goal we have asked authors to address one or more of the following: 1.
18:191	Conceptual input of a dictionary user: what is present in speakers/writers minds when they are generating a message and looking for a (target) word?
19:191	Does the user have in mind conceptual primitives, semantically related words, some type of partial definition, something like synsets, or something completely different?
20:191	2.
21:191	Access, navigation and search strategies: how can search be supported by taking into account prior, i.e. available knowledge?
22:191	Entries should be accessible in many ways: by word forms, by meaning, by sounds (syllables), or in a combined form, and this even if input is given in an incomplete, imprecise or degraded form.
23:191	The more precise the conceptual input, the less iii navigation should be needed and vice versa.
24:191	How can we create manageable search spaces, and provide a user with the tools for navigating within them?
25:191	3.
26:191	Indexing words and organizing the lexicon: Words and concepts can be organized in many ways, varying according to typology and conceptual systems.
27:191	For example, words are traditionally organized alphabetically in Western languages, but by semantic radicals and stroke counts in Chinese.
28:191	The way words and concepts are organized affects indexing and access.
29:191	Indexing must robustly allow for multiple ways of navigation and access.
30:191	What efficient organizational principles allow the greatest flexibility for access?
31:191	What about lexical entry standardization?
32:191	Are universal definitions possible?
33:191	What about efforts such as the Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) and other global structures for the lexicon?
34:191	Can ontologies be combined with standards for the lexicon?
35:191	4.
36:191	NLP Applications: Contributors can also address the issue of how such enhanced dictionaries, once embedded in existing NLP applications, can boost performance and help solve lexical and textual-entailment problems such as those evaluated in SEMEVAL 2007, or, more generally, generation problems encountered in the context of summarization, question-answering, interactive paraphrasing or translation.
37:191	Weve received 18 papers, of which 6 were accepted as full papers, while 8 were chosen as poster presentations.
38:191	While we did not get papers on all the issues mentioned in our call, we did get a quite rich panel on ideas as divers as use of ontologies; sense extraction; computation of associative responses to multi-word stimuli; saliency relations; lexical relationships within collocations and word association norms; cognitive organization of dictionaries; user-adapted views on a lexicographic database; access based on conceptual input; search in onomasiological dictionaries, access based on underspecified input; dictionary use for authoring aids or MT, use of feature vectors, corpora and machine learning, etc It was also interesting to see the variety of languages in which these issues are addressed.
39:191	The proposals range from Japanese, English, German, Russian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Romanian, Spanish, to French and Chinese.
40:191	In sum, the community working on dictionaries is dynamic, and there seems to be a growing awareness of the importance of some of the problems presented in our call for papers.
41:191	We would like to express here our sincerest thanks to all the specialists who have assisted us to assure a good selection of papers, despite the very tight schedule.
42:191	Their reviews were helpful not only for us as decision makers, but also for the authors, helping them to improve their work.
43:191	In the hope that the results will inspire you, provoke fruitful discussions and result in future collaborations.

59:191	This paper conducts some initial comparisons of the lexical relationships observed within Japanese collocation data extracted from a large corpus using the Japanese language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi et al., 2008) and the relationships found within Japanese word association sets taken from the large-scale Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007).
60:191	The comparison results indicate that while some relationships are common to both linguistic resources, many lexical relationships are only observed in one resource.
61:191	These findings suggest that both resources are necessary in order to more adequately cover the diverse range of lexical relationships.
62:191	Finally, the paper reflects briefly on the implementation of association-based word-search strategies into electronic dictionaries proposed by Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006).
63:191	1 Introduction Large-scale corpora and various corpus query tools have long been recognized as extremely important language resources.
64:191	The impact of   2008.

67:191	corpora and corpus query tools has been particularly significant in the area of compiling and developing lexicographic materials (Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002) and in the area of creating various kinds of lexical resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and FrameNet (Atkins et al., 2003; Fillmore et al., 2003).
68:191	In contrast, although the significance of databases of free word association norms have long been recognized within psychology in providing insights into higher cognitive processes (Cramer, 1968; Deese, 1965; Nelson et al., 1998; Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), their value as a language resource has been largely overlooked.
69:191	However, as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) point out, databases of word association norms represent an extremely useful supplement to the range of traditional language resources, such as large-scale corpora, thesauri, and dictionaries, and can potentially contribute greatly to the development of more sophisticated linguistic resources.
70:191	This paper seeks to demonstrate the potential value of word association databases as language resources.
71:191	Specifically, we conduct some initial comparisons of the lexical relationships observed within Japanese collocation data, as extracted from a large corpus with the Japanese language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool (Srdanovi et al., 2008), with those found within Japanese word association sets, which were created through the ongoing construction of the large-scale Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) (Joyce, 2005, 2007).
72:191	Interesting similarities and differences between the two language resources in terms of captured lexical relationships affirm the value of word association databases as rich linguistic resources.
73:191	In concluding, we speculate briefly on how the wider range of lexical relationships identifiable through the combination of collocation data and word associ1 ation databases could be utilized in organizing lexical entries within electronic dictionaries in ways that are cognitively salient.
74:191	While we fully acknowledge that the challenges involved are formidable ones (Zock, 2006), the principled incorporation of word association knowledge within electronic dictionaries could greatly facilitate the development of more flexible and userfriendly navigation and search strategies (Zock and Bilac, 2004).
75:191	2 Basic Concepts: Word Sketches and Word Association Norms This section briefly provides some background information about SkE, which is the corpus query tool used in this study to extract and display word collocation data, and about word association norms as gathered through psychological experimentation.
76:191	2.1 Sketch Engine (SkE): Word Sketches and Thesaurus Tools Sketch Engine (SkE) (Kilgarriff et al. 2004) is a web-based corpus query tool that supports a number of functions.
77:191	These include fast concordancing, grammatical processing, word sketching (one-page summaries of a words grammatical and collocation behavior), a distributional thesaurus, and robot use.
78:191	SkE has been applied to a number of languages.
79:191	In this study, we utilize the Word Sketches and Thesaurus functions for the Japanese language.
80:191	As both tools process raw collocation data by organizing words according to grammatical and lexical relationships, they are particularly suited to the conducted comparisons with the word association data.
81:191	Word Sketches (Kilgarriff and Tugwell, 2001) present the most frequent and statistically-salient collocations and grammatical relations for a given word.
82:191	These relations are derived as the results of grammatical analysis (a gramrel file) that employs regular expressions over PoS-tags.
83:191	The distributional thesaurus groups together words that occur in similar contexts and have common collocation words.
84:191	Estimations of semantic similarity are based on shared triples.
85:191	For example, <read a book> and <read a magazine> share the same triple pattern of <read a ?>, and because book and magazine exhibit high salience for the triple, they are both assumed to belong to the same thesaurus category.
86:191	This approach is similar to conventional techniques for automatic thesaurus construction (Lin, 1998).
87:191	2.2 Word Association Norms In contrast to the Word Sketch collocation and thesaurus tools that take the corpus as the basic input language resource, databases of word association norms are the results of psychological experiments.
88:191	The free word association task typically asks the respondent to respond with the first semantically-related word that comes to mind on presentation of a stimulus word.
89:191	The collection of word association normative data can be traced back to the seminal study by Kent and Rosanoff (1910) which gathered word association responses for a list of 100 stimulus words.
90:191	However, despite the insightful remarks of Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) that word associations closely mirror the structured patterns of relations that exist among conceptsclaims that undoubtedly warrant further investigation there are, unfortunately, still relatively few largescale databases of word association norms.
91:191	The notable exceptions for the English language include the Edinburgh Association Thesaurus (EAT) (Kiss et al., 1973), which consists of approximately 56,000 responses to a stimulus list of 8,400 words, and the University of South Florida Word Association, Rhyme, and Word Fragment Norms compiled by Nelson et al.92:191	(1998), consisting of nearly three-quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words.
93:191	Another database deserving mention is the Russian Association Thesaurus compiled by Karaulov et al.94:191	(1994, 1996, 1998) which has approximately 23,000 responses for 8,000 stimulus words (cited in Sinopalnikova and Pavel, 2004).
95:191	3 Japanese Language Resources This section introduces the Japanese language resources utilized in this study: namely, the Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus (Srdanovi et al., 2008) and the Japanese Word Association Database (Joyce, 2005, 2007).
96:191	3.1 Japanese Word Sketches and Thesaurus The Japanese version of SkE is based on JpWaC (Erjavec et al., 2007; Srdanovi et al., 2008), which is a 400-million word Japanese web corpus that has been morphologically analyzed and POS-tagged with the ChaSen tool (http://chasen.naist.jp/).
97:191	The Word Sketches are based on Japanese grammatical analysis results (gramrel file), where 22 grammatical relations are defined based on ChaSen PoS tags and tokens (Srdanovi et al 2008).
98:191	Figure 1 presents 2 parts of word sketches for the noun fuyu ( winter), showing adjective modifications and two verb relations involving the particles of wa ( topic marker) and ni ( time marker), respectively.
99:191	Figure 1.
100:191	Parts of the Word Sketch results for the noun fuyu ( winter).
101:191	3.2 Japanese Word Association Database To an even greater extent than for the English language, there has been a serious lack of word association norms for the Japanese language.
102:191	While Umemotos (1969) survey collected associations from 1,000 university students, the limited set of just 210 words merely underscores the deficient.
103:191	More recently, Okamoto and Ishizaki (2001) compiled an Associative Concept Dictionary (ACD) consisting of 33,018 word association responses provided by 10 respondents for 1,656 nouns.
104:191	However, it should be noted that the ACD is not strictly free association data because response category was specified as part of the task.
105:191	Under ongoing construction by Joyce (2005, 2007), the Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD) aims to eventually develop into a very large-scale database of free word association norms for the Japanese language in terms of both the number of stimulus items and the numbers of association responses collected.
106:191	The present JWAD stimulus list consists of 5,000 basic Japanese kanji and words.
107:191	The currently available JWAD Version 1 (JWAD-V1) consists of 104,800 free word association responses collected through a paper questionnaire survey with a sample of 2,099 items presented to up to 50 respondents.
108:191	The association sets compared with work sketch profiles in the subsequent sections are from JWAD-V1.
109:191	4 Conducted Comparisons This section presents the results of our initial comparison for the lexical relationships observed within the Japanese collocation data with those in the Japanese word association sets.
110:191	The comparisons focused on approximately 350 word association responses constituting the association sets for the two verbs of kizuku ( to notice) and sagasu ( to search for), the adjective of omoshiroi ( interesting), and the three nouns of jitensha ( bicycle), natsu ( summer), and yama ( mountain), as examples of basic Japanese vocabulary.
111:191	Taking into account the considerable degree of orthographic variation present with the Japanese writing system, all possible orthographic variations were searched for in the SkE, such as kizuku (/ ) and omoshiroi (/).
112:191	4.1 Word Sketches and Thesaurus Versus Word Association Norms The Japanese SkE employs a large-scale Japanese corpus and detailed grammatical analysis based on ChaSen POS tags.
113:191	Accordingly, numerous lexical relationships are identified in the word sketches and thesaurus results.
114:191	For example, kizuku appears 12,134 times in the corpus in approximately 200 collocation examples in total, which are grouped under 12 different collocation and grammatical relations and sorted according to the statistical salience of the relations frequency within the corpus (note that searches were conducted with the default setting of only including collocations with frequencies of five or more).
115:191	The thesaurus function also yields numerous results, typically displaying around 60 salient relations that are clustered into five semantic groups.
116:191	In contrast, while JWAD-V1 is quite large-scale for a word association databases, it is naturally far smaller than the Japanese SkE corpus.
117:191	As already noted, it consists of word association collected from about 50 respondents (although there are 100 respondents in the case of kizuku), and where some responses would obviously be provided by multiple respondents.
118:191	Comparisons of the SkE results with the sets of word association responses revealed that there is considerable overlap in the range of lexical relationships observed in the two linguistics resources.
119:191	However, the comparisons also identified many lexical relationships that are only present in one of the language resources.
120:191	3 Because of the large differences in the overall sizes of the association responses in JWAD-V1 and the collocations in SkE, it is not surprising that the word association data does not cover the numerous collocation words present in the SkE results.
121:191	(In future studies, we plan to examine the kinds of relationships that are extracted from the corpora but which are not observed in the word association database).
122:191	However, it is very interesting to note that a considerable number of the JWAD word associations were not present in the SkE results, even though the tool is drawing on a much larger resource.
123:191	In this study, we concentrate on describing these lexical relationships.
124:191	Table 1.
125:191	The numbers of word association norms present (+) and absent (-) in the Word Sketches (WS) and the Thesaurus (T) results Norms Ass.
126:191	Freq  2 Ass.
127:191	Freq = 1 WS+ WST+ WS+ WST+ omoshiroi 6 5 2 1 16 2 kizuku 6 8 3 9 44 2 sagasu 4 8 1 2 13 1 jitensha 7 13 0 2 10 0 natsu 3 4 1 5 13 1 yama 6 3 2 8 7 2  Table 1 shows that considerable numbers of word association responses with frequencies of two or more, as well as many with frequencies of one, are not observed in the word sketches and thesaurus results.
128:191	While these results could be indicating a need to consider new methods or approaches to corpus-extraction in addition to those currently employed, these findings also strongly suggest that some of the lexical relationships might be unique to the normative word association data.
129:191	Both resources unquestionably tap into fundamental aspects of lexical relationships, but the resources would seem to be quite different in nature.
130:191	Accordingly, the present results suggest that investigations into lexical relationships would do well to employ both corpus-based results and databases of word association norms in complementary ways, in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of the diverse range of lexical relationships.
131:191	The thesaurus function only outputs lexical relationships between words of the same word class.
132:191	This function also yields synonym relationships that are also found in the word association norms, and are rated as being highly salient for the thesaurus results.
133:191	For example, tanoshii and kyomibukai ( interesting) are word association responses for omoshiroi.
134:191	4.2 Lexical Relationships that are Common to Both the Corpus-Based Results and the Word Association Norms This section discusses some of the lexical relationships common to the two resources.
135:191	The most frequent of these are presented in Table 2.
136:191	The first coord group includes kawa ( river) with the noun of yama, tanoshii ( pleasant) with the adjective of omoshiroi, and odoroku ( to be surprised) with the verb of kizuku.
137:191	Other frequent relationships are verbal phrases involving appropriate particles (such as nounNI (e.g., jitensha ni noru ( to ride a bicycle), noPronom, nounWO (e.g., michi wo sagasu ( to look for a road), deVerb, niVerb).
138:191	Table 2 also includes a number of modification relationships (modifier_Adv, modifier_Ai (e.g., atsui natsu ( hot summer)).
139:191	Note that these terms are those employed in the Word Sketch results.
140:191	Table 2.

142:191	Briefly, these relationships can be classified under six categories.
143:191	(1) Relationships involving a specific concept related to the stimulus word and its contextual meaning.
144:191	In Table 3 below, many of these are classified as typically associated words.
145:191	Examples include omoshiroi and warai (  laughter), kizuku and ch i ( attention), and natsu and taiy  ( sun).
146:191	These relationships are neither collocational nor grammatical in nature, and so the grammatical analysis currently employed in the word sketches cannot identify them.
147:191	On the other hand, while they are semantically related, because they often belong to different word classes, the thesaurus function also fails to identify them.
148:191	(2) Relationships that are semantically similar (could be regarded as close synonyms) but do not belong to the same word class.
149:191	Examples include sagasu and tanky  ( search) and kizuku andkikubari ( care, attention).
150:191	While these are not grammatical or collocational relations, again, the thesaurus function is also unable to find them because they belong to different word classes.
151:191	(3) Association responses consisting of more than one word.
152:191	Examples include explanatory phrases such as kibun ga ii ( lit.
153:191	feeling is good, comfortable) as response to omoshiroi, as well as concepts denoted by phrases, such as hito no kao ( human faces), also a response to omoshiroi.
154:191	(4) Relationships that could be recognized by the SkE, but which the present version fails to detect.
155:191	These would seem to reflect limitations with the present ChaSen dictionary (e.g., it does not list chari / charinko ( casual words for bicycle) or morphological/POStagging errors with ChaSen, or relationships that are not regarded as being sufficiently salient within the complete corpus, because they may appear frequently as both independent words and as constituents of many poly-morpheme words (e.g., omoshiroi hito ( interesting person)).
156:191	(5) Relationships that can be identified when search is executed for orthographic variants of the word, such as tsumaranai ( boring) being found when omoshiori is written in hiragana (as ).
157:191	(6) Word association responses that are rather idiosyncratic in nature, often reflecting private experiences of a single respondent.
158:191	The importance of such responses in word association databases should be judged on the size of the database, although one also should be cautious about sampling issues with lower respondent numbers.
159:191	While it would certainly be interesting to conduct further comparisons between the association norms and other kinds of corpora, such as literary works, newspapers, or more balanced corpora, processed by the SkE, the main purpose of the present paper is to draw attention to the value of word association databases as linguistic resources.
160:191	Although the lexical relationships in categories 1 and 2 were not observed in the present corpus-based results, they are unquestionably of great relevance to efforts to develop more principled organizations of the lexicon for navigational purposes, and would enhance existing lexical resources, such as WordNet.
161:191	With trends to increasingly include multiple word idioms and phrases within various dictionaries and linguistic resources, the multiple-word association responses of category 3 may provide further insights into how such items are stored and processed.
162:191	Moreover, categories 4 and 5 clearly suggest that free word association norms can be a very useful resource for evaluating and further improving morphological analyzers, as well as corpus query tools.
163:191	5 Lexicographical Implications: Organizing Lexicons According to Association Relationships As the merits of SkE and its significant contributions to the compilation of a number of major dictionaries are discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Kilgarriff and Rundell, 2002), and because Srdanovi and Nishina (2008) outline some possible lexicographical applications of the Japanese language version of the SkE, in this section, we focus on the lexical relationships observed within the JWAD and their lexicographical implications for realizing a principled association-based organization of the lexicon.
164:191	5 Table 3.
165:191	Tentative classification of the word association responses elicited for fuyu ( winter) Relationship Description Examples Modification Attribute: Temperate  (samui cold) Modification Attribute: Color  (shiroi white) Modification Attribute: Emotion  (setsunai bitter, severe) Lexical siblings Hyponyms of seasons  (natsu summer),  (haru spring) Typically associated Meteorological phenomena   (yuki snow),  (koori ice) Typically associated Activity  (t min hibernation),  (ett  passing of winter),  (ky kei rest),  (yasumi rest, holiday) Typically associated Cultural artifacts  (kotatsu quilt for lower body when sitting around low table),  (kamakura snow hut) Typically associated Time  (t ji winter solstice) Typically associated Location  (kita north) Typically associated Animal  (kuma bear) Typically associated Cultural symbolization  (fuyu-sh gun General Winter; hard winter; Jack Frost)  5.1 Linguistic Approaches to Association Data and Its Potential As previously commented, Deese (1965) and Cramer (1968) have both argued that word associations closely mirror the structured patterns of relations that exist among concepts.
166:191	Indeed, as Sinopalnikova and Pavel (2004) note, Deese (1965) was the first to conduct linguistic analyses of word association norms, such as measurements of semantic similarity based on his convictions that similar words evoke similar word association responsesan approach that is somewhat reminiscent of Church and Hanks (1990) notion of mutual information.
167:191	However, as we have also remarked already, the linguistic value of word association data has, regrettably, been largely overlooked.
168:191	In a similar spirit to Hirsts (2004) claim that, notwithstanding certain caveats on the complex relationships between them, a lexicon can often serve as a useful basis for developing a practical ontology, we believe that a very promising approach to organizing the lexicon would be to more fully appreciate and utilize the rich variety of associative relationships that exist within word association norms.
169:191	While the required, more thoroughgoing investigation into how to appropriately classify the complex nature of associative relationships is beyond the scope of this present study, in the next sub-section, we attempt to highlight the potential contributions that word association norms could provide to efforts seeking to explore lexical knowledge.
170:191	5.2 Tentative Classification of Association Relationships To illustrate some of the issues for developing a comprehensive, yet a parsimonious, classification of associative relationships, it is useful to briefly consider the notion proposed by Zock and Bilac (2004) and Zock (2006) of word search strategies in electronic dictionaries based on associations.
171:191	Their outline of how such a look-up system might function employs three kinds of basic association relationships; namely, a kind of (AKO), subtype (ISA), and typically involved object, relation or actor (TIORA).
172:191	While we accept that the limited set of just three types was probably motivated primarily in the interests of simplicity, given Zocks (2006) suggestion to enhance the navigability of the system by categorizing relationships, clearly the classification of association relationships is a fundamental issue.
173:191	Table 3 presents a tentative classification of the word association responses for the noun winter.
174:191	As the comparisons introduced in Section 4 clearly demonstrate, it is usually possible to extract the modification and lexical sibling relationships included in Table 3 from corpora with corpus query tools such as SkE.
175:191	However, the comparisons also highlighted the fact that it is far more difficult to identify the kinds of relationships classified in Table 3 as typically associated with such linguistic resources alone.
176:191	While highly provisional in nature, we believe that the attempt to classify the association relationships within the association responses for fuyu can 6 serve to highlight some important issues for Zock and Bilacs (2004) approach.
177:191	While the lexical siblings relationships between fuyu and the two response words of natsu ( summer) and haru ( spring) could feasibly be represented by AKO or ISA relationship links to shiki ( the four seasons) outside of the association set itself, having to rely on external references would not be a very satisfactory approach to classifying the direct association relationships.
178:191	Incidentally, although the hyponyms of seasons description would seem fairly natural from the perspective of a thesaurus, the absence of aki ( autumn) from the set would indicate that the strengths of associations can vary even among lexical siblings (although the absence of aki from the present data could simply be due to sampling issues).
179:191	Given that fuyu is a noun, the presence of several modification relationships is not very surprising, at least not for the prime associate of samui ( cold), but the idea of fuyu having a color attribute is perhaps initially more startling (while one many not expect winter to have a default color slot within its range of attributes, the association of shiroi ( white) with fuyu is initiatively appealing).
180:191	For the fuyu association set, the most relevant of the association relationships specified by Zock and Bilac (2004) is the TIORA relationship.
181:191	However, even for this relatively small association set containing just 11 main relationship types, because seven of them can be initially classified as typically associated, clearly this designation alone is too encompassing to be a useful classification category.
182:191	The inclusion of the description field in Table 3 is an attempt to further define meaningful sub-categories.
183:191	In the case of the sub-category meteorological phenomena, it would seem to be well motivated to explain the associations between fuyu as the stimulus word and yuki ( snow) and k ri ( ice) as two response words.
184:191	However, while the subcategory of cultural artifacts clearly goes some way to pinpointing the underlying association between fuyu and kotatsu (), it does rely on a certain cultural familiarity with the kind of quilted kind of blanket that are used for keeping ones legs warm when sitting around a low family table during winter.
185:191	A natural association for anyone who has ever lived in Japan during the winter months, but typically associated + cultural artifact seems to miss something of the naturalness.
186:191	6 Conclusions This paper has compared the lexical relationships observed within Japanese collocation data extracted from a large corpus using the Japanese language version of the Sketch Engine (SkE) tool and the relationships found within Japanese word association sets taken from the large-scale Japanese Word Association Database (JWAD).
187:191	The comparison results indicate that while many lexical relationships are common to both linguistic resources, a number of lexical relationships were only observed in one of the resources.
188:191	The fact that some lexical relationships might be unique to word association norms demonstrates the value of word association databases as linguistic resources.
189:191	The present findings suggest that both resources can be effectively used in combination in order to provide more comprehensive coverage of the wide range of lexical relationships.
190:191	Finally, we presented a tentative classification of the association relationships in the association set for fuyu.
191:191	Our brief discussion of the classification sought to reflect on some of the challenges to realizing a principled association-based organization of the lexicon as a fundamental step toward implementing cognitively-salient wordsearch strategies based on associations in electronic dictionaries.
