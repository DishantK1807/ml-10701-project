In previous work (Lambert and Carberry, 1991), we described a tripartite plan-based model of dialogue that recognizes and differentiates three different kinds of actions: domain, problemsolving, and discourse.

Knowledge Sources Grosz and Sidner (1986) contend that modeling discourse requires integrating different kinds of knowledge in a unified framework in order to constrain the possible role that an utterance might be serving.

The inferencing for utterances similar to (5) and (6) is discussed in depth in Lambert and Carberry (1992), and the resultant DM is given in Figure 2.

This is further discussed in Lambert and Carberry (1992).
C92-1049
Ramshaw, Litman, and Wilensky (Ramshaw, 1991; Litman and Allen, 1987; Wilensky, 1981) have noted the need for recognizing problem-solving actions.

(Cohen, 1987; Cohen and Young, 1991), or because they assumed that dialogue participants do not change their minds (Flowers, McGuire and Birnbaum, 1982; Quilici, 1991).
J87-1002
The focus of attention and focusing heuristics (discussed in Lambert and Carberry (1991)) order these sequences of inferred actions, or inference lines, in terms of coherence.
P91-1007
Since linguistic knowledge is present, less evidence is needed from world knowledge to recognize the discourse actions being performed (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
J86-3001
Certain words often suggest what type of discourse action the speaker might be pursuing (Litman and Allen, 1987; Hinkelman, 1989).
P89-1026
For example, the linguistic clue please suggests a request discourse act (Hinkelman, 1989) while the clue word but suggests a non-acceptance discourse act.
