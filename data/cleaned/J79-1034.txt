Diller, Editor Sperry-Univac St Paul, Minnesota 55101 Microfi che 34 Coovri$.ht @ 1975 by the Association for Computational Linguistics PREFACE The talks presented in Session 3 of the 13th ACL rneeting dealt with three facets of the language understafiding process: the integration of knowledge sources axt ton and A. Robinson), syntactic processing (Bates and J Robinson), md semantic processing (Hendrix, Sondheimer and Perry, and Cercone).
2:234	The first four talks were oriented toward speech nput while the talk by Sondhe~er and Perry assumed phrase structure trees as input and the talk by Cercone assumed textual input.
3:234	The paper from which Bates's talk was drawn was much too extensive for inclusion bere and will be published separately My special thanks to Stan Petrick who agreed to chair this session on very short notice.

The syntactic analysis system presented here is composed of ~vo parts, a modified augmented rransition network grammar and a 7arser which is designed for a speech understanding environment.
7:234	The parser operates on partial utterances called th&ries.

10:234	The parser processes the words in a theory by building partial syntactic paths using the words of :he theory.
11:234	These paths do not depend on left context, which will Le missing if there are gaps in the theory.
12:234	Syntact-ic constituexs are built where possible and, whenever a constituent is it the parser can interface witrh the semantic zomponent of he total.

14:234	The parser tries to predict words and/or syntactic categories 50 fill or reduce gaps in the theory, particulatly small function riorls which are difficult to detect reliably on acoustic grounds aloone.
15:234	Thk parser does not follow all possible parse paths, but nctc~;:~pts to select the.nost likely ones fo; extension.
16:234	It uses a '-:dicious mixture of top down, bottom up, depth first, and breadth J " I rlrst parsing strategies to take advantage of local, reliable inforrLstion.
17:234	It saves all the information gained while following al~crnative parse paths, so that several parse paths which share a comnon part, even if the paths are in different theories, can stare chat portion without ~eparsing.
18:234	This is true even if the -.rse r/ '.A paths split before and/or after the common part and even if the common section analyzes only part of a syntactic constituent.

SONDHEIMER AND DoYT PERRY Department of Computer and Information Science The Ohio State University Columbus, Ohio 43210 Introduction.
100:234	This paper presents a formal ism cal led Semantic Processing Scheme, SPS, for use in describing semantic interpreters.
101:234	SPS is a rule-based system with a rule-ordering scheme that can produce deep case structures from phrase-structure trees.
102:234	It was originally developed to demonstrate how English prepositions, such as "up", "down", and "through", which reference location, motion, and orientation in space could be semantically interpreted.
103:234	This paper presents SPS in its current form and shows how it can Landle these prepositions, call ed the locative prepositions.
104:234	SPS is continuing to be used in studies of semantic processing.
105:234	Computational linguistics has seen a considera'ble amount of work on the development of general model s for 1 anguage-unders tandi ng sys terns.
106:234	Among tile 4 5 7 most we1 1-known examples of this is the work of Schank, Simmons, Wlnograd, 839 and Woods . On the whole, these rnodgls have been tested on broad but shallow subsets of ~nglish, in that they have been applied to many different phenomena but few extensively.
107:234	The authors of this paper are taking a different approach.
108:234	We are studying a few phenomena and attempting to allow for them in considerable detail.
109:234	At the least, this approach should lead to better treatment of the particular phenomenon.
110:234	It can also lead to the development of new general models or the revislon of old ones.
111:234	The paper is written in five sections.
112:234	The f4rst describer the overall Interpretative framework.
113:234	A second indicates some of the difficulties inherent in the processing of locatlve prepositions.
114:234	An overview of SPS Is glven in the third section.
115:234	The last two sections expand on the SPS description and discuss how the locatives are all owed for.
116:234	Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics.
117:234	SPS is developed for a traditional three-level system, with syntactic, serna~tic, and pragmatic stages.
118:234	Based on the level of abstractness, these stages compare most closely to Yinogrd't and Woods'.
119:234	The syntactic processing stage is assumed to take strings of text and produce underlying syntactic structures in the form of cansti tuent structure trees.
120:234	We are attempting to keep these as close to surface eonstftuent structures as possible.
121:234	However, some divergence from the surface form is currently assumed.
122:234	For exampl e, imperatives, Interrogatives, and relative clauses are assumed to be shown in a declarative-li ke form, and preposi ticns are assumed to have their complement immediately following then.
123:234	An SCS based interpreter takes these syntactlc structures and produces output whlch ref1 ects underlying semantic structures.
124:234	The form of the semantic structures is also a topic of our research.
125:234	We are uslng Case structures 7 *2'4v5 and PI anner-1 l ke assertional forms . It 1s Interesting to note that our results to date tend to indicate the need for a level of ahgtraction somewhere bet~een Simn 'IS and Schank's semantic nets.
126:234	In developing the semantic lewl-, we are trying to make it the one where "general knowledge of language and its relation to the world" is applied.
127:234	This is in contrast to the pragmatic level, where situationspecific information is used to interpret the semantic structures.
128:234	In sumnary, a system employing SPS would construct syntactic trees, use SPS for the production of Case structures, and employ a pragmatic processing scheme to interpret these structures.
129:234	Problems in Processing Locative Prepositions.
130:234	Part of the problem with the semantic interpretation of locatives is the complexity of the structures necessary to represent them on the underlying syntactic and semantic levels.
131:234	'This section discusses these problems and introduces our semantic structure notation.
132:234	The representation of locative prepositional meaning in Case structures has been problematic.
133:234	The number of cases that Fillmore has postulated for them has risen to four--Location, Source, Goal, Path.
134:234	He a1 so features 2 locatives in a paper on problems within Case grammar . The worst of the problems involves not being able to interpret the semantic weight o.~ meaning of the representation.
135:234	An example of such a probl em comes in the represenI I tation of the following: "Bill held his daughter on his lap in the ttunnel.
136:234	, Both of the locati* phrases w~uld be assigned the same case Location.
137:234	Howeverj they actual ly locate different objects.
138:234	Bi 17 's daughter was said to be on his lap while both of them were said to be in the tunnel.
139:234	Similarly, the use of an unordered set of cases fails to a1 low for the difference in meaning of the following twosentences, where the first two prepositional phrases in each would be in the Path case: '!He went down the hi1 1 across the bridge to the chapel.", and "He went across the bridge down the hill to I I the chapel.
140:234	The Case representation we are using deals with these problems.
141:234	This representation uses only one case for all spattal references.
142:234	This case, the Place case, identifies spaces which derive from the location of participants i.n its action, event, qr state of affairs (or event/state).
143:234	Which participants and how each space relates to them depends on the type of event/state, The basic structure of the assertional notation can be seen by showing how a Place case wul d be represented: ( :PLACE #E/S $PO).
144:234	The ": " II II identifies a relation, the # an event/state, and the "8" objects (note that many of these will be replaced by variables in the actual assertions produced).
145:234	The first element of any assertion is always a relation, which forces interpretations on the other elenients.
146:234	With the relation :PLACE, the last two elements must be references to an eventlstate and a spatial object (space), in that order.
147:234	The specific spatial objects that are referred in Place assertions are call ed Pl ace objects.
148:234	The prepositional elements on the semantic level can relate Place objects directly.
149:234	An example of this is the representation of "She died away from where she 1 ived.", i .e. , (:PLACE #E/Sl $PO1 ) (:AWAYFROM $PO1 $PO)?
150:234	(:PLF\CE iiE/SZ bP(12).
151:234	here a prepositional element relates the Place object of the two event/states corresponding to "she died" and "she 1 ived".
152:234	Prepositional elements can also relate spaces derived from Place objects.
153:234	This is seen with the representation of motional meanings, such as in the mu1 tiple Path sentences above.
154:234	The Place object of "go" and other notional event/states are taken as indicating the space traversed by the moving object or objects.
155:234	For the example sentence, the Place object would show the space through which the person travelled.
156:234	This is acceptable since the static positioning of these spaces (or paths) as "across" the bridge is logically equivalent to his going across it.
157:234	The predication of derived spaces arises in the handling of the ordering problem.
158:234	The motional Place object can be taken as composed of parts that are ordered like the parts of other objects (from front to back or top to bottom).
159:234	The ordering here is based on the time the component spaces were occupied.

161:234	A semantic structure might look 1 i ke the foll.wing: (:PLACE #XI08 $XI 09) ( :SEG $XI 09 6x1 10) (:SEG $XI09 $11 11 ) (:FINAL $XI10 $X112) (:INITIAL $XI11 SX113) (:LE $XI12 $X113).
162:234	The Place case proposal avoids problems 1 i ke that with the Location case exarnpl e, through the representation of certain syntacti cally simp1 e clauses with more than one event/state.
163:234	The representation of "He held her on his lap in the tunnel ".
164:234	shows an event/state corresponding to "he held her" and one corresponding to "she was on his lap".
165:234	These are constituents in a causative event/state, with the first causing the second *Fillmore roves in this direction in 121 Similarly the representation resembles those of Rurnel hart and Norman 3 and schank4.
166:234	We Wave attempted to systematically work out the event/state analysi, as far as it concerns locatives, for all verbs taking locative objects.
167:234	8 This complex structure solves the case problems by a1 lowing each preposition to predicate a different Place object.
168:234	"On his lap" predicates afi existential event/state showing where the female was located.
169:234	"In the tunnel " can predicate the Place object of the causative event/state.
170:234	The interpretation that space is that it is composed from the Place objects of its two constituent eventlstates.
171:234	Hence, both peopl e wi 11 be predicated by i t. While these last two devices enable us to avoid representational problems, it should, of course, be remembered that semantic interpretation must support these forms.* Tied in with semantic complexity is a1 so complexity on the syntactic 1 eve1 . Assuming sentences are normal ized in underlying syntactic' structures as specified, locatives appear in four positions: as the qualifier of a head noun in o noun phrase; as the compl ement of a copula; as the adjunct to a clause; and inside a clause as a locative o,bject.
172:234	The adjunct usage can be differentiated from the locative object by its tendency to give overall predication to the event or state referenced by the clause.
173:234	In "He held her on his lap in the tunnel .", the first phrase is a locative object and the second is an adjunct.
174:234	To summarize this section has presented a variety of points about the semantic interpretation of locative pr'eposi tionsthat they can require complex case representations, and that they appear in a variety of syntactic environments.
175:234	SPS has been designed to relate the syntactic to the semantic *There are other phenohena for which the Place case proposal a1 lows.
176:234	The co'mpl ete representation is descri bed el sewhere.6 What has been given here is enough to show the difficulty of interpretation.
177:234	environment of locative prepositions.
178:234	How it deals with these problems will be described after a brief over vie^ of the formal ism, SPS.
179:234	The SPS formalism is mst closely related to a fam'ily of semantic interpretatian schemes deriving from Woods' 1968 The close similarity to that work 1 ies in the basic form of rules.
180:234	These rules have the form "pattern + action", where the pattern side specifies tests to be made on the syntactic structures, and the action side specifies forms to be added to the semantic structures.
181:234	The tests are mainly based on the matching of tree fragments against syntactic structures and the testing of semantic features associated with those elements matched.
182:234	In SPS, sets of features can be directly examined or compared to other sets of features.
183:234	Each lexical entry may have mu1 tiple sets of features associated with it.
184:234	SPS a1 so a1 lows these tests to be made against features associated with registers by other rules.
185:234	If the tests are successful, the action element is executed.
186:234	This principally adds assertional forms to the semantic structure, but can a1 so set values of registers.
187:234	In the assertional forms, means are provided to a1 1 ow references to the syntac4ic constituents and 1 exical entries matched, as well as to other forms through the registers.
188:234	SPS uses a finite state transition net for ordering the appl ication of rules.
189:234	Each noun phrase and sentence is analyzed under the control of a net associated with it.
190:234	The process of forcing interpretation through constituents is guided by marking completely interpreted nodes.
191:234	The overall tree is processed from the bottom up.
192:234	SPS Rules and Locative Prepositions.
193:234	To see how SPS works in detail, and,," explain how it allows for locative prepositions we look at a typical rule: Rul e 2-STAT-LO: ((*I-S5 (1 2.3 4) 1(4) *1-S7 (( EQ #2STAT 1-1) (COMPATIBLE 1-1 2-1) (COMPATIBLE 1-2 OBJ(I-i 1) (COMPATIBLE R(SS) SUBJ(I-1 )))I ======+ (((:PLACE R(CAUSED) !X(1 )) (1-1 !X(1) ! X(2)) (:PRED !X(3) $BE) (:OBJ !X(3) !l-2) (:PLACE !X(3) !X(2))))) This is a rule that might be applied to interpret the prepositional phrase in the sentence "He held her on his lap.".
194:234	The rule is identified as 2-STAT-LO.
195:234	This particular name indicates that it deals with a preposition with a certain static type of meaning (2-STAT) used as a locative object (LO).
196:234	The pattern portion of the rule consists of two parts.
197:234	Tbe first describes the syntactic environment in which it applies, while the second gives the semantic feature tests.
198:234	The specification of the syntactic environment is done through reference to tree fragments that must be matched in the syntactic structure in order for the rule to apply.
199:234	The reference is made through the asterisk-numberdash-1 i teral fons in the rule, e.g., 11*1 -S5I1, where the 1 itera1 s identify fragments such as the following: PROP I VP I PP /\ PREP NP I I I PROP VP I PROP = proposition These-fragments would match a locative object use of a prepos~.~lur~ arlu LH~.
200:234	verb of that sentence.
201:234	Other fragments are needed for other usages.
202:234	The two forms in the rule after the reference to the first tree fragment will be described in the ~ext section.
203:234	The second part of the pattern side is a set af triples used to test semantic features.
204:234	These tests are of two types, EQ and COMPATIBLE.
205:234	The EQ or "equal" tests ascertain the presence of a single feature in a set.
206:234	Its first parameter is the feature and its second the set.
207:234	The primary use of this test with locatives is to identify the cases where the prepositional tree fragment has actually matched a locative use of a preposition, since the syntactic parser can only be assumed to identify prepositions and not differentiate their senses.
208:234	SPS allom for this discrimination by providing reference to the 1 exical entries associated with a preposition .* These references are made thro+ugh the number-dash-number forms where the first number refers to the number associated with an occurrence of a tree fragment in a rule, while the second refers to the leaf number in the fragment.
209:234	The COMPATIBLE test is meant to allow for the semantic co-occurrence restrictions.
210:234	It takes two sets of features as arguments and evaluates to true if the sets share at least one element.
211:234	The above rule il 'lustrates how this test can be used to allow for three types of restrictions affecting locatives.
212:234	These are between a verb and its prepositional object and between a preposition and the two elements it relates (Winograd's semantic subject and semantic object).
213:234	The fact that SPS allows three sets of features to be associated with lexical entries is used for the three restrictions on 1o.catives.
214:234	One set, accessed through number-dash-number, is for restrtc tions placed on the *With ambiguous entries, SRS tests each sense individually, therefore, any of the lexical references can be considered to have a unique meaning at any one time.
215:234	preposition by the verb.
216:234	The other two sets, identified by the OBJ and SUB prefixes are for restrictions on the elements related.* The final triple in the pattern differs from the othprs in that the test is against a register.
217:234	SPS allows for registers that can have sets of features associated with them.
218:234	The registers provide communication between rules to a1 low for some contextual effects.
219:234	Tests may be made against registers both before and after they are set, with the test held in abqance in the former case.
220:234	The use of the register here is to identify the semantic subjest of the preposition.
221:234	This is necessary since it can not be imediatelv said where the subject is situated in the sentence.
222:234	In the following sentences it is initial, median, and final: "He held onto the rope.", "Hk held her on his lap.
223:234	", and "He held in his hands the letter I sent Mary".
224:234	Given that everything is successful on the pattern side, the action side is executed.
225:234	An example of rule application is given below: (:PLACE !X21 !X100) PROP (:ON ! xi oa LXI 01 1 / \ ( : PRED ! Xi02 $BE ( : OBJ ! Xi 02 !'x4 I: PLACE ! XI 02 4 Xl 01 ) I he held 1 her I on hi:, lap Note that ":PREDt' ide,ntifies the predicator of an event/state, " :OBJH identifies Ir 1 II the element in the object case, and that the 1 i terals beginning with . are *Note that the test using OBJ is on a noun phrase.
226:234	At the moment SPS takes references to noun phrases and sentences to be to the lexical entries of their head noun and verb, respectively.
227:234	variables representing some event/states or objects.
228:234	The purpose of the rul e is to relate the location of the object being held to the location of the complement.
229:234	These locations are available through event/states which identify where each of the two objects were.
230:234	We use the predicator $BE for these event/states, such as in the one for "his lap" which is produced by the rule.
231:234	Hbw the correct assertions are produced from the assertional forms is illustrated in the above rule.
232:234	All the direct references to relations and objects that start with ":It (I tl 'I#", or $ are inserted directly.
233:234	The number-dash-number forms provide a reference to a 1 iteral stoAd in a lexical entry . For prepositions this 1 iteral gives the physical relation that the term refers to.
234:234	The two Place objects are formed by the use of a variable generation feature using the " !XIt'-number-")" form.
