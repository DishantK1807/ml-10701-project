In such translation, given a source language text, S, the translated text, T,inthe target language that maximizes the probability P(T|S) is selected as the most appropriate translation, T best, which is represented as (Brown et al., 1990) T best = argmax T P(T|S) = argmax T (P(S|T) ×P(T)).

Ratnaparkhi proposed models to generate text from semantic attributes (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).

We implemented these models within an maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996; Ristad, 1997; Ristad, 1998).
J96-1002
We used a morpheme model and a dependency model identical to those proposed by Uchimoto et al.(Uchimoto et al., 2001; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000b).

Humphreys et al.proposed using models developed for sentence-structure analysis to rank candidate-text sentences (Humphreys et al., 2001).
W01-0812
Bangalore and Rambow proposed a method to generate candidate-text sentences in the form of trees (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000).
C00-1007
Knight et al.proposed a way to compensate for missing information caused by a lack of language-dependent knowledge, or a “knowledge gap” (Knight and Hatzivassiloglou, 1995; Langkilde and Knight, 1998a; Langkilde and Knight, 1998b).
P95-1034
The word-order model proposed by Uchimoto et al.can also generate surface text in a natural order (Uchimoto et al., 2000a).
