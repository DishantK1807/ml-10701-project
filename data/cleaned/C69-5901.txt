Some ~roblems of Word-Formation ~'ithin the Framework of a Generative Grammar Szab6 Zolt&n Word-formation has not yet received due attention in ~enerative grammars, probably becal~se it is an interim problem between that of the more-or-less clearly established ~orpho-phonological possibilities and the problem of the lexicon, which h~s not yet been worked out (re~ardin~ wor@formation see the productive attempts of Chomsky, 7,o Worth, ~,otsch, Volotskaia, Zimmer).
~;y intention is to examine word-formation from a 6enerative approach, i.e. to trace the possibilities of ~eneratia c derivatives.l shall base my attempLs on e~amples drawn from word-form~tion in liuncarian, a lanouaoe exceptionally rich ia for,n~tive devices.
I. Une first step is the separation of ~rars,~atical and lexicol%ical derivatives.\['his is necessary in order to show wnafi belonbs to the lexicon and wJ.at does not.To ma ke this de\]i~,itation we can use a relatively simple brans i fomrration: derivation (D)~ syntactic construction (SC).ilere the meanirl 6 of the stem ($tM) and of the suffix (Su~) is carried by dif'ferent elements of the sentactic construction, e.

The productive ~ra~m~tical or even lexicolotic~l derivatives will not be entered in the lexi6on (\[~.Ghoesky: Assects of the~E~ ~leory of 8271tax 184).
3/)eriv~tional processes discussed before raise no serious c\]ifficulties, for generative 6rammars.But there are lot of derivatives that create much more problems.
C~onsi-3si@er first of' all the quasi-prodl,ctive p1"ocesses or the croat va~'iety of sporadic, sinLle cases, l~ is pretty difficult to find rules of any ~enerality tiLat produce derivatives of such types.'.\[here are, ho~ever, so~e wide classes of cases "~it~ v~ryin L 8ecrees of proSuc~iviby which ~equire non-ac~\]~oc sol~ tJoas.
