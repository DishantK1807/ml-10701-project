Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) considered a similar task of identifying the most probable light verb for a given deverbal noun.

Stevenson et al.(2004) 54 have used a corpus whose estimated size is at least 15.7 billion, the number of hits returned in a Google search for the query “the” as of February 2006.

Then, the most probable light verb for n is given by: DJ96(n) = argmax v f(v,n) summationdisplay n f(v,n) (2) Stevenson et al.(2004)’s research examines evidence from constructions featuring determiners.

Building on this, Fazly et al.(2005) incorporate an estimation of the probability that a certain noun is part of a LVC.

This is in accordance with the observation that different light verbs have different properties (Stevenson et al., 2004).

As such, previous computational research had proposed that the “lightness” of a LVC might be best modeled as a continuum as opposed to a binary class (Stevenson et al., 2004).

Recently, Fazly et al.(2005) have proposed a statistical measure for the detection of LVCs.
