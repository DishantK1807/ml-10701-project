All the knowledge sources were made available to be used by the inference engine, since previous experiments showed that they are all relevant (Specia, 2006).

Verbs and possible senses in our corpus Both corpora were lemmatized and part-of-speech (POS) tagged using Minipar (Lin, 1993) and Mxpost (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), respectivelly.

For example, Dang and Palmer (2005) also use a rich set of features with a traditional learning algorithm (maximum entropy).

WSD systems have generally been more successful in the disambiguation of nouns than other grammatical categories (Mihalcea et al., 2004).

Syntalex-3 (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004) is based on an ensemble of bagged decision trees with narrow context part-of-speech features and bigrams.

(Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).

Work WSD approaches can be classified as (a) knowledge-based approaches, which make use of linguistic knowledge, manually coded or extracted from lexical resources (Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Lesk 1986); (b) corpus-based approaches, which make use of shallow knowledge automatically acquired from corpus and statistical or machine learning algorithms to induce disambiguation models (Yarowsky, 1995; Sch√ºtze 1998); and (c) hybrid approaches, which mix characteristics from the two other approaches to automatically acquire disambiguation models from corpus supported by linguistic knowledge (Ng and Lee 1996; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).

CLaC1 (Lamjiri et al., 2004) uses a Naive Bayes algorithm with a dynamically adjusted context window around the target word.

These approaches have shown good results; particularly those using supervised learning (see Mihalcea et al., 2004 for an overview of state-ofthe-art systems).

Finally, MC-WSD (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2004) is a multi-class averaged perceptron classifier using syntactic and narrow context features, with one component trained on the data provided by Senseval and other trained on WordNet glosses.
