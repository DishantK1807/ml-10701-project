Attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding (Bos and Markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).

The RTE problem as presented in the PASCAL RTE dataset is particularly attractive in that it is a reasonably simple task for human annotators with high inter-annotator agreement (95.1% in one independent labeling (Bos and Markert, 2005)), but an extremely challenging task for automated systems.

The chief difference in our algorithm is that we generate the surface text search strings from the parsed logical forms using the generation capabilities of NLPWIN (Aikawa et al., 2001), and we verify that the syntactic relations in each discovered web snippet are isomorphic to those in the original candidate paraphrase template.

Our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005), and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%.

3. Calculate paraphrase similarity as a function of the overlap between the slot-filler sets Xt and Xh, i.e: score(Ph,Pt) = |Xh∩Xt||Xt| . We then incorporate paraphrase similarity within the lexical similarity model by allowing, for some unaligned node h ∈ Ph, where t ∈ Pt: sim(h,t) = max(MN(h,t),score(Ph,Pt)) 38 Our approach to paraphrase detection is most similar to the TE/ASE algorithm (Szpektor et al., 2004), and bears similarity to both DIRT (Lin and Pantel, 2001) and KnowItAll (Etzioni et al., 2004).

For example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (Bos and Markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. when able to use the specific task labels as input.

Many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al., 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).
