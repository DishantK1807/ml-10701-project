In this field as well, the use of pre-defined sets of relation patterns has proved fairly reliable, particularly in the case of factoid type queries (Brill et al., 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Hovy et al., 2002; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002).

When present in text, they function as modal 700 qualifiers of the truth of a given proposition, as in example (2), or they indicate the factuality nature of the event expressed by the proposition (whether it happened or not), as in (1) (Saur´ı and Verhagen, 2005).

In many cases, they involve dealing with several events, or identifying and reasoning about certain relations among events which are only partially stated in the source documents (such as temporal and causal ones), all of which makes the pattern-based approach less suitable for the task (Small et al., 2003, Soricut and Brill, 2004).

Such an approach is based on well-established techniques using finite-state methods (see for instance Koskenniemi, 1992; Appelt et al.1993; Karttunen et al., 1996; Grefenstette, 1996, among others).

TARSQI is devoted to two complementary lines of work: (1) establishing a specification language, TimeML, aimed at capturing the richness of temporal and event related information in language (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a, forthcoming), and (2) the construction of a set of tools that perform tasks of identifying, tagging, and reasoning about eventive and temporal information in natural language texts (Pustejovsky and Gaizauskas, forthcoming, Mani, 2005; Mani and Schiffman, forthcoming; Verhagen, 2004; Verhagen et al., 2005; Verhagen and Knippen, forthcoming).

We obtain all such grammatical information by first preprocessing the input file using the Alembic Workbench tagger, lemmatizer, and chunker (Day et al., 1997).

Additional tools within the TimeML research framework are (a) GUTime, a recognizer of temporal expressions which extends Tempex for TimeML (Mani, 2005), (b) a tool devoted to the temporal ordering and anchoring of events (Mani and Schiffman, forthcoming), and (c) Slinket, an application in charge of identifying subordination contexts that introduce intensional events like those exemplified in (1-2) (Verhagen et al., 2005).

qualifies the denoted event with modal information (irrealis, necessity, possibility), and therefore has implications for the suitability of statements as answers to questions, in a parallel way to other intensional contexts exemplified in (1-2); AF Tense and aspect provide crucial information for the temporal ordering of the events; AF Similarly, the non-finite morphology of certain verbal expressions (infinitival, present participle, or past participle) has been shown as useful in predicting temporal relations between events (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004).
