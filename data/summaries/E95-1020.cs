Brill et al.(1990) try to infer grammatical category from bigram statistics.
H90-1055
Transformation-based tagging as introduced by Brill (1993) also requires a handtagged text for training.
P93-1035
The present paper is concerned with tagging languages and sublanguages for which no a priori knowledge about grammatical categories is available, a situation that occurs often in practice (Brill and Marcus, 1992a).

(Brill and Marcus, 19925; Finch, 1993)).
H92-1030 P93-1035
We obtained 47,025 50-dimensional reduced vectors from the SVD and clustered them into 200 classes using the fast clustering algorithm Buckshot (Cutting et al., 1992) (group average agglomeration applied to a sample).

In a previous paper (Schfitze, 1993), we trained a neural network to disambiguate part-of-speech *Although Biber (1993) classifies collocations, these can also be ambiguous.
J93-3004
Brill and Marcus (1992a) have shown that the effort necessary to construct the part-of-speech lexicon can be considerably reduced by combining learning procedures and a partial part-of-speech categorization elicited from an informant.
H92-1030
Biber (1993) applies factor analysis to collocations of two target words ("certain" and "right") with their immediate neighbors.
J93-3004
No pretagged text is necessary for Hidden Markov Models (Jelinek, 1985; Cutting et al., 1991; Kupiec, 1992).
