In rule-based approaches (Grosz et al., 1995; Hobbs, 1978; Mitkov et al., 1998; Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996; Okumura and Tamura, 1996; Palomar et al., 2001; Walker et al., 1994), anaphoric relations between anaphors and their antecedents are identified by way of handcrafted rules, which typically rely on syntactic structures, gender/number agreement, and selectional restrictions.
