with Finite Set Constraints This inferen('e procedure fits nicely with all imph;mentation of (lominance constraints t)ased on constraint programming (Marriott and Stuckey, 1.998; Koller and Niehren, 2000) with tinite set constraints (Miiller, 1999).

There are labeling constraints X:.f(X~,...,Xr~), expressive combinations XRY of dominance constraints 'with set operators (Dtu:hier and Niehren, 200(}; Cornell, 1994), non-intervention constraints ~( X <1* Y <~* Z), and binding constraints a(X)=Z.

More specifically, we introduce DPL structuT"cs~ extended trce structures that encode formulas of dynamic predicate logic (DPL) in much the same way as Egg et al.'s (1998) lambda structnres encode A-terms.
P98-1058
Modeling variable binding with an explicit binding flmction instead of variable nmnes was first proposed in (Egg et al., 1998).

Descriptions In this section, we define the Constraint Language tbr DPL structures, CL(DPL), a language of tree descriptions which conserw~tively extends donfinance constraints (Marcus et al., 1983; Rainbow et al., 1995; Keller et al., 2000) by variable binding constraints.

CL(DPL) is a close relative of the Constraint Language for 460 Lamb(la Structures (CLLS), 1)resented in (Egg et al., 1998).
