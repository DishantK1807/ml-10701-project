<context>young baby. This work is focused on the detection and extraction of Causal Relations from open domain text. A discussion of what can be considered a causation and a formal definition can be found in (Hobbs, 2005). Broadly speaking, causation is a relation between two events: cause and effect. Cause is the producer of the effect, and effect the result of the cause. The rest of the paper is organized as follow</context>
