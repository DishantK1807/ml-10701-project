Then, a sentence realizer, RealPro (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), transforms them into English sentences.

Even where corpus work is used (Dalianis, 1996; Harvey and Carberry, 1998; Shaw, 2002), the results are not completely convincing because we do not know for certain the content to be communicated from which these texts supposedly have been aggregated.

As regards evaluation, NLG systems have been evaluated e.g. by using human judges to assess the quality of the texts produced (Coch, 1996; Lester and Porter, 1997; Harvey and Carberry, 1998); by comparing the systemâ€™s performance to that of humans (Yeh and Mellish, 1997); or through task efficacy measures, i.e., measuring how well the users so, and the distribution of topics and of evaluations is too broad to be telling.

In both DIAG-NLP1 and DIAGNLP2, we use EXEMPLARS (White and Caldwell, 1998), an object-oriented, rule-based generator.

Figure 3: Answers to ConsultRu by DIAG-orig, DIAG-NLP1 and DIAG-NLP2 2.1 DIAG-NLP1: Syntactic aggregation DIAG-NLP11 (i) introduces syntactic aggregation (Dalianis, 1996; Huang and Fiedler, 1996; Reape and Mellish, 1998; Shaw, 2002) and what we call structural aggregation, namely, grouping parts according to the structure of the system; (ii) generates some referring expressions; (iii) models a few rhetorical relations; and (iv) improves the format of the output.

In much work on aggregation (Huang and Fiedler, 1996; Horacek, 2002), aggregation rules and heuristics are shown to be plausible, but are not based on any hard evidence.

Whereas it is considered an essential task of an NLG system, its specific contributions to the effectiveness of the text that is eventually produced have rarely been assessed (Harvey and Carberry, 1998).

NLG systems have been evaluated in various ways, such as via task efficacy measures, i.e., measuring how well the users of the system perform on the task at hand (Young, 1999; Carenini and Moore, 2000; Reiter et al., 2003).
