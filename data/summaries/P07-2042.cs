Pantel, Ravichandran and Hovy (2004) learned syntactic patterns for identifying hypernym relations and combined these with clusters built from co-occurrence information.

Recently, Snow, Jurafsky and Ng (2005) generated tens of thousands of hypernym patterns and combined these with noun clusters to generate high-precision suggestions for unknown noun insertion into WordNet (Snow et al., 2006).

Hearst (1992) was the rst to apply xed syntactic patterns like such NP as NP for extracting hypernym-hyponym pairs.
C92-2082
First, we extracted hypernyms from a large text corpus (300Mwords) following the approach of Snow et al.(2006). We collected 16728 different contexts in which hypernym-hyponym pairs were found and evaluated individual context patterns as well as a combination which made use of Bayesian Logistic Regression.

Following Snow et al.(2006), we derive two types of evidence from these patterns: ??H is a hypernym of A, B and C ??A, B and C are siblings of each other Here, sibling refers to the relative position of the words in the hypernymy tree.
