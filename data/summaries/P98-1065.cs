Hearst. (1997) TextTiling: Segmenting Text into Multi-paragraph Subtopic Passages.
J97-1003
Hearst (1997) and Masson (1995) make use of the word distribution in a text to find a thematic segmentation.
J97-1003
Knowledge-based systems as Grosz and Sidner's (1986) require an extensive manual knowledge engineering effort to create the knowledge base (semantic network and/or frames) and this is only possible in very limited and well-known domains.
J86-3001
To process narrative or expository texts such as newspaper articles, Kozima's (1993) and Morris and Hirst's (1991) approaches are based on lexical cohesion computed from a lexical network.
J91-1002 P93-1041
The cohesion between two words is measured as in Church and Hanks (1990) by an estimation of the mutual information based on their collocation frequency.
J90-1003
Related works Without taking into account the collocation network, the methods described above rely on the same principles as Hearst (1997) and Nomoto and Nitta (1994).

Silberztein. (1994) INTEX: A Corpus Processing System.
C94-1095
They have been collected with the INTEX tool of Silberztein (1994).
C94-1095
As in Kozima (1993), the second method exploits lexical cohesion to segment texts, but in a different way.
P93-1041
The collocations have been calculated according to the method described in Church and Hanks (1990) by moving a window on the texts.
