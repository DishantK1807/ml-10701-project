After establishing a correspondence between attribute and unification grammar (UG), we may see that the technique of "restriction" used by Shieber (1985) in his extended algorithm is related to finite partitioning on attribute domains, in fact a particular case which takes advantage of the more structured attribute domains of UG.

Attribute grammar has been used in the past by the author to define computational models of Chomsky's Government-binding theory, from which practical parsing programs were developed (Correa, 1987a).

Pereira and Warren (1983) and Shieber (1985) present v6rsions of Earley's algorithm for unification grammars, in which unification is the sole operation responsible for attribute evaluation.

1. Introduction Earley's (1970) algorithm is a general algorithm for context-free languages, widely used in natural language processing (King, 1983; Shieber, 1985) and syntactic pattern recognition (Fu, 1982), where the full generative power of context-free grammar is required.
