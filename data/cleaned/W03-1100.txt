1:11	Message from the Program Committee Co-Chair This volume is the Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Information Retrieval with Asian Languages (IRAL 2003) which is held on July 7, 2003, in Sappro, Japan.
2:11	This workshop is the sixth event of the series after about two years absence.
3:11	The first workshop was held in Korea, 1996, and then we had 4 more workshops in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, respectively.
4:11	Unfortunately, because of organizing difficulties in the steering committee members of participating Asian countries, we could not hold workshops in 2001 and 2002.
5:11	In IRAL2000 in Hong Kong, we collocated the workshop just before ACL2000.
6:11	In the Year 2003, we have ACL2003 in Sapporo, and we proposed to have an IRAL workshop as one of ACL supported workshops.
7:11	For this workshop, we have 25 paper submissions from 7 countries/area; Canada (1), Hong Kong (1), Japan (10), Korea (8), Taiwan (2), Thailand (1), and US (2).
8:11	From all these submissions, the Program Committee has chosen 13 papers for oral presentation and 9 papers for poster presentation.
9:11	On behalf of the organizing staff, I would like to express our heartfelt thanks to all of the people who attended and worked for the IRAL 2003 workshop.
10:11	We hope having our workshop within ACL2003 will be a good chance to start again our periodical gathering of IR research community.
