Abstract 
In this paper, four state-of-art probabilistic 
taggers i.e. TnT tagger, TreeTagger, RF tagger 
and SVM tool, are applied to the Urdu lan-
guage. For the purpose of the experiment, a 
syntactic tagset is proposed. A training corpus 
of 100,000 tokens is used to train the models. 
Using the lexicon extracted from the training 
corpus, SVM tool shows the best accuracy of 
94.15%. After providing a separate lexicon of 
70,568 types, SVM tool again shows the best 
accuracy of 95.66%. 
1 Urdu
Language 
Urdu belongs to the Indo-Aryan language family. 
It is the national language of Pakistan and is one 
of the official languages of India. The majority 
of the speakers of Urdu spread over the area of 
South Asia, South Africa and the United King-
dom
1
. 
Urdu is a free order language with general 
word order SOV. It shares its phonological, mor-
phological and syntactic structures with Hindi. 
Some linguists considered them as two different 
dialects of one language (Bhatia and Koul, 
2000). However, Urdu is written in Perso-arabic 
script and inherits most of the vocabulary from 
Arabic and Persian. On the other hand, Hindi is 
written in Devanagari script and inherits vocabu-
lary from Sanskrit. 
Urdu is a morphologically rich language. 
Forms of the verb, as well as case, gender, and 
number are expressed by the morphology. Urdu 
represents case with a separate character after the 
head noun of the noun phrase. Due to their sepa-
rate occurrence and their place of occurrence, 
they are sometimes considered as postpositions. 
Considering them as case markers, Urdu has no-

minative, ergative, accusative, dative, instrumen-
tal, genitive and locative cases (Butt, 1995: pg 
10). The Urdu verb phrase contains a main verb, 
a light verb describing the aspect, and a tense 
verb describing the tense of the phrase (Hardie, 
2003; Hardie, 2003a). 
2 Urdu
Tagset 
There are various questions that need to be ans-
wered during the design of a tagset. The granu-
larity of the tagset is the first problem in this re-
gard. A tagset may consist either of general parts 
of speech only or it may consist of additional 
morpho-syntactic categories such as number, 
gender and case. In order to facilitate the tagger 
training and to reduce the lexical and syntactic 
ambiguity, we decided to concentrate on the syn-
tactic categories of the language. Purely syntactic 
categories lead to a smaller number of tags which 
also improves the accuracy of manual tagging
2
 
(Marcus et al., 1993). 
Urdu is influenced from Arabic, and can 
be considered as having three main parts of 
speech, namely noun, verb and particle (Platts, 
1909; Javed, 1981; Haq, 1987). However, some 
grammarians proposed ten main parts of speech 
for Urdu (Schmidt, 1999). The work of Urdu 
grammar writers provides a full overview of all 
the features of the language. However, in the 
perspective of the tagset, their analysis is lacking 
the computational grounds. The semantic, mor-
phological and syntactic categories are mixed in 
their distribution of parts of speech. For example, 
Haq (1987) divides the common nouns into sit-
uational (smile, sadness, darkness), locative 
(park, office, morning, evening), instrumental 
(knife, sword) and collective nouns (army, data). 
In 2003, Hardie proposed the first com-
putational part of speech tagset for Urdu (Hardie,

2003a). It is a morpho-syntactic tagset based on 
the EAGLES guidelines. The tagset contains 350 
different tags with information about number, 
gender, case, etc. (van Halteren, 2005). The 
EAGLES guidelines are based on three levels, 
major word classes, recommended attributes and 
optional attributes. Major word classes include 
thirteen tags: noun, verb, adjective, pro-
noun/determiner, article, adverb, adposition, con-
junction, numeral, interjection, unassigned, resi-
dual and punctuation. The recommended 
attributes include number, gender, case, finite-
ness, voice, etc.
3
 In this paper, we will focus on 
purely syntactic distributions thus will not go 
into the details of the recommended attributes of 
the EAGLES guidelines. Considering the 
EAGLES guidelines and the tagset of Hardie in 
comparison with the general parts of speech of 
Urdu, there are no articles in Urdu. Due to the 
phrase level and semantic differences, pronoun 
and demonstrative are separate parts of speech in 
Urdu. In the Hardie tagset, the possessive pro-
nouns like g909g942g1012g995 /mera/ (my), g909g941g910g1644g996g919 /tumhara/ 
(your), g909g941g910g996g1643 /humara/ (our) are assigned to the 
category of possessive adjective. Most of the Ur-
du grammarians consider them as pronouns 
(Platts, 1909; Javed, 1981; Haq, 1987). However, 
all these possessive pronouns require a noun in 
their noun phrase, thus show a similar behavior 
as demonstratives. The locative and temporal 
adverbs (g1551g910g1644g1011 /yahan/ (here), g1551g910g1643g1005 /wahan/ (there), 
g911g909 /ab/ (now), etc.) and, the locative and tempor-
al nouns (g930g914g955 /subah/ (morning),  g993g910g951  /sham/ 
(evening),  g942g1004g819  /gher/ (home)) appear in a very 
similar syntactic context. In order to keep the 
structure of pronoun and noun consistent, loca-
tive and temporal adverbs are treated as pro-
nouns. The tense and aspect of a verb in Urdu is 
represented by a sequence of auxiliaries. Consid-
er the example

/ja/ and g910g1643g941 /raha/ and the last word of the sen-
tence g1601g1643 /hai/ (is) shows the tense of the verb.”

 Urdu is written in right to left direction. 
 
The above considerations lead to the following 
tagset design for Urdu. The general parts of 
speech are noun, pronoun, demonstrative, verb, 
adjective, adverb, conjunction, particle, number 
and punctuation. The further refinement of the 
tagset is based on syntactic properties. The mor-
phologically motivated features of the language 
are not encoded in the tagset. For example, an 
Urdu verb has 60 forms which are morphologi-
cally derived from its root form. All these forms 
are annotated with the same category i.e. verb. 
During manual tagging, some words are 
hard for the linguist to disambiguate reliably. In 
order to keep the training data consistent, such 
words are assigned a separate tag. For instance, 
the semantic marker g1601g947 /se/ gets a separate tag 
due to its various confusing usages such as  loca-
tive and instrumental (Platts, 1909). 
The tagset used in the experiments reported 
in this paper contains 42 tags including three 
special tags. Nouns are divided into noun (NN) 
and proper name (PN). Demonstratives are di-
vided into personal (PD), KAF (KD), adverbial 
(AD) and relative demonstratives (RD). All four 
categories of demonstratives are ambiguous with 
four categories of pronouns. Pronouns are di-
vided into six types i.e. personal (PP), reflexive 
(RP), relative (REP), adverbial (AP), KAF (KP) 
and adverbial KAF (AKP) pronouns. Based on 
phrase level differences, genitive reflexive (GR) 
and genitive (G) are kept separate from pro-
nouns. The verb phrase is divided into verb, as-
pectual auxiliaries and tense auxiliaries. Numer-
als are divided into cardinal (CA), ordinal (OR), 
fractional (FR) and multiplicative (MUL). Con-
junctions are divided into coordinating (CC) and 
subordinating (SC) conjunctions. All semantic 
markers except g1601g947  /se/ are kept in one category. 
Adjective (ADJ), adverb (ADV), quantifier (Q), 
measuring unit (U), intensifier (I), interjection 
(INT), negation (NEG) and question words 
(QW) are handled as separate categories. Adjec-
tival particle (A), KER (KER), SE (SE) and 
WALA (WALA) are ambiguous entities which 
are annotated with separate tags. A complete list 
of the tags with the examples is given in appen-
dix A. The examples of the weird categories such 
as WALA, KAF pronoun, KAF demonstratives, 
etc. are given in appendix B. 
3 Tagging
Methodologies 
The work on automatic part of speech tagging 
started in early 1960s. Klein and Simmons 
693
 
 
(1963) rule based POS tagger can be considered 
as the first automatic tagging system. In the rule 
based approach, after assigning each word its 
potential tags, a list of hand written disambigua-
tion rules are used to reduce the number of tags 
to one (Klein and Simmons, 1963; Green and 
Rubin, 1971; Hindle, 1989; Chanod and Tapa-
nainen 1994). A rule based model has the disad-
vantage of requiring lots of linguistic efforts to 
write rules for the language. 
Data-driven approaches resolve this prob-
lem by automatically extracting the information 
from an already tagged corpus. Ambiguity be-
tween the tags is resolved by selecting the most 
likely tag for a word (Bahl and Mercer, 1976; 
Church, 1988; Brill, 1992). Brill’s transformation 
based tagger uses lexical rules to assign each 
word the most frequent tag and then applies con-
textual rules over and over again to get a high 
accuracy. However, Brill’s tagger requires train-
ing on a large number of rules which reduces the 
efficiency of machine learning process. Statistic-
al approaches usually achieve an accuracy of 
96%-97% (Hardie, 2003: 295). However, statis-
tical taggers require a large training corpus to 
avoid data sparseness. The problem of low fre-
quencies can be resolved by applying different 
methods such as smoothing, decision trees, etc. 
In the next section, an overview of the statistical 
taggers is provided which are evaluated on the 
Urdu tagset. 
3.1 Probabilistic
Disambiguation 
The Hidden Markov model is the most widely 
used method for statistical part of speech tag-
ging. Each tag is considered as a state. States are 
connected by transition probabilities which 
represent the cost of moving from one state to 
another. The probability of a word having a par-
ticular tag is called lexical probability. Both, the 
transitional and the lexical probabilities are used 
to select the tag of a particular word. 
As a standard HMM tagger, The TnT 
tagger is used for the experiments. The TnT tag-
ger is a trigram HMM tagger in which the transi-
tion probability depends on two preceding tags. 
The performance of the tagger was tested on 
NEGRA corpus and Penn Treebank corpus. The 
average accuracy of the tagger is 96% to 97% 
(Brants, 2000). 
The second order Markov model used by 
the TnT tagger requires large amounts of tagged 
data to get reasonable frequencies of POS tri-
grams. The TnT tagger smooths the probability 
with linear interpolation to handle the problem of 
data sparseness. The Tags of unknown words are 
predicted based on the word suffix. The longest 
ending string of an unknown word having one or 
more occurrences in the training corpus is consi-
dered as a suffix. The tag probabilities of a suffix 
are evaluated from all the words in the training 
corpus (Brants, 2000). 
In 1994, Schmid proposed a probabilistic 
part of speech tagger very similar to a HMM 
based tagger. The transition probabilities are cal-
culated by decision trees. The decision tree 
merges infrequent trigrams with similar contexts 
until the trigram frequencies are large enough to 
get reliable estimates of the transition probabili-
ties. The TreeTagger uses an unknown word 
POS guesser similar to that of the TnT tagger. 
The TreeTagger was trained on 2 million words 
of the Penn-Treebank corpus and was evaluated 
on 100,000 words. Its accuracy is compared 
against a trigram tagger built on the same data. 
The TreeTagger showed an accuracy of 96.06% 
(Schmid, 1994a). 
In 2004, Giménez and Màrquez pro-
posed a part of speech tagger (SVM tool) based 
on support vector machines and reported accura-
cy higher than all state-of-art taggers. The aim of 
the development was to have a simple, efficient, 
robust tagger with high accuracy. The support 
vector machine does a binary classification of the 
data. It constructs an N-dimensional hyperplane 
that separates the data into positive and negative 
classes. Each data element is considered as a 
vector. Those vectors which are close to the se-
parating hyperplane are called support vectors
5
.  
A support vector machine has to be 
trained for each tag. The complexity is controlled 
by introducing a lexicon extracted from the train-
ing data. Each word tag pair in the training cor-
pus is considered as a positive case for that tag 
class and all other tags in the lexicon are consi-
dered negative cases for that word. This feature 
avoids generating useless cases for the compari-
son of classes. 
The SVM tool was evaluated on the 
English Penn Treebank. Experiments were con-
ducted using both polynomial and linear kernels. 
When using n-gram features, the linear kernel 
showed a significant improvement in speed and 
accuracy. Unknown words are considered as the 
most ambiguous words by assigning them all 
open class POS tags. The disambiguation of un-
knowns uses features such as prefixes, suffixes,

upper case, lower case, word length, etc. On the 
Penn Treebank corpus, SVM tool showed an ac-
curacy of 97.16% (Giménez and Màrquez, 
2004). 
In 2008, Schmid and Florian proposed a 
probabilistic POS tagger for fine grained tagsets. 
The basic idea is to consider POS tags as sets of 
attributes. The context probability of a tag is the 
product of the probabilities of its attributes. The 
probability of an attribute given the previous tags 
is estimated with a decision tree. The decision 
tree uses different context features for the predic-
tion of different attributes (Schmid and Laws, 
2008).  
The RF tagger is well suited for lan-
guages with a rich morphology and a large fine 
grained tagset. The RF tagger was evaluated on 
the German Tiger Treebank and Czech Academ-
ic corpus which contain 700 and 1200 POS tags, 
respectively. The RF tagger achieved a higher 
accuracy than TnT and SVMTool. 
Urdu is a morphologically rich language. 
Training a tagger on a large fine grained tagset 
requires a large training corpus. Therefore, the 
tagset which we are using for these experiments 
is only based on syntactic distributions. Howev-
er, it is always interesting to evaluate new dis-
ambiguation ideas like RF tagger on different 
languages. 
4 Experiments

A corpus of approx 110,000 tokens was taken 
from a news corpus (www.jang.com.pk). In the 
filtering phase, diacritics were removed from the 
text and normalization was applied to keep the 
Unicode of the characters consistent. The prob-
lem of space insertion and space deletion was 
manually solved and space is defined as the word 
boundary. The data was randomly divided into 
two parts, 90% training corpus and 10% test cor-
pus. A part of the training set was also used as 
held out data to optimize the parameters of the 
taggers. The statistics of the training corpus and 
test corpus are shown in table 2 and table 3. The 
optimized parameters of the TreeTagger are con-
text size 2, with minimum information gain for 
decision tree 0.1 and information gain at leaf 
node 1.4. For TnT, a default trigram tagger is 
used with suffix length of 10, sparse data mode 4 
with lambda1 0.03 and lambda2 0.4. The RF 
tagger uses a context length of 4 with threshold 
of suffix tree pruning 1.5. The SVM tool is 
trained at right to left direction with model 4. 
Model 4 improves the detection of unknown 
words by artificially marking some known words 
as unknown words and then learning the model.

The taggers show poor accuracy while detecting 
proper names. In most of the cases, proper name 
is confused with adjective and noun. This is be-
cause in Urdu, there is no clear distinction be-
tween noun and proper name. Also, the usage of 
an adjective as a proper name is a frequent phe-
nomenon in Urdu. The accuracies of open class 
tags are shown in table 5. The detailed discussion 
on the results of the taggers is done after provid-
ing an external lexicon to the taggers.

5 Discussion

The output of table 9 can be analyzed in many 
ways e.g. ambiguous tags, unknown words, open 
class tags, close class tags, etc. In the close class 
tags, the most frequent errors are between de-
monstrative and pronoun, and between KER tag 
and semantic marker (P). The difference between 
demonstrative and pronoun is at the phrase level. 
Demonstratives are followed by a noun which 
belongs to the same noun phrase whereas pro-
nouns form a noun phrase by itself. Taggers ana-
lyze the language in a flat structure and are una-
ble to handle the phrase level differences. It is 
interesting to see that the SVM tool shows a 
clear improvement in detecting the phrase level 
differences over the other taggers. It might be 
due to the SVM tool ability to look not only at 
696
 
 
the neighboring tags but at the neighboring 
words as well.

“Table 10: The word g1001g1005 /voh/ is occurring both as 
pronoun and demonstrative. In both of the cases, 
it is followed by a noun. But looking at the 
phrases, demonstrative g1001g1005 has the noun inside the 
noun phrase.” 
The second most frequent error among the closed 
class tags is the distinction between the KER tag 
g1601g815 /kay/ and the semantic marker g1601g815 /kay/. The 
KER tag always takes a verb before it and the 
semantic marker always takes a noun before it. 
The ambiguity arises when a verbal noun occurs. 
In the tagset, verbal nouns are handled as verb. 
Syntactically, verbal nouns occur at the place of 
a noun and can also take a semantic marker after 
them. This decreases the accuracy in two ways; 
the wrong disambiguation of KER tag and the 
wrong disambiguation of unknown verbal nouns. 
Due to the small amount of training data, un-
known words are frequent in the test corpus. 
Whenever an unknown word occurs at the place 
of a noun, the most probable tag for that word 
will be noun which is wrong in our case. Table 
11 shows an example of such a scenario.

All the taggers other than the SVM tool have 
difficulties to disambiguate between KER tags 
and semantic markers.

“Table 12: (a) Occurrence of adjective with 
noun, (b) dropping of main noun from the noun 
phrase. In that case, adjective becomes the 
noun.” 
Coming to open class tags, the most frequent 
errors are between noun and the other open class 
tags in the noun phrase like proper noun, adjec-
tive and adverb. In Urdu, there is no clear dis-
tinction between noun and proper noun. The 
phenomenon of dropping of words is also fre-
quent in Urdu. If a noun in a noun phrase is 
dropped, the adjective becomes a noun in that 
phrase (see table 12). The ambiguity between 
noun and verb is due to verbal nouns as ex-
plained above (see table 11). 
6 Conclusion

In this paper, probabilistic part of speech tagging 
technologies are tested on the Urdu language. 
The main goal of this work is to investigate 
whether general disambiguation techniques and 
standard POS taggers can be used for the tagging 
of Urdu. The results of the taggers clearly answer 
this question positively. With the small training 
corpus, all the taggers showed accuracies around 
95%. The SVM tool shows the best accuracy in

 One possible solution to this problem could be to intro-
duce a separate tag for verbal nouns which will certainly 
remove the ambiguity between the KER tag and the seman-
tic marker and reduce the ambiguity between verb and 
noun.

disambiguating the known words and the RF 
tagger shows the best accuracy in detecting the 
tags of unknown words. 
Appendices 
Appendix A. Urdu part of speech tagset 
Following is the complete list of the tags of Ur-
du. There are some occurrences in which two 
Urdu words are mapped to the same translation 
of English. There are two reasons for that, ei-
ther the Urdu words have different case or there 
is no significant meaning difference between 
the two words which can be described by dif-
ferent English translations.
