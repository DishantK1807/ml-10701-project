This method uses mutual information and loglikelihood, which Dunning (1993) used to calculate the dependency value between words.

Brill (1995) describes a simple rule-based approach for learning by rewriting the bracketing rule—a method for presenting the structure of natural language text— for linguistic knowledge.
