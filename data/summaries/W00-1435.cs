For more information on ILEX, see Knott et al.(1997) and Mellish et al.(1998). The demonstration will consist of generating a series of texts, in each case adding in additional components of the domain semantics.

Mapping Domain taxonomy onto Upper Model: ILEX uses an Upper Model (a domainindependent semantic taxonomy, see Bateman (1990)), which supports the grammatical expression of entities, e.g., selection of pronoun, differentiation between mass and count entities, between things and qualities, etc.
