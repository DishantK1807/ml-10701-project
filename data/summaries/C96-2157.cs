An alternative method we considered was to estimate certain conditional probabilities, similarly to the formula used in (Yarowsky, 1995): SW(t) log P(p C A/t) f(t, A)f(A) = ~ log (2) P(p C R/t) f(t, .R)f(.l~) Here f(A) is (an estimate of) the probability that any given candidate phrase will be accepted by the spotter, and f(R) is the probability that this phrase is rejected, i.e., f(R) = l-f (A).
