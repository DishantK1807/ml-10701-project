More details on these standard criteria can be found for instance in (Och, 2003).

Och. 2003.

We extended the monotone search algorithm from (Zens and Ney, 2004) such that reorderings are possible.
N04-1033
Then, we introduce reorderings into this graph as described in (Kanthak et al., 2005).
W05-0831
We use a phrase-based translation approach as described in (Zens and Ney, 2004).
N04-1033
The model scaling factors are optimized with respect to some evaluation criterion (Och, 2003).
P03-1021
(Bangalore and Riccardi, 2001; Kumar and Byrne, 2003), deal with word graphs.
N01-1018 N03-1019
The training of the model scaling factors as described in (Och and Ney, 2002) was done on N-best lists.
P02-1038
The described steps can be implemented using weighted nite state transducer, similar to (Kumar and Byrne, 2003).
N03-1019
(Och et al., 2003).
P03-1021
More details of this reordering approach are described in (Kanthak et al., 2005).
