The κ statistic (Carletta, 1996) is recast as: κ(fs,w)(sys,sys) = agr(fs,w)(sys,sys)− P agr(fs,∗)(sys,sys) N − P agr(fs,∗)(sys,sys) N In this modified form, κ(fs,w) represents the divergence in relative agreement wrt f s for target noun w, relative to the mean relative agreement wrt f s over all words.

With the POS extraction method, we first tagged the BNC using an fnTBL-based tagger (Ngai and Florian, 2001) trained over the Brown and WSJ corpora and based on the Penn POS tagset.

Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2002) determine a noun’s countability preferences—as defined in a 5-way classification—from its semantic class in the ALT-J/E lexicon, and show that semantics predicts countability 78% of the time.

We read dependency tuples directly off the output of RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002b) in grammatical relation mode.1 RASP has the advantage that recall is high, although precision is potentially lower 1We used the first parse in the experiments reported here.

These are described in greater detail in Baldwin and Bond (2003).

For the chunker, we ran fnTBL over the lemmatised tagged data, training over CoNLL 2000style (Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) chunkconverted versions of the full Brown and WSJ corpora.

An alternative method would be to use weighted dependency tuples, as described in Briscoe and Carroll (2002a).

This research complements that described in Baldwin and Bond (2003), where we present the linguistic foundations and features drawn upon in the countability classification task, and motivate the claim that countability preferences can be learned from corpus evidence.

In a separate evaluation, we took the bestperforming classifier (Dist(AllCON,SUITE)) and ran it over open data, using best-500 feature selection (Baldwin and Bond, 2003).
