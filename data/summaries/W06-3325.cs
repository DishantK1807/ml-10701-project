Average biosystematics documents contain about 15.000 words, which is less than 0.02% of the data used by Niu (2003).

127 2.5 Active Learning According to Day (1997), the original idea of Active Learning was to speed up the creation of large labeled training corpora from unlabeled documents.

The most common ones are list lookups, grammars, rules, and statistical methods like SVMs (Bikel 1997).

All these techniques have been developed for tasks like the one presented by Carreras (2005).
