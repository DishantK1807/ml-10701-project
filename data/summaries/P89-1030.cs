As a discourse progresses, an adequate discourse model must represent the relevant entities, and the relationships between them (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), A speaker may then felicitously refer anaphorically to an object (subject to focusing or centering constraints (Grosz et al., 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al.1987) ) if there is an existing DE representing it, or if a corresponding DE may be directly inferred from an existing DE.

Our paraphrasing component (Meteer and Shaked, 1988) already uses the discourse entities to a limited extent.

We would like to address the problem of event reference and its interaction with temporal information, using ideas such as those in (Webber, 1988) and in the special issue of ComputationaJ Linguistics on tense and aspect (Vol.

We designed the 243 algorithms and structures necessary to generate discourse entities from our logical representation of the meaning of utterances, and from pointing gestures, and currently use them in Janus's (Weischedel et al., 1987, BSN, 1988) pronoun resolution component, which applies centering techniques (Grosz et al., 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al.1987) to track and constrain references.

We are currently starting to port the DE generation component to the BBN Spoken Language System (Boisen et al., 1989), and plan to integrate it with the intra-sentential mechanisms in (Ingria and Stallard, 1989).
