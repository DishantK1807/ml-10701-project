Various supervised learning methods for Named Entity (NE) tasks were successfully applied and have shown reasonably satisfiable performance.((Zhou and Su, 2002)(Borthwick et al., 1998)(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000)) However, most of these systems heavily rely on a tagged corpus for training.

Therefore we need to separate the functional words from an NE instance to detect the boundary of the NE instance and this is achieved by a part-of-speech tagger, POSTAG, which can detect unknown words (Lee et al., 2002).
