Unlike Church and Hanks (1990), Smadja (1993) goes beyond the "two-word" limitation and deals with "collocations of arbitrary length".

Currently, the effectiveness of such techniques is evaluated not only on how easily they can be applied to text sources to extract information and represent it in a systematic format (Walker 1983), but also on whether they can be applied to large text corpora of several tens of thousand of words.

Unlike Choueka (1988), Church and Hanks (1990) identify as collocations both interrupted and uninterrupted sequences of words.

The more negative the value is, the more "bursty" the word is distributed, and the more likely it is content oriented since "content words tend to appear in 'bursts" (Church and Mercer 1993).
J93-1001
Following Church and Hanks (1990), they use mutual information to select significant two-word patterns, but, at the same time, a lexical inductive process is incorporated which, as they claim, can improve the collection of domain-specific terms.
J90-1003
Other representative collocation research can be found in Church and Hanks (1990) and Smadja (1993).
