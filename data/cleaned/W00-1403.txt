1 Introduction
The natural language generation community has emphasized for a number of years the strengths of multilingual generation (MGEN) systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; RTsner and Stede, 1992; Reiter and Mellish, 1993; Goldberg et al., 1994; Paris et al., 1995; Power and Scott, 1998).
These strengths concern the reuse of knowledge, the support for early drafts in several languages, the support for maintaining consistency when making changes, the support for producing alternative formulations, and the potential for producing higher quality outputs than machine translation.
(The weaknesses concern the high-cost of building large, language-independent knowledge bases, and the dilficulty of producing high-quality.
broad-coverage generation algorithms).
From an economic perspective, the more a system can rely on language independent modules for the purpose of multilingual generatiom the better.
If an MGEN system needs to develop language dependent knowledge bases, and language dependent algorithms for content selection, text planning, and sentence planning, it-is difficult to justify its economic viability.
However, if most of these components are language independent and/or much of the code can be re-used, an MGEN system becomes a viable option.
.Many of the earl3 implementations of MGEN systems have adopted the perspective that text planners can be implemented as language-independent modules (lordanskaja el, ;11., 1992: Goldberg et el., 1994), possibly followed by a hm:aricatwn stage, in which discourse l.rees are re-written to refleet~ language-specific constraints (R6sner and Stede.
1992; St,ede, 1999).
Although such an approach may 17 be adequate for highly restricted text genres, such as weather forecasts, it usually poses problems for less restricted genres.
Studies of instruction manuals (RTsner and Stede, 1992; Delin et al., 1994: Delin et al., 1996) suggest that there are variations with respect to the way high-level communicative goals are realized across languages.
For example, Delin et al.(1994) noticed that sentences (1), (2), and (3), which were taken from a trilingual instruction manual for a step-aerobics machine, yield nonisomorphic Rhetorical Structure (Mann and Thompson, 1988) analyses in English, French, and German respectively (see Figure 1).
English: \[The stepping load can be altered I \] \[by loosening the locking lever 2\] \[and changing the position of the cylinder foota\].
(1) French: \[Pour modifier la charge d'appui, l\] \[desserrer les levieres 2\] \[puis d6placer le pied des v6rins a\] (\[To modify the load stepping ~\] \[loosen the levers 2\] \[then change .the foot of the cylinder foot.el) (2) German: \[,Nach Lockern der Klelnmhebel 2\] (3) \[kann t \] \[durch Verschieben des Zylinderfudes 3 \] \[die Tretbelastung verS.ndert werden.~ \] (\[After loosening of the levers 2\] \[can'\] \[by puslfing of the cylinder foot 3\] \[the load changed be, ~\]) Hmvever, previous.discourse,studies do .not estimate how ubiquitous such non-isomorphic analyses are.
Are the examples above an exception or the norm?
Are non-isomorphic analyses specific to discourse structures built, across elementary discourse units of single sentences, or do they also occur across sentences and paragraphs?
If nonisomorphism is ubiquitous, how should an MGEN system be designed in order to effectively deal wit h non-isomorphic discourse structures when mapping knowledge bases into multiple languages?
In this paper, we describe an experiment that was designed to answer these questions.

2 Towards
building a parallel corpus of discourse trees: an example Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (4), a word-by-word "gloss" of it (5), and a two-sentence translation of it that was produced by a professional translator (6).
~/rf~ ~ 4\] \[~afL~,t~, 5\] \[~< g-~.~oq~t-¢ {4) Thompson, 1988).
If we analyze the text fragments closely, we will notice that in translating sentence (4), a professional translator chose to realize the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in text (4) corresponds roughly to unit I in text (6)); to realize then some of the information in Japanese unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (4) corresponds to unit 2 in text (6)); to fuse then information given in units 1, 3, and 5 in text (4) and realize it in English as unit 3; and so on.
Also, the translator chose to repackage the information in the original Japanese sentence into two English sentences.
At the elementary unit level, the correspondence between Japanese sentence (4) and its English translation (6) can be represented as in (7), where j C e denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit j is realized fully in unit e; j D e denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit e is realized fully in unit.
j; j = e denotes the fact that units j and e are semantically equivalent; and j ~ e denotes the fact that there is a semantic overlap between units j and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equivalence.

However, when translating text, it is not only that information is re-packaged and re-ordered; it is also that the rhetorical rendering changes.
What is realized in Japanese using an ELABORATION relation can be realized in English using, for example, a CON'I'RAST or a CONCESSION relation.

son (1988) the discourse structures of text fragments (4) and (6).
Each discourse structure is a tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose internal nodes correspond t.o contiguous text spans.
Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text spans.
(There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as the CONTRAST relation that holds between unit \[3\] and span \[4,.5\] in the structure of the English text are multinuclear).
The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's intention than the satellite: and that the nucleus of a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa.
Rhetorical relations'that end.in the.suffix :'-e".
denote relations that correspond to embedded syntactic constituents.
For example, the ELABORATIONOBJEC'T-ATTRIBUTE-E relation that holds between units 9.
and 1 in the English discourse structure corresponds to a restrictive relative.
We chose to label these relations because we have noticed that they often dominate complex discourse trees, whose elenlentary units are fully fleshed clauses.
If one knows the mappings at the ed~l level, one can determine the mappings at.
the span (discourse constituent) level as well.
For example, us19 ing the elementary mappings in (7), one can determine that Japanese span \[1,2\] corresponds to English span \[1,2\], Japanese unit \[4\] to English span \[4,,5\].,Japanese span \[6,7\] to English unit \[6\], Japanese span \[1,5\] to English span \[1,5\], and so on.
As Figure 2 shows, the CONCESSION relation that holds between spans \[1,5\] and \[6,7\] in the Japanese tree corresponds to a similar relation that holds between span \[I.5\] and unit \[6\] in the English tree (modulo the fact that, in Japanese, the relation holds between sentence fragments, while in English it holds between fldl sentences).
However, the TEMPORAL-AFTER relation that holds between units \[3\] and \[4\] in the Japanese tree is realized as a CONTRAST relation between unit \[3\] and span \[4,5\] in the English tree: And because Japanese units \[6\] and \[7\] are fused into: unit \[6\] ing:nglish, the rel,ation .ELA-BORAT.IONOBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E iS no longer made explicit in the English text.
Assume now that it is the task of an MGEN system to produce from a knowledge base texts (4) and (6).
The system will have to select, the appropriate information, generate text plans for the two texts, generate sentence plans, and realize them.
Should the syst.en~ generate a text plan having a structure similar to the PtST analysis at.
the top or the bottom of Figure 2"?
Or something in between'?
As one can see, the discourse trees in Figure 2 are quite different: they suggest that depending on the output language, text plans should use different relations, different orderings of elementary units, different aggregations across semantic units, etc.
Some researchers may argue that the two RST analyses in Figure 2 are too specific.
That they, figures.
In computing Position-Dependent (P-D) recall and precision figures, a Japanese span was considered to match an English span when the Japanese span contained all the Japanese edus that corresponded to the edus in the English span, and in fact, correspond t0.:text.,~plaz!s .,tha-t .l!.ave bee.n already refined by an aggregation module and arguably, even by a sentence planner.
After all, the re-ordering of units 1 and 2 can be explained only in terms of different syntactic contraints in Japanese and English.
We agree with such a concern.
Nevertheless, as our experiment shows, significant differences across discourse trees are found not only for trees built at the sentence level, but also for trees built at the paragraph and text levels.
For these levels, it is difficult to explain the differences in terms of language-specific syntactic constraints.
Rather, it seems more adequate to assume that there are significant differences with respect to the way information is organized rhetorically across languages.
The experiment described in the next section estimates quantitatively this difference.
3 Experiment
In order to assess how similar discourse structures are across languages, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding translations.
The texts, selected randomly from the ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994), contained on average about 460 words.
We developed a discourse annotation protocol for,Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al.(1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts it, the corpus.
10~. of the Japanese and English texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us.
The agreement was statistically significant (Kappa = 0.65.0 > 0.01 for Japanese and Kappa = 0.748,0 > 0.01 for English (Carletta, 1996; Siegel-and Castellan, 1988)).
The tool and the annotation protocol are available at.
http://www, isi.edt,/~r, zarcu/softwa,-e/.
For each pair of Japanese-English discourse, structures, we also built, manually an alignment file, which specified the correspondence between the edus of the Japanese and English texts.
Using labeled recall and precision figures, we computed the similarity between English and Japanese discourse trees with respect t,o their assignment of edu boundaries, hierarchical spans, nuclearity, and rhetorical relations, Because the trees we comparod differ from one language to the other ill the ntnnber of elernent ary units, the order, of these units, and the way the units are grouped rectirsively into discourse spans, we comptlted two types of recall and precision, :+when :~e.J~laa~tese:~-and.~En~lish::spans -appeared-in the same position linearly.
For example, the English tree in Figure 2 is characterized by 10 subsentential spans, which span across positions \[1,1\], \[2,2\], \[3,3\], \[4,4\], \[5,5\], \[6,6\], \[1,2\], \[4,5\], \[3,5\], and \[1,5\].
(Span \[1,6\] subsumes 2 sentences, so it is not sub-sentential).
The Japanese discourse tree has only 4 spans that could be matched in the same positions with English spans, namely spans \[1,2\].
\[4,4\], \[5,5\], and \[1,5\].
Hence the similarity between the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect to their discourse structure below the sentence level has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/ll (in Figure 2, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans).
In computing Position-Independent (P-I) recall and precision figures, even when a Japanese span "floated" during the translation to a position in the English tree that was different from the position in the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision figures are affected less than when computing PositionDependent figures.
The position-independent figures reflect the intuition that if two trees tl and t2 both have a subtree t, tl and 12 are more similar than if they were if they didn't share ally subtree.
For instance, for the spans at the sub-sentential level in the trees in Figure 2 the position-independent recall is 6/10 and the position-independent precision is 6/11 because in addition to spans \[1,2\], \[4,4\], \[5,5\], and \[1,5\], one can also match Japanese spat, \[1,1\] to English spa,, \[2,2\] and Japanese spa,, \[2,2\] to Japanese span \[1,1\].
The Position-Independent figures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing discourse trees.
They span a wider range of values than the Position-Dependent figures, which enables a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables a better characterization of the differ.ences between Japanese and English discourse structures.
In order to provide a better estimate of how close two discourse trees were, we computed PositionDependent and -Independent recall and precision figures for the sentential level (where units are given by edus and spans are given by sets of edus or single sentences); paragraph level (where units are given by sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences or single paragraphs): and text level (where units are given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets of paragraphs).
These figures offer a detailed picture of how discourse structures and relations are mapped -from one languageto the other.
Some of the differences at the sentence level can be explained by differences between the syntactic structures of Japanese 20 Level Sentence Paragraph Text Weighted Average All .Sentence Paragraph Text Weighted Average All Units P-D R P-D P 29.1 25.0 53.9 53.4 41.3 42.6 36.0 32.5 Spans P-D R P-D P 27.2 22.7 46.8 47.3 31.5 32.6 31.8 28.4 • 8.2 ..... : 7,4 ..... -.5.9 . ...... 5.3.: P-IR P-IP 71.0 61.0 62.1 61.6 74.1 76.5 69.6 63.0 74.5 66.8 P-IR P-IP 56.0 46.6 53.2 53.8 54.4 56.5 55.2 49.2 50.6 45.8 Nuclei P-D R P-D P 21.3 17.7 38.6 39.0 28.8 29.9 26.0 23.1 ..... -.4A ............ 3~9:_ P-IR P-IP 44.3 36.9 43.3 43.8 48.5 50.4 44.8 39.9 39.4 35.7 Relations P-D R P-D P 14.9 12.4 31.9 32.3 26.1 27.1 20.1 17.9 .... ..3.3 ....... 3.0.

The differences at the paragraph and text levels have a purely rhetorical explanation.
As expected, when one computes the recall and precision figures with respect to the nuclearity and relation assignments, one also factors in the nuclearity status and the rhetorical relation that is associated with each span.
Table 1 summarizes the results (P-D and P-I (R)ecall and (P)recision figures) for each level (Sentence, Paragraph, and Text).
It presents Recall and Precision figures with respect to span assignment, nuclearity status, and rhetorical relation labeling of discourse spans.
The numbers in the "Weighted Average" line report averages of the Sentence-, Paragraph-, and Text-specific figures, weighted according to the number of units at each level.
The numbers in the "All" line reflect recall and precision figures computed across the entire trees, with no attention paid t.o sentence and paragraph boundaries.
Given the significantly different syntactic structures of Japanese and English.
we were not surprised by tile low recall and precision results that reflect the similarity between discourse trees built below the sentence level.
However, as Table 1 shows, there are astonishing differences between discourse trees at the paragraph and text.
levels as well.
For exampie, the Position-Independent figures show that only about 62% of the sentences: and only :about 53% of the hierarchical spans built across sentences could be matched between the two corpora.
When one looks at the nuclearity status and rhetorical relations associated with the spans built across sentences, the P-I recall and precision figures drop to about 43c2~ and :/5~ respectively.
The differences in recall and precision are exl)lained both by differen,-es in the way information is packaged rote paragraphs in the-two languages arid the way it is structured rhetorically both within and above the paragraph level.
4 How
should a multilingual text planner work?
The results in Section 3 strongly suggest that if one is to build text plans in the context of a JapaneseEnglish multilingual generation system, a languageindependent text planning module whose output is mapped straightforwardly into sentence plans (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Goldberg et al., 1994) will not do.
The differences between the rhetorical structures of Japanese and English texts are simply too big to support the derivation of a unique text plan, which would subsume both the Japaneseand Englishspecific realizations.
If we are to build MGEN systems capable of generating rich texts in languages as distant as English and Japanese, we would need to use more sophisticated techniques.
In the rest of this section, we discuss a set of possible approaches, which are consistent with work that has been carried out to date in the NLG field.
4.1 Use
text plan representations that are more abstract than discourse trees Delin et al.(1994) have shown that although tile rhetorical renderings in Figure 1 are non-isomorphic.
dmy are alt subsumed by one .commol~, more.abstract t.ext.-plan representation language that forrealizes the procedural relations of Generation and Enablement (Goldman, 1970).
One caa~ conceive of.
text plans being represented as sequences of actions or hierarchies of actions and goals over which one can identify Generation and Enablement relations that hold between them.
In such a framework, text planning is carried out ill a language-independent manner.
which is then followed by a rhetorical "'fleshing out".
(Delin et al.(1994) have shown how Generation and Enablenlent relations are realized rhetorically in various languages using relations such as PURPOSE, 'SEQUENCE, CONDITION, and MEANS).
Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) suggest that the variability present in Delin et al.'s Rhetorical Struc21 ture analyses in Figure 1 can be explained by the inadequate mixture of intentional and semantic relations, at different levels of granularity.
They propose that discourse phenomena should be accounted for at a more abstract level than RST relations and they present a classification system in terms discourse-tree rewriting module capable of rewriting P-specific discourse structures into O-specific discourse structures.
When generating texts in language P, the MGEN system works as a monolingum generator.
When generating texts in language O, the MGEN system generates a text plan in lanof "stratification", ..'!me£afunction?.,,,and .::p~radig,: ........ guage.-~, xnapsitdr~to.=taaag,uageO.,~ anti,then ~proceeds ..
matic/syntagmatic axiality" that enables one to represent discourse structures at multiple levels of abstraction.
Adopting such an approach could be an extremely rewarding enterprise.
Unfortunately, the research of Delin et al.(1994) and Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) cannot be applied yet to unrestricted domains.
Generation and Enablement are only two of the abstract relations that can hold between actions and goals.
And some texts, such as descriptions, are difficult to characterize only in terms of actions and goals.
Building a "complete" taxonomy of such abstract relations and identifying adequate mappings between there relations and rhetorical relations are still open problems.
4.2 Derive
a language-independent discourse structure, and then linearize it RSsner and Stede (1992) and Stede (1999) assume that a discourse representation g la Mann and Thompson imposes no contraints on the linear order of the leaves.
For tile purpose of multilingual text planning, one can, hence, assume that a languageindependent text planner derives first a languageindependent rhetorical structure and then linearizes it, i.e., transforms it to make it language specific.
The transformations that RSsner and Stede have applied concern primarily re-orderings of the children of some nodes and re-assignment of rhetorical relation labels.
But given, for example, tile significant differences between the discourse structures in Figure 2, it is difficult to envision what the languageindependent text plan might look like.
It is deftnitely possible to conceive of such a text plan representation.
However, the linearization module will need then to be much more sophisticated: it will need to be able to rewrite full structures, re-order constituents, aggregate_across possibly non-adjacent units, etc.
4.3 hnplement a text planning algorithm for one language only.
For all other languages, devise discourse-tree rewriting modules In this approach, the system developer assigns a preferrential status to one of the languages that are to be handled I) 3 ' the MGEN system.
Lot's call this language P.
The system developer implenlents text planning algorithms only for this language.
For any other language O, the developer itnplements a 22 further with the sentence planning and realization stages.
Marcu et al.(2000) present and evaluate a discourse-tree rewriting algorithm that exploits machine learning methods in order to map Japanese discourse trees into discourse trees that resemble English-specific renderings.
The advantage of such an approach is that the tree-rewriting modules can be also used in the context of machine translation systems in order to repackage and re-organize the input text rhetorically, to reflect constraints specific to the target language.
The disadvantage is that, from an NLG perspective, there is no guarantee that such a system could produce better results than a system that implements language-dependent text planning modules.
4.4 Derive
language-dependent text plans Another viable approach is to acknowledge that text plans vary significantly across languages and, therefore, should be derived by language-dependent planners.
To this end, one could use both topdown (How, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993) and bottom-up (Marcu, t997; Mellish et al., 1998) text planning algorithms.
The advantage of this approach is that it has the potential of producing trees that reflect tile peculiarities specific to any language.
The disadvantage is that only the text planning algorithms are general: the plan operators and the rhetorical relations they operate with are languagedependent, and hence, more expensive to develop and maintain.
4.5 Discussion
Depending oil tile languages and text genres it operates with, all MGEN system may get away with a language-independent text planner.
However, for sophisticated genres and distant languages, implementing a language-independent planner that is straightforwardly'mapped i:nto sentence, plans does not appear to be a felicitous solution.
We enumerated four possible alternatives for addressing the text planning problem in an MGEN system.
Each of tile approaches has its own pluses and minuses.
Which will eventually win in large-scale deployable MGEN systems remains an open question.
