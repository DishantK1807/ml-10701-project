Future work comprises further probing into machine learning techniques, in particular investigating whether other learning algorithms are more appropriate for our problem (Mooney, 1996), especially algorithms that take into account some a priori knowledge about features and their dependencies.

Note that the notion of core is related to the notions of nucleus in RST, intended effect in (Young and Moore, 1994), and of point of a move in (Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), and that text generators representing these notions exist.

For each contributor, one analyzes its relation to the core from an intentional perspective, i.e., how it is intended to support the core, and from an informational perspective, i.e., how its content relates to that 1For more detail about the RDA coding scheme see (Moser and Moore, 1995; Moser and Moore, 1997).

It synthesizes ideas from (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) and from RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988).

Moser and Moore (1995; 1997) coded a corpus of naturally occurring tutorial explanations for the range of features identified in prior work.

Previous research (Hobbs, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Schiffrin, 1987; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), which has been largely descriptive, suggests factors such as structural features of the discourse (e.g., level of embedding and segment complexity), intentional and informational relations in that structure, ordering of relata, and syntactic form of discourse constituents.

An important result pointed out by (Moser and Moore, 1995) is that cue placement depends on core position.

80 2 Related Work McKeown and Elhadad (1991; 1990) studied severai connectives (e.g., but, since, because), and include many insightful hypotheses about cue selection; their observation that the distinction between but and Â¢lthoug/~ depends on the point of the move is related to the notion of core discussed below.

Prior work in text generation has focused on cue selection (McKeown and Elhadad, 1991; Elhadad and McKeown, 1990), or on the relation between *Learning Research & Development Center tComputer Science Department, and Learning Research ~z Development Center tlntelllgent Systems Program cue occurrence and placement and specific rhetorical structures (RSsner and Stede, 1992; Scott and de Souza, 1990; Vander Linden and Martin, 1995).

The work of Elhadad (1990) and Knott (1996) will help in answering this question.

They play a crucial role in many discourse processing tasks, including plan recognition (Litman and Allen, 1987), text comprehension (Cohen, 1984; Hobbs, 1985; Mann and Thompson, 1986; Reichman-Adar, 1984), and anaphora resolution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
