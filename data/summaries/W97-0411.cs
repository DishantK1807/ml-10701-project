However, we have found that the amount of work involved in developing new grammars for Swedish, French, Spanish and most recently Danish has always been at least an order of magnitude less than the effort required for the original grammar (Gambgck and Rayner, 1992; Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1996; Rayner, Carter et al, 1997).

* An automatic tuning of the grammar to the domain using the technique of ExplanationBased Learning (van Harmelen and Bundy, 1988; Rayner, 1988; Samuelsson and Rayner, 1991; Rayner and Carter, 1996).

Robustness in the face of ill-formed input and recognition errors is tackled by means of a "multiengine" strategy (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994; Rayner and Carter, 1997), combining two different translation methods.

The current SLT system carries out multilingual speech translation in near real time in the ATIS domain (Hemphill et al., 1990) for several language pairs.

We tackle the N-squared problem by means of transfer composition (Rayner, Carter and Bouillon, 1996; Rayner, Carter et al, 1997).

Removing these constituents significantly constrains the search space and speeds up parsing (Rayner and Carter, 1997).

This, together with the use of representative subcorpora (Rayner, Bouillon and Carter, 1995) to allow structurally equivalent sentences to be represented by a single example, means that a corpus of many thousands of sentences can be judged in just a few person weeks.

(3) The statistical information used in analysis is entirely derived from the results of supervised training on corpora carried out using the TreeBanker (Carter, 1997), a graphical tool that presents a non-expert user with a display of the salient differences between alternative analyses in order that the correct one may be identified.

On the other side of the coin, the main domaindependent aspects of a linguistic description are t E.g. in our initial extension from English to languages with more complicated morphology, which necessitated the development of a morphological processor based on the two-level formalism (see (Carter, 1995)).

These points will be discussed in the context of the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) (Rayner, Alshawi eta/, 1993; Agn~s et al., 1994; Rayner and Carter, 1997), a customizable speech translator built as a pipelined sequence of generalpurpose components.
