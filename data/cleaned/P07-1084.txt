But for bilingual terminology mining, and for many language pairs, large comparable corpora are not available.
More importantly, as terms are defined vis-à-vis a specific domain with a restricted register, it is expected that the quality rather than the quantity of the corpus matters more in terminology mining.
Our hypothesis, therefore, is that the quality of the corpus is more important than the quantity and ensures the quality of the acquired terminological resources.
We show how important the type of discourse is as a characteristic of the comparable corpus.
1 Introduction
Two main approaches exist for compiling corpora: “Big is beautiful” or “Insecurity in large collections”.
Text mining research commonly adopts the first approach and favors data quantity over quality.
This is normally justified on the one hand by the need for large amounts of data in order to make use of statistic or stochastic methods (Manning and Schütze, 1999), and on the other by the lack of operational methods to automatize the building of a corpus answering to selected criteria, such as domain, register, media, style or discourse.
For lexical alignment from comparable corpora, good results on single words can be obtained from large corpora — several millions words — the accuracy of proposed translation is about 80% for the top 10-20 candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002).
(Cao and Li, 2002) have achieved 91% accuracy for the top three candidates using the Web as a comparable corpus.
But for specific domains, and many pairs of languages, such huge corpora are not available.
More importantly, as terms are defined vis-à-vis a specific domain with a restricted register, it is expected that the quality rather than the quantity of the corpus matters more in terminology mining.
For terminology mining, therefore, our hypothesis is that the quality of the corpora is more important than the quantity and that this ensures the quality of the acquired terminological resources.
Comparable corpora are “sets of texts in different languages, that are not translations of each other” (Bowker and Pearson, 2002, p.
93). The term comparable is used to indicate that these texts share some characteristics or features: topic, period, media, author, register (Biber, 1994), discourse...
This corpus comparability is discussed by lexical alignment researchers but never demonstrated: it is often reduced to a specific domain, such as the medical (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or financial domains (Fung, 1998), or to a register, such as newspaper articles (Fung, 1998).
For terminology 664 mining, the comparability of the corpus should be based on the domain or the sub-domaine, but also on the type of discourse.
Indeed, discourse acts semantically upon the lexical units.
For a defined topic, some terms are specific to one discourse or another.
For example, for French, within the subdomain of obesity in the domain of medicine, we find the term excès de poids (overweight) only inside texts sharing a popular science discourse, and the synonym excès pondéral (overweight) only in scientific discourse.
In order to evaluate how important the discourse criterion is for building bilingual terminological lists, we carried out experiments on French-Japanese comparable corpora in the domain of medicine, more precisely on the topic of diabetes and nutrition, using texts collected from the Web and manually selected and classified into two discourse categories: one contains only scientific documents and the other contains both scientific and popular science documents.
We used a state-of-the-art multilingual terminology mining chain composed of two term extraction programs, one in each language, and an alignment program.
The term extraction programs are publicly available and both extract multi-word terms that are more precise and specific to a particular scientific domain than single word terms.
The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Peters and Picchi, 1998; Rapp, 1999) slightly modified to handle both singleand multi-word terms.
We evaluated the candidate translations of multi-word terms using a reference list compiled from publicly available resources.
We found that taking discourse type into account resulted in candidate translations of a better quality even when the corpus size is reduced by half.
Thus, even using a state-of-the-art alignment method wellknown as data greedy, we reached the conclusion that the quantity of data is not sufficient to obtain a terminological list of high quality and that a real comparability of corpora is required.
2 Multilingual
terminology mining chain Taking as input a comparable corpora, the multilingual terminology chain outputs a list of singleand multi-word candidate terms along with their candidate translations.
Its architecture is summarized in Figure 1 and comprises term extraction and alignment programs.
2.1 Term
extraction programs The terminology extraction programs are available for both French1 (Daille, 2003) and Japanese2 (Takeuchi et al., 2004).
The terminological units that are extracted are multi-word terms whose syntactic patterns correspond either to a canonical or a variation structure.
The patterns are expressed using part-of-speech tags: for French, Brill’s POS tagger3 and the FLEM lemmatiser4 are utilised, and for Japanese, CHASEN5.
For French, the main patterns are N N, N Prep N et N Adj and for Japanese, N N, N Suff, Adj N and Pref N.
The variants handled are morphological for both languages, syntactical only for French, and compounding only for Japanese.
We consider as a morphological variant a morphological modification of one of the components of the base form, as a syntactical variant the insertion of another word into the components of the base form, and as a compounding variant the agglutination of another word to one of the components of the base form.
For example, in French, the candidate MWT sécrétion d’insuline (insulin secretion) appears in the following forms: a0 base form of N Prep N pattern: sécrétion d’insuline (insulin secretion); a0 inflexional variant: sécrétions d’insuline (insulin secretions); a0 syntactic variant (insertion inside the base form of a modifier): sécrétion pancréatique d’insuline (pancreatic insulin secretion); a0 syntactic variant (expansion coordination of base form): secrétion de peptide et d’insuline (insulin and peptide secretion).
The MWT candidates secrétion insulinique (insulin secretion) and hypersécrétion insulinique (insulin 1http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/ info/perso/permanents/daille/ and release LINUX.

In Japanese, the MWT a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a7a1.a8a10a9 6 (insulin secretion) appears in the following forms: a0 base form of NN pattern: a0a11a1a11a3a12a5a13a1 /N a14 .a8 a9 /Na15 (insulin secretion); a0 compounding variant (agglutination of a word at the end of the base form): a0a16a1a17a3 a5a18a1 /N a14 .a8a19a9 /Na15 .a20a22a21 /Na23 (insulin secretion ability) At present, the Japanese term extraction program does not cluster terms.
2.2 Term
alignment The lexical alignment program adapts the direct context-vector approach proposed by (Fung, 1998) for single-word terms (SWTs) to multi-word terms (MWTs).
It aligns source MWTs with target single 6For all Japanese examples, we explicitly segment the compound into its component parts through the use of the “.” symbol.
words, SWTs or MWTs.
From now on, we will refer to lexical units as words, SWTs or MWTs.
2.2.1 Implementation
of the direct context-vector method Our implementation of the direct context-vector method consists of the following 4 steps: 1.
We collect all the lexical units in the context of each lexical unit a24 and count their occurrence frequency in a window of a25 words around a24 . For each lexical unit a24 of the source and the target language, we obtain a context vector a26a28a27 which gathers the set of co-occurrence units a29 associated with the number of times that a29 and a24 occur together a30a32a31a33a31 a27a34 . We normalise context vectors using an association score such as Mutual Information or Log-likelihood.
In order to reduce the arity of context vectors, we keep only the co-occurrences with the highest association scores.
2. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the lexical units of the source context vector.
666 3.
For a word to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Cosine (Salton and Lesk, 1968) or Jaccard (Tanimoto, 1958).
4. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units closest to the translated context vector according to vector distance.
2.2.2 Translation
of lexical units The translation of the lexical units of the context vectors, which depends on the coverage of the bilingual dictionary vis-à-vis the corpus, is an important step of the direct approach: more elements of the context vector are translated more the context vector will be discrimating for selecting translations in the target language.
If the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for a lexical unit, we consider all of them but weight the different translations by their frequency in the target language.
If an MWT cannot be directly translated, we generate possible translations by using a compositional method (Grefenstette, 1999).
For each element of the MWT found in the bilingual dictionary, we generate all the translated combinations identified by the term extraction program.
For example, in the case of the MWT fatigue chronique (chronic fatigue), we have the following four translations for fatigue: a0a2a1, a0a4a3, a5a7a6, a8a10a9 and the following two translations for chronique: a11a13a12a15a14a17a16, a18a20a19 . Next, we generate all combinations of translated elements (See Table 17) and select those which refer to an existing MWT in the target language.
Here, only one term has been identified by the Japanese terminology extraction program: a18a21a19 .a0a22a3 . In this approach, when it is not possible to translate all parts of an MWT, or when the translated combinations are not identified by the term extraction program, the MWT is not taken into account in the translation process.
This approach differs from that used by (Robitaille et al., 2006) for French/Japanese translation.
They first decompose the French MWT into combinations of shorter multi-word units (MWU) elements.
This approach makes the direct translation of a subpart of the MWT possible if it is present in the 7the French word order is inverted to take into account the different constraints between French and Japanese.

bilingual dictionary.
For an MWT of length a25, (Robitaille et al., 2006) produce all the combinations of MWU elements of a length less than or equal to a25 . For example, the French term syndrome de fatigue chronique (chronic fatigue disease) yields the following four combinations: i) a27syndrome de fatigue chroniquea28, ii) a27syndrome de fatiguea28a29a27chroniquea28, iii) a27syndromea28a30a27fatigue chroniquea28 and iv) a27syndromea28 a27fatiguea28a31a27chroniquea28 . We limit ourselves to the combination of type iv) above since 90% of the candidate terms provided by the term extraction process, after clustering, are only composed of two content words.
3 Linguistic
resources In this section we outline the different textual resources used for our experiments: the comparable corpora, bilingual dictionary and reference lexicon.
3.1 Comparable
corpora The French and Japanese documents were harvested from the Web by native speakers of each language who are not domain specialists.
The texts are from the medical domain, within the sub-domain of diabetes and nutrition.
Document harvesting was carried out by a domain-based search, then by manual selection.
The search for documents sharing the same domain can be achieved using keywords reflecting the specialized domain: for French, diabète and obésité (diabetes and obesity); for Japanese, a32 a33a24a34 and a35a13a36 . Then the documents were classified according to the type of discourse: scientific or popularized science.
At present, the selection and classification phases are carried out manually although 667 research into how to automatize these two steps is ongoing.
Table 2 shows the main features of the harvested comparable corpora: the number of documents, and the number of words for each language and each type of discourse.

3.2 Bilingual
dictionary The French-Japanese bilingual dictionary required for the translation phase is composed of four dictionaries freely available from the Web8, and of the French-Japanese Scientific Dictionary (1989).
It contains about 173,156 entries (114,461 single words and 58,695 multi words) with an average of 2.1 translations per entry.
3.3 Terminology
reference lists To evaluate the quality of the terminology mining chain, we built two bilingual terminology reference lists which include either SWTs or SMTs and MWTs: a0 a27lexicon 1a28 100 French SWTs of which the translation are Japanese SWTs.
a0 a27lexicon 2a28 60 French SWTs and MWTs of which the translation could be Japanese SWTs or MWTs.

php, http://quebec-japon.com/lexique/index.
php?a=index&d=3 These lexicons contains terms that occur at least twice in the scientific corpus, have been identified monolingually by both the French and the Japanese term extraction programs, and are found in either the UMLS9 thesaurus or in the French part of the Grand dictionnaire terminologique10 in the domain of medicine.
These constraints prevented us from obtaining 100 French SWTs and MWTs for lexicon 2.
The main reasons for this are the small number of UMLS terms dealing with the sub-domain of diabetes and the great difference between the linguistic structures of French and Japanese terms: French pattern definitions tend to cover more phrasal units while Japanese pattern definitions focus more narrowly on compounds.
So, even if monolingually the same percentage of terms are detected in both languages, this does not guarantee a good result in bilingual terminology extraction.
For example, the French term diabète de type 1 (Diabetes mellitus type I) extracted by the French term extraction program and found in UMLS was not extracted by the Japanese term extraction program although it appears frequently in the Japanese corpus ( a0 a1 a32 a33 a34 ).
In bilingual terminology mining from specialized comparable corpora, the terminology reference lists are often composed of a hundred words (180 SWTs in (Déjean and Gaussier, 2002) and 97 SWTs in (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002)).
4 Experiments
In order to evaluate the influence of discourse type on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction, two experiments were carried out.
Since the main studies relating to bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora concentrate on finding translation candidates for SWTs, we first perform an experiment using a27lexicon 1a28, which is composed of SWTs.
In order to evaluate the hypothesis of this study, we then conducted a second experiment using a27lexicon 2a28, which is composed of MWTs.
4.1 Alignment
results for a27lexicon 1a28 Table 3 shows the results obtained.
The first three columns indicate the number of translations found 9http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls 10http://www.granddictionnaire.com/ 668 a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11 a13a15a14a17a16a19a18a21a20a8a11 a22a24a23a26a25a27a25a27a28a29a14a30a18a21a20a8a11 a23a32a31a34a33 a14a36a35 a23a32a31a34a33 a15a8a35 a27scientific corporaa28 64 11.6 20.2 49 52 a27mixed corporaa28 76 11.5 16.3 51 60 Table 3: Bilingual terminology extraction results for a27lexicon 1a28 a0a2a1 a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11 a13a15a14a17a16 a18a21a20a8a11 a22a24a23a26a25a27a25a27a28a29a14 a18a21a20a8a11 a23a32a31a34a33 a14a36a35 a23a32a31a34a33 a15a8a35 a27scientific corporaa28 32 16.1 21.9 18 25 a27mixed corporaa28 32 23.9 27.6 17 20 Table 4: Bilingual terminology extraction results for a27lexicon 2a28 (a0a2a1 a3a6a5a8a7a37a9a38a11 ), and the average (a13a15a14a17a16 a18a21a20a8a11 ) and standard deviation (a22a24a23a26a25a27a25a39a28a17a14 a18a21a20a8a11 ) positions for the translations in the ranked list of candidate translations.
The other two columns indicate the percentage of French terms for which the correct translation was obtained among the top ten and top twenty candidates (a23a15a31a15a33 a14a36a35,a23a32a31a34a33 a15a8a35 ).
The results of this experiment (see Table 3) show that the terms belonging to a27lexicon 1a28 were more easily identified in the corpus of scientific and popular documents (51% and 60% respectively for a23a32a31a34a33 a14a36a35 and a23a32a31a15a33 a15a8a35 ) than in the corpus of scientific documents (49% and 52%).
Since a27lexicon 1a28 is composed of SWTs, these terms are not more characteristic of popular discourse than scientific discourse.
The frequency of the terms to be translated is an important factor in the vectorial approach.
In fact, the higher the frequency of the term to be translated, the more the associated context vector will be discriminant.
Table 5 confirms this hypothesis since the most frequent terms, such as insuline (#occ.
364 insulin: a0a18a1 a3 a5 a1 ), obésité (#occ.
333 obesity: a35a13a36 ), and prévention (#occ.
120 prevention: a40a42a41 ), were the best translated.

For single-item French-English words applied on a medical corpus of 0.66 million words, (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) obtained 61% and 94% precision on the top-10 and top-20 candidates.
In our case, we obtained 51% and 60% precision for the top 10 and 20 candidates in a 1.5 million-word French/Japanese corpus.
4.2 Alignment
results for a27lexicon 2a28 The analysis results in table 4 indicate only a small number of the terms in a27lexicon 2a28 were found.
Since we work with small-size corpora, this result is not surprising.
Because multi-word terms are more specific than single-word terms, they tend to occur less frequently in a corpus and are more difficult to translate.
Here, the terms belonging a27lexicon 2a28 were more accurately identified from the corpus which consists of scientific documents than the corpus which consists of scientific and popular documents.
In this instance, we obtained 30% and 42% precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a 0.84 million-word scientific corpus.
Moreover, if we count the number of terms which are correctly translated between a27scientific corporaa28 and a27mixed corporaa28, we find the majority of the translated terms with a27mixed corporaa28 in those obtained with a27scientific corporaa28 11 By combining parameters 11Here, a43a24a44a46a45a48a47a50a49a52a51a8a53a55a54a56a51a10a57a59a58a60a51a10a61, a43a24a44a46a45a63a62a64a49a10a65a52a61a66a54a17a65a37a67a59a58a68a51a69a53 and a70a32a71a24a72a74a73a76a75a69a77a37a78 a65a79a54 a78 a65a46a58a80a65a37a53 . 669 a67 a61 a51a8a67 a51a8a61 a65 a67 a65a52a61 a67 a61 a51a69a67 a51a8a61 a65a37a67 a65 a61 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 a1 × × × × × × × nbr.

11 feeding preferences: a21a15a22 .a23 a24 ), or very low frequency, such as obésité massive (#occ.

Our claim was that a real comparability of the corpora is required to obtain relevant terms of the domain.
This comparability should be based not only on the domain and the sub-domain but also on the type of discourse, which acts semantically upon the lexical units.
The discourse categorization of documents allows lexical acquisition to increase pre670 cision despite the data sparsity problem that is often encountered for terminology mining and for language pairs not involving the English language, such as French-Japanese.
We carried out experiments using two corpora of the specialised domain concerning diabetes and nutrition: one gathering documents from both scientific and popular science discourses, the other limited to scientific discourse.
Our alignment results are close to previous works involving the English language, and are of better quality for the scientific corpus despite a corpus size that was reduced by half.
The results demonstrate that the more frequent a term and its translation, the better the quality of the alignment will be, but also that the data sparsity problem could be partially solved by using comparable corpora of high quality.
