Whereas Hockenmaier’s parser is trained on (normal-form) CCG derivations, Clark and Curran (2003) present a CCG parser trained on the dependency structures within parsed sentences, as well as the possible derivations for them, using a log-linear (MaximumEntropy) model.

• The parser only used a subset of CCG – pure CCG (Eisner, 1996) – consisting of the Application and Composition rules.

The parser used is straightforward implementation of the normal-form CCG parser presented by Eisner (1996).

In particular, Hockenmaier and Steedman (2001) report a generative model for CCG parsing roughly akin to the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) specific to CCG.
