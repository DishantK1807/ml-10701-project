<context>extract this new isa-relation we initially considered the idea of exploiting the patents’ corpus, but we discarded it later, for two main reasons: 1) in limited corpora this relation is not frequent (Caraballo, 1999); and 2) in the patents’ domain, it is not uncommon that new definitions for terms are given with a local scope. As an alternative, we decided to extract isa-relations using lexico-syntactic patterns</context>
