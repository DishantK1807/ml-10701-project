Fujii and Ishikawa (2004) have shown how it is possible to identify de nitions semi automatically, however these sources are not as standard as dictionaries and thus harder to parse using only regular expressions.

The output is written in Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2001).

An MRS consists of a bag of labeled elementary predicates and their arguments, a list of scoping constraints, and a pair of relations that provide a hook into the representation | a label, which must outscope all the handles, and an index (Copestake et al., 2001).

This con ation has caused problems in applications such as question answering as well as in fundamental research on linking syntax and semantics (Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson, 2002).

The basic method has a long pedigree (Copestake, 1990; Tsurumaru et al., 1991; Rigau et al., 1997).
P97-1007
For other languages, early work for English linked senses exploiting dictionary domain codes and other heuristics (Copestake, 1990), and more recent work links senses for Spanish and French using more general WSD techniques (Rigau et al., 1997).
P97-1007
Other heuristics have been proposed by Rigau et al.(1997). Another way is to use the thesaurus to predict which words name explicit relationships which need to be extracted separately (like abbreviation).

net/). We use this parser to parse the de ning sentences into a full meaning representation using minimal recursion semantics (MRS: Copestake et al.(2001)). 3 Ontology Extraction In this section we present our work on creating an ontology.

Hinoki Treebank In order to produce semantic representations we are using an open source HPSG grammar of Japanese: JACY (Siegel and Bender, 2002), which we have extended to cover the dictionary de nition sentences (Bond et al., 2004).
