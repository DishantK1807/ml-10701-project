Grishman & Sterling (1992), Poznanski & Sanfilippo (1993), Resnik (1993), Ribas (1994) and others have shown that it is possible to acquire selection preferences from (partially) parsed data.

In a recent experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system utilizing a lexicalist grammatical framework, Briscoe & Carroll (1993) observed that half of parse failures on unseen test data were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the ANLT dictionary.

the Alvey NL Tools (ANLT) dictionary, Boguraev et al.(1987); the COMLEX Syntax dictionary, Grishman et al.(1994)). Unfortunately, neither approach can yield a genuinely accurate or comprehensive computational lexicon, because both rest ultimately on the manual efforts of lexicographers / linguists and are, therefore, prone to errors of omission and commission which are hard or impossible to detect automatically (e.g.

Our approach to acquiring subcategorization classes is predicated on the following assumptions: • most sentences will not allow the application of all possible rules of English complementation; • some sentences will be unambiguous even given the indeterminacy of the grammar4; 3Brent (1993:249-253) provides a detailed explanation and justification for the use of this measure.

The resulting set of putative classes for a predicate are filtered, following Brent (1993), 358 by hypothesis testing on binomial frequency data.

Manning (1993) conducts a larger experiment, also using a PoS tagged corpus and a finite-state NP parser, attempting to recognize sixteen distinct complementation patterns.

Ta represents a text adjunct delimited by commas (Nunberg 1990; Briscoe ~ Carroll, 1994).

Work Brent's (1993) approach to acquiring subcategorization is based on a philosophy of only exploiting unambiguous and determinate information in unanalysed corpora.

Over the existing test corpus this is not statisti5Carroll & Briscoe (1996) use the same test set, although the baseline results reported here differ slightly due to differences in the mapping from parse trees to Susanne-compatible bracketings.

Moreover, although Schabes (1992) and others have proposed 'lexicalized' probabilistic grammars to improve the accuracy of parse ranking, no wide-coverage parser has yet been constructed incorporating probabilities of different subcategorizations for individual predicates, because of the problems of accurately estimating them.

3. A probabilistic LR parser, trained on a treebank, returns ranked analyses (Briscoe &: Carroll, 1993; Carroll, 1993, 1994), using a grammar written in a feature-based unification grammar formalism which assigns 'shallow' phrase structure analyses to tag networks (or 'lattices') returned by the tagger (Briscoe & Carroll, 1994, 1995; Carroll & Briscoe, 1996).

Developing an analogous system for another language would be harder but not infeasible; similar taggers and parsers have been developed for a number of languages, but no extant subcategorization dictionaries exist to our knowledge, therefore the lexical statistics we utilize for statistical filtering would need to be estimated, perhaps using the technique described by Brent (1993).

A tagger, a first-order HMM part-of-speech (PoS) and punctuation tag disambiguator, is used to assign and rank tags for each word and punctuation token in sequences of sentences (Elworthy, 1994).

Preliminary experiments acquiring a few 356 verbal subcategorization classes have been reported by Brent (1991, 1993), Manning (1993), and Ushioda et al.(1993). In these experiments the maximum number of distinct subcategorization classes recognized is sixteen, and only Ushioda et al.attempt to derive relative subcategorization frequency for individual predicates.
