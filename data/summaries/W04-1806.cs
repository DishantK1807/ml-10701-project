For example, based on (Caraballo 1999), each parent of a leaf node could be viewed as a cluster label for its children, with the weight of a parent-child link being determined based on how strongly the child is associated with the cluster.

We use the log likelihood ratio (LLR) (Dunning 1993) given by -2log 2 (H o (p;k 1,n 1,k 2,n 2 )/H a (p 1,p 2 ;n 1,k 1,n 2,k 2 )) LLR measures the extent to which a hypothesized model of the distribution of cell counts, H a, differs from the null hypothesis, H o (namely, that the percentage of documents containing this term is the same in both corpora).

For example, the cue-phrase “such as” (Hearst 1992) (Caraballo 1999) suggest a kind-of relation, e.g., ‘a ligand such as triethylphosphine’ tells us that ‘triethylphosphene’ is a kind of ‘ligand’.

Automatic comparison of a machine-generated ontology against reference ontologies constructed by humans, e.g., (Zhang et al.1996) (Sekine et al.1999) (Daude et al.2001), is therefore desirable, provided suitable reference ontologies are available.

The existing approaches to ontology induction include those that start from structured data, merging ontologies or database schemas (Doan et al.2002). Other approaches use natural language data, sometimes just by analyzing the corpus (Sanderson and Croft 1999), (Caraballo 1999) or by learning to expand WordNet with clusters of terms from a corpus, e.g., (Girju et al.2003). Information extraction approaches that infer labeled relations either require substantial handcreated linguistic or domain knowledge, e.g., (Craven and Kumlien 1999) (Hull and Gomez 1993), or require human-annotated training data with relation information for each domain (Craven et al.1998). The number of relations in H that our system missed (relations that were more than distance 1 away in the system ontology), is 3493.
