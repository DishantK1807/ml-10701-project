Various methods of creating detailed entries have been suggested, such as the extraction of candidates from corpora (Manning, 1993; Utsuro et al., 1997; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001), and the automatic and semi-automatic induction of semantic constraints (Akiba et al., 2000).

Our work di ers from corpus-based work such as Manning (1993) or Kawahara and Kurohashi (2001) in that we are using existing lexical resources rather than a corpus.
