The components of LMT dealing specifically with translation do not index into the grammar rules, as, for example, in the LRC system (Bennett and Slocum 1985).

ATTACHMENT A second improvement in ModL concerns preference attachment of postmodifiers in the sense of Wilks, Huang and Fass (1985), and Huang (1984a, 1984b).

McCord \]Design of LMT: A Prolog-Based Machine Translation System sions in a logical form language (LFL) (McCord 1985a, 1987).

Prior to the development of Prolog, Alain Colmerauer worked in the period 1967-70 on a machine translation project, the TAUM project--Traduction Automatique Universit6 de Montr6al (Colmerauer et al.1971, Kittredge, Boutbeau and Isabelle 1973, Isabelle and Bourbeau 1985).

For more discussion of the practicality of a syntactic transfer method, see Bennett and Slocum (1985).
J85-2002
Bracketing with ordinary parentheses is treated in the LRC system (Bennett and Slocum 1985) by reliance on LISP's handling of parentheses.

In fact, this grammar produces logical forms that can be used for other applications such as database query systems and knowledge-based systems, and has been used in the systems described in McCord (1982, 1987), Teeple (1985), Bernth (1988), and Dahlgren (1988).
P85-1013
The existing syntax rules for nt are compiled essentially as in McCord (1985a), but the name given to the head predicate is changed to ntbase, representing the simple (noncoordinated, nonbracketed) form of the phrase.
P85-1013
Many of the ingredients have been described previously (McCord 1981, 1982, 1985a, 1987), so the background description given here is abbreviated (but fairly self-contained), and the emphasis is on new ingredients.
P85-1013
A modular logic grammar (MLG) (McCord 1985a, 1987) has a syntactic component (with rules written in a certain formalism), and a separate semantic interpretation component (using a certain methodology).
P85-1013
Also an interface of LMT to a lexical data base (Neff, Byrd, Rizk 1988) for the Collins English-German Dictionary has been partially developed by Susanne Wolff and the author.
A88-1012
For a description of the way MLG semantic interpretation works, see McCord (1985a, 1987).
P85-1013
For example, LFL expressions for degree adjectives like "good" are focalizers (McCord 1985a, 1987), where the base argument shows the base of comparison for the adjective.
P85-1013
In the logic programming framework, treatments include those in Dahl and McCord (1983), Sedogbo (1984), and Hirschman (1986).

In the following discussion, the one-pass mode will be ignored--for details, see McCord (1985a, 1987).
