Drawing on the feature sets used in Connolly et al.(1997) and Ge et al.(1998), we believe the following factors might indicate co-referenco: • Syntactic role (e.g.

So, we view boundaries between dialog acts as one class and non-boundaries as the other (see Passonneau & Litman (1997) for a similar practice).

A model-theoretic algorithm proposed by Vilain et al.(1995) uses these Co-referenc e classes to define a precision and recall metric which yields intuitively plausible results and is easy to calculate.

Problematic issues in spoken dialog include • the determination of the center of attention in multiparty discourse; • utterances with no discourse entities; • abandoned or partial utterances, interruptions, speech repa!rs; • the determination of utterance boundaries; • the high frequency of discourse deictic and vague anaphora (Eckert & Slmbe, 1999).
