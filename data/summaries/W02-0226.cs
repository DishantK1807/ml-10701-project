Later developments of plan-based dialogue models include multilevel plan extension (Litman and Allen, 1987; Litman and Allen, 1990; Carberry, 1990; Lambert and Carberry, 1991), theories of joint action (Cohen and Levesque, 1991) and SharedPlan (Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Grosz and Kraus, 1996).

This makes it different from others using surface features like (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

Some of the problems are discussed in (Jurafsky et al., 1998; Stolcke et al., 2000; Jurafsky and Martin, 2000; Jurafsky, 2002).

DITE or frame-based, with no explicit dialogue model, but task is explicitly represented as a frame or a form (Goddeau et al., 1996), a task description table (Lin et al., 1998), a topic forest (Wu et al., 2000), or an agenda (Xu and Rudnicky, 2000), etc.

To test the reliability of group segmentation within GDM-IS, we calculate the kappa coefficient (C3) 8 (Carletta, 1996; Carletta et al., 1997; Flammia, 1998) to measure pairwise agreement between the subject and the expert.

link dialogue acts to utterances, three problems 5 must be addressed at the same time: AF Dialogue act classification scheme and its reliability in coding corpus, (Carletta et al., 1997; Allen and Core, 1997; Traum, 1999); AF Choice of features/cues that can support automatic dialogue act identification, including lexical, syntactic, prosodic, collocational, and discourse cues; AF A model that correlates dialogue acts with those features.
