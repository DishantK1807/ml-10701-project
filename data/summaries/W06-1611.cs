In contrast, the majority of the previous work either ignores this contextual information (Möller, 2005a; Walker et al., 2000) or makes limited use of the 85 discourse structure hierarchy by flattening it (Walker et al., 2001) (Section 5).

Also, previous studies have shown that tutoring specific parameters can improve the quality of SDS performance models that model the learning gain (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006).
N06-1034
Similar approximations of the discourse structure are also common for other SDS tasks like predictive models of speech recognition problems (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004).
P04-1044
Also, while a human annotation of the discourse structure will be more complex but more time consuming (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Levow, 2004), its advantages are outweighed by the automatic nature of our discourse structure annotation.
P96-1038 W04-2318
structure We base our annotation of discourse structure on the Grosz & Sidner theory of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).

Previous work (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006) has suc88 cessfully used student learning as the performance metric in the PARADISE framework.

Also, note that the inclusion of student certainty in the final PARADISE model provides additional support to a hypothesis that has gained a lot of attention lately: detecting and responding to student emotions has the potential to improve learning (Craig et al., 2004; Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2005; Pon-Barry et al., 2006).

A notable exception is the DATE dialogue act annotation from (Walker et al., 2001).
P01-1066
In our previous work (Rotaru and Litman, 2006), we per90 formed an analysis of the rejected student turns and studied how rejections affect the student state.

The discourse structure hierarchy has been shown to be useful for other tasks: understanding specific lexical and prosodic phenomena (Hirschberg and Nakatani, 1996; Levow, 2004), natural language generation (Hovy, 1993), predictive/generative models of postural shifts (Cassell et al., 2001), and essay scoring (Higgins et al., 2004).

In our case, we show that instead of looking at the user state in isolation (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006), combining it with the discourse structure transition can generate informative interaction parameters.
N06-1034
work Previous work has proposed a large number of interaction parameters for SDS performance modeling (Möller, 2005a; Walker et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2001).
P01-1066
Our annotation for discourse structure and student state has been performed on a corpus of 95 experimentally obtained spoken tutoring dialogues between 20 students and our system ITSPOKE (Litman and Silliman, 2004).
N04-3002
A tutoring SDS (Litman and Silliman, 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2004) has to discuss concepts, laws and relationships and to engage in complex subdialogues to correct student misconceptions.
N04-3002
We also want to see if our results hold for performance metrics based on user satisfaction questionnaires; in the new ITSPOKE corpus we are currently annotating, each student also completed a user satisfaction survey (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006) similar to the one used in the DARPA Communicator multi-site evaluation (Walker et al., 2002).
N06-1034
The performance of our best model is comparable or higher than training performances reported in previous work (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006; Möller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2001).
N06-1034 P01-1066
Finally, similar to (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2006), we are tackling a more problematic performance metric: the student learning gain.
