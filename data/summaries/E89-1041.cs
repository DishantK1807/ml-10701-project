These include the kind of structural correspondence used for relating syntax and semantics in recent work on LFG (Halvorsen 1987, Kaplan & Halvorsen 1988, Kaplan, Netter, Wedekind & Zaenen 1989) and also bilingual lexical entries as in Beaven & Whitelock (1988).

This discussion will be based on an MT prototype under development at ISSCO Geneva (Johnson et al.1988) which employs a grammar development tool for unification grammars known as UD, or Unification Device (Johnson & Rosner 1989).

On the surface, the space for interaction between these two fields would seem fairly limited, and in practice the the application of formal semantics in MT has been very limited, a notable exception being the Rosetta project (Landsbergen 1982, 1987).

fin Kaplan et al.(1989) translation relations are predominantly defined in terms of a projection x across fstructures and the semantic projection is referred to as 'g).

One obvious point of reference in 312 considering relations between attributevalue graphs is the kind of lexical rule found in PATR type environments (Shieber 1984, Karttunen 1986).
C86-1016 P84-1075
It is usually assumed that there is a direct relationship between the complexity of the transfer operations and the level of abstraction of the representations; some of the issues involved in this trade-off are discussed in Krauwer & des Tombe (1984).
P84-1099
Before considering some more recent developments associated with Situation Semantics, it will be useful to sketch some of the distinctions between this theory and more traditional semantic theories, such as Montague Semantics, with particular reference to the implications that these may have for an MT methodology, as in Landsbergen's Rosetta (Landsbergen 1982, 1987).
C82-1028
The limit case is where the representations are sufficiently abstract that transfer becomes vacuous: this is exemplified by the interlingual approach adopted in Rosetta (Landsbergen 1982).
