Among these methods, the one using Naïve Bayesian Ensemble (i.e., an ensemble of Naïve Bayesian Classifiers) is reported to perform the best for word sense disambiguation with respect to a benchmark data set (Pedersen 2000).

This implementation is exactly the one proposed in (Yarowsky 1995), and we will denote it as MB-D hereafter.

2: Yarowsky’s Words We also conducted translation on seven of the twelve English words studied in (Yarowsky, 1995).

Note that the results of MB-D here cannot be directly compared with those in (Yarowsky, 1995), mainly because the data used are different.

This way of creating classified data is similar to that in (Yarowsky, 1995).

It also adopts the heuristics of ‘one sense per discourse’ (Gale et al.1992b) to further classify unclassified sentences.

They include those using Naïve Bayes (Gale et al.1992a), Decision List (Yarowsky 1994), Nearest Neighbor (Ng and Lee 1996), Transformation Based Learning (Mangu and Brill 1997), Neural Network (Towell and 1 In this paper, we take English-Chinese translation as example; it is a relatively easy process, however, to extend the discussions to translations between other language pairs.

(1) It actually employs an ensemble of the Naïve Bayesian Classifiers (NBC), because an ensemble of NBCs generally performs better than a single NBC (Pedersen 2000).

Yarowsky (1995) proposes a method for word sense disambiguation, which is based on Monolingual Bootstrapping.
