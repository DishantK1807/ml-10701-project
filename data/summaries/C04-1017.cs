In previous research on splitting sentences, many methods have been based on word-sequence characteristics like N-gram (Lavie et al., 1996; Berger et al., 1996; Nakajima and Yamamoto, 2001; Gupta et al., 2002).

Among them, the technique of splitting an input sentence and translating the split sentences appears promising (Doi and Sumita, 2003).

The other system was DP-match Driven transDucer (D 3 ) (Sumita, 2001), whose unit of expression is a sentence.

The objective measures used were the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001), the NIST score (Doddington, 2002) and Multi-reference Word Error Rate (mWER) (Ueffing et al., 2002).
