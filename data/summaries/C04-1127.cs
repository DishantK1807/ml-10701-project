Work The work closest to ours is (Riloff et al., 2002).

3 Cross-lingual Information Extraction (Riloff et al., 2002) present several approaches to cross-lingual information extraction (CLIE).

(Sudo et al., 2003a)) consists of three phases to learn extraction patterns from the source documents for a scenario specified by the user.

To remedy this problem, we incorporated “crosslanguage projection” (Riloff et al., 2002) only for Named Entities.

This problem is being addressed through automatic knowledge acquisition methods, such as unsupervised learning for domain-specific lexicons (Lin et al., 2003) and extraction patterns (Yangarber, 2003), which require the user to provide only a small set of lexical items of the target classes or extraction patterns for the target domain.

The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al., 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user’s query.

We used word alignment obtained by using Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2003) to get names in the English translation from names in the original Japanese sentences.

So, direct application of (Riloff et al., 2002) is not suitable for this experiment.
