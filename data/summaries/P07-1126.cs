The WordNet::Similarity package (Pedersen et al., 2004) implements this distance measure and was used by the authors.

segmentation The discourse segmentation module, which we developed in earlier research, hierarchically and sequentially segments the discourse in different topics and subtopics resulting in a table of contents of a text (Moens, 2006).
W06-3804
We do not separately evaluate our technology for salience detection as this technology was already extensively evaluated in the past (Moens, 2006).
W06-3804
We have used LTPOS (Mikheev, 1997), which performed the task almost errorless (precision of 98.144% and recall of 97.36% on the nouns in the test corpus).
J97-3003
with sentence parse information Because not all entities of the text are captured in the discourse tree, we implement an additional refinement of the computation of the salience of an entity which is inspired by (Moens et al., 2006).
W06-3804
In order to correctly assign a noun in a text to its synset, i.e., to disambiguate the sense of this word, we use an efficient Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system that was developed by the authors and which is described in (Deschacht and Moens, 2006).
