Recently, many dependency syntactic parsers using finite-state machines (FSMs) have been presented (Kahane et al., 1998; Elworthy, 2000; Nasr et al., 2002; Oflazer, 2003; Yli-Jyr¨a, 2004a).

It involves several extensions that are not present in earlier encoding schemes where dependencies are also indicated through matching pairs of symbols (Oflazer, 2003; Yli-Jyr¨a, 2004a).

The analysis is adapted from Covington (1990).
