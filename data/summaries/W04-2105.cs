Collocation extraction methods have been used not only for English, but for many other languages: French (Ferret, 2002), German (Evert and Krenn, 2001) and Japanese (Nagao and Mori, 1994), to cite but those.

The statistical significance often evaluate whether two words are independant using hypothesis tests such as t-score (Church et al., 1991), the X2, the log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993) and Fisher’s exact test (Pedersen, 1996).

The various extraction measures have been discussed in great detail in the literature (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999; McKeown and Radev, 2000), their performance has been compared (Dunning, 1993; Pedersen, 1996; Evert and Krenn, 2001), and the methods have been combined to improve overall performance (Inkpen and Hirst, 2002).
