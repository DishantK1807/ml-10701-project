In this spirit, following the work of Mellish \[Mellish 1988\] the technique of encoding boolean combinations of atomic feature values so that satisfaction can be checked by unification is adopted in the ET-6 formalism \[Alshawi et al.1991\]. Since there were open questions as what could be directly expressed in ALEP, in this conversion experiment we first took a direct approach, essentially employing ALEP as a feature term rewriting system for HPSG specifications.
