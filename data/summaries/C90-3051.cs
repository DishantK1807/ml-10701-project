Work on incremental parsing and interpretation is typically motivated by a desire to model, or mimic, (aspects of) this behaviour, for example, Bobrow and Webber (1980), Ades and Steedman (1982), Mellish (1985), Pulman (1985), and Haddock (1987~ 1988~ 1990).

3 ATMS-Style Approaches 3.1 Overview Charniak and Gohlman (1988) make use of an NI)MS for keeping track of alternatives arising in sensesemantic and co,ltexl;ual interpretation, for example, wil.h respect to word sense, case, and noun-phrase reference.

A recent example of this is Pollack and Pereira (1988) who use a strict compositional semantics but.

For example, Jacobs (1988), in dealing with the problem of "concretion" -developing a most specific or metaphorical interpretation -lets his system, TRUMP, treat each interpretation as an assumption.

Zernik, Uri and Allen Brown (1988).

Zernik arm Brown (1988) in a sen,m take this approach to its extreme, using de~ fault reasoning and dependency-directed backtracking to guide the entire parsing and interpretation process.

Charniak and Goldman (1988) provide an example of how ATMS techniques could be used for comparisons (eft section a.1). 4.3 Revision of Interpretations The basic ATMS does not provide nonmonotonic justifications and hence no machinery for actually revising a previously held interpretation through default reasoning, etc.

Appelt, Douglas and Kurt Konolige (1988).

Conflicting information is simply thrown away, ~hus in a sense making the system even More recently, Zernik and Brown (1988) suggest a coupling of a DCG parser with a JTMS, both of which are embedded in a Prolog system.

Furthermore, systems that mix for example deictic and natural-language input require that linguistic status be given to sentence fragments, thus demanding incremental analysis (Kobsa et al.1986). One body of work which appears to be usefifl in incremental parsing and interpretation is re,on (or truth) maintenanceJ A reason-maintenance system (RMS) supports incremental formation and revision of beliefs.

Zernik and Brown 1988:802), the system initially assumes "the child" to be the agent since the "default voice" is considered to be "active".

This section dis'cusses some general problems of JTMSs and JTMS-style approaches to incrementM parsing with special reference to the framework of Zernik and Brown (1988) whose notion of parsing comes closest to the one considered here.

with nonmonotonic interpretation rules; other examples are Asher (1984), Dunin-Keplicz (1984), and Appelt and Konolige (1988).

An ordinary chart parser as well as an ATMS-style chart parser as put forward above are incremental in this sense, whereas the nonlnonotonic model of Zernik attd Brown (1988) attd, say, an ATN parser are not.
