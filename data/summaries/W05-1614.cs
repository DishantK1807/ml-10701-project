One complicating factor is that the pun criteria are largely surface constraints which apply to what, in a conventional pipeline NLG architecture [Reiter and Dale, 2000], would be the final output of the generator.

There is not space here to explore the large issue of surface-level constraints and their consequences for NLG architecture, but see [Reiter, 2000] for some discussion.
