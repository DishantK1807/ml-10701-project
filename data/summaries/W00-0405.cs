Many of these documents are likely to repeat much the same information, while differing in certain i Most of these were based on statistical techniques applied to various document entities; examples include frait, 1983; Kupiec et al., 1995; Paice, 1990, Klavans and Shaw, 1995; MeKeown et al., 1995; Shaw, 1995; Aon¢ et al., 1997; Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Mitra et al., 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Baldwin and Mortbn, 1998; Radev and McKeown, 1998; Strzalkowski et al., 1998).

These include comparing templates filled in by extracting information using specialized, domain specific knowledge sources from the doc"ument, and then generating natural language summaries from the templates (Radev and McKeown, 1998), com-• paring named-entities extracted using specialized lists between documents and selecting the most relevant section (TIPSTER, 1998b), finding co-reference chains in the document set to identify common sections of interest (TIPSTER, 1998b), or building activation networks of related lexical items (identity mappings, synonyms, hypernyms, etc).

Naturally, an ideal multi-document summary would include a natural language generation component to create cohesive readable summaries (Radev and McKeown, 1998; McKeown et al., 1999).

More recently, other approaches have investigated the utility of discourse structure (Marcu, 1997), the combination of information extraction and language generation (Klavans and Shaw, 1995; McKeown et al., 1995), and using machine learning to find patterns in text (Teufel and Moens, 1997; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Strzalkowski et al., 1998).

Some of these approaches to single document summarization have been extended to deal with multi-document summarization (Mani and Bloedern, 1997; Goldstein and Carbonell, 1998; TIPSTER, 1998b; Radev and McKeown, 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; McKeown et al.,.!999; Stein et al., 1999).
