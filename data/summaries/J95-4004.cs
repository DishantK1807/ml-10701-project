This learning approach has also been applied to a number of other tasks, including prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation (Brill and Resnik 1994), bracketing text (Brill 1993a) and labeling nonterminal nodes (Brill 1993c).

Useful tools, such as large aligned corpora (e.g., the aligned Hansards (Gale and Church 1991)) and semantic word hierarchies (e.g., Wordnet (Miller 1990)), have also recently become available.

There are a number of efforts worldwide to manually annotate large corpora with linguistic information, including parts of speech, phrase structure and predicate-argument structure (e.g., the Penn Treebank and the British National Corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993; Leech, Garside, and Bryant 1994)).

An effort has recently been undertaken to create automated machine translation systems in which the linguistic information needed for translation is extracted automatically from aligned corpora (Brown et al.1990). These are just a few of the many recent applications of corpus-based techniques in natural language processing.

However, it appears to be the case that directly estimating probabilities from even a very small manually tagged corpus gives better results than training a hidden Markov model on a large untagged corpus (see Merialdo (1994)).

These transformations alter the tagging of a word from X to Y iff 7 In Brill and Resnik (1994), we describe an approach to prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation that obtains highly competitive performance compared to other corpus-based solutions to this problem.

This algorithm has been applied to a number of natural language problems, including part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, and syntactic parsing (Brill 1992; Brill 1993a; Brill 1993b; Brill and Resnik 1994; Brill 1994).

Word-sense disambiguation, a problem that once seemed out of reach for systems without a great deal of handcrafted linguistic and world knowledge, can now in some cases be done with high accuracy when all information is derived automatically from corpora (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991; Yarowsky 1992; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Bruce and Wiebe 1994).

A number of part-of-speech taggers are readily available and widely used, all trained and retrainable on text corpora (Church 1988; Cutting et al.1992; Brill 1992; Weischedel et al.1993). Endemic structural ambiguity, which can lead to such difficulties as trying to cope with the many thousands of possible parses that a grammar can assign to a sentence, can be greatly reduced by adding empirically derived probabilities to grammar rules (Fujisaki et al.1989; Sharman, Jelinek, and Mercer 1990; Black et al.1993) and by computing statistical measures of lexical association (Hindle and Rooth 1993).

Part-of-speech tagging is an active area of research; a great deal of work has been done in this area over the past few years (e.g., Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; Hindle 1989; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Brill 1992; Black et al.1992; Cutting et al.1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al.1993; Weischedel et al.1993; Schutze and Singer 1994).

Roche and Schabes (1995) show a method for converting a list of tagging transformations into a deterministic finite state transducer with one state transition taken per word of input; the result is a transformation-based tagger whose tagging speed is about ten times that of the fastest Markov-model tagger.

Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part-of-speech taggers has been on further exploring Markovmodel based tagging (Jelinek 1985; Church 1988; Derose 1988; DeMarcken 1990; Merialdo 1994; Cutting et al.1992; Kupiec 1992; Charniak et al.1993; Weischedel et al.1993; Schutze and Singer 1994).
