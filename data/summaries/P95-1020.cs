P92-1009
implicatures in indirect replies The same methodology can be applied to modeling conversational impIicatures in indirect replies (Green, 1992).
P92-1009
Computational approaches fail to account for the cancellation of pragmatic inferences: once presuppositions (Weischedel, 1979) or implicatures (Hirschberg, 1985; Green, 1992) are generated, they can never be cancelled.
P92-1009
Green (1992) assumes that implicatures are connected to discourse entities and not to utterances, but her approach still does not allow cancellations across discourse units.
P92-1009
To understand conversationM implicatures associated with indirect replies one must consider discourse expectations, discourse plans, and discourse relations (Green, 1992; Green and Carberry, 1994).
P92-1009 P94-1009
To recognize normal state implicatures one must consider mutual beliefs and plans (Green, 1990).
P90-1012
inferences in sequences of utterances We have already mentioned that speech repairs constitute a good benchmark for studying the genera148 tion and cancellation of pragmatic inferences along sequences of utterances (McRoy and Hirst, 1993).
