A Method of Creating New Bilingual Valency Entries using Alternations Sanae Fujita Francis Bond fsanae, bondg@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp NTT Machine Translation Research Group NTT Communication Science Laboratories Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation Abstract We present a method that uses alternation data to add new entries to an existing bilingual valency lexicon.
If the existing lexicon has only one half of the alternation, then our method constructs the other half.
The new entries have detailed information about argument structure and selectional restrictions.
In this paper we focus on one class of alternations, but our method is applicable to any alternation.
We were able to increase the coverage of the causative alternation to 98%, and the new entries gave an overall improvement in translation quality of 32%.
1 Introduction
Recently, deep linguistic processing, which aims to provide a useful semantic representation, has become the focus of more research, as parsing technologies improve in both speed and robustness (Uszkoreit, 2002).
In particular, machine translation systems still mainly rely on large hand-crafted lexicons.
The knowledge acquisition bottleneck, however, remains: precise grammars need information-rich lexicons, such as valency dictionaries, which are costly to build and extend.
In this paper, we present a method of adding new entries to an existing bilingual valency dictionary, using information about verbal alternations.
The classic approach to acquiring lexical information is to build resources by hand.
This produces useful resources but is expensive.
This is still the approach taken by large projects such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or OntoSem.
Therefore, there is a need to extend these handmade resources quickly and economically.
Another approach is to attempt to learn information from corpora.
There has been much research based on this, but due to the inevitable errors, there are few examples of lexicons being constructed fully automatically.
Korhonen (2002) reports that the ceiling on the performance of mono-lingual subcategorization acquisition from corpora is generally around 80%, a level that still requires manual intervention.
Yet another approach is to combine knowledge sources: for example to build a lexicon and then try to extend it using corpus data or to enrich monolingual data using multilingual lexicons (Fujita and Bond, 2002).
The aim of this research is not to create a lexicon from scratch, but rather to add further entries to an existing lexicon.
We propose a method of acquiring detailed information about predicates, including argument structure, semantic restrictions on the arguments and translation equivalents.
It combines two heterogeneous knowledge sources: an existing bilingual valency lexicon (the seed lexicon), and information about verbal alternations.
Most verbs have more than one possible argument structure (subcat).
These can be regularized into pairs of alternations, where two argument structures link similar semantic roles into di erent subcats.
Levin (1993) has identi ed over 80 alternation types for English, and these have been extended to cover 4,432 verbs in 492 classes (Dorr, 1997).
In this paper, we will consider alternations between transitive (Vt) and intransitive (Vi) uses of verbs, where the subject of the intransitive verb (S) is the same as the object of the transitive verb (O) (e.g.
the acid dissolved the metal, the metal dissolved (in the acid)) (Levin, 1993, 2633)).
We call the subject of the transitive verb A (ergative) and this alternation the S=O alternation.
Figure 1 shows a simpli ed example of an alternating pair in a bilingual valency dictionary (the valency lexicon from the Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991)).
This includes the subcategorization frame and selectional restrictions.
As shown in Figure 1, Japanese, unlike English, typically morphologically marks the transitivity alternation.
We chose the S=O alternation because it is one J-E Entry: 302116 S a0 N1:hstuffi a1 nom X a2 N3:hstuffi a3 dat a4 Vi a5a7a6a9a8 tokeru \dissolve" S a0 N1 subject a2 Vi dissolve X a4 PP in N3 J-E Entry: 508661 A a0 N1:hpeople, artifacti a1 nom O a2 N2 hstuffi a10 acc X a2 N3:hinanimatei a3 dat a4 Vi a5a12a11 toku \dissolve" A a0 N1 subject a2 Vt dissolve O a2 N2 direct object X a4 PP in N3 Figure 1: Vi a5a7a6a9a8 tokeru \dissolve" $ Vt a5a13a11 toku \dissolve" of the most common types of alternations, making up 34% of those discovered by Bond et al.(2002) and has been extensively studied.
The method we present, however, can be used with any alternation for which lists of alternating verbs exist.
2 Resources
We use two main resources in this paper: (1) a seed lexicon of high quality hand-made valency entries; and (2) lists of verbs that undergo one or more S=O alternations.
The alternation list includes 449 native Japanese verbs that take the S=O alternation, based on data from Jacobsen (1981), Bullock (1999) and the Japanese/English dictionary EDICT (Breen, 1995).
Each entry consists of a pair of Japanese verbs with one or more English glosses.
Expanding out the English results in 839 Japanese-English pairs in all.
Some examples are given in Table 1.
Intransitive Transitive Ja En Ja En a14a16a15a18a17 tokeru dissolve a14a20a19 toku dissolve a21a22a19 naku cry a21a18a23a25a24 nakasu make cry a26a18a27a16a17 agaru rise a26a18a28a16a17 ageru lift Table 1: Verbs Undergoing the S=O Alternation As a seed lexicon, we use the valency dictionary (Ikehara et al., 1997) from the Japanese-toEnglish machine translation system ALT-J/E.
It consists of linked pairs of Japanese and English verbs.
There are 5,062 Japanese verbs and 11,214 entries (ignoring all idiomatic and adjectival entries).
Verb entries in both languages have information about the argument structure (subcat) of the verb.
In addition to the core arguments, adjunct cases are added to many patterns to help in disambiguation.1 The Japanese side has selec1This is common in large NLP lexicons, such as COMtional restrictions (SR) on the arguments.
The arguments are linked between the two languages using case-roles (N1, N2,...).
The seed lexicon covered 381 out of the 449 linked Japanese pairs (85%).
In the next section, in order to examine the nature of the alternation we compare the case roles and translation of the linked valency pairs.
3 The
Nature of the S=O Alternation 3.1 Comparing Selectional Restrictions of A, O and S In alternations, a given semantic role typically appears in two di erent syntactic positions: for example, the dissolved role is the subject of intransitive dissolve and the object of the transitive.
Baldwin et al.(1999) hypothesized that selectional restrictions (SRs) stay constant in the di erent syntactic positions.
Dorr (1997), who generates both alternations from a single underlying representation, implicitly makes this assumption.
In addition, Kilgarri (1993) speci cally makes the A h+sentient, +volitioni, while the O is h+changes-state, +causally affectedi.
However, we know of no quantitative studies of the similarities of alternating verbs.
Exploiting the machine translation lexicon for linguistic research, we compare the SRs of S with both A and O for verbs that take the S=O alternation.
The SRs take the form of a list of semantic classes, strings or *.
Strings only match speci c words, while * matches anything, even non-nouns.
The semantic classes are from the GoiTaikei ontology of 2,710 categories (Ikehara et al., 1997).
It is an unbalanced hierarchy with a maximum depth of 12.
The top node (level 1) is noun.
The lower the level, the more specialized LEX (Grishman et al., 1998).
For example, the COMLEX 3.0 entry for gather notes that it coocurs with PPs headed by around, inside, with, in and into.
the meaning, and thus the more restrictive the SR.
We calculate the similarity between two SRs as the minimum distance (MD), measured as links in the ontology.
If the SRs share at least one semantic class then the MD is zero.
In this case, we further classi ed the SRs which are identical into \0 (Same)".
For example, in Figure 1, the MD between S and O is \0 (Same)" because they have the same SR: hstuffi.
The MD between A and S is two because the shortest path from hartifacti to hstuffi traverses two links (artifact inanimate stuff).2 Figure 2 shows the MD between O and S, and A and S.
The selectional restrictions are very similar for O and S.
30.1% have identical SRs, distance is zero for 27.5% and distance one is 28.3%.
However, for A and S, the most common case is distance one (26.7%) and then distance two (21.5%).
Although O and S are di erent syntactic roles, their SRs are very similar, re ecting the identity of the underlying semantic roles.
Figure 2: The Minimum Distance of Selectional Restrictions Next, we examine whether A, O, and S are h+sentient, +volitioni or not.
In the GoiTaikei hierarchy, semantic classes subsumed by agent are h+sentient, +volitioni.
A was very agentitive, with 60.1% of the SRs being subsumed by agent.
The most frequent SR for A is hagenti itself (41.4%).
S and O are less agentitive, with 13.9% and 14.1% of their respective selectional restrictions being agentitive.
This data supports the hypothesis in Kilgarri (1993).
2There is some variation due to lexicographer’s inconsistencies.
For example X’s SR is hstuffi in the intransitive and hinanimatei in the transitive entry.
It should be hstuffi in both entries.
In summary, the SRs of S and O are not identical, but very similar.
In comparison, A is more agentitive, and not closely linked to either.
3.2 Comparison
of Japanese and English From the point of view of constructing bilingual lexical entries, if the English main verb can translate both Japanese entries, then it is possible to automatically construct a usable English translation equivalent along with the Japanese alternation.
In order to see how often this is the case, we compare Japanese and English alternations and investigate the English translations in the alternation list.
We divide the entries into ve types in Table 2.
The rst three are those where the main English verb is the same.
The most common type (30.0%) is made up of English unaccusative verbs which also undergo the S=O alternation [S=O].
The next most common (19.8%) is entries where the Japanese intransitive verb can be translated by making the transitive verb’s English translation passive [passive].
In the third type (6.5%) the English is made transitive synthetically [synthetic]: a control verb (normally make) takes an intransitive verb or adjective as complement.
The last two are those where either di erent translations are used (42.8%), or the same English verb is used but the valency change is not one of those described above.
The rst three rows of Table 2 show the verbs whose alternate can be created automatically, 56.3% of the total.
This gure is only an approximation, for two reasons.
The rst is that the translation may not be the best one, most verbs can have multiple translations, and we are only creating one.
The second is that this upper limit is almost certainly too low.
For many of the alternations, although our table contained di erent verbs, translations using identical verbs are also acceptable.
In fact, most transitive verbs can be made passive, and most intransitive verbs embedded in a causative construction, so this alternative is always possible (and is also possible for Japanese).
However, if the Japanese uses a lexical alternation, it is more faithful to link it to an English lexical alternation when possible.
4 Method
of Creating Valency Entries In this section we describe how we create new alternating entries.
Given a verb, with dependents Ni, and an alternation that maps some or all of the Ni, we can create the alternate by analogy with existing alternating verbs.
The basic ow of Japanese English Translation English Structure Type No.
(%) Vi Vt Vi Vt Vi Vt a0a2a1 a8 a0a4a3 a8 S weaken A weaken O S Vi A Vt O S=O 138 30.0 a5a7a6 a8 a5a9a8a11a10 S be omitted A omit O S be Vt-ed A Vt O passive 91 19.8 a12 a11 a12a14a13a15a10 S cry A make O cry S Vi/be Adj A Vc O Vi/Adj synthetic 30 6.5 a16 a11a18a17a7a8 a16 a11 a10 S pass away A lose O S Vi A Vt O Di Head 197 42.8 a19a18a20a21a6 a8 a19a18a20a2a8a22a10 S play A play with O S Vi A Vt prep O Di Struct 4 0.9 Vc is control verb such as make,get,let,become.
Many entries also include information about non-core arguments/adjuncts.
Table 2: Classi cation of English Translations of the S = O Alternation List (Reference Data) creating valency entries is as follows.
For each dependent Ni if Ni participates in the alternation if Ni has an alternate in the target then map to it else delete Ni else transfer [non-alternating dependent] If the alternation requires a dependent not in the source Add the default argument We use the most frequent argument in existing valency entries as a default.
Speci c examples of creating S = O alternations are given in the next section.
Although we only discuss the selectional restrictions and subcat information here, we also map the verb classes (given as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1997)).
The mapping for the dependents in the alternation can be taken from existing lexical resources (Dorr, 1997), learned from corpora (McCarthy, 2000) or learned from existing lexicons (Bond et al., 2002).
4.1 Target
In this experiment, we look at one family of alternations, the S = O alternation.
The candidate words are thus intransitive verbs with no transitive alternate, or transitive entries with no intransitive alternate.
Alternations should be between senses, but the alternation list is only of words.
Many of the candidate words (those that have a entry for only one alternate) have several entries.
Only some of these are suitable as seeds.
We don’t use entries which are intransitive lemmas but have an accusative argument, which are intransitive (or transitive) lemmas but have an transitive translation (or intransitive), or which have both topic and nominative, such as (1), where the nominative argument is incorporated in the English translation.
(1) N1:hanimalsi N1 N1 a23 ha top N3:h"a24a24a24 "i N3:\chikara" N3:power a27 ga nom a25a16a15 a17 nukeru lose N1 lose N1’s energy There are 115 entries (37 lemmas) which have only intransitive entries and 81 entries (25 lemmas) which have only transitive entries which are in our reference list of alternating verbs.
We create intransitive entries using the existing transitive entries, and transitive entries using the existing intransitive entries.
4.2 Creating
the Japanese subcat and SRs In creating the intransitive entries from the transitive entries, we map the O’s SRs onto the S’s SRs, and change the case marker from accusative to nominative.
We delete the A argument, and transfer any other dependents as they are.
In creating the transitive entries, we map the intransitive S’s SRs onto the new O’s SRs, and give it an accusative case-marker.
If the intransitive entry has a demoted subject argument (where the Japanese case-marker is ni and the English preposition is by), we promote it to subject and use its SR for A.
Otherwise we add a causative argument as ergative subject (A) with a default SR of hagenti3 and a nominative casemarker.
We show an example in Figure 3.
4.3 Creating
the English Equivalents The English translation can be divided into three types: S=O, passive and synthetic.
Therefore it is necessary to judge which type is appropriate for each entry, and then create the English.
This judgement is shown in Figure 4.
To judge whether an English 3hagenti is the most frequent SR for transitive verbs undergoing this alternation as shown in x 3.1.

We evaluated the quality by using the new entries in a machine translation system.
5.1 Translation-Based Evaluation We evaluated the quality of the created entries in a translation-based regression test.
We got two example sentences using each verb from Japanese newspapers and web pages: this gave a total of 124 test sentences.
We translated the test sentences using ALT-J/E, both with (with) and without (w/out) the new entries.
Translations that were identical were marked no change (the system translates with a simple word dictionary if it has no valency entry).
Translations that changed were evaluated by people uent in both languages (two thirds by Japanese native speakers and one third by an English native speaker, not the authors).
The translations were randomly presented to the evaluators labeled by A and B.
Therefore evaluators did not know whether a translation is with or w/out.
The translations were placed into three categories: (i) A is better than B, (ii) A and B are equivalent in quality, and (iii) A is worse than B.
For example in (2), the evaluation was (iii).
In this case A is w/out and B is with, so the new entry has improved the translation.

Table 3 shows the evaluation results, split into those for transitive and intransitive verbs.
The most common result was that the new translation was better (46.0%).
The quality was equivalent for 13.7% and worse for 14.5%.
The overall improvement was 31.5% (46.0 14.5).
Extending the dictionary to include the missing alternations gave a measurable improvement in translation quality.

They found three major source of errors.
The rst was that alternation is a sense based phenomenon.
As we built alternations for all patterns in the seed dictionary, this resulted in the creation of some spurious patterns.
An example of an impossible entry is a22 a8a24a23 a6 a8 torawareru \be caught", translated as be picked up with the inappropriate semantic restriction hconcrete,material-phenomenoni on the subject.
However, another good entry was creCreating Intransitive entries: if the original subcat has a control verb (Vc 2 fmake,have,get,causeg) A Vc O Vi/Adj ) S Vi/be Adj [synthetic] (A make O cry ) S cry ) else (original head is Vt) if Vt undergoes the S = O alternation { A Vt O ) S Vi [S=O] (A turn O ) S turn) else { A Vt O ) S be Vt-ed [passive] (A injure O in X ) S be injured in X ) We made a special rule for the English Vt have.
In this case the intransitive alternation will be There is: for example, a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7 A have O on X ) a0a9a1a11a10a8a7 There be S on X.

The second source of errors was in the selectional restrictions.
In around 10% of the entries, the lexicographers wanted to change the SRs.
The most common change was to make the SR for A more speci c than the default of agent.
The third source of errors was in the English translation, where the lexicographers sometimes preferred a di erent verb as a translation, rather than a regular alternation.
6 Discussion
and Future Work The above results show that alternations can be used to create rich and useful bilingual entries.
In this section we discuss some of the reasons for errors, and suggest ways to improve and expand our method.
6.1 Rejecting
Innappropriate Candidates To make the construction fully automatic, a test for whether the Japanese side of the entry is appropriate or not is required.
One possibility is to add a corpus based lter: if no examples can be found that match the selectional restrictions for an entry, then it should be rejected.
This could be done for each language individually.
The problem with this approach is that many of the entries we created were for infrequent verbs.
The average frequency in 16 years of Japanese newspaper text was only 173, and 22 verbs never appeared, although all were familiar to native speakers.
We can, of course, use the web to alleviate the data sparseness problem.
6.2 Improving
the English Translations In this section we compare the distribution of the di erent types of translations for the reference data (x 3.1) and the entries created by our method (x 3.2).
The breakdown is shown in Table 4.
The rst three rows show entries with the same English main verb.
One major discrepancy is in the frequency of the control verb construction.
In Vi, no original transitive entry used control verbs.
In general, when lexicographers create an entry, they prefer a simple entry to a synthetic one.
Looking at the linguists’ reference data, about 6.5% of the examples used control verbs.
In the constructed data, 66.1% (77 entries) use the control verb make, more than any other category.
For example, when the original intransitive entry is N1 be exhausted, exhausted is de ned as adjective in the existing dictionary.
So we create a new entry N1 make N2 exhaustedadj.
However, there is a transitive verb exhaust, and it was preferred by the lexicographers: N1 exhaust N2.
The algorithm needs to optionally convert adjectives to verbs in cases where there is overlap between the adjective and past participle.
Finally, we consider those Japanese alternations where the transitive and intransitive alternatives need translations with di erent English main verbs.
A good example of this is Vi a16 a11 a17 English Structure Reference Data (Table2) Vi Created Vt Created Type Vi Vt No.

Even with reliable English syntactic data, it would be hard to rule out pass away as a possible transitive verb or lose as an intransitive.
They can only be ruled out by using data linking the subcat with the meaning, and this would need to be linked to the Japanese verbs’ meanings.
This may become possible with larger linked multi-lingual dictionaries, such as those under construction in the Papillon project,5 but is not now within our reach.
In summary, we could improve the construction of the English translations by using richer English information, especially about past-participles or verb senses.
6.3 Usage
as a Lexical/Translation Rule Although we have investigated the use of alternations in lexicon construction, the algorithms could also be used directly, either as lexical/translation rules or to generate transitive and intransitive entries from a common underlying representation.
For example, Shirai et al.(1999) uses the existing entries and lexical rules deploying them to translate causatives and passives (including adversative passives) from Japanese to English.
Trujillo (1995) showed a method to apply lexical rules for word translation.
That is, they expand the vocabulary using prepared lexical rules for each language, and create links for translation between the lexical rules of a pair of languages.
Dorr (1997) and Baldwin et al.(1999) generate both alternates from a single underlying representation.
Our proposed method could partially be implemented as a lexical or a translation rule.
But not all the word senses alternate (x 4.2), and not all the target language entries are regularly translated by the same head (x 3).
Further many of the 4My friend passed away $ I lost my friend.
5http://www.papillon-dictionary.org/ rules mix lexical and syntactic information, making them quite complicated.
Because of that, it is easier to expand out the rules beforehand and enter them into the system.
6.4 Further
Work In this paper, we targeted native Japanese verbs only.
ALT-J/E already has a very high coverage of native Japanese verbs.
However, even in this case, we could increase the cover of this alternation from 85% to 98% (442 out of 449 alternation pairs now in the dictionary).
Most valency dictionaries or new language pairs have less cover, and so will get more results.
It is also possible to use this method so as to only create half the entries by hand, and then to automatically make the alternating halves (although not all the created entries will be perfect).
In addition to the native Japanese verbs, there are many Sino-Japanese verbal nouns that undergo S=O alternation (For example, (3) $ (4)).
(3) a0 mise shop a27 ga nom a1a3a2 seihin products a4 o acc a5a7a6a9a8a11a10 kanbai-shita sold out The shop sold out of the products.
(4) a1a3a2 seihin products a27 ga nom a5a7a6a9a8a11a10 kanbai-shita sold out The products are sold out.
ALT-J/E’s Japanese dictionary has about 2,400 verbal nouns which have usage as both transitive and intransitive.
Of these only 536 are in the valency dictionary.
Our next plan is to add them all to the valency dictionary, using alternations to make the process more e cient and consistent.
Another extension is to apply the method to other alternations, using either linguists’ data or automatically acquired alternations (Oishi and Matsumoto, 1997; Furumaki and Tanaka, 2003; McCarthy, 2000).
In particular, S = O alternations make up only 34% of those discovered by Bond et al.(2002), we intend to investigate the alternations that make up the remainder.
7 Conclusion
We presented a method that uses alternation data to add new entries to an existing translation lexicon.
The new entries have detailed information about argument structure and selectional restrictions.
We were able to increase the coverage of the S=O alternation to 98%, and the new entries gave an overall improvement in translation quality of 32%.
