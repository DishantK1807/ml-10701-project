69:810	THE PERISHING PUBLISHING PROSPECT FOR SCIENTIFIC AUTHORS Economics and a resourceful technology are eroding the comfortable system by which post-World War I1 scientists have gained credit for results of their research.
70:810	Existing arrangements for citation and indexing for reference and retrieval are similarly threatened.
71:810	This Symposium will attempt to alert scientific authors to trends, opportunities, and dangers they must face in the next decade, as foreseen by knowledgable communicators with experties and occupational mandates to define and predict the future.
72:810	Emphasis in all presentations will be on the impact of imminent changes on individual authors rather than on specialized problems in technical and scientific information transf ern ARRANGED BY HAROLD F. ~SBORNE.

74:810	Comunica.tions services are the means by which scientists and engineers are able to build upon the results of prior work even though that work may have been done at a distant place or in a different discipline.
75:810	Many prestigious committees and study groups have analyzed the information problems of scientists and engineers and offered a broad range of recommendations for improvement.
76:810	But very little has changed.
77:810	This symposium will review the problems with, and needs for, co~unications services by the scientific community and suggest new approaches to the problem of maintaining an economically viable and user responsive scientific and technical comunications enterprise in the U.S. Speakers will deal with a variety of specific questions including: What is the role of information in science and engineering?
78:810	How much progress have we made in improving information services during the last 10 years?
79:810	What are the current problems in financial support, organization, and management of the scientific communication enterprise?
80:810	What can be done to improve the extisting situation and enhance the value of scientific and technical information services to users engaged in scientific research?

83:810	In one category of such systems, knowledge is extracted automatically from the aggregate of patient records (medical data banks); another category encapsulates and makes available decision making rules of human experts.
84:810	The program describes the current state of the art in the development of these systems; reviews research in the modeling of clinical decision processes; examines the implications of computer-aided consulting on medical practice and education; and surveys Federal programs which support the training of manpower for biomedical information processing ARRANGED BY VLADIMIR SLAMECKA, DIRECTOR, SCHOOL OF INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.

HOEMANN Bowling Green State University Ohio 43403 Stokoe (1960) has designed a model of the structure of the American Sign Language (ASL) which is amenable to computer simulation.
193:810	He has proposed that signs comprising the ASL lexicon are composed of three basic aspects, location (TAB), hand configuration I (DEZ), and movement (SIG) . He has identified a finite number of each of these elements, and he has proposed that they may be combined in various ways to constitute recognizable and meaningful signs.
194:810	Recent reformulations have ventured some modifications (e.g. , Stokoe, 1972), but the basic approach remains the same.
195:810	Such a conceptualization of ASL implies that if a computer were furnished a set of each of these types of elements, it ought to Acknowledgments.

199:810	METHOD APPARATUS.
200:810	Our principal apparatus was an Owens-Illinois Digivue Plasma Display Unit attached to a Nova 1220 minicomputer The Digivue Display Unit is an electronic device with a gasfilled display matrix and activating circuitry.
201:810	An electrical signal is passed through each of two very fine wires at right angles to one another.
202:810	When the gas is activated, it lights up at the poiat of intersection.
203:810	There are 512 grid lines in each direction, making a total of 262,144 addressable points.
204:810	Points can be written or erased at the rate of 50,000 dots per second.
205:810	The program language used was Graphic Basic, a version of Data General Corporation's time-shared BASIC, modified for use with the Digivue Display Unit (Fulton, 1974).
206:810	Access to the computer was gained through the Digivue keyboard and through a teletypewriter.
207:810	Paper tape output from the teletypewriter provided permanent storage of previously written programs.
208:810	PROCEDURE.
209:810	AS a concession to storage limitations, the project was, at first, limited to one-handed signs located on or near the face.
210:810	An oval shape with stylized browline, nose, and mouth was stored in memory and served as the reference for any sign which the computer was required to generate Hand co~~figurations (DEZ) were constructed by joining coordinate points with line segments.
211:810	The points were stored in the memory of the computer, and graphic commands were issued to form the line segments.
212:810	As a program was fed into the computer, it stored in memory information about the DEZ and the initial TAB while the face was drawn on the screen.
213:810	Another series of subroutines drew the DEZ in its initial TAB and moved it to another TAB so as to represent a movement (SIG).
214:810	If the sign required a change of DEZ, the program could call the new DEZ up from memory and place it in the sign's final position.
215:810	VALIDATION.
216:810	The adequacy of the simulated signs rests with their intelligibility.
217:810	Deaf and hearing persons who were fluent users of ASL were tested to verify that the graphic display yielded signs that could be recognized as part of the ASL lexicon.
218:810	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Thus far 11 DEZ, 8 TABs, and 7 SIGs have been programed and stored on a single paper tape.
219:810	If disc storage and the necessary interface were added to our Nova, it is likely that we could represent all 12 TABs, 19 DEZ, and 24 SIGs identified by Stokoe as primes of his model.
220:810	Meanwhile, the subset of structural features programed thus far constitute a suitable feasibility study of a computer simulation of ASL.
221:810	The following results have been achieved It has been verified that the features of ASL identified by Stokoe as structural elements may also function as distinctive features.
222:810	The same DES and SIG executed with different TABs may result in signs with different meanings (father and mother, summer and dry in our data).
223:810	The same TAB and SIG executed with different DEZ may also result in signs with different meanings (who and lipread in our data).
224:810	Finally, the same DEZ and TAB with different SIGs may also result in signs with different meanings (summer and wise, face and who in our data) . Secondly, if any one of these aspects (TAB, DEZ, or SIG) of a sign is altered, the resulting sign compiled by the computer is 1) likely to be nonsense" in ASL.
225:810	In our data, the 11 DEZ, 8 TABs, and 7 SIGs yield potentially 11 x 8 x 7 or 616 signs.
226:810	Over 600 of them are nonsense.
227:810	This indicates that most signs in ASL differ from one another in more than one distinctive feature.
228:810	Also, since many signs change DEZ and involve more than one SIG, there is a low probability of confusing one sign with another, even when the signs are presented out of context.
229:810	Finally, our data indicate that the orientation of the hands also constitutes a distinctive feature in ASL.
230:810	Inappropriate hand orientation can disrupt intelligibility even when the other three aspects are compiled correctly.
231:810	Stokoe's model seems to be sufficiently robust to assimilate the required revision without altering his basic approach.
232:810	This computer simulation of ASL was limited to the structural features of individual signs, and it corresponds to a study of the phonological structure of spoken languages.
233:810	(Stokoe refers to his analysis as CHEROLOGY after the Greek chcir or hand ).
234:810	No attempt was made in this simulation to present the signs in a linguistic context or to represent the structure of AS sentences Future studies are planned in which the graphic di~play of individual signs will be subject to systematic distortion to discover whether TAB or SIG aspects of signs are perceived categorically by native users of ASL.

240:810	rf Ise of . Th i :;in:; ed " I Introduction In this paper we describe a new programming language which is designed to facilitate the writing of natural language grammars.
241:810	A simple structural analysis program using this language is given as an example.
242:810	There are two key issues in analyzing natural language by computer: 1) how to represent knowledge (semantics, pragmatics) and the state (context) of the world, and 2) how to advance the programming technology appropriate for syntacticsemantic, syntactic-contextual interface.
243:810	The point in designing a programming language is to make this kind of programming less painful.
244:810	Tradi tima1 systems whi.ch represent grammars as a set of rewriting rules ustially 'have poor control mechanisms, and flexible interaction between thc syntact LC and other con~ponents is not possible.

248:810	systcos are apt.
249:810	t.0 c.lestroy the intc.lligih:il ity and regularity of natural language gramars, because in these systems both rules and their control mechanisms are contained in the same program.
250:810	Recently various syscems for natural language analysis have been developed T. Winograd's (1971) "PROGRAMMAR" is a typical example of procedure oriented systems.
251:810	In this system the syntactic and other components can interact closely in the course of analyzing sentences.
252:810	However, details of the program are lost in the richness of this interaction.
253:810	LINGOL, developed by V. Pratt (1973) at MIT, is a language appropriate to syntaxsemantics interface and in which it is easy to write grammars in the form of rewriting rules.
254:810	The TAUM group at Montreal University (1971) has evolved a programming languagc name :I System-Q in which expressions of trees, strings and lists of them can be matched against partial expressions (structural patterns) containing variables and can be transformed in any arbitrary fast1 i 011.
255:810	Thc augmcn tcd t ri111~ i L I on ilc twork (A1l'N) proposccl by W Woods (19 70) from our point of view gives an especially good framework for natural Xa~~guage analysis systems.
256:810	One ofthe most attractive features is the clear dtscrimination between grammatical rules and the control mechanism.
257:810	This enables us to develop the model by adding various facilities to its control mechanism.
258:810	The ATN model has the following additional merits :.
259:810	30 1.
260:810	It provides power of expression equivalent to transformational grammars 2.
261:810	It mai11tai.n~ much of the rendability of context-free grammars.
262:810	3.
263:810	Rules of n grammar can be changed easily, so we can improve them through a t rial-and-error process whi1.e writing the grammar.
264:810	4.
265:810	It is possible to impose various types of semantic and pragmatic conditions on the branches between states.
266:810	By doing this, close interactions between the syntactic and other components can be easily accomplished.
267:810	However ATN has the following shortcomings, especially when we apply it to the parsing of Japanese sentences: 1.
268:810	It scans words one-by-one from the leftmost end of an input sentence, checks the applicability of a rule, and makes the transition from one state to another.
269:810	This method may be well suited for English sentences, but because the order of words and phrases in Japanese sentences is relatively free, it is preferable to check the applicability of a rule by a flexible pattern-matching method.
270:810	In addition, without a patte rn-matching mechanism, a single rewriting rule of an ordinary grammar is often to be expressed by several rules belonging to different states in Woods ATN parser.
271:810	2.
272:810	An ATN model essentially performs a kind of top-down analysls of sentences.
273:810	Therefore recovery f ronl failures in predictf.on is most d1.f ficult.
274:810	Considering these factors, we developed PLATON (a Programming Lhnguage for Tree-Ol>cratioN), which is based on the A1'N model and has various additional capabilities such as pattern-matching, flexible backtracking, and so on.
275:810	As in SystewQ and LINGOL, PLATON's pattern-matching facility makes it easy to write rewriting rules.
276:810	Moreover, it extracts substructures from the inputs and invokes appropriate semantic and contextual checking functions.
277:810	31 These may be arbitrary LISP functions defined by the user, the arguments of whi~n are the extracted substructures.
278:810	A backtracking mechanism is also necessary for langu~e understanding as in other fields of artificial intelligence.
279:810	During the analysis, various sorts of heuristic information should be utilizable.
280:810	At any stage, analysis based on criteria which may relate to syntactic, semantic or contextual considerat ions taken separately may be unreliable.
281:810	The result which fulfils all the criteria, however, will be a correct one.
282:810	The program should be designed such that it can choose the most satisfactory rule from many candidates according to the criteria at hand.
283:810	In further processing, if the choice is found to be wrong by other criteria, the program must be able to backtrack to the point at which the .relevant decision was made.
284:810	In PLATON we can easily set up arbitrary numbers of decision points in the program.
285:810	Then, if subsequent processing results in some failure, control will come back to the points relevant to the cause of the failure.
286:810	11.
287:810	Pattern-matching Before proceeding to the detailed description of PLATON, we will explain the representation schema for input sentences and parsed trees.
288:810	The process of analyzing a sentence, roughly speaking, may be regarded as the process of transforming an ordered list of words to a tree structure, which shows explicitly the interrelationships of each word in the input sentence.
289:810	During the process, trees which correspond to the parts already analyzed, and 1hts which have not been processed yet, may coexist together in a single structure.
290:810	We therefore wish to represent such a coexisting structure of trees and lists.
291:810	A list structure is a structure in which the order of element is not changeable.
292:810	On the other hand, a tree structure consists of a single root node and several nodes which are tied to the root node by distinguishable relations.
293:810	Because relations between the root and the other nodes are explicitly specified, the order of nodes in a tree is changeable except for the root node which is placed in the leftmost position.
294:810	Different matching schemas will be applied to trees and lists.
295:810	The formal definition of such coexisting structures is as follows.
296:810	<structure> is the fundamental data-structure into which all data processed by PLATON must be transformed.
297:810	Hereafter we refer to this as the "structure" The formal definition of <structure) is: (list) ::= ($ ts tructures> ) (structures> : := 1 <structure> ( structures > <tree> : := ( node, I ( (node) < branches) ) <branches> : := (brancl~) 1 (branch, branches ) (branch) ::= (<relation> (tree, ) ( node, : := Clis t > I !UBITRARY LISP-ATOM < relation > : := ARBITRARY LISP-ATOM A simple example is shown in Figure 1.
298:810	Coexisting Structure of Trees and Lists Corresponding Expression in PLATON Figure 1 Expression of Structure in PLATON Two lists which have the same elements but different orderings (for example, (X A B C) and ($ A C B)), should be regarded as different structures.
299:810	On the other hand, two tree structures such as ( A ( R1 B ) ( R2 C )) and ( A ( R2 C )( R1 B )) are regarded as identical.
300:810	Besides the usual rewrite rules which treat such strings, s tructural patterns which contain variable expressions are permitted in PLATON.
301:810	The PLATON-interpreter matches structural patterns containing variable expressions against the structure under process and checks whether the specified pattern is found in it.
302:810	At the same time, the variables in the pattern are bound to the corresponding subs tructurzs . Variables in patterns are indicated as :X (X is an arbitrary LISP atom).
303:810	The following can be expressed by variables in the above definition (1) arbitrary numbers of < structures>, that is to say, list elements in the definition of < list > (Figure 2, Ex.
304:810	1).
305:810	We can also specify the Structural Pat terns Structures Results of Matching Example 1 SUCCESS In A :K C C Example 2 SUCCESS SUCCESS Figure 2 Illustration of Matching 34 number of list elements by indicating variables as :X+number.
306:810	For example, the variable :D2 will match with two elements in a list.
307:810	(2) arbitrary numbers of <branches >, in the definition of (tree > (Figure 2, Ex.
308:810	2).
309:810	(3) < tree) in the definition of < branch) (Figure 2, Ex.
310:810	3).
311:810	We shall fail such structural patterns (structure-1 > . By using the same variable several times in a pattern, we can express a structure in which the same sub-structure appears in two or more different places.
312:810	The character ! in a list indicates that the next element following the character is optional.
313:810	111 Basic Operations of PLATON A grammar, whether generative or analytical.
314:810	is represented as a directed graph with labeled states and branches.
315:810	There is one state dis tinguished as the Start State and a set of states called Final States.
316:810	Each branch is a rewriting rule and has the following elements: (1) applicability conditions of the rule, typically represented as a structural pattern (2) actions which must be executed, if the rule is applicable (3) a structural pattern into which the input structure should be transformed.
317:810	Each state has several branches ordered according to the preference of tho rules.
318:810	When the control jumps to a state, it checks the rules associated with the state one-by-one until it finds an applicable rule.
319:810	If such a rule is found, the input structure is transformed into another structure specified by the rule and the control makes the state transition.
320:810	35 In addition to the above basic mechanism the system is provided with push-down and pop-up operations.
321:810	The push-down operation is such that in the process of applying a rule, several substructures are extracted from the whole structure by variable binding mechanisms of pattern-matching.
322:810	Then each is analyzed from a different state.
323:810	The pop-up operation is such that after each substructure is analyzed appropriately, control comes back to the suspended rule and execution continues.
324:810	Usills these operations, embedded structures can be handled easily (See Figure 3) . Fipure 3 State Diapram Table 1 shows the formal definition cf a grarmr of PLATON (See following page).
325:810	It shows that branches or rewriting rules in an ATN parser correspond to six-tuples (i e. , (pcon), <strx>, dcon>, ( c transr ), ( 4acts> ), dendb . <strx> corresponds to the left side of a rewriting rule and describes the structural pattern to which a rule is applicable.

329:810	) I(TR /) 1 ARBITRARY LISP FORM <variable:: = :X (X is an arbitrary LISP atom) name 7 <register: : = /X (X is an arbitrary LISP atom) name) shows that a rule is applicable no matter what the structure under process is The variables used in (structure-1) are bound to corresponding substructures when matching succeeds.
330:810	The results of Example 1 (See Figure 2) indicate that the variable :K is bound to the substructure (* ( B ( R1 C)) D ) The scope of variable binding is limited to within the realm of the particular rule.
331:810	The same variable name in different rules has different interpretations.
332:810	In this sense, :X-type variables in < s tructure-I> are called Local Variables.
333:810	On the other hand, w2 can store certain kinds of results from the application of rules in registers and refer back to them in different rules.
334:810	These cons tftue variables which we call registers.
335:810	They are represented by the symbols /X (X is an arbitrary LISP atom).
336:810	Besides the pattern-matching, < peon> and < con ) can .~lso check the applicability of a rule.
337:810	Certain parts of the results from the application of previous rules are contained in registers, not in the structure.
338:810	We can check the contents of these registers by using < pcon > -part functions like GR, GU, etc.
339:810	(these functions are listed in Table 2) and other LISP functions defined by the usual LISP function, DEFINE.
340:810	(See following page for Table 2).
341:810	Semantic and contextual co-ordinatian between substruetures can be checked by using appropriate functions in the (con >-part of a rule.
342:810	Semantic and contextual analyses cannot be expressed in the form of simple rewriting rules.
343:810	These analyses have differing requirements such as lexical information about words which may in turn represent knowledge of the world and contextual information which may. express the state of the world.
344:810	We can use arbitrary LISP-forms in the 4 con 7 -part, according to what semantic and contextual models we choose.

351:810	:N and :N1 are the words of an input sentence.
352:810	SEM is a function defined by the user which checks the semantic co-ordination between the adjective :N and the noun :N1.
353:810	By this function SEM, we can search, if necessary, through both lexical entries and the contextual data bases.
354:810	Uith this approach, if a certain syntactic pattern is found in the input structure, it is possible for an appropriate semantic runction to be called.
355:810	Hence the intimate iiitcrcctions between syntactic and semantic components can be obtained easily without destroying the clarity of natural language grammars.
356:810	Arbitrary LISP-forms can be also used in <act> -portion.
357:810	They will be evaluated when the rule is applied.
358:810	If necessary, we can set intermediate results into registers and variables by using the functions listed in Table 2 (end > comprises f~ur varieties, and rules are divided into four types according to their ( end > types.
359:810	1.
360:810	NEXT-type : The < end+ is in the form (NEXT dstate-name, 4 s try> ) . The bstry) corresponds to the right side of a rewriting rule, and represents the transformed structure.
361:810	A rule of this type causes state-transition to the dstate-name), when it is applied.
362:810	2.
363:810	NEXTB-type: This rule also causes state-transition.
364:810	Unlike with the NEXT-type, state-saving is done and if further processing results in some failures, control comes back to the state where this rule is applied.
365:810	The environments, that is, the contents of various registers will be restored, and the next rule belonging to this state will be tried 40 3.
366:810	POP-type : The (end > -part of this type is in the form (POP <s try > ) When it is applied, the processing of this level is ended and the control returns to the higher level with the value stry > . 4.
367:810	FM-type: The <end )-part of this type is in the form (FM <failuremessage) ).
368:810	The side effects of he processing at this level, that is, register settings and so on, are cancelled (see section 4).
369:810	In <stry > we can use two kinds of variables, that is, the variables used in dstrx > and registers.
370:810	We find this structural pattern, called 4s tructure-2 >, more suitable for writing transformational rules than Woods BUILDkoperation.
371:810	By way of illustration consider the following: input string = CDE(A(Rl(* B)))FG) strx = (8 :I ( A ( Rl :N )) :J ) StrgT = (* (A ( FU (* :I :N ))( R2 /REG )) :J) the content of /REG = (G ( R3 H )) As the result of matching, the variables :I, :N and :J are bouad to the substructures (& C D E ), ($ B) and (3 F G ) respectively.
372:810	The result of evaluating the < stry > is ( ( A ( R1 (# C D E B ))( R2 ( G ( R3 H )))) F G ).
373:810	If the rule is a POP-type one, then this structure will be returned to the higher level processing.
374:810	If it is NEXTor NEXTB-type, then the control will move to the specified state with this structure.
375:810	IV Push-down and Pop-up Operations By means of NEXTB-type rules, we can set up decision points in a program.
376:810	We can also do this by using push-down and pop-up operations.
377:810	A rule in PLATON finds particular syntactic clues by its structural description ( strx> ; and at the same time, extracts substructures from the input st'king From the structural description it is predicted that the substructures may have particular constructions, that is, they may comprise noun phrases, relative clauses or whatever.
378:810	It is-necessary to transfer the subst~r~ctures to states appropriate for analyzing these constructions predicted and to return the analyzed structures back into the appropriate places In PLATON, these operations can be described in the Ctrans > -part of a rule.
379:810	For example, suppose the <trans >-part of a rule is ( (( Sl :K :K )) (( S2 ( :I :J)/REG )) ) When the cantrol interprets this statement, the substructures corresponding to the varuble :K and ( :I : J ) are transferred to the states S1 and S2 respectively If the processings starting from these states are normally completed (by a POP-type rule), then the results are stored i?
380:810	the variable :K and the regzster /REG.
381:810	In this manner, by means of the push-down and pop-up mechanisms, substructures can be analyzed from appropriate states.
382:810	Processing from kese states, however, may sometimes result in failure, That is, predictions that certain relationships will be found among the elements of substructures may not be fulfilled.
383:810	In such instances the pushed down state will send an error-message appropriate to the cause of the failure by an Wtype rule.
384:810	An FM-type rule points out that a certain error has occurred in the processing.
385:810	If NEXTB-type rules were used in the previous processing at this level, control will go back to the most recently used NEXTB-type rule.
386:810	If NEXTB-type rules were not used at this processing level, tne error-message specified by the FM-type rule will be sent to the <trans> part of the rule which directed this push-down operation (see Figure 4) Higher level Lower level p processing ------------/ / \ / \ I \ / \ rocessing~ \ ---I I \ I \ i \ / NExTB-type rules were not applied in this level Lower level processing c------/This rule will be applied next.
387:810	Figure 4 Illustration of Backtracking 43 According to these error-messages, control-flow can be changed appropriately.
388:810	For example, we can direct processings by describing the 4 trans > -part in the following way.
389:810	( (( sl :K :K )( ERR1 ( EXEC (( S5 :K :K 1) (( 56 ( :I :J ) /REG )))) ( ERR2 (TUNS ( S8 /))I ((S2 (j6 :I :J ) /REG )) ) In the above example, the processing of the substructure :K from the state S1 will produce one of the following three results.
390:810	According to the returned value, the appropriate step will be taken: (1) Normal return: the processing of :K is ended by a POP-type rule.
391:810	The result is stored in the variable :K and the next push-down performed, that is :I : J ) will be transferred to the state S2.
392:810	(2) Return with an error-message: the processing of :K results in a failure and an FM-type rule sends up an error-message.
393:810	If the message is ERR1, them :K and :f :J ) will be analyzed from the states S5 and S6 respectively (EXEC-type).
394:810	If it is ERRS, the interpreter will give up the application of the present rule, and pass the control to another state S8 (TRANStype).
395:810	If it is neither ERRl nor ERR2, the same step as (3) will be taken (3) Re turn with the value NIL: the processing Prom the state S1 will send up the value NIL if it runs into a blind alley, that is, there are no applicable rules.
396:810	The interpreter will give up the application of the present rule and proceed to the next rule attached to this state.
397:810	Mechanisms, such that control flow can be appropriately changed according to the error-messages from lower level processings are not found in Woods ATN parser, We can obtain flexible backtracking facilities by combining these mechanisms with NEXTBtype rules.
398:810	V A Simple Example We are now developing a deductive question-answering sys tern with natural language inputs -Japanese sentences.
399:810	The internal data-base is assumed to be a set of deep case structures of input sentences.
400:810	We adopted and modified Fillmore's (1968) case grammar to analyze the input of Japanese sentences.
401:810	Japanese is a typical example ofan SOV-language in which the object and other constituents governed by a verb usually appear before :he verb in s sentence.
402:810	A typical construction of a Japanese sentence is shown in Figure 5.
403:810	Figure 5 Typical Construction of a Japanese Sentence A verb may govern several noun phrases preceding it.
404:810	A relative clause modifying a noun may appear in the form -verD + noun -The right boundary of the clause is easily identified by finding the verb.
405:810	The left boundary is often much more difficult to identify.
406:810	In Figure 5, the noun phrase NPkr is a case element of the verb V On the other hand, the noun phrase NPi is governed by the verb Va Because the rule of projections holds in JaFnese as in other languages, all the noun phrases between NP c'+ I and V are governed by V, and the noun phrases before NP,: are governed by VA However, in the cou.rse of analysis, such boundaries cannot be determined uniquely.
407:810	The analysis program fixes a temporary boundary and proceeds to the next step in processing If the temporary boundary is not correct, the succeeding processing will fail and the control wil come back to the point at which the temporary boundary was fixed.
408:810	Now we will show a simple example of structural analysis by PLATON The example explains how the backtracking facility is used in analyzing Japanese sentences.
409:810	Because we want to visualize the operations of PLATON without bothering with microscopic details of Japanese sentences, we will take an imaginary problem as an example.
410:810	The parser which is written in PLATON is described in another paper by M Nagao and J. Tsujii (1976) An input string is assumed to be a list.
411:810	The elements of the list are integers and trees are in the form of ( X (SUM 0)).
412:810	Here 'X' may be regarded as a term modified by 'SUM 0' These two kinds of elements are arranged in an arbitrary order, except that the last element is the tree (X(SUM 0)).
413:810	The following is an example of an input string: ( 5 2 13 (x (Srn 0)) 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 ( x (SUM 0)) ) Figure 6 An Example String to be Analyzed The result of the transformation is expected to be in the following fotm: ( (X (Sm4)) (XSm6)) (X (Sm9)) 1 This result is regarded as representing the following relationships between integers and 'X' . The number associated with an 'X' by the relation 'SUM' shows the sum of the integers which are governed by the X. We can look upon the relations r between integers and an X' as the relations between noun phrases and the verb in Japanese sentences.
414:810	The result of the analysis is assumed to satisfy the following conditions.
415:810	46 (1) Governor-governed relationships between integers and an 'X' must obey the projection rule (i.e. , clauses do not overlap).
416:810	(2) As a simulation of a semantic restriction, we attach a condition that the sum of the integers governed by an 'X' should not erceed ten.
417:810	(3) As a simulation of a contextual restriction, we attach the condition that a result (F (X (SUM num-1)) (X (SUM num-2)) . . .
418:810	(X (SUM num-N)) ) should maintain the relation, numl 4 num-2 5 . . .
419:810	<um-N.
420:810	set 05 rules is shown in the following.
421:810	The corresponding statediagram is shown in Figure 7.

424:810	list shown in Figure 6.
425:810	Since the start state is SWP, the first rule attached to this state is applied.
426:810	This rule will find the leftmost 'x' and an integer just before the 'x' (by SUMUP -I-, strx).
427:810	The variable :I1 is bound to tius integer.
428:810	This integer is added to the sum of the integers, :N, if the total does not exceed ten (SUMUP -I-, con).
429:810	PUSHR, used in the < act > -part, is a PLATON function which puts the second argument on the head of the first argument (SUMUP -I-, act) After this rule is applied, the control will enter the state SUMUP again (SW -I-, end).
430:810	That is, this rtile is applied until there are no ~ntegers before the first ' X' or the sum of the integers.
431:810	exceeds ten.
432:810	As the result, the environment is the following: structure under processing = qY 5 (X (SUM 6)) 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) relationship temporarily fixed be tween integers and 'X' content of /REG =(213) The second rule of SUMUP will be applied next.
433:810	This rule checks by its 1 con> part whether the result at hand satisfies the third condition, that is, the contextual restriction.
434:810	Because the content of /RESULT is NIL, the function CONTEXTCHECK returns the value T (SllMUl' -2-, con).
435:810	So this rule is applicable.
436:810	Control makes the state-transition to the state BACKTRACK (SUMUP -2-, end).
437:810	Because the first rule of BACKTRACK is a NEXTBtype yule, state-saving is performed.
438:810	That is, tbe following environment is saved: content of /REG = ( 2 1 3) content of /RESULT = NIL structure under processing = # 5 (X (SUM 6)) 3 1 ( X (SUM 0)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 )) ) 49 By this rules, the registers /REG and /RESULT are set as follows ( BACKTRACK -I-, act).
439:810	/REG : = NIL /RESULT: = ( ( X (SUM 6 ) ) ) And the structure is transformed to (X 5 3 1 (X (SUM 0)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) A XEXTBtype rule causes a state transition as does a NEXT-type rule.
440:810	So control returns to the state SUMUP (BACKTRACK -I-, end) . At tt.is state, a process similar to the one described above is performed.
441:810	As a result, the following governor-dependent relationships are es tablished.
442:810	Here the bold lines indicate the newly established relationships.
443:810	By the first rule of BACKTRACK the following environment is saved.
444:810	content of /REG = ( 5 3 1 ) conten& of /RESULT = ( ( X (SLW 6 )) ) structure under processing = (# (X (SUM 9)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) And /REG and /RESULT are set as the following (BACKTRACK -1-, act) . /REG: = NIL /RESULT: = ( (X (SUM 6)) (X (SUM 9)) ) The transformed structure is (BACKTRACK -10, end) Cjl 2 2 (x (SUMO)) 1 The control is transferred to the state SUMUP.
445:810	By applying the first rule of this state repeatedly on the above structure the following structure is obtained.
446:810	(j( ( x SUM 4)) 1 50 However this result does not satisfy the con textual restriction.
447:810	So the application of the second rule of SLJMl.JP fails because the function CONTEXTCHECK used in <con ) -part returns the value NIL (SUMUP -2-, con) That is : con textcheck [( (X (SUM 6) ) (X (SUM 9) ) ) : (X (SUM 4)) 1 = NIL The third rule, therefore, will be applied next.
448:810	Because this rule is a %type rule (SUMUP -3-, end), it causes an error and control comes back to the point at which a NEXTB-type rule was applied most recently.
449:810	The saved nviro~ment is restored.
450:810	This is: /REG: = ( 5 3 1 ) /RESULT: = ( (X (SUM 6)) ) structure under processing: = (* (X (SUM 9)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) Then by applying the second rule of BACKTRACK, the governor-governed relationship established lastly in the previous process is cancelled.
451:810	The structure and the register /REG are changed as below (BACKTRACK -2-, act) : /REG: = ( 3 1 ) structure under processing: ( 5 (X (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0 )) ) Control enters the BACKTRACK state again.
452:810	The application of the first rule saves the environ~wnt : content of /REG = ( 3 1 ) content of /RESULT = ( (X (SUM 6)) structure under processing = (1< 5 ( X (SUM 4)) 2 2 (X (SUM 0)) ) That is, the relationship indicated by the dotted line in the following is cancelled: Control transits to the state SUMUP (BACKTRACK -I-, end) and a similar process is performed.
453:810	However, because the governor-governed relationship between the integer 5 and the second 'Xr is cancelled, the sum of the integers governed by the first 'X', ( 2 1 3 ), is greater than that of the second ' X', ( 3 1 ) . The contextual condition, therefore, is not fulfilled, and the application of the second rule of SUMUP will not succeed.
454:810	So the temporarily established relationships will be cancelled one-by-one as follows.
455:810	After these relationships have been cancelled, the desired result is obtained by the following sequence.
456:810	52 At the final stage of the processing, the fourth rule of SW a POP-type rule, is applied and returns the value ( (X (SUM 4)) CX (SUM 6)) (X (SUM 9) 1 VI Conclusion We have described a programming language called PLATON for natural language processing.
457:810	The language has several additional capabilities beyond the ATN parser of W. Woods.
458:810	Grammars written in the language not only maintain clarity of representation but also provide adequately a natural interface between the syntactic component and other components.
459:810	By means of the pattern-matching facility, we can write grammars in a quite natural manner.
460:810	And because of the PLATON variable binding mechanism, semantic and contextual LISP fuactions a easily incorporated in syntactic patterns.
461:810	Flexible backtracking mechanisms and push-down operations make com-, r, Acatecr non-deterministic processing possible in a very simple way.
462:810	We are now deveLoping an analysis program for Japanese using this language.
463:810	The program can accept fairly complicated sentences in a textbook of elementary chemistry It can utilize the lexical and contextual information of chemistry adequately during the analysis.
464:810	Such information in our system is expressed in the form of a semantic network similar to that of R. F. Simmons (1973).
465:810	Perhaps, PLATON itself must be equipped with more semantics and context-oriented operations such as specified lexical descriptions and functions using them.
466:810	However, what description method is most efficient, and moreover, what semantic information must be stored in the lexicon, are not yet entirely clear.
467:810	So, as the first step, PLATON leaves many parts of these problems for 53 the user to specify by LISP programs.
468:810	PLAMN is written in LIS1'1.5 and implemented on a FACOM 230-60 at the Kyoto University computing center and a TOSBAC-40 mini-computer in our laboratory.
469:810	The interpreter of PLATON itself requires only 4.5 K cells.

471:810	A directory of members also appeared.
472:810	Early in 1975, the Journal announced an experimental procedure for review of submiesions; the author could submit a 600-word summary for distribution to all members of the Editorial Board, If the last 30 submissions, 15 have used this procedure.
473:810	Contributors and Board members appear satisfied with the results.
474:810	The number of microfiches distributed in the 1975 subcription was 22, up from the 14 distributed to I974 members.
475:810	But the number of frames increased from 900 to 1700, roughly; as anticipated, the average number of frames filled is going up Since the first announcement of the Journal, 86 submissions have been received.
476:810	Their present status is shown at the top of the following frame.

478:810	Of the 7 then out for major re sion, two have been published.
479:810	We might thus expect to publish as many as 7 or 8 of the manuscripts now out for revision, making a total of about 36 of 81 received; our ultimate acceptance rate may be around 45%.
480:810	The financial support of the National Science Foundation, which continued through 1975, and the unpaid help of both the State University of New York and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (the latter is processing bibliographies and indexes) have been most significant in establishing the new Journal.

483:810	By the end of January, 200 replies had arrived and the rate of arrival had diminished * The present report makes no interpretations or explanations; the figures are here for the Editorial Board, the Executive Committee, and the members to examine.
484:810	All written comments received in response to the questionnaire are presented following the numerical data.
485:810	Members who have strong opinions about the policy the Association should adopt may write to any officer of the Journal or Association; but prompt action is needed in order to permit planning and development of manuscripts for the 1977 volume.
486:810	* The issue left the editor on November 7; the questionnaire was to be returned "by December 31'!
487:810	Due to unforeseen delays, the issue reached readers beginning mediately after Christmas in the Washington area, and late in January in Hawail and abroad.

574:810	LONG COMMENTS Here's my survey questionnaire.
575:810	Anent the decision as to where to go from here, I have a very strong recommendation to make.
576:810	I think you're in a pioneering position on something very important, and should stick with it, certainly for at least two or three more years if at all possible.
577:810	The major difficulty and source of objections, I think, is not any of the arguments against microfiche that you outline, but simply the difficulty people have in adopting radically new habits in such a fundamental activity as reading.
578:810	Which Srings me to the second point.
579:810	I think that as a pioneer, the Editorial Board of the AJCL has a responsibility to try to make the experimentsucceed, and not just sit back and watch.
580:810	Specifically, I think it's very important to make available to subscribers a microfiche reader which works reasonably well, is not terribly expensive, and most importantly, is easy to acquire.
581:810	I would bet that if you arranged with a manufacturer or dealer to supply a small, practical reader in the $25-$35 price range, which people could order simply by writing their name and address on an addressed, postage-paid return card included in an MCL packet, at least a hundred would be sold within a month You wbuld have done your readers a service, and would alsb have broadened the base of those who are in a position to make use of the micro iche format.
582:810	There are a variety of details to-be considered in implementing such a plan, for instance, that.
583:810	the supplier should be prepared to make exchanges for defective units, but I'm sure that the members of the Editorial Board are as alert to these as I am.
584:810	I would appreciate hearing what reaction people have to this suggestion.
585:810	Paul G. Chapin National Science Foundatioa Washington, D.C. 20550 I am quite pleased at receiving the AJCL on microfiche and would hope that other organizations to which I belong would at least offer optional microfiche subscriptions to their journals.
586:810	I find myself inundated with prfnted publications and am running out of space to store these valuable documents; I do not want my office or my home turned into a library.
587:810	When I receive a copy of the AJCL, I read through the opaque cards looking for paper summaries that interest me. When I find such a paper, I use the department's microfiche reader to browse through it.
588:810	Occasionally I have the library make a paper copy for me so that I can study papers without access to a microfiche viewer.
589:810	One service which I think might be useful for ATCL subscribers without such convenient access to hard-copy microfiche machines would be an opaque card which one could use to order paper copies of selected articles.
590:810	James R. Rhyne Department of Computer Science University of Houston, Texas 77004 The microfiche journal is the best thing ACL has got going for it.
591:810	In che last couple of years, I've been letting my memberships in a number of organizations lapse.
592:810	One of the principal reasons is that I simply can't cope with the flood of paper which results from memberships.
593:810	My house and office get cluttered up with stacks of magazines that can't be chucked because one article in a dozen looks as if it ought to be read some time.
594:810	It's gotten to the point where new issues go straight from the mailbox to the recyclery.
595:810	For this "servfce", one pays extra.
596:810	Microfiche solves that; I've got two years' worth of ACL output in a 6" x 6%'' metal box, and there's room far two more years.
597:810	If I ever run out of room for metal boxes, I can cull out selected cards.
598:810	11 By all means, make your experiment" permanent!
599:810	Anonymous More notes on your questionnaire!
600:810	(1) I have been getting IEEE Computer, IEEE Computer Transactions, and IEEE Spectrum since 1969 on microfiche.
601:810	I no longer have paper copies of these earlier issues.
602:810	I bought a cheap microfiche reader in 1969.
603:810	(2) I bought a Realist (Xerox 320) l.fi .rears ago.
604:810	(3) 1 also get now AJCL Journal (yours), Scientific American (Bell & Howell), IEEE Software Engineering regularly on microfiche.
605:810	(4) I buy selected titles from NTIS and University Microfj-Lms (Micromedia--kids books) . 1 subscribe to NTIS computer xeekly abstracts @$3O/yr.
606:810	No company reimbursement.
607:810	(5) After a years research I have produced my first amateur microfiche at home which dops on a Bruning.
608:810	(So I now will be a publisher)!
609:810	(6) I am a microfilm/microEiche COM expert in Management Systems at work (only part time).
610:810	I am a systems analyst on data center management software .
611:810	(7) Being an engineer and an analyst AJCL is currently a peripheral area of interest.
612:810	I would not have joined your organization if your journal was only on paper.
613:810	I got into microfilming because I was running out of space.
614:810	(8) I believe I will be able to keep a tremendously large number of journals, magazines, professional or pleasure reading books if they are on microfiche.
615:810	By keeping good inventories in a safety deposit box I will have good insurance and replacement in case of fire.
616:810	49) Able to microfilm (fiche) myself I will be able to archive (and back up against fire) any book or paper I work on.
617:810	It would be easier to correspond and exchange papers with someone around the world or U.S. Lower postage.
618:810	(10) I would like to see all hard bound and paper back books, all magazines available on microfiche.
619:810	The savings for the Library of Congress and copyright off ice would be tremendous.
620:810	These fiche should also be available to individuals from the publishers.
621:810	(11) I also get the ACM Communications, and ACM Surveys on fiche I trust I will see the results of your survey, and maybe my letter, in the next AJCL Newsletter.
622:810	Neil R. Karl 21425 Duns Scotus Sauthfield, Michigan 48075 Your recent questionnaire on the AJCL format invited additional comment I may be biased but I think micropublication of our journal is a superb answer to the twin problems of skyrocketing publication/distribution costs and the need to disseminate more information to students of this growing field.
623:810	No serious student or scholar should be without a microfiche reader.
624:810	Good compact readers from $100 (the Bell & Howell Brief CaS e reader) to $214 (the Washington Scientific Industries Mini-Cat) are available.
625:810	Surely a modest investment for a life-time of use.
626:810	I do think, however, that you can more effectively package the microfiche for increased user convenience.
627:810	There are two basic approaches: 1) Bind fiche envelopes and the eye-legible cards together before they are distributed to subscribers or 2) provide subscribers with a conyenient microfiche binder file.
628:810	Thomas F. Deahl, Microdoc 8 I 5 Parnont~r T.ane Phi Iarlelnhia 19119 " -HI r ----.a ----I -------r-------It is my opinion that far from being a disadvantage, microfiche is a positive advantage.
629:810	Already a large amount of my home and office space is devoted to storing technical journals which I have saved over the years, and as time passes the problem will only get worse.
630:810	I only hope that you will continue to distribute AJCL on fiche, and that other journals will follow your example.
631:810	I do, however,find the small size of the opaque cards to be inconvenient.
632:810	Perhaps you could combine all the opaque cards in each issue into one or two 85x11" sheets, which could be folded when mailed, then spread open and collected in a looseleaf or other book when received.
633:810	Norman Haas 35-20 Leverich Street Jackson Heights, N .Y. 11372 While having the freedom to publish very detailed accounts of large programs is useful I think that a more space conscious medium would encourage more concise descriptions.
634:810	The freedom to be verbose does not strike me as a good idea in this field!
635:810	Also, it is difficult to judge the effect of the microfiche format on soliciting manuscripts because the journal is new and thus has no developed prestige.
636:810	Unsigned Although I do not object to microfiche format, I find the organization of opaque cards and fiche sometimes confusing and easily disordered.
637:810	Unsigned I'd like to see ACL offer--at a good price--a fiche reader.
638:810	My intuitive requirements are 1) "book-page" size image, 2) stowable, 3) transportable, 4) under $100.
639:810	Comment?
640:810	Peter Z. Ingerman 40 Needlepoint Lane Willi~orq.
641:810	N =J. -080.46 I 12lieve the best alternative would be to 1) continue journal on micro iche, 2) arrange to sell inexpensive readers to subscribers through ACL (or widely publicize where and for how much readers are available) 3) offer hard copy versions of articles by individual order.
642:810	Unsigned I am a computer programer by profession and my interest in linguis tics extends only to those areas which are directly applicable to computers.
643:810	Even there my interest is more concerned with the practical side rather than with esoteric theory.
644:810	Since most of what you print can only be considered as future referent material by me, your printing of the journal on microfiche is eminently satisfying to me; in fact, if you switched entirely to paper, I would have to seriously consider my continued receiving of the j ournal . Robert D. Kluto 2179 Pacific Avenue San Francisco, California 94115 SHORT COMMENTS General Fiche is good for scanning and storing info where only occasional reference is needed.
645:810	Paper copy needd for the few papers of frequently needed reference.
646:810	It didn't even reach me until Jan. 5.
647:810	probably due to a poorly registered address label.
648:810	(I bet il lot don't make it if they're all as bad as mine).
649:810	I am a student and could not afford AJCL publications in printed form.
650:810	You might make the microfiche envelope larger (to contain the opaque copy) and use face of envelope to print information on it You should have asked how long I was a member to interpret this stuff.
651:810	Sorry this is late One of my major reasons for subscribing to AJCL is that it is published in microfiche.
652:810	For $10 a year I am very satisfied.
653:810	You might consider negative contrast to ease the eye strain I haven't found time to read articles but expect to and like the format.
654:810	Love fiche.
655:810	At this moment Itan not working directly in the field of CL. PLEASE NOTE: Negative, rather than positive, microfiche provides the clearest and easiest to read copy.
656:810	An option for negative fiche-copy would encourage a great deal of new memberships.
657:810	1) Do offer printed copies.
658:810	than "prestige" (whose)?
659:810	2) Currency is far more important Only major complaint about fiche is that all the readers are lousy on the eyes.
660:810	I prefer to be forced to get used to microfiche because paper should not be wasted.
661:810	Despite the current inconvenience for me of microfiche publication, I am in favor of continued publication on the grounds that maybe it'll spread and eventually encourage better reader technology.
662:810	A lot of good work is being done by people who are not too famous; it's very importarlt that it should be published inexpensively somewhere.
663:810	Question 1.
664:810	Answer 1: But unrelated to microfiche as medium.
665:810	Answer 0 : Because "go to inconvenienr place".

681:810	Question 5.
682:810	Answer all checked: Papers not accepted submitted elsewhere.
683:810	Question 6.
684:810	Answer yes: But it gains others who need the pages.
685:810	Most likely.
686:810	But it is still experimental.
687:810	Give it a chance.
688:810	Loses some but gains others that are too long for publication elsewhere.
689:810	Probably.
690:810	Difficult ta be sure since it is a new j ournal . At least it would lose mine.
691:810	But because of the format, gains others.
692:810	Balance Answer no: Don't know but I suspect not since alternatives are so few.
693:810	I feel there is more prestige in microform.
694:810	Question 7.
695:810	Answer yes: Inconvenient and costly.
696:810	But not good.
697:810	Probably, I don't really know.
698:810	New one.
699:810	I haven ' t used it yet, don ' t know how we1 $ it works.

707:810	Answer 1: For use with students.
708:810	Answer 2-3 : Good idea.
709:810	This is the best offer yet--a postcard return to get paper copies of wanted articles only.
710:810	No answer : Probably too expensive (postage) . Depends on the article content; question is not very good.
711:810	Question 9.
712:810	Answer fiche: With option of question 8.
713:810	With option of #8, option of Finite String as part of this option, devote several cards of an issue to microfiche readers, their advantages and disadvantages and cost.
714:810	(To "mixed") NO! One format only.
715:810	.Answer mixed: Fiche with option to order hard copy.
716:810	Bit depends on which goes where.
717:810	Answer other: EithPr fiche or paper but not mixed.

721:810	Depends on mix.
722:810	Question 10.
723:810	Answer no: Would use a library copy and Xerox.
724:810	Probably not.
725:810	Offer on paper only.
726:810	Answer ? Yes and no; pay more for the larger journal to continue; prefer microfiche.
727:810	Stupid question--depends on question 8 situation.
728:810	If paper copies of separate articles not available probably so--otherwise not.
729:810	Question 11.
730:810	Answer continue: Continue a "fairly" satisfactory method.
731:810	Would buy "possibly if other material also available.
