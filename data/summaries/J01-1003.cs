Johnson (1984) presents a scheme for inducing phonological rules from surface data, mainly in the context of studying certain aspects of language acquisition.

Analyzer Architecture We adopt the general approach advocated by Karttunen (1994) and build the morphological analyzer as the combination of several finite-state transducers, some of which are constructed directly from the elicited information, and others of which are constructed from the output of the machine learning stage.

The morphographemic rules describing changes in spelling as a result of affixation operations are induced from the examples provided by using transformation-based learning (Brill 1995; Satta and Henderson 1997).

Furthermore, since the language informant provides only a small number of examples, statistically motivated approaches like the one suggested by Theron and Cleoete (1997) are not applicable.

More recently, Theron and Cloete (1997) have presented a scheme for obtaining two-level morphology rules from a set of aligned segmented and surface pairs.

in the sense in which it is used in transformation-based learning (Brill 1995).

On the other hand, this approach as such is inapplicable to languages like Arabic, which have radically different word formation processes (for which a number of other finite-state approaches have been proposed; (see, for example, Beesley \[1996\] and Kiraz \[2000\]).

This list is then processed by a transformation-based learning paradigm (Brill 1995; Satta and Henderson 1997), as illustrated in Figure 4.

Currently the provisions we have for such constraints are limited to writing regular expressions (albeit at a much higher level than standard regular expressions); however, capturing such constraints using a more natural language (e.g., Ranta 1998) can be incorporated into future versions.
W98-1308
Our approach is as follows: we use the resulting morphological analyzer with an error-tolerant finite-state recognizer engine (Oflazer 1996).

These rules are then composed into one finite-state transducer (Kaplan and Kay 1994).
J94-3001
Since language informants are not expected or required to be well-versed in computational linguistics in general, or in recent approaches to building morphological analyzers (e.g., Koskenniemi 1983; Antworth 1990; Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Karttunen 1994) and the operation of state-of-the-art finite-state tools (e.g., Karttunen 1993; Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen et al.1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1998; van Noord 1999; van Noord and Gerdemann 1999) in particular, the generation of the morphological analyzer component has to be accomplished semiautomatically.
