For evaluation we have selected a set of 8 metric variants corresponding to seven different families: BLEU (n = 4) (Papineni et al., 2001), NIST (n = 5) (Lin and Hovy, 2002), GTM F1-measure (e = 1,2) (Melamed et al., 2003), 1-WER (Nie√üen et al., 2000), 1-PER (Leusch et al., 2003), ROUGE (ROUGE-S*) (Lin and Och, 2004) and METEOR3 (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).

The approach which is closest to ours is that by Schafer and Yarowsky (2003) who suggested a combination of models based on shallow syntactic analysis (part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking).

and Further Work Many researchers remain sceptical about the usefulness of linguistic information in SMT, because, except in a couple of cases (Charniak et al., 2003; Collins et al., 2005), little success has been reported.

Then, running GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), we obtain token alignments for each of the data views.

In the last years, many efforts have been devoted to this matter (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003).
