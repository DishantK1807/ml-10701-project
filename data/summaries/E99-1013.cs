Mutual information compares the probability of the co-occurence of words a and b with the independent probabilities of occurrence of a and b (Church and Hanks, 1990).
J90-1003
Our syntactic-relation-based thesaurus is based on the method proposed by Hindle (1990), although Hindle did not apply it to information retrieval.
P90-1034
Words appearing in similax grammatical contexts are assumed to be similar, and therefore classified into the same class (Lin, 1998; Grefenstette, 1994; Grefenstette, 1992; Ruge, 1992; Hindle, 1990).
P90-1034 P98-2127
The similarity between two words is then defined as the Dice coefficient of the two feature vectors (Lin, 1998).
