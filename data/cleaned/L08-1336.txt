The software tool Transcriber (Barras et al., 2001) is employed for this Figure 2: The Czech WoZ Recording Room Set up purpose. The time alignment between speech and discussed photographs also needs to be stored for the dialoguemanagement purposes. 3</context>

Researchers constantly go back, as a sort of Rosetta stone, to the ATT SWITCHBOARD corpus (Godfrey et al., 1992) in spite of all its limitations, rather in the way other areas of NLP was over-focussed on the Wall Street Journal Corpus in the 1990s.

Future Data in Companions Elsewhere we have set out the initial and more sophisticated learning mechanisms we are applying to the Companions corpus to derive an initial Dialogue Management system (Pinto et al., 2008)3, based on a stack and Dialogue Action Forms (DAFs) intended to capture overall dialogue context. Our methodology for obtaining fresh data from this initial implementation relies on the PhotoPal par</context>

In a normal Wizard of Oz experiment, the user believes they are talking to a system while in fact the system is being controlled by a human being (Strauss et al., 2006). In our case the emphasis was on collecting naturally occurring dialogues relevant to the domain rather than obscuring the use of humans. For the SC, a number of subjects were asked to reminisce abo</context>
