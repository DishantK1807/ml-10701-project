The linguistic meaning, built in parallel with the syntax, is represented using Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS), a hybrid logic representation which allows a compositional, unification-based construction of HLDS terms with CCG (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).

MMCCG is a lexicalist grammar formalism in which application of combinatory rules is controlled though context-sensitive specification of modes on slashes (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003).

To handle imprecision and informality, we constructed an ontological knowledge base containing domain-specific interpretations of the predicates (Horacek and Wolska, 2004).

More details on the lexical-semantic stage of interpretation can be found in (Wolska and KruijffKorbayov´a, 2004b), and more details on the domain ontology are presented in (Horacek and Wolska, 2004).
