Work Existing methods for sentence ordering are divided into two approaches: making use of chronological information (McKeown et al., 1999; Lin 385 and Hovy, 2001; Barzilay et al., 2002; Okazaki et al., 2004); and learning the natural order of sentences from large corpora not necessarily based on chronological information (Lapata, 2003; Barzilay and Lee, 2004).

Barzilay and Lee (2004) have proposed content models to deal with topic transition in domain specific text.
N04-1015
The underlying idea of Formula 14 was proposed by Papineni et al.(2002) as the BLEU metric for the semi-automatic evaluation of machine-translation systems.

Lapata (2003) has suggested a probabilistic model of text structuring and its application to the sentence ordering.
P03-1069
The previous studies (Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003) employ rank correlation coefficients such as Spearman’s rank correlation and Kendall’s rank correlation, assuming a sentence ordering to be a rank.
P03-1069
Even though we could not compare our experiment with the probabilistic approach (Lapata, 2003) directly due to the difference of the text corpora, the Kendall coefficient reported higher agreement than Lapata’s experiment (Kendall=0.48 with lemmatized nouns and Kendall=0.56 with verb-noun dependencies).

This criterion is a formalization of the sentence-ordering algorithm proposed by Okazaki et al, (2004).
C04-1108
Okazaki et al.(2004) have proposed an algorithm to improve chronological ordering by resolving the presuppositional information of extracted sentences.
C04-1108
Intrinsic evaluation that involves human judges to rank a set of sentence orderings is a necessary approach to this task (Barzilay et al., 2002; Okazaki et al., 2004).
C04-1108 N04-1015
Okazaki et al.(2004) propose a metric that assess continuity of pairwise sentences compared with the gold standard.
