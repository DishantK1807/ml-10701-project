Bangalore et al.(2001) and Barzilay and Lee (2002) both applied the technique of multi-sequence alignment (MSA) to align parallel corpora and produced similar FSAs.

Since the co-training-based algorithm of Barzilay and McKeown (2001) takes parallel corpus as input, we created out of the MTC corpus 55 × 993 sentence pairs (Each equivalent translation set of cardinality 11 was mapped into parenleftbig112 parenrightbig equivalent translation pairs.).

And researchers in multi-document text summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999), information extraction (Shinyama et al., 2002), and question answering (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002) have focused on identifying and exploiting paraphrases in the context of recognizing redundancies, alternative formulations of the same meaning, and improving the performance of question answering systems.

Natural language generation researchers have used paraphrasing to increase the expressive power of generation systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Lenke, 1994; Stede, 1999).

It’s still possible to use MSA if, for example, the input is pre-clustered to have the same constituent ordering (Barzilay and Lee (2003)).
N03-1003
In previous work (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002), paraphrases are represented as sets or pairs of semantically equivalent words, phrases, and patterns.

Given a sentence group, we pass each of the 11 sentences to Charniak’s (2000) parser to get 11 parse trees.

We compare the paraphrases we collect with paraphrases that are derivable from the same corpus using a cotraining-based paraphrase extraction algorithm (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001).
