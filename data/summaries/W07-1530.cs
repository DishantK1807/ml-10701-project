(Teufel et al., 1999) reports on interannotator agreement studies with this scheme.

Secondly, unlike in the RST corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) or the Discourse GraphBank (Wolf and Gibson, 2005), discourse segments are not separately annotated, with annotators then identifying what discourse relations hold between them.

The PCC176 (Stede, 2004) is a sub-corpus that is available upon request for research purposes.

In addition, we annotated coreference (PoCos (Krasavina and Chiarcos, 2007)) and rhetorical structure according to RST (Mann and Thompson, 1988).

Following the approach towards discourse structure in (Webber et al., 2003), the PDTB takes a lexicalized approach, treating discourse connectives as the anchors of the relations and thus as discourse-level predicates taking two Abstract Objects as their arguments.

It has been difficult to identify all and only those cases where a token functions as a discourse connective, and in many cases, the syntactic analysis in the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) provides no help.

Discourse Treebank (Bonnie Webber, Edinburgh) The Penn Discourse TreeBank (Miltsakaki et al., 2004; Prasad et al., 2004; Webber, 2005) annotates discourse relations over the Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993), in terms of discourse connectives and their arguments.

193 Also annotated in the PDTB is the attribution of each discourse relation and of its arguments (Dinesh et al., 2005; Prasad et al., 2007).

First, because the PDTB annotates both structural and anaphoric connectives (Webber et al., 2003), a span can serve as argument to >1 connective.

Therefore, a part of the computational linguistics corpus has a second layer of annotation, called CFC (Teufel et al., 2006) or Citation Function Classification.

Corpus (Simone Teufel, Cambridge) The Argumentative Zoning (AZ) annotation scheme (Teufel, 2000; Teufel and Moens, 2002) is concerned with marking argumentation steps in scientific articles.
