However, in contrast to our approach, supervised training was used by Johnson et al.(1999). In the second approach, log-linear models of LFG grammars were trained on a text corpus of about 36,000 sentences.

Unfortunately, most of the proposed probability models are not mathematically clean in that the probabilities of all possible UBG readings do not sum to the value 1, a problem which is discussed intensively by Eisele (1994), Abney (1997), and Schmid (2002).

The best models of Riezler et al.(2000) achieved a precision, which is only slightly lower than ours.

Work and Discussion The most direct points of comparison of our method are the approaches of Johnson et al.(1999) and Riezler et al.(2000), esp.

Novel Disambiguation for UBGs (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) suggest that, given a UBG, the approximated CFG can be used as a cheap filter during a two-stage parsing approach.

In more detail, the kernel of our novel disambiguation method for UBGs consists of the application of a context-free approximation for a given UBG (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and the exploitation of the standard probability model for CFGs.
C00-2155
All approaches have in common that they try to model a probability distribution over the readings of the UBG, which can be used to rank the competing analyses of a given sentence; see, e.g., Briscoe and Carroll (1993), Eisele (1994), Brew (1995), Abney (1997), Goodman (1997), Bod and Kaplan (1998), Johnson et al.(1999), Riezler et al.(2000), Osborne (2000), Bouma et al.(2001), or Schmid (2002).

The application of the method to a mid-size UBG of English, and largesize HPSGs of English and Japanese is described in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002) and (Kiefer et al., 2000).

The abstraction is specified by means of a restrictor (Shieber, 1985), the so-called lexicon restrictor.

An in-depth description of the method, containing lots of details, plus a mathematical underpinning is presented in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002).
