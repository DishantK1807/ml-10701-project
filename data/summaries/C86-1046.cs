For the sake of comparison, let us consider the following example which Pereira 1981 uses in order to illustrate Extraposition Grammar: (3) The mouse that the cat that likes fish chased squeaks, The following DRL-tree depicts the dependencies and the word order of this sentence by means of the attributes just defined: (4) (ILLOCUTION: assertion: adj<l> (PREDICATE: squeak: adj<l> (SUBJECT: mouse: adj<l> (DETERMINER: the: seq<l>) (ATTRIBUTE: chase: adj<2> (OBJECT: that: lim<l>) (SUBJECT: cat: adj<l> (DETERMINER: the: adj<l>) (ATTRIBUTE: like: adj<2> (SUBJECT: that: lim<l>) (OBJECT: fish: adj<2>))))))); The projection of subtrees and their attributes yields the following constituent analysis of the input string: (5) the mouse that the cat that \[ e squeaks likes fish chased \[ adj<l> the \[, mouse --~ \[ that the cat I seq<l> adj<2> \] that likes \[ \] fish chased that \[ +---chased \[ lim<l> tile cat that likes fish \[ < I adj<l> the I *cat --~ \[ that likes fish I adj<l> adj<2> I that \] ~---likes--~ \] fish I lim<l> adj<2> I There is exactly one sequence of words that is in agreement with all of the attribute-values in the tree.
