We proved 4There are also other lists of semantic relations used by the research community (e.g., (Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998)), but empirically that this set is encoded by noun – noun pairs in noun phrases and is a subset of our larger list of 35 semantic relations.

They can vary from a few prepositions (Lauer, 1995) to hundreds and even thousands more specific semantic relations (Finin, 1980).

Currently, the best-performing English NP interpretation methods in computational linguistics focus mostly on two consecutive noun instances (noun compounds) and are either (weakly) supervised, knowledge-intensive (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), (Rosario et al., 2002), (Moldovan et al., 2004), (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006), (Pennacchiotti and Pantel, 2006), (Kim and Baldwin, 2006), (Snow et al., 2006), (Girju et al., 2005; Girju et al., 2006), or use statistical models on large collections of unlabeled data (Berland and Charniak, 1999), (Lapata and Keller, 2004), (Nakov and Hearst, 2005), (Turney, 2006).

The resulting English corpus contained 10,000 sentences which were syntactically parsed (Charniak, 2000).

Lauer (Lauer, 1995), for example, considers a set of eight prepositions as semantic classification categories that can link the head and the modifier nouns in a noun compound: of, for, with, in, on, at, about, and from.
P95-1007
The training data was annotated with contextual features based on two state-ofthe-art classification tag sets: Lauer’s set of 8 prepositions (Lauer, 1995) and our list of 22 semantic relations.
