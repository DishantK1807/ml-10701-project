Machine Translation Based on NLG from XML-DB Yohei Seki Aoyama Gakuin / Department of Informatics, University The Graduate University for Advanced Studies (Sokendai) Ken'ichi Harada Department of Computing Science Keio University Abstract The purpose of this study is to propose a new method for machine translation.
Wehave proceeded through with two projects for report generation (Kittredge and Polguere, 2000) : Weather Forecast and Monthly Economic Report to be produced in four languages : English, Japanese, French, and German.
Their input data is stored in XML-DB.
We applied a three-stage pipelined architecture (Reiter and Dale, 2000), and each stage was implemented as XML transformation processes.
Weregard XML stored data as language-neutral intermediate form and employ the so-called `sublanguage approach' (Somers, 2000).
The machine translation process is implemented via XMLDB as a kind of interlingua approach instead of the conventional structure transfer approach.
1 Introduction
As the variety of users accessing the common resources on the World Wide Web, the importance of multimedia and multilingual information presentation technology has increased.
Machine translation technology is essential for multilingual presentations, and many researchers pursue language independent structures;; i.e.
Rassinoux et al.(1998), etc.
Many semantic structures like`semantic frame' or `feature structures' have been developed and common language attributes were embedded in these structures.
On the other hand, to store the resources, there were lots of databases all over the world.
Those DBs stored in relational style with numerical data format would necessarily have language independent features.
There, however, was a gap between DB structures and language independent semantic structures.
Recently, the XML-DB technologies have been developed to support a more structured function for databases.
The structuring techniques are useful not only for data structure but to represent linguistic structures.
Wedeveloped the XML-based report generation system as in Figure 1.
The system is based on a three-stage pipelined architecture : document planning, microplanning, and surface realization.
This system produces four languages : Japanese, English, French, and German from the common resources.
The system also supports the publishing in VoiceXML format 1 and synthesis function by using IBM websphere VoiceServer SDK 2. Therefore, this system is also useful for handicapped people like the visually handicapped to share information.

XML-Based Report Generation System This paper consists of four sections.
In Section 2, we discuss language independent and dependent features.
Section 3 details multilingual generation and voice synthesis technologies in our system.
Finally, in Section 4, we present our conclusions.

3: The Ontologies for Monthly Economic Reports 2 Language Independence and Dependency on Discourse Unit 2.1 Language Independence The intentional structure to retrieve data from DB is based on language-independent ontological structure (Rassinoux et al., 1998).
Although wetake the input database whichis originally provided with RDB style format 3, the input data is restructured according to an ontologically-formulated structure with XML format.
In case of the `weather forecast', our 3 In fact, our weather domain input data is the Annual Report published by the Japan Meteorological Agency (http ://www.jmbsc.or.jp/oine/cd0040.htm).
On the other hand, our economy domain input data is retrieved from NEEDS (Nikkei Economic Electronic Databank System, http ://www.nqi.co.jp/english/needs/n top.html). data from each observatory pointwas structured according to place names.
On the other hand, in case of the `economy report', each numeric item was structured according to the contents of each heading.
These structures are shown in Figures 2 and 3.
2.2 Lexical
Variation Depends on Discourse Unit In order to generate individual languages, lexical paraphrasing processes according to discourse units must be carried out.
For example, the numerical data concerning `increasing' and `decreasing' expressions in Japanese varies according to the subject;; i.e. prices : increasing = `joushou';; decreasing = `geraku' and other subjects : increasing = `zou';; decreasing = `gen'.
We implement this paraphrasing as a surface realization process within discourse unit.
3 Multilingual
Generation and Voice Synthesis The system is based on a three-stage pipelined architecture : document planning, microplanning, and surface realization.
The document planning stage is independent of individual languages.
The microplanning stage contains the process of conversion for lexical paraphrasing of each language.
The surface realization module is dependent on each language.
3.1 Document
Planning The document planning module consists of two tasks : `document structuring' and `content determination'.
The code fragmentofeachtask is shown in Appendix A.
In the Economy Reports' case, the output data is produced based on the previous one to three months data.
Our input data is stored in Yggdrasill, the XML-DB product of Mediafusion Corporation in Japan 4, and the contents are retrieved with XPath notations and structured with DOM (Document Object Model).
DOM trees are used to remove overlapping data between overview and shallow data.
They are corresponding to two-stage content determination (Sripada et al., 2001).
The output DTD (DocumentType De nition) of this module is shown in Appendix B.
3.2 Microplanning
In the microplanning module, the XML tag and elements are replaced to produce text speci cation, which is based on lexical constraint in each language.
More precisely, microplanning contains the following tasks : determining the detailed (sentence-internal) organization, looking at alternativeways to group information into phrases, and so on (McDonald, 2000, pp.156).
This stage is implemented with SAX (Simple API for XML).
Lexicalisation task according toeach language and aggregationtask to eachsentence are modularized with SAX.
The output DTD of this module is shown in Appendix C.
3.3 Surface
Realization We followed the sublanguage approach (Somers, 2000), because surface lexical expression strongly depends on each discourse struc4 http ://www.mediafusion.co.jp/seihin/ygg/index.html ture.
We implemented the surface realization stage with XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) and Xalan 5, and the output had twovariations : the XHTML and VoiceXML format.
The combination of xsl : param and xsl : choose command was used for lexical paraphrasing based on discourse structure constraints.In addition, context-based lexical paraphrasing is an important factor in avoiding repetitious text.
We use the Java extension function in Xalan, and count the repeating element and change the expression.
The completed texts of the Monthly Economic Reports are shown in Appendix D and Weather Forecasts in E.
4 Conclusions
We implemented a three-stage pipelined NLG architecture (Reiter and Dale, 2000) as XML transformation process.
Our system proved the eectiveness of using XML to translate reports from a database based on the distinction between domain selection and linguistic selection.
XML is useful especially for content determination from a hierarchical structured database.
If wehave a time series or chronological data whichischaracterized by information dense at the same reference time point, our approachcan be applied to NLG from such data.
Our system used the common document planner to translate into four dierent languages.
The document planning module only depends on its input database domain.
Therefore, our system makes a distinction between data selection and linguistic selection processes in order to produce reports from the DB.
