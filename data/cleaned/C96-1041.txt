Part-of-speech tagging, which assigns the most likely tag to each word in a given sentence, is one.
of tire problems which can be solved by statisticM approach.
Many researchers haw~ tried to solve the problem by hidden Marker model (HMM), which is well known as one of the statistical models.
But it has many difficulties: integrating heterogeneous information, coping with data sparseness prohlem, and adapting to new environments.
In this paper, we propose a Markov radom field (MRF) model based approach to the tagging problem.
The MRF provides the base frame to combine various statistical information with maximum entropy (ME) method.
As Gibbs distribution can be used to describe a posteriori probability of tagging, we use it in ma.ximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of optimizing process.
Besides, several tagging models are developed to show the effect of adding information.
Experimental results show that the performance of the tagger gets improved as we add more statistical information, and that MtF-based tagging model is better than ttMM based tagging model in data sparseness problem.
1 Introduction
Part-of-speech tagging is to assign the correct tag to each word in the context of the sentence.
'\['here are three main approaches in tagging problem: rule-based approach (Klein and Simmons 1%3; Brodda 1982; Paulussen and Martin 1992; Brill et al.1990), statistical approach (Church :1988; Merialdo 1994; Foster 1991; Weischedel et al.1993; Kupiec 1992) and connectionist approach (Benello et al.1989; Nakanmra et al.1989). In these approaches, statistical approach has the following advantages : • a theoretical framework is provided • automatic learning facility is provided • the probabilities provide a straightforward way to disambiguate Many information sources must be combined to solve tagging problem with statistical approach.
It is a significant assumption that tire correct tag can generally be chosen from I.he local context.
Not only local sequences of words and tags are needed to solve tagging problem, but syntax, semantic, and morphological level information is also required in general.
Usually information sources such as t)igram, trigram and migra.m are used in the tagging systems which are based on statistical method.
Traditionally, linear interpolation an(t its variants have been used to combine the information sources, })tit these are shown to be seriously deficient.
ME (Maximum Entropy) estimation method provides the facility to combine several information sources.
Each inR)rmation source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the con> bined estimate.
The function with the highest entropy within the constraints is the ME solution.
Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique M E solution is guaranteed to exist and an iteratiw~" algorithm is provided.
MRF (Marker random field) model is based on ME method and it; has the facility to combine many inlbrmation sources through feature flmctions.
MRF model has the following adwmtages: robustness, adaptability, parallelism and the facility of combining informatiort sources.
M RF-based tagging model inherits these advantages.
In this paper, we will present one of the statistical models, namely MRF-based tagging systern.
We will show that several information sources including unigram, bigram and trigram, can be combined in MRF-based tagging model.
Experimental results show that the MRF-based tagger has very good performance especially when training data size is small.

Tire parameter lland A2 can be estimated by forward-backward algorithm (Deroua86+) (Charniak93+)(tIUANG90+).
Linear interpolation is so advantageous because it reconciles the different information sources in a straightforward and simple-minded way.
But such simpliticy is also the source of its weaknesses: • Linearly interpolated information is generally inconsistent with their information sources because information sources are heterogeneous for each other in general.
• Linear interpolation does not make optimal combination of information sources.
• Linear interpolation has over-estimation problem because it adjusts the model on the training data only and has no policy for untrained data.
This problem occur seriously when the size of the training data is not large enough.
4.2 ME(maxlmum entropy) principle There is very powerful estimation method which combines information sonrces objectively.
ME(maximum entropy) principle (,laynes57) provides the method to combine information sources consistently and the ability to overcome overestimation problem by maximizing entropy of the domain with which the training data do not provide information.
Let us describe ME principle briefly.
For given x, the quantity x is capable of assuming the discrete wdues xi, (i = 1, 2, ..., n).
We are not given the corresponding probabilities pi; all we know is tire expectation value of the function f,.(x), (r = 1, 2, ..., m): ;q E\[fr(x)\] = Epi(xi)f,.(xi) (1l) i=1 On the basis of this information, how can we determine the probability value of the function pi(x)?
At first glance, the problem seems insoluble because the given information is insufficient to determine the probabilities pi(x).
We call the function f,.
(xi) a constraint function or fealure.
Given consistent constraints, a unique ME soluton is guaranteed to exist and to be of the form: where the Ar's are some nnknown constants to be found.
This formula is derived by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution Pi as satisfying all the constraint given, qb search the l,.'s that make pi(x) satisfy all tile constraints, an external observation: OOO W\[_2 Wi 1 Wi Wi+l Wi+2 ooo MRF: .co {~~ eee <L.V <?L~/ ',,IL/ <dJ <L.v Figure 1: MRF T is defined for the neighborhood system with distance 2 iterative algorithm, "Generalized Iterative Scaling" (GIS), exists, which is guaranteed to converge to the solution (l)arroch72+).
(12) is similar to Gibbs distribution, which is the primary probability distribution of M\[{F model.
MRF model uses ME principle in combining information sources and parameter estimation.
We will describe MRFF model and its parameter estimation method later.
5 MRF-based tagging model 5.1 MRF in tagging Neighborhood of given random variable is defined by the set of random variables that directly atfect the given random variable.
Let N(i) denote a set of random variables which are neighbors of ith random variable.
Let's define the neighborhood system with distance L in tagging fbr words W = wl, ..., w,~, and tags T = h, ..., t,~.
N(i) = {iL,...,i1, i+ l,...,i+ L} (13) This neighborhood system has on(; dimensional relation and describes the one dimenstional structure of sentence.
Fig. 1 showes MP~F T which is defined for the neighborhood system with distance 2.
The arrows represent that the random variable ti is affected by the neighbors ti2, ti1, ti+ t, ~j+'~.
It also showes that ti,ti-t and ti,ti+l have the neighborhood relation connected by bigram, and that ti,ti-l,ti-2 and ti,ti+l,ti+2 have ttm neighborhood relation connected by trigram.
A clique is defined as the set of random variables that all of the pairs of random variables are neighborhood in it.
Let's define the clique as the tag sequence with size L in tagging problem.
G = {ti-L,ti-(t,-1), ...,ti} (14) A clique concept is used to define clique fimction that evaluates current state of random variables in clique.
The definition of MRF is presented as following.
Definil~ion of MIF: Random 'variable T is Markov random field if T' salisfies the following two properties.
238 Positivity : t)('F) > O, W' (15) Locality : S'(t~I%,Vj, j ¢ i) = P(t~I%,Vj, j ~ iV(j)) We assume tha.t every prob;d>lity value el tag se(luenee is larger l, hml zero bee;rose ungraluiuat, ic;d Sellt, ellCeS (;fill,tl)pem" in htlllHill l~tligll&ge liS~ge, including meaningless sequence of characters.
St) the positivity of' MRt'! is satislied.
This :+tSStllnption results in the robustness mid ada.ptability of the inodel, eveli though unti:a~ined events ocolir.
The locality of MRF is consistent with the asSlliliptioii O\[ I;a.ggiilg t)roblein in that the tag of given word ca, it be deterinined by the local context.
(Tonsequenl, ly, the random variable 7' is MRF for neighborhood systenl N(i) its 7' satisties the positivity and the locality.
5.2 A
Posteriori Protiatiillty A posteriori probat)ility is needed to sea.rcb for the Jrlost, likely tag sequence.
M II, F provides the i;heoretical bi~cliground about the probal)ility of the system (Bes~tg74) ((leiJfla, ii84+).

The a priori probal)ilit;y P(7') of tag sequence 7 ~ is Gibbs distribution because the randora variable 7' of tagging is MRF.
It can be proved that a posteriori probability i)(TiW) for given word sequen(;e W is also Gil)bs distribution (Chun93).

It is similar to the I)ehaviour o\[' molecular particles in the rcM world.

7 Optimization
The process of selecting the best tag sequence is called ms optimization process.
We use MAP (Maximum A l)osteriori) estiniation method.
The tag sequence 7' is selected to niaximize the a posteriori probM)ility of tagging (19) by MAP.
Simulated annealing is used to searcti the optimal tag sequence as Gibbs distribution provides simulated anneMing facility with teliiperatur(+ arid eileFgy ('OllCept.
