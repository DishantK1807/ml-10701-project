To cope with this problem, Kudo and Matsumoto (2000) introduced a new type of features called dynamic features, which are created dynamically during the parsing process.

Most of the previous statistical approaches for Japanese dependency analysis (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998; Haruno et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 1999; Kanayama et al., 2000; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) are based on a probabilistic model consisting of the following two steps.

We used a third degree polynomial kernel function, which is exactly the same setting in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000).
W00-1303
Kudo and Matsumoto (2000) used the sigmoid function to obtain pseudo probabilities in SVMs.
W00-1303
A number of statistical and machine learning approaches, such as Maximum Likelihood estimation (Fujio and Matsumoto, 1998), Decision Trees (Haruno et al., 1999), Maximum Entropy models (Uchimoto et al., 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2000; Kanayama et al., 2000), and Support Vector Machines (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000), have been applied to estimate these probabilities.

Results The results for the new cascaded chunking model as well as for the previous probabilistic model based on SVMs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000) are summarized in Table 2.

The static features are basically taken from Uchimotoâ€™s list (Uchimoto et al., 1999).
