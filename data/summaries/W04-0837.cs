The method is described in (McCarthy et al., 2004), which we summarise here.

Association for Computational Linguistics for the Semantic Analysis of Text, Barcelona, Spain, July 2004 SENSEVAL-3: Third International Workshop on the Evaluation of Systems PoS precision recall baseline Noun 95 73 45 Verb 79 43 22 Adjective 88 59 44 Adverb 91 72 59 All PoS 90 63 41 Table 2: The SENSEVAL-2 first sense on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words data system can be tuned to a given genre or domain (McCarthy et al., 2004) and also because there will be words that occur with insufficient frequency in the hand-tagged resources available.

Our predominant senses have been used within a WSD system as a back-off method when data is not available from other resources (Villarejo et al., 2004).
W04-0861
The first sense heuristic which is often used as a baseline for supervised WSD systems outperforms many of these systems which take surrounding context into account (McCarthy et al., 2004).
P04-1036
We acquire thesauruses for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs based on the method proposed by Lin (1998) using grammatical relations output from the RASP parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).
P98-2127
In recent work, Lapata and Brew (2004) obtain predominant senses of verbs occurring in subcategorization frames, where the senses of verbs are defined using Levin classes (Levin, 1993).
