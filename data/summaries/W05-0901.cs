2The content units proposed in recent methods (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) are a first step in this direction.

We use single-document English summaries as these are sufficient for investigating task-based usefulness, although more elaborate surrogates are possible, e.g., those that span more than one document (Radev and McKeown, 1998; Mani and Bloedorn, 1998).

Section 5 presents the results of correlation between task usefulness and the Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metric (Lin and Hovy, 2003).1 While we show that ROUGE correlates with task usefulness (using our Relevance-Prediction measure), we detect a slight difference between informative, extractive headlines (containing words from the full document) and less informative, non-extractive “eye-catchers” (containing words that might not appear in the full document, and intended to entice a reader to read the entire document).

Following the lead of earlier evaluations (Oka and Ueda, 2000; Mani et al., 2002; Sakai and Sparck-Jones, 2001), we focus on relevance assessment as our extrinsic task.

In fact, large variations have been found in the initial summary scoring of an individual participant and a subsequent scoring that occurs a few weeks later (Mani, 2001; van Halteren and Teufel, 2003).

In the SUMMAC experiments, the Kappa score (Carletta, 1996; Eugenio and Glass, 2004) for interannotator agreement was reported to be 0.38 (Mani et al., 2002).
