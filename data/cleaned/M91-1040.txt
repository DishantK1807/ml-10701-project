IT IS GOOD THAT THE NETWORK PRESENTS THESE PICTURES OF PEOPLE CRYING, MANIPULATING THEIR EMOTIONS . THOSE TEARS WERE SHED OVER 50 YEARS OF OPPRESSION AND MISERY, AND OVER THE BOMBINGS THAT HAVE DESTROYE D ZACAMIL NEIGHBORHOOD.

D-6 BIAFARA KNEW BOTH GROUPS OF MERCENARIES . ACCORDING TO HIS STATEMENTS GIVEN TO DAS LAST MARCH, NOT ONLY DID ISRAELI MERCENARIE S TRAIN ASSASSINS IN MIDDLE MAGDALENA, THERE WAS ALSO A GROUP OF 1 1 BRITISH MERCENARIES, WHO GAVE LESSONS TO 50 STUDENTS .

TST1-MUC3-001 0 SAN SALVADOR, 19 MAR 89 (RADIO CADENA SONORA) -[COMMUNIQUE] [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT GENERAL COMMAND] [TEXT ] ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION : TODAY, 9 MARCH, WE HAVE RECEIVED A MESSAGE SIGNED BY THE MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMISSION ASKING US TO BEGIN THE PEACE TALKS . WE HAVE ALREAD Y ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, EXPRESSING OUR WILLINGNES S TO HOLD A MEETING . THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION'S LETTER MAKES NO MENTIO N OF ANY MOVE TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS . IT DOES NOT EVEN CONSIDE R INCLUDING THIS TOPIC ON THE MEETING'S AGENDA . ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO HOLD THE ELECTIONS O N 19 MARCH . CONSEQUENTLY, THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN ] HEREBY INFORMS THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE O F THE FOLLOWING : 1.THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST CLEARLY AND PUBLICLY ANNOUNC E THAT IT IS WILLING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON CONFINING THE ARMY TO IT S BARRACKS ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTIONS, ESTABLISHING AN ELECTORAL CODE BY CONSENSUS, PROVIDING ABSENTEE VOTING FOR SALVADORANS LIVING ABROAD, RESTRUCTURING THE CENTRAL ELECTIONS COUNCIL, AND FORMING A COUNCIL FO R VERIFICATION . MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT MUST EXPRESS THE STATE POWERS' WILLINGNESS TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS FOR 5 MONTHS, ONCE A CEASE-FIRE HAS BEEN AGREE D UPON.
32:42	WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION MUST PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS WILLING TO BRING MILITARY COMMANDERS AND OFFICER S RESPONSIBLE FOR POLITICAL MURDERS AND CRIMES TO TRIAL, TO REDUCE TH E SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES TO THE NUMBER OF TROOPS IT HAD IN 1968, AND T O DISBAND THE SECURITY FORCES TO FORM A NEW CIVIL POLICE . WE REITERATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS PERMANENTLY CEASING THE ARMED STRUGGLE . 2.
33:42	IF THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION AGREES TO THE ABOVE REQUESTS, TH E FMLN WILL AGREE TO A MEETING AND IS WILLING TO IMMEDIATELY DECIDE ON A D-7 DATE AND A TIME FOR THE MEETING . THE FMLN IS EVEN WILLING TO HOLD THE MEETING OUTSIDE EL SALVADOR . AS A PART OF THIS MEETING, WE ARE WILLIN G TO NEGOTIATE AND COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE ARMED FORCES STAFF ON A CEASE-FIRE THAT WILL BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTIO N TO THE CONFLICT.
34:42	3.
35:42	IF NO SUCH AGREEMENT IS REACHED, THEN THERE IS NO POINT I N HOLDING THE MEETING PRIOR TO 19 MARCH, BECAUSE IT WILL SIMPLY BE USED BY BOTH THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY [PDC] AND THE NATIONALIS T REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE [ARENA] IN THEIR ELECTION DISPUTE . THE ELECTIONS PLAY NO ROLE IN ACHIEVING PEACE ; THEY ONLY SERVE TO PROVIDE A FALSE JUSTIFICATION FOR CONTINUING THE WAR . 4.
