The popular Giza++ (Och and Ney, 2000b) tool is used to align the parallel corpora.

(Och et al., 2004) have explored many different feature functions.

This result corresponds to known work in the literature (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2005; Hasan et al., 2006), when using POS only as a post-processing step during reranking.
W05-0821 W06-2606
Reranking n-best lists using POS has also been explored by (Hasan et al., 2006).

The weights Î»i are typically optimized so as to maximize a scoring function on a development set (Och and Ney, 2002).
P02-1038
optimization A common criterion to optimize the coefficients of the log-linear combination of feature functions is to maximize the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) on a development set (Och and Ney, 2002).

In (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2005), a factored language model using POS information showed similar performance to a 4-gram word language model.

Recent works in statistical machine translation (SMT) shows how phrase-based modeling (Och and Ney, 2000a; Koehn et al., 2003) significantly outperform the historical word-based modeling (Brown et al., 1993).
