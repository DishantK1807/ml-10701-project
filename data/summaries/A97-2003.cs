The use of SMES in COSMA, semantic analysis and inference, the dialogue model mapping between human and machine dialogue structures, utterance generation, the architectural framework of the server, and the PASHA agent system are described in (Busemann et al., 1997).
A97-1006
We demonstrate extended versions of the systems described in (Busemann et al., 1997).
