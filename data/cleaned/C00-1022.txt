However, to have a siguiti(:ant impact (m al)i)li('ations, t;erminologi('al knowledge should not 1)e limited to tl;11; nolnent'latures of single-word and mull;i-word lx',rms.

Semantic categories may 1)lay a crucial role in many apl)li(:ations, and t/articularly when disaml)iguation \])rocesses are required.

Assigning semantic categories to technical ternls is a difficult and tinle-('onsunling l;ask.
Highly st)ecialized skills are required and, even though the major concepts represented in these ternlinologi(:al resources 1)ertain to the aeronautic donlain, various related knowledge areas are con('erned, such as Data, Processhig', Mc('hanits; and Mmmth.cl;uring Procossc's.
Our goal is to elaborate a tool that helps ternfinologisl;s to assign semantic ('ategories when ut)dating the reli;ren(:e lx;rminology.

2 The
Terminological Resources We use in this study a French/English bilingual terminology of the aeronautic domain.
This hand-crafted database results tTrom a multidisciplinary effort involving technical writers, translators, terminologists and engineers.
In its current state, the database contains 12,267 French/English term ctmt)les, structured in 70 semantic categories.
As already ot)served in several terminological databases, multi-word terms cover the larger part; of the database (nearly 80%).
Tile described terms are mostly nouns but the database also contains about 200 verbs and verbal phrases.
Table 1 gives some exampies of terms and a short description of the associated categories.
These linguistic resources are integrated in a computer-aided translation environment used by technical writers.
Semantic categories have originally been introduced in order to distinguish the various senses of polysemous terms.
Each term couple is annotated with one or more categories specifying the contexts in which the translation is recommended.
An entry is associated to a ternr for each identified meaning.
For example, the french term ddpasscmerd has at least two possible meanings, corresponding to two different translations: ovc~iflow in the Data Processing category (DPR,) and out-o\[-./lushnc.ss in the Airm'M't Structure category (STR).
As shown in the examples of table 1, the assigmnent of semantic categories has been extended to monosemous terms.
In our experiments of term categorization, only the fl:ench l;erms have 1)een used.

Work ~brm Semantic Ca, teg'orizat, ion is on several aspects similar to _Th(;sam'us l~2xtension (Uramoto, 1996; Tokunaga et al., 1997).
Our methods are ch)se to those used for positioning unknown words in thesauri.
However, the two issues cm~ be ditlhrentiated with respect to the manit)ulated data.
A thesaurus is intended to cover a large set; of concet)tual domains while a terminological database is tbcused accurately on a specific topic and its related domains.
For example, in (Tokunaga et al.~ 1997), the thesaurus to be extended contains lnore than 500 categories.
This tends to make the t)roblem harder, lint, since many categories are strictly independent, it is easier to find distinctive tieatures between categories.
By contrast, our terminological database contains only 70 categories.
But, in this restricted set, we find categories corresponding to close or even overlapping knowledge areas.
It; is more difficult to ditt'erentiate them.

We use as contextual cues the open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) theft cooccur in the corpus with the technical terms.
More precisely, the cues are open-class words surrounding the occllrr(;lices of t;he term in some window of t)i'edetined size.
Each new term to be (:ntegorizeA is rel)resented by the overall set of (:oni;exi;ual (:ues that have 1)een (~xl;ra(:l;ed fl:onl :t \])arl; ()f the (:orlms (I;est (:orlms).

This probability accounts for the weight of category C in the corpus.
4.2 Training
and Test qJhe exogeneous classifier starts with the selection of test documents in the cort)us.
Technical terms found in these documents will form the test set.
The remaining documents represent the training corl)us.
%'aining and test stages are the following: • POS tagging.
The test and training corpora are tagged with MultAna, a tagger designed as an extension of the Multex morphological analyzer (Petitpierre and Russell, 1995).
Occurrences of the technical terms are identified during this stage and the terms to be categorized are those which are identified in the test corpus.
• Extraction of contextual cues.
For each term occurrence in training and test data, the contextual cues are collected.
Only the lemmas of open-class words are used and cues may correspond to multiword terms.
Each test term is then represented by the set of cues which have been collected in test data.
'~Note that the categorization process could be simplified by eliminating P(wi), since this quantity is constaifl; for all categories.

• Frequency calculation and probability estimation.
Training data are explored to compute the frequencies (occurrences and co-occurrences) of cues, terms and categories.
As mentioned earlier (section 3), tile cue occun'ences which have been collected around the test terms are ignored during this step.
Tile probabilities required for the categorization operation are then computed.
• Categorization of the test terms.
The most probable categories are assigned to each test term (see section 4.1).
Figure 1 gives; some examples of exogencous categorization 3.
5 Endogeneous
Categorization Our approach to endogeneous categorization is simpler.
It is exclusively based oll a quantitative analysis of the lexical composition of technical terms.
Henceforth, the open-class words used to compose technical terms will be called terminolwical components.
The endogeneous approach relies on a much more restricted source of data than the exogeneous approach, since the comI)one:nt set of a terminological database is quantitatively limited compared with the set of contextual cues extracted from corpora.
Nevertheless, we make the assumption that this quantitative limitation is partly compensated by the aSome category labels are described in table 1.

6 Experiments
and Evaluation To estimate the accuracy of the exogeueous method, we used a domain-specific corpus of 541,964 words, coml)osed of documents I)ertaintug to various textual genres (software st)ecifications, maintenance procedures, manufacturing notices...).
This corpus covered 63 of the 70 categories.
Each run starts with the selection eta document among the corpus documents.
The known terms identified in this document are considered as test: terms.
We used relatively wide contexts.
The cues were extracted in a window of :t=20 words around the term.
Each run involved more than 70,000 contexts of term occurrences.
To experiment the endogeneous apI)roach, test sets of col~xl)ound terms have l)een randomly extracted from the, terlninological database.
We adopted an evaluation scheme similar to that detlned in (Tokunaga et al., 1997) for thesaux'us extension.
The categorization is considered successful if' the right categox'y appears among the t~: first categories assigned by the classifier.
Within a semi-automatic acquisition framework, this evaluation scheme is more suitable than strict evaluation where only the first category assigned by the classifier is considered as relevant (evaluation restricted to h=l).
'l. Frolu oux' application 1)erspective, it is useful to provide to the terminologist a restricted set of less than 5 t)lausible categories instead of the complete set of 70 categories without prior filtering.
In the experiments des(:ribed in (Tokunaga et al., 1997), k takes the values 5, 10, 20 and 30 for average(t 1)ertbrmance ranging from 26.4:% to 55.9% (the choice is made among 544 categories).
Some of their precise experiments yielded an accm'acy greater than 80% fox' t~: = 30.
In ore" experinmnts, we measured accuracy tbr h=l to 5.
Some results are given in tables 3 and 4.
The scores are higher than those achieved in thesaurus extension, especially with the exogeneous approach (fi'om 52.75% to 97.61%).
We should however keel) in mind that we deal with a diflbrent kind of data (see section 3).
