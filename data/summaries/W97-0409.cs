Each engine attempts to translate the entire input text, segmenting each sentence in whatever manner is most appropriate for its technology, and putting the resulting translated output segments into a shared chart data structure (Kay, 1967; Winograd, 1983) after giving each segment a score indicating the engine's internal assessment of the quality of the output segment.

The Multi-Engine Machine Translation (MEMT) architecture (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994) makes it possible to exploit the differences between MT technologies.
A94-1016
The machine translation (MT) technology is the MultiEngine Machine Translation (MEMT) architecture (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994), described further below.
A94-1016
Since the scores produced by the engines are estimates of variable accuracy, we use statistical language modelling techniques adapted from speech recognition research to select the best overall set of outputs (Brown and Frederking, 1995; Frederking, 1994).

Differences in the development times and costs of different.technologies can be exploited to enable MT systems to be rapidly deployed for new languages (Frederking and Brown, 1996).
C96-1030
Other technologies such as lexical-transfer MT (Nirenburg et al., 1995; Frederking and Brown, 1996; MacDonald, 1963), and Example-Based MT (EBMT) (Brown, 1996; Na61 gao, 1984: Sato and Nagao, 1990) provide lowerquality general-purpose translations, unless they are incorporated into human-assisted MT systems (Frederking et al., 1993; Melby, 1983), but can be used in non-domain-restricted translation applications.

After any MT step, the interviewer is able to edit the best overall hypothesis for either the forward or backward translation using a popup-menu-based editor, as in our earlier Pangloss text MT system (Frederking et al., 1993).

The EBMT and Lexical-Transfer-based MT translation engines used in DIPLOMAT are described elsewhere (Frederking and Brown, 1996).
