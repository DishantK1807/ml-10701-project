First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).

Linguistic research has documented a wide range of regularities across the sound systems of the world?s languages (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986; de Boer, 2000; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b).

Syntactic lexicons have been derived from other resources ??the LinGO ERG lexicon (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000) contains entries extracted from ComLex (Grishman et al., 1994), and Hockenmaier and Steedman (2002) acquire a CCG lexicon from the Penn Treebank.

Functional phonologists argue that such regularities are the consequences of certain general principles like maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972), which is desirable between the phonemes of a language for proper perception of each individual phoneme in a noisy environment, ease of articulation (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; de Boer, 2000), which requires that the sound systems of all languages are formed of certain universal (and highly frequent) sounds, and ease of learnability (de Boer, 2000), which is required so that a speaker can learn the sounds of a language with minimum effort.

The LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger (2000)) is a broad-coverage, linguistically precise HPSG-based grammar of English, which represents the culmination of more than 10 person years of (largely) manual effort.

Signatures Topic Signatures (TS) are word vectors related to a particular topic (Lin and Hovy, 2000).
