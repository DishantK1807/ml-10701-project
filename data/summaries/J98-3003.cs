While Bach (1986) did not investigate the internal structure of events, others suggested that this needs to be done (e.g., Moens and Steedman 1988; Parsons 1990).

Working in the framework of systemic-functional grammar (SFG), both Wanner (1992) and Teich and Bateman (1994) employ SPL as an intermediate description, but they emphasize the integration of the SPL construction process into SFG.

More specifically for NLG, structure mappings between fine-grained representations have been suggested for instance by Horacek (1990), Nogier and Zock (1992), and Nicolov, Mellish, and Ritchie (1996).

The SemSpec language is a subset of the input representation language that was developed for Penman, the sentence plan language (SPL) (Kasper 1989).

The idea of using the lexicon early in the generation process is not new; it has been realized in several other generators, for example in the frame-oriented system DIOGENES (Nirenburg and Nirenburg 1988).

For example, Sanfilippo (1994) argues against this instrument on the grounds that there is no general control regime on lexical rules that would deterministically restrict any polysemic expansion.
