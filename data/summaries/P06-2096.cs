Another piece of related work, (Quirk et al., 2004), starts off with parallel inputs and uses monolingual Statistical Machine Translation techniques to align them and generate novel sentences.

From now on, we shall refer to the Chunk tag of a word as its IOB value (IOB was named by Tjong Kim Sang and Jorn Veeenstra (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) after Ratnaparkhi (Ratnaparkhi, 1998)).

Pang et al.provide a remedy to this problem by performing alignment on the Charniak parse trees of the clustered sentences (Pang et al., 2003).

Previous work aligns a group of sentences into a compact word lattice (Barzilay and Lee, 2003), a finite state automaton representation that can be used to identify commonality or variability among comparable texts and generate paraphrases.
