Previous work on natural language reference in multimedia generation• \[Andre and Rist1994, McKeown et a1.1992\] has focused on coordination of pictoria ! and textual referencesto concrete objectsand to actions to be performed o~ ghe objects, and on generating references to the presentation itself.

Also, to be precise, we are interested in what \[Kronfeld1986, Kronfeld1990\] terms :the modal aspect of Donnellan's distinction.

An attributive description's main function is to convey information directly contributing to the communicative goals of a discourse, whereas a referential description's only function is to enable the audience to identify a particular referent \[Donnellan1977, Kronfeld1986\].
