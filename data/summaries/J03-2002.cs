OAA makes it convenient to combine different components that are required in natural language process205 Bos Implementing Binding and Accommodation Theory ing, such as speech recognition or parsing, the presupposition resolution component, and theorem provers, because OAA agents can be implemented in different programming languages and run simultaneously on different machines (Bos and Oka 2002).
