The Query System 5 NAIVE SEMANTICS AND DISCOURSE PHENOMENA 12 Most computational treatments of discourse phenomena acknowledge the role of world knowledge in anaphora resolution, temporal reasoning, and causal reasoning (Reichman 1985; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Wada and Asher 1986).

2.2.2 SENTENCE-LEVEL SEMANTICS The modified parse is then submitted to a semantics module, which outputs a structure motivated in part by current versions of discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp 1981; Wada and Asher 1986; Asher and Wada 1988).

5. The analysis work was originally reported in Dahlgren and McDowell (1986b).

The role of syntax and compositional semantics will be underplayed in what follows, only because these contributions have been thoroughly treated by others (Reinhart 1982; Asher and Wada 1988; Kamp 1981; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Webber 1985).

This facility exploits the fact that possible feature types for any term are constrained by the ontological attachment of the term, by the Kind Type to which they belong (Dahlgren & McDowell 1986a; Dahlgren 1988a).

The theoretical underpinnings and practical work on the KT system have been reported extensively elsewhere, in conference papers (Dahlgren and McDowell 1986a, 1986b; McDowell and Dahlgren 1987) and in a book (Dahlgren 1988a).

The particular implementation of DRT which we use assumes a simple, purely syntactic parse as input to the DRS construction procedures (Wada and Asher 1986).

Grosz and Sidner (1986) argue that coherence relations are not a useful analytical tool because no clear, closed set of them has been discovered.

Moens and Steedman 1987).

Here the commonsense knowledge base is accessed to apply rules for prepositional phrase attachment (Dahlgren and McDowell 1986b) and word sense disambiguation (Dahlgren 1988a), as well as to assign the correct scope properties to operators and quantifiers.
