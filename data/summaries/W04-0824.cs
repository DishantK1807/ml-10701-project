Training and test data, and the Wordnet glosses, were parsed with Charniakâ€™s parser (Charniak, 2000).

Here we used the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002), where the weight matrix used to classify the test data is the average of all of the matrices posited during training, i.e., a1 a62 a52 a49 a62 a49 a42a51a50a53a52 a1 a42 . 4.2 Multicomponent architecture Task specific and external training data are integrated with a two-component perceptron.
