There is relatively little discussion of this topic in Brown et al.(1990). although a brief mention of the EM algorithm is made.

There has been quite a bit of recent work on sentence alignment, e.g., (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1990, (Kay and Rbscheisen, 1988), (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, to appear); we use a method described in (Gale and Church, 1991) which makes use of the fact that the length of a text (in characters) i~ 5ighly correlated (0.991) with the length of its translation.

Much of the current excitement surrounding parallel texts was initiated by Brown et aL (1990), who outline a selforganizing method for using these parallel texts to build a machine translation system.

Introduction Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et a/, 1990) arm bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermarm, 1990) have recently become interested in studying parallel texts (also known as bilingual corpora), bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debates) which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).
