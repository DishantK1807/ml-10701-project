We also reformulate questions into declarative sentences following the strategy proposed in Brill et al.(2002). The reformulated sentences are submitted as queries to an IR engine for retrieving sentences with relevant answers.

Edge covers have been successfully applied in several natural language processing tasks, including machine translation (Taskar et al., 2005) and annotation projection (PadÂ´o and Lapata, 2006).
H05-1010
The similarity of question and answer paths is computed using a simplified version of the similarity measure6 proposed in Shen and Klakow (2006).

Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing methods for the automatic identification and labeling of semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents.1 The success of these methods, often referred to collectively as shallow semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), is largely due to the availability of resources like FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), which document the surface realization of semantic roles in real world corpora.

Syntactic structure matching has been applied to passage retrieval (Cui et al., 2005) and answer extraction (Shen and Klakow, 2006).

All FrameNet sentences, questions, and answer sentences were parsed using MiniPar (Lin, 1994), a robust dependency parser.

WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is perhaps the most popular resource and has been employed in a variety of QA-related tasks ranging from query expansion, to axiom-based reasoning (Moldovan et al., 2003), passage scoring (Paranjpe et al., 2003), and answer filtering (Leidner et al., 2004).

They use ASSERT (Pradhan et al., 2004), a publicly available shallow semantic parser trained on PropBank, to generate predicate-argument structures which subsequently form the basis of comparison between question and answer sentences.

Question answering (QA) is often cited as an obvious beneficiary of semantic 12 role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005; Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004).

The latter are ranked according to word overlap (i.e., identical phrases are ranked higher than phrases with no 6Shen and Klakow (2006) use a dynamic time warping algorithm to calculate the degree to which dependency relation paths are correlated.

Important future directions lie in evaluating the contribution of alternative semantic role frameworks (e.g., PropBank) to the answer extraction task and developing models that learn semantic roles directly from unannotated text without the support of FrameNet annotations (Grenager and Manning, 2006).
W06-1601
Our approach is less domain dependent and resource intensive than Narayanan and Harabagiu (2004), it solely employs a dependency parser and the FrameNet database.

Narayanan and Harabagiu (2004) were the first to stress the importance of semantic roles in answering complex questions.

Answer types are determined using classification rules similar to Li and Roth (2002).
