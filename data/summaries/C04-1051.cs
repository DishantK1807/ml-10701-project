While these models have proven effective at the word alignment task (Mihalcea & Pedersen 2003), there are significant practical limitations in their output.

Such data would be amenable to conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques (e.g., those discussed in Och & Ney 2003).

The importance of learning to manipulate monolingual paraphrase relationships for applications like summarization, search, and dialog has been highlighted by a number of recent efforts (Barzilay & McKeown 2001; Shinyama et al.2002; Lee & Barzilay 2003; Lin & Pantel 2001).

Giza++ is a freely available implementation of IBM Models 1-5 (Brown et al.1993) and the HMM alignment (Vogel et al.1996), along with various improvements and modifications motivated by experimentation by Och & Ney (2000).
C96-2141 J93-2003 P00-1056
Alignment Each corpus was used as input to the word alignment algorithms available in Giza++ (Och & Ney 2000).
P00-1056
To mitigate this limitation on final mappings, we follow the approach of Och (2000): we align once in the forward direction and again in the backward direction.
P00-1056
Lee & Barzilay (2003), for example, use MultiSequence Alignment (MSA) to build a corpus of paraphrases involving terrorist acts.
N03-1003
While the idea of exploiting multiple news reports for paraphrase acquisition is not new, previous efforts (for example, Shinyama et al.2002; Barzilay and Lee 2003) have been restricted to at most two news sources.

These alignments can subsequently be recombined in a variety of ways, 5 The formula for AER given here and in Och & Ney (2003) is intended to compare an automatic alignment against a gold standard alignment.
J03-1002
In order to address such questions, we used word Alignment Error Rate (AER), a metric borrowed from the field of statistical machine translation (Och & Ney 2003).
J03-1002
To compute Precision, Recall, and Alignment Error Rate (AER) for the twin datasets, we used exactly the formulae listed in Och & Ney (2003).
J03-1002
Mean number of instances of paraphrase phenomena per sentence (such as Multiple Sequence Alignment, as employed by Barzilay & Lee 2003).
N03-1003
We closely followed the evaluation standards established in Melamed (2001) and Och & Ney (2000, 2003).
