There has been significant work with such models for greedy sequence modeling in NLP (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Borthwick et al., 1998).

Previous work has built lexicons from fixed corpora by determining linguistic patterns for the context in which relevant words appear (Collins and Singer, 1999; Jones et al., 1999).

CRFs have shown empirical successes recently in POS tagging (Lafferty et al., 2001), noun phrase segmentation (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and Chinese word segmentation (McCallum and Feng, 2003).

It has recently been shown that quasi-Newton methods, such as L-BFGS, are significantly more efficient than traditional iterative scaling and even conjugate gradient (Malouf, 2002; Sha and Pereira, 2003).

There can easily be over 100,000 atomic tests (mostly based on tests for the identity of words in the vocabulary), and ten or more shifted-conjunction patternsâ€”resulting in several million features (Sha and Pereira, 2003).
