a176 Chunking data set (chunking) This data set was used for CoNLL-2000 shared task(Tjong Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000).

In the CoNLL-2000 shared task, we achieved the accuracy of 93.48 using IOB2-F representation (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000b) 5.

Sassano and Utsuro evaluate how the difference of the chunk representation would affect the performance of the systems based on different machine learning algorithms(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000).

In the field of natural language processing, SVMs are applied to text categorization and syntactic dependency structure analysis, and are reported to have achieved higher accuracy than previous approaches.(Joachims, 1998; Taira and Haruno, 1999; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a).

They apply weighted voting of the systems which are trained using distinct chunk representations and different machine learning algorithms such as MBL, ME and IGTree(Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).

Voting Tjong Kim Sang et al.report that they achieve higher accuracy by applying weighted voting of systems which are trained using distinct chunk representations and different machine learning algorithms, such as MBL, ME and IGTree(Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000).

The data has part-ofspeech (POS) tags annotated by the Brill tagger(Brill, 1995).

Various machine learning approaches have been proposed for chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000a; Tjong Kim Sang et al., 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b; Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; van Halteren, 2000).

Tjong Kim Sang calls this method as IOB1 representation, and introduces three alternative versions â€” IOB2,IOE1 and IOE2 (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999).

In using DP matching, we limit a number of ambiguities by applying beam search with width a142 . In CoNLL 2000 shared task, the number of votes for the class obtained through the pairwise voting is used as the certain score for beam search with width 5 (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a).

a176 Base NP standard data set (baseNP-S) This data set was first introduced by (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), and taken as the standard data set for baseNP identification task2.

2. Start/End This method has been used for the Japanese named entity extraction task, and requires the following five tags for representing proper chunks(Uchimoto et al., 2000) 1.
P00-1042
1. Inside/Outside This representation was first introduced in (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995), and has been applied for base NP chunking.
W95-0107
Sassano and Utsuro(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000) introduce a variable context length model for Japanese named entity identification task and perform better results.

In addition, our method also outperforms other methods based on the weighted voting(van Halteren, 2000; Tjong Kim Sang, 2000b).
