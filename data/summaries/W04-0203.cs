Even annotating linear segmentation is challenging, particularly in the vicinity of segment boundaries (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).

These referential and lexical features build on the work of Passonneau and Litman (1997), who use them in discourse segmentation.

These relations have syntactic aspects, such that single utterances can be grouped together and combined into segments recursively and are often modeled as a hierarchical tree structure (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Webber et al., 1999).
J86-3001 P99-1006
of discourse relations One substructure of a coherent discourse structure is its attentional structure, which can be modeled as a stack of focus spaces (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
J86-3001
First, if non-canonicals are indicators of attentional stack pops, they should be more likely at segment boundaries; hence, we expect an increased presence of cue words (Passonneau and Litman, 1997) on non-canonicals compared to canonicals.
J97-1005
Annotation of hierarchical discourse structure is difficult and subjective although efforts have been made (Creswell et al., 2002; Marcu et al., 1999).
