Other recent work has applied M.E. to language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), and reference resolution (Kehler, 1997).

System Features For NYU's official entry in the MUC-7 evaluation, MENE took in the output of an enhanced version of the more traditional, hand-coded "Proteus" namedentity tagger which we entered in MUC-6(Grishman, 1995).

More complete discussions of M.E. as applied to computational linguistics, including a description of the M.E. estimation procedure can be found in (Berger et al., 1996) and (Della Pietra et al., 1995).

This allows us to compute the conditional probability as follows (Berger et al., 1996): P(flh) = ~i°~ '(h'I) (2) Z~(h) Z~(h) = ~I~I~ '(h'~) (a) ff i The maximum entropy estimation technique guarantees that for every feature gi, the expected value of gi according to the M.E. model will equal the empirical expectation of gi in the training corpus.

MENE is highly portable, as we have already demonstrated with our result on upper-case English text and even in its current state, its results are already comparable to that of the only other purely statistical English NE system which we are aware of (Miller et al., 1998).
M98-1009
The Viterbi search finds the highest probability path in which there are no two tokens in which the second one cannot follow the first, as defined by a table of all such invalid transitions (a similar approach to (Sekine et al., 1998)).

More MENE test results and discussion of the formal run can be found in (Borthwick et al., 1998).

In addition, subsequent to the evaluation, the University of Manitoba (Lin, 1998) and IsoQuest, Inc.

Table 4 gives a comparison of BBN's HMMbased Identifinder (Miller et al., 1998) and NYU's MENE and MENE-Proteus systems on different training and test sets.

The latter figure matches the best currently published result (Bikel et al., 1997) on within-domain all-caps data.
A97-1029
Clearly a more sophisticated feature selection routine such as the ones in (Berger et al., 1996), or (Berger and Printz, 1998) would be required in this case.
J96-1002
The 11 binary history-views used by MENE's binary features are very similar to those used in BBN's Nymble/ldentifinder system (Bikel et al., 1997) with two exceptions: • Nymble used a feature for "significant" (i.e.

On a different set of data, the MUC-7 formal run data, the accuracy of the two human taggers who were preparing the answer key was tested and it was discovered that one of them had an F-Measure of 96.95 and the other of 97.60 (Marsh and Perzanowski, 1998).
M98-1002
On the other hand, we scored lower on all-caps than BBN's Identifinder in the MUC-7 formal evaluation for reasons which are probably similar to the ones discussed in section 9 in the comparison of our mixed case performances (Miller et al., 1998) (Borthwick et al., 1998).
M98-1009 M98-1018
(Krupka and Hausman, 1998) shared with us the outputs of their systems on our training corpora as well as on various test corpora.
M98-1015
At the MUC-7 conference, there were two other interesting systems using statistical techniques from the Language Technology Group/University of Edinborough (Mikheev and Grover, 1998) and BBN (Miller et al., 1998).
M98-1009
All three of these elements are present in systems such as IsoQuest's (Krupka and Hausman, 1998), and their absence from MENE probably explains much of the reason why the MENE-only system failed to perform at the state-of-the-art.

He has achieved state-of-the art results by applying M.E. to parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1997a), part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and sentence-boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).

This approach is essentially the same as (Sekine et al., 1998).
W98-1120
M.E. was first applied to named entity recognition at the MUC-7 conference by (Borthwick et al., 1998) and (Mikheev and Grover, 1998).
