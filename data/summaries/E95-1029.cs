Our results agree, at least at the level of morphology, with (Leech and Eyes 1993; Marcus et al.1993). In our experiment, the main differences between morphology and syntax were that (i) specifying the syntactic representation takes a few more pages in the definition manual, and (it) there seem to be more cases in syntax where multiple analyses have to be accepted but relatively few even then.
