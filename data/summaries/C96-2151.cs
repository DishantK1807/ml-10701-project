A dynamic programming technique is then used to find tag the sequence 5/\],..., ~, that maximizes P(T1,...,Tn I Wl, . .., Wn) = tt = IIP(Tk T1,...,Tk-1;Wl,...,Wn) k=l 1:=1 P(Tk Tk-N+I,...,Tk-1; VIZk) â€¢ 7' ".P(T~ wk) P(Tk ~k-N+l,..., k-l) \[ k=l fl P(Tk P(T,) Tk-N+~,..., ~-~)" P(Wk I Tk) ~:~ P(Wk) Since the maximum does not depend on the factors P(Wk), these can be omitted, yielding the standard statistical PoS tagging task: max \]-\[ P(Tk IU~-~V+~,...,Tk-J.P(Wk JT~) TI,...,T~, t~l= This is well-described in for example (DeRose 1988).
