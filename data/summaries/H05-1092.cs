Some systems use link grammars in conjunction with trigger verbs instead of templates (Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003).

Figure 1 shows the generative dynamic model, based on previous work on role and relation extraction (Rosario and Hearst, 2004) where the task was to extract the entities TREATMENT and DISEASE and the relationships between them.

We use graphical models and a neural net that were found to achieve high accuracy in the related task of extracting the relation types might hold between the entities “treatment” and “disease” (Rosario and Hearst, 2004).

Many papers that claim to be doing relationship recognition in actuality address the task of role extraction: (usually two) entities are identified and the relationship is implied by the co-occurrence of these entities or by some linguistic expression (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002).

Some approaches simply report that a relation exists between two proteins but do not determine which relation holds (Bunescu et al., 2005; Marcotte et al., 2001; Ramani et al., 2005), while most others start with a list of interaction verbs and label only those sentences that contain these trigger words (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Blaschke et al., 1999; Rindflesch et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Sekimizu et al., 1998; Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003; Pustejovsky et al., 2002).
