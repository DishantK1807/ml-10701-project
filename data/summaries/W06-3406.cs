Compared to the original values from (Cohen et al., 2004), we observed a relative error rate drop of 24.7% in the Request act, 33.3% in the Commit act, 23.7% for the Deliver act, 38.3% for the Propose act, 9.2% for Meeting and 29.1% in the dData act.

Compared to a previous study (Cohen et al., 2004), this representation reduces the classification error rates by 26.4% on average.

A similar cleaning procedure was executed by Cohen et al.(2004). Some types of punctuation marks (“,;:.)(][”) were removed, as were extra spaces and extra page breaks.

2 “Email-Acts” Taxonomy and Applications A taxonomy of speech acts applied to email communication (email-acts) is described and motivated in (Cohen et al., 2004).

Therefore, we can conclude that Cohen et al.(2004) could have obtained better results if they had used more labeled data.

By using only single words as features, Cohen et al.(2004) disregarded a very important linguistic aspect of the speech act inference task: the textual context.

Compared to the original study (Cohen et al., 2004), this representation reduced the classification error rates by 26.4% on average.

Using this n-gram based representation in classification experiments, we obtained a relative average drop of 26.4% in error rate when compared to the original Cohen et al.(2004) paper.

In a previous work, Cohen et al.(2004) used text classification methods to detect “email speech acts”.

Cohen et al.(2004) showed that machine learning algorithms can learn the proposed email-act categories reasonably well.

edu/∼vitor. 7 Conclusions In this work we considered the problem of automatically detecting the intents behind email messages using a shallow semantic taxonomy called “email speech acts” (Cohen et al., 2004).

The first bar denotes the error rate obtained by Cohen et al.(2004) in a 5-fold crossvalidation experiment, also using linear SVM.

Also, signature files and quoted text from previous messages were removed from all messages using a technique described elsewhere (Carvalho and Cohen, 2004).

The Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) is typically used to measure the human interrater agreement.
