Tagging for many phenomena, such as dialogue acts (Carletta et al.1997; Di Eugenio et al.2000), requires coders to make subtle distinctions among categories.

κ had long been used in content analysis and medicine (e.g., in psychiatry to assess how well students’ diagnoses on a set of test cases agree with expert answers) (Grove et al.1981). Carletta (1996) deserves the credit for bringing κ to the attention of computational linguists.

Thus, such an assumption is detrimental if such systematic disagreements are to be used to improve the coding scheme (Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara 1999).

Reporting both κ Co and κ S&C does not invalidate our previous discussion, as we believe κ Co is more appropriate for discourseand dialogue-tagging in the majority of cases, especially when exploiting bias to improve coding (Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara 1999).

In fact, in many cases the analysis of systematic disagreements among annotators on the same portion of the data (i.e., of bias) can be used to improve the coding scheme (Wiebe, Bruce, and O’Hara 1999).
P99-1032
In fact, Carletta et al.(1997) use words of caution against adopting Krippendorff’s suggestion as a standard; the first author has also raised the issue of how to assess κ values in Di Eugenio (2000).
