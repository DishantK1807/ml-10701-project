There are two canonical parsers that fall into this category: the decision-tree parser of (Magerman, 1995), and the maximum-entropy parser of (Ratnaparkhi, 1997).

A simple example is the annotation of nodes with their parent labels (Johnson, 1998).

With a simple feature set, we manage to obtain performance comparable to the unlexicalized PCFG parser of (Klein and Manning, 2003) on the set of sentences of length 375 40 or less.

369 The major alternative to PCFG-based approaches are so-called history-based parsers (Black et al., 1993).

Much of the current research into probabilistic parsing is founded on probabilistic contextfree grammars (PCFGs) (Collins, 1996; Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Charniak, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2003).
