The differences between the pyramid F-score and the macroaveraged binary F-score correspond to the distinction between microand macro-averaging discussed in the context of text classification (Lewis, 1991).

The pyramid extension (Lin and DemnerFushman, 2006) was proposed to address the issues mentionedabove.

After the human annotation process, nugget pyramids were built in the manner described by Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006).

Also, a score distribution heavily skewed towards zero makes meta-analyses of evaluation stability difficult to perform (Voorhees, 2005).
H05-1038
In particular, we examine the recent so-called “pyramid extension” that incorporates relevance judgments from multiple assessors to improve evaluation stability (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2006).

Pyramids in TREC 2006 Lin and Demner-Fushman (2006) present experimental evidence in support of nugget pyramids by applying the proposal to results from previous TREC QA evaluations.

Pyramid Extension The vital/okay distinction has been identified as a weakness in the TREC nugget-based evaluation methodology (Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Lin and DemnerFushman, 2006).
