This is the method used by several earlier papers on SF extraction starting with (Brent, 1991; Brent, 1993; Brent, 1994).

with related work Preliminary work on SF extraction from coq~ora was done by (Brent, 1991; Brunt, 1993; Brent, 1994) and (Webster and Marcus, 1989; Ushioda et al., 1993).

(Manning, 1993) applies Brent's method to parsed data and obtains a subcategorization dictionary for a larger set of verbs.

Using the values computed above: Pl -7tl k2 P2 --= -77, 2 kl +k2 p -7z 1 .-\]'It 2 Taking these probabilities to be binomially distributed, the log likelihood statistic (Dunning, 1993) is given by: 2 log A = 2\[log L(pt, k:l, rtl) @ log L(p2, k2, rl,2) -log L(p, kl, n2) log L(p, k2, n2)\] where, log L(p, n, k) = k logp + (,z -k)log(1 p) According to this statistic, tile greater the value of -2 log A for a particular pair of observed frame and verb, the more likely that frame is to be valid SF of the verb.

Also, techniques for extracting SF information fiom data can be used along with other research which aims to discover relationships between different SFs of a verb (Stevenson and Merlo, t999; Lapata and Brew, 1999; Lapata, 1999; Stevenson et al., 1999).

Brent (Brent, 1993; Brent, 1994) uses the standard method of testing miscue probabilities for filtering frames observed with a verb.

Machinereadable dictionaries are not comprehensive enough to provide this lexical infornaation (Manning, 1993; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).

Several techniques and results have been reported on learning subcategorization frames (SFs) from text corpora (Webster and Marcus, 1989; Brent, 1991; Brent, 1993; Brent, 1994; Ushioda et al., 1993; Manning, 1993; Ersan and Charniak, 1996; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Minnen, 1998; Carroll and Rooth, 1998).

In addition, except for (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Minnen, 1998), only a small number of SF types is considered.

(Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Carroll and Minnen, 1998) differs from earlier work in that a substantially larger set of SF types are considered; (Canoll and Rooth, 1998) use an EM algorithm to learn subcategorization as a result of learning rule probabilities, and, in tnrn, to improve parsing accuracy by applying the verb SFs obtained.
