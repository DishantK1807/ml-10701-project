We will also study the effect of other window sizes and the combination of this unsupervised approach with minimally-supervised approaches such as (Brill 1995) (Smith and Mann 2003).

Work Work related to toponym tagging has included harvesting of gazetteers from the Web (Uryupina 2003), hand-coded rules to place name disambiguation, e.g., (Li et al.2003) (Zong et al.2005), and machine learning approaches to the problem, e.g., (Smith and Mann 2003).

(Smith and Mann 2003) use a “minimally supervised” method that exploits as training data toponyms that are found locally disambiguated, e.g., “Nashville, Tenn.”; their disambiguation task is to identify the state or country associated with the toponym in test data that has those disambiguators stripped off.

There has of course been a large amount of work on the more general problem of word-sense disambiguation, e.g., (Yarowsky 1995) (Kilgarriff and Edmonds 2002).
P95-1026
While (Uryupina 2003) uses machine learning to induce gazetteers from the Internet, we merely download and merge information from two popular Web gazetteers.

(Li et al.2003) use a statistical approach to tag place names as a LOCation class.
