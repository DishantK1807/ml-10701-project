The third component is POST, which assigns parts of speech stochastically via a Hidden Markov model, has been described elsewhere \[Meteer, et al., 1991\].

1. INTRODUCTION Probabilistic part of speech taggers have proven to be successful in English part of speech labelling \[Church 1988; DeRose, 1988; de Marcken, 1990; Meteer, et.

A probabilistic part-of-speech tagger (POST) \[Meteer, et al., 1991\] which assumed a single sequence of words as input.

A third approach combines a rule-based part of speech tagger with a set of correction templates automatically derived from a training corpus \[Brill 1992\].

In motivation, it is similar to one of the goals of Brill (1992).
