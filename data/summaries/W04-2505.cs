We have developed a probabilistic approach extending the metonymy work of (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003).

4 Predicate-Argument Structures To identify predicate-argument structures in questions and passages, we have: (1) used the Proposition Bank or PropBank as training data; and (2) a mode for predicting argument roles similar to the one employed by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).

The identification of the expected answer type is based either on binary semantic dependencies extracted from the syntactic parse of the question (Harabagiu et al., 2001) or on the predicateargument structure of the question.

In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) a noisy channel model for Q/A was introduced.

Sentence into Predicate Argument Structures For the experiments, we used PropBank (www.cis.upenn.edu/»ace) along with PennTreeBank3 2 (www.cis.upenn.edu/»treebank) (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003).

This corpus contains about 53,700 sentences and a fixed split between training and testing which has been used in other researches (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2003).

These standard features, first proposed in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), are derived from parse trees as illustrated by Table 2.

As reported in (Surdeanu et al., 2003), the recognition of predicate-argument structures depends on features made available by full syntactic parses and by Named Entity Recognizers.
P03-1002
Since the verb ! object relation translates in one of the predicate-argument relations, we have coerced the predicate interpretations in the same way as (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003), but we allowed for any predicate-argument relation.

For question QI, the starting point is the concept identified as a cue for the expected answer type through methods described in (Harabagiu et al., 2000).
