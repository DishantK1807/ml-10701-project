In recent years, the availability of annotated corpora, such as TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), has triggered the use of machinelearning methods for temporal analysis (Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Boguraev and Ando, 2005).

This measure is commonly used in topic segmentation (Hearst, 1994) under the assumption that change in lexical distribution corresponds to topical change.
P94-1002
Some of these needs can be addressed by emerging technologies for temporal analysis (Wilson et al., 2001; Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Boguraev and Ando, 2005).

The score of the graph is computed by summing the scores of text (Wilson et al., 2001).

Given a set of annotated examples, we train a classifier2 to predict boundaries based on the following feature set: Lexical Features Temporal expressions, such as tomorrow and earlier, are among the strongest markers of temporal discontinuity (Passonneau, 1988; Bestgen and Vonk, 1995).

We define a temporal segment to be a fragment of text that does not exhibit abrupt changes in temporal focus (Webber, 1988).

The features we consider for the pairwise ordering task are similar to ones used in previous research on event ordering (Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Boguraev and Ando, 2005).

We automatically segment sentences into clauses using a robust statistical parser (Charniak, 2000).

Temporal interpretation encompasses levels ranging from the syntactic to the lexico-semantic (Reichenbach, 1947; Moens and Steedman, 1987) and includes the characterization of temporal discourse in terms of rhetorical structure and pragmatic relations (Dowty, 1986; Webber, 1987; Passonneau, 1988; Lascarides and Asher, 1993).

Work Temporal ordering has been extensively studied in computational linguistics (Passonneau, 1988; Webber, 1988; Hwang and Schubert, 1992; Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1993).

In fact, this method is commonly used in event ordering (Mani et al., 2003; Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Boguraev and Ando, 2005).
