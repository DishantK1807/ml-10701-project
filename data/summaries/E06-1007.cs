The transcription contains manually added punctuation, and it also explicitly records disfluencies and speech repairs by marking both interruption points and word fragments (Heeman & Allen, 1999).

In summary, the best approaches for detecting nonreferential it in written text already work reasonably well, yielding an F-measure of over 70% (Evans, 2001; Boyd et al., 2005).

Boydetal. (2005)obtainaprecision of 82% and a recall of 71% using a memory-based machine learning approach, and a similar precision but much lower recall (42%) using a decision tree classifier.

The majority of works on detecting nonreferential it in written text uses some variant of the partly syntactic and partly lexical tests described by Lappin & Leass (1994), the first work about computational pronoun resolution to address the potential benefit of detecting nonreferential it.
J94-4002
Dimitrov et al.(2002) modify and extend the approach of Lappin & Leass (1994) in several respects.
J94-4002
Boyd et al.(2005) use a 350.000 word corpus from a variety of genres.

We then examined the inter-annotator reliability of the annotation by calculating the κ score (Carletta, 1996).

(Bed017) In this example, only one of the three instances of it is a referential pronoun: The first it appears in the reparandum part of a speech repair (Heeman & Allen, 1999).

Lappin & Leass (1994) mainly supply a short list of modal adjectives and cognitive verbs, as well as seven syntactic patterns like It is Cogv-ed that S.

Finally, Boyd et al.(2005) also use a machine learning approach.
W05-0406
Finally, Strube & M¨uller (2003) describe an implemented system for resolving 3rd person pronouns in spoken dialog, but they also exclude nonreferential it from consideration.
P03-1022
Like many works that treat the detection of nonreferential it only as one of several steps of the coreference resolution process, Lappin & Leass (1994) do not give any figures about the performance of this filtering method.

Heeman & Allen (1999)).

For each spurt thus processed, POS tags were obtained automatically with the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).

The system of Byron (2002) is implemented, but deals mainly with how referents for already identified discourse-deictic anaphors can be created.
