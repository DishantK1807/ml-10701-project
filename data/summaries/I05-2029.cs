This menu of context sensitive queries is crucial to the interaction because a pointing gesture without an accompanying description is ambiguous (Schmauks, 1987) and it is through this menu selection that the player expresses intent and restricts the scope of the dialog.

In the specific case of combining natural language and graphics, there have been two main areas of study: interacting with graphical elements to resolve ambiguous references on the natural language side (Bolt, 1980; Kobsa et al., 1986); and generating coordinated text and graphic presentations using information from a knowledgebase (Andr√© and Rist (1994); Towns et al.(1998)). In addition to these two main areas, early work by Tennant (1983) experimented with using a predictive left-corner parser to populate dynamic menus that the user would navigate to construct queries that were guaranteed to be correct and task-relevant.
