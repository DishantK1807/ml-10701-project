Moore (2001) describes this technique in detail, while Pinkham & Corston-Oliver (2001) describes its integration with MSR-MT and investigates its effect on translation quality.

Menezes & Richardson (2001) provides further details and an evaluation of the LF alignment algorithm.

Some of these employ parsers to produce dependency structures for the sentence pairs in aligned bilingual corpora, which are then aligned to obtain transfer rules or examples (Meyers et al.2000; Watanabe et al.2000). Other systems extract and use examples that are represented as linear patterns of varying complexity (Brown 1999; Watanabe and Takeda 1998; Turcato et al.1999). For some EBMT systems, substantial collections of examples are also manually crafted or at least reviewed for correctness after being identified automatically (Watanabe et al.2000; Brown 1999; Franz et al.2000). The efforts that report accuracy results for fully automatic example extraction (Meyers et al.2000; Watanabe et al.2000) do so for very modest amounts of training data (a few thousand sentence pairs).

Richardson et al.(1998) describes how MindNet began as a lexical knowledge base containing LF-like structures that were produced automatically from the definitions and example sentences in machine-readable dictionaries.

Other variations of EBMT systems are hybrids that integrate an EBMT component as one of multiple sources of transfer knowledge (in addition to other transfer rule or knowledge based components) used during translation (Frederking et al.1994; Takeda et al.1992). To our knowledge, commercial quality MT has so far been achieved only through years of effort in creating hand-coded transfer rules.
