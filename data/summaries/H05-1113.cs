6.1.2 Point-wise Mutual Information (a16 ) Point-wise Mutual information of a collocation (Church and Hanks, 1989) is defined as, a16a18a17a19a11a21a20a23a22a25a24a27a26 a15a28a17a19a11a2a20a23a22a25a24a30a29a31a15a28a17a33a32a34a20a35a32a36a24 a15a28a17a19a11a2a20a35a32a36a24a30a29a37a15a28a17a33a32a34a20a23a22a25a24 where, a11 is the verb and a22 is the object of the collocation.
P89-1010
The basic idea in there is that “if an object appears only with one verb (or few verbs) in a large corpus we expect that it has an idiomatic nature” (Tapanainen et al., 1998).
P98-2210
They evaluate their model on English NN compounds and verb-particles, and showed that the model correlated moderately well with the Wordnet based decomposability theory (Baldwin et al., 2003).
W03-1812
The LSA model we built is similar to that described in (Schutze, 1998) and (Baldwin et al., 2003).
W03-1812
A typical natural language system assumes each word to be a lexical unit, but this assumption does not hold in case of MWEs (Becker, 1975) (Fillmore, 2003).
T75-2013
Schone and Jurafsky (Schone and Jurafsky, 2001) applied Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) to the analysis of MWEs in the task of MWE discovery, by way 900 of rescoring MWEs extracted from the corpus.

They do not fall cleanly into mutually exclusive classes, but populate the continuum between the two extremes (Bannard et al., 2003).

2obtained from Lin’s (Lin, 1998) automatically generated thesaurus (http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/a66 lindek/downloads.htm).
P98-2127
A similar comparison between the ranks according to Latent-Semantic Analysis (LSA) based features and the ranks of human judges has been made by McCarthy, Keller and Caroll (McCarthy et al., 2003) for verb-particle constructions.
W03-1810
mutual information difference with similar collocations (a38 ) This feature is based on Lin’s work (Lin, 1999).
P99-1041
Another way of determining the non-compositionality of V-N collocations is by using ‘distributed frequency of object’ (DFO) in V-N collocations (Tapanainen et al., 1998).

Several other measures like Log-Likelihood (Dunning, 1993), Pearson’s a2a4a3 (Church et al., 1991), Z-Score (Church et al., 1991), Cubic Association Ratio (MI3), etc., have been also proposed.
J93-1003
The corpus is parsed using Bikel’s parser (Bikel, 2004) and the Verb-Object Collocations are extracted.
W04-3224
Hence, we choose to use Lin’s thesaurus (Lin, 1998) instead of Wordnet (Miller et al., 1990).
P98-2127
Measuring the relative compositionality of V-N collocations is extremely helpful in applications such as machine translation where the collocations that are highly non-compositional can be handled in a special way (Schuler and Joshi, 2004) (Hwang and Sasaki, 2005).
P05-1068
An interesting way of quantifying the relative compositionality of a MWE is proposed by Baldwin, Bannard, Tanaka and Widdows (Baldwin et al., 2003).
W03-1809 W03-1812
Some of these are Frequency, Mutual Information (Church and Hanks, 1989), distributed frequency of object (Tapanainen et al., 1998) and LSA model (Baldwin et al., 2003) (Schutze, 1998).

Dekang Lin proposes a way to automatically identify the noncompositionality of MWEs (Lin, 1999).

Becker. 1975.

McCarthy, Keller and Caroll (McCarthy et al., 2003) judge compositionality according to the degree of overlap in the set of most similar words to the verb-particle and head verb.
W03-1810
Work (Breidt, 1995) has evaluated the usefulness of the Point-wise Mutual Information measure (as suggested by (Church and Hanks, 1989)) for the extraction of V-N collocations from German text corpora.

902 6.1.4 Distributed Frequency of Object (a0 ) The distributed frequency of object is based on the idea that “if an object appears only with one verb (or few verbs) in a large corpus, the collocation is expected to have idiomatic nature” (Tapanainen et al., 1998).
