Current state of the art syntactic parsers reach accuracies between 86% and 90%, as measured by different types of precision and recall (for more details see (Collins, 2003)).

Previous work on discourse parsing ((Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and (Forbes et al., 2001)) have focused on syntactic and lexical features only.

Based on the modified coding scheme manual, we segmented and annotated our instructional corpus using the augmented RST tool from (Marcu et al., 1999).

It is trained on a lot fewer examples than the state of the art syntaxbased discourse parser (Soricut and Marcu, 2003).

The lexicon is based on COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994).

To provide semantics for nouns, we use CoreLex (Buitelaar, 1998), in turn based on the generative lexicon(Pustejovsky, 1991).

Of course, since semantic information is hard to come by, it is not surprising that previous work on discourse parsing did not use it, or only used shallow word level ontological semantics as specified in WordNet (Polanyi et al., 2004).
W04-0211
However, since the corpus, the size of training data and the set of rhetorical relations we have used differ from (Soricut and Marcu, 2003), a direct comparison cannot be made.
N03-1030
The task of discourse parsing can be divided into two disjoint sub-problems ((Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and (Polanyi et al., 2004)).
