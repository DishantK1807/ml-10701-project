Chart Parsing 2.1 Chart Parsing The incremental parser has been grounded in a chart-parsing framework (Kay 1980, Thompson 1981, Thompson and Ritchie 1984) for the following reasons: • chart parsing is an efficient, open-ended, well understood, and frequently adopted technique in natural-language processing; • chart parsing gives us a previously unexplored possibility of embedding incrementality at a low cost.

SThe ~raldeter operation in Earley (1970); the ~ndarnentad rule in Thompson (1981:2).

Within natural-language processing, Tomita (1985) and Yonezawa and Ohsawa (1988) have reported parsers which operate on-line, but, incidentally, not incrementally in the sense adopted here.
