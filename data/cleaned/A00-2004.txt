Advances in domain independent linear text segmentation Freddy Y.
Y. Choi Artificial Intelligence Group Department of Computer Science University of Manchester Manchester, England choif@cs.man.ac.uk Abstract This paper describes a method for linear text segmentation which is twice as accurate and over seven times as fast as the state-of-the-art (Reynar, 1998).
Inter-sentence similarity is replaced by rank in the local context.
Boundary locations are discovered by divisive clustering.
1 Introduction
Even moderately long documents typically address sew~ral topics or different aspects of the same topic.
The aim of linear text segmentation is to discover the topic boundaries.
The uses of this procedure include information retrieval (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Reynar, 1999), summarization (Reynar, 1998), text understanding, anaphora resolution (Kozima, 1993), language modelling (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Beeferman et al., 199717) and improving document navigation for the visually disabled (Choi, 2000).
This paper focuses on domain independent methods for segmenting written text.
We present a new algorithm that builds on previous work by Reynar (Reynar, 1998; Reynar, 1994).
The primary distinction of our method is the use of a ranking scheme and the cosine similarity measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979) in formulating the similarity matrix.
We propose that the similarity values of short text segments is statistically insignificant.
Thus, one can only rely on their order, or rank, for clustering.
2 Background
Existing work falls into one of two categories, lexical cohesion methods and multi-source methods (Yaari, 1997).
The former stem from the work of Halliday and Hasan (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).
They proposed that text segments with similar vocabulary are likely to be part of a coherent topic segment.
hnplementations of this idea use word stem repetition (Youmans, 1991; Reynar, 1994; Ponte and Croft, 1997), context vectors (Hearst, 1994; Yaari, 1997; Kaufmann, 1999; Eichmann et al., 1999), entity repetition (Kan et al., 1998), semantic similarity (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Kozima, 1993), word distance model (Beeferman et al., 1997a) and word frequency model (Reynar, 1999) to detect cohesion.
Methods for finding the topic boundaries include sliding window (Hearst, 1994), lexical chains (Morris, 1988; Kan et al., 1998), dynamic programming (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Heinonen, 1998), agglomerative clustering (Yaari, 1997) and divisive clustering (Reynar, 1994).
Lexical cohesion methods are typically used for segmenting written text in a collection to improve information retrieval (Hearst, 1994; Reynat, 1998).
Multi-source methods combine lexical cohesion with other indicators of topic shift such as cue phrases, prosodic features, reference, syntax and lexical attraction (Beeferman et al., 1997a) using decision trees (Miike et al., 1994; Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Litman and Passonneau, 1995) and probabilistic models (Beeferman et al., 1997b; Hajime et al., 1998; Reynar, 1998).
Work in this area is largely motivated by the topic detection and tracking (TDT) initiative (Allan et al., 1998).
The focus is on the segmentation of transcribed spoken text and broadcast news stories where the presentation format and regular cues can be exploited to improve accuracy.
3 Algorithm
Our segmentation algorithm takes a list of tokenized sentences as input.
A tokenizer (Grefenstette and Tapanainen, 1994) and a sentence boundary disambiguation algorithm (Palmer and Hearst, 1994; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) or EAGLE (Reynar et al., 1997) may be used to convert a plain text document into the acceptable input format.
3.1 Similarity
measure Punctuation and uninformative words are removed from each sentence using a simple regular expression pattern mateher and a stopword list.
A stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980) is then applied to the remaining tokens to obtain the word stems.
A dictionary of word stem frequencies is constructed for each sentence.
This is represented as a vector of frequency counts.
Let fi,j denote the frequency of word j in sentence i.
The similarity between a pair of sentences x,y 26 is computed using the cosine measure as shown in equation 1.
This is applied to all sentence pairs to generate a similarity matrix.
E:, f.~., x :~., sim(x,y) = ~_~.,.~.,,,, f2.xEjf2.
(1) Figure 1 shows an example of a similarity matrix ~ . High similarity values are represented by bright pixels.
The bottom-left and top-right pixel show the self-similarity for the first and last sentence, respectively.
Notice the matrix is symmetric and contains bright square regions along the diagonal.
These regions represent cohesive text segments.
Each value in the similarity matrix is replaced by its rank in the local region.
The rank is the number of neighbouring elements with a lower similarity value.
Figure 2 shows an example of image ranking using a 3 x 3 rank mask with output range {0, 8}.
For segmentation, we used a 11 x 11 rank mask.
The output is expressed as a ratio r (equation 2) to circumvent normalisation problems (consider the cases when the rank mask is not contained in the image).

3.2 Ranking
For short text segments, the absolute value of sire(x, y) is unreliable.
An additional occurrence of a common word (reflected in the numerator) causes a disproportionate increase in sim(x,y) unless the denominator (related to segment length) is large.
Thus, in the context of text segmentation where a segment has typically < 100 informative tokens, one can only use the metric to estimate the order of similarity between sentences, e.g. a is more similar to b than c.
Furthermore, language usage varies throughout a document.
For instance, the introduction section of a document is less cohesive than a section which is about a particular topic.
Consequently, it is inappropriate to directly compare the similarity values from different regions of the similarity matrix.
In non-parametric statistical analysis, one compares the rank of data sets when the qualitative behaviour is similar but the absolute quantities are unreliable.
We present a ranking scheme which is an adaptation of that described in (O'Neil and Denos, 1992).
1The contrast of the image has been adjusted to highlight the image features.
# of elements with a lower value r = (2) # of elements examined To demonstrate the effect of image ranking, the process was applied to the matrix shown in figure 1 to produce figure 32 . Notice the contrast has been improved significantly.
Figure 4 illustrates the more subtle effects of our ranking scheme, r(x) is the rank (1 x 11 mask) of f(x) which is a sine wave with decaying mean, amplitude and frequency (equation 3).

3.3 Clustering
The final process determines the location of the topic boundaries.
The method is based on Reynar's maximisation algorithm (Reynar, 1998; Helfman, 1996; Church, 1993; Church and Helfman, 1993).
A text segment is defined by two sentences i,j (inclusive).
This is represented as a square region along the diagonal of the rank matrix.
Let si,j denote the sum of the rank values in a segment and aij = (j i + 1) 2 be the inside area.
B = {bl,...,bm} is a list of m (:oherent text segments, sk and ak refers to the sum of rank and area of segment k in B.
D is the inside density of B (see equation 4).
D (4) )-~k~l ak To initialise the process, the entire document is placed in B as one coherent text segment.
Each step of the process splits one of the segments in B.
The split point is a potential boundary which maximises D.
Figure 5 shows a working example.
The number of segments to generate, m, is determined automatically.
D (n) is the inside density of n segments and 5D (n) -D (n) -D (n-l) is the gradient.
For a document with b potential boundaries, b steps of divisive clustering generates (D (1), ..., D (b+l)} and {SD(2),...,SD (b+l)} (see figure 6 and 7).
An unusually large reduction in 5D suggests the optiinal clustering has been obtained 3 (see n = 10 in 3In practice, convolution (mask {1,2,4,8,4,2,1}) is first aI)plied to 5D to smooth out sharp local changes Rank matrix Step 2 Step 1 cut Step 3 Figure 5: A working example of the divisive elustering algorithm.

Let # and v be the mean and variance of 5D(n),n E {2, ..., b + 1}.
m is obtained by applying the threshold, p + c × v/~, to 5D (c = 1.2 works well in practice).

The method has a comLn2 Let refer to the rank value plexity of order 12 • ri,j in the rank matrix R and S to the sum of rank matrix.
Given R of size n × n, S is computed in three steps (see equation 5).
Figure 8 shows the result of applying this procedure to the rank matrix in figure 5.
4 Evaluation
The definition of a topic segment ranges from complete stories (Allan et al., 1998) to summaries (Ponte and Croft, 1997).
Given the quality of an algorithm is task dependent, the following experiments focus on the relative performance.
Our evaluation strategy is a variant of that described in (Reynar, 1998, 71-73) and the TDT segmentation task (Allan et al., 1998).
We assume a good algorithm is one that finds the most prominent topic boundaries.
4.1 Experiment

Low error probability indicates high accuracy.
Other performanc(; measures include the popular precision and recall metric (PR) (Hearst, 1994), fuzzy PR (Reynar, 1998) and edit distance (Ponte and Croft, 1997).
The l)roblems associated with these metrics are discussed in (Beeferman et al., 1999).

2 TextTiling We compare three versions of the TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 1994).
H94(c,d) is Hearst's C implementation with default parameters.
H94(c,r) uses the recommended parameters k = 6, w = 20.
H94(js) is my implementation of the algorithm.
Experimental result (table 3) shows H94(c,a) and H94(~,r) are more accurate than H94(js).
We suspect this is due to the use of a different stopword list and stemming algorithm.

3 DotPlot Five versions of Reynar's optimisation algorithm (Reynar, 1998) were evaluated.
R98 and R98(min) are exact implementations of his maximisation and minimisation algorithm.

It incorporates the optimisations described 7The full derivation of our method is available from the author.

in section 3.4.
R98(m,dot) is the modularised version of R98 for experimenting with different similarity measures.
R98(m,s,) uses a variant of Kozima's semantic similarity measure (Kozima, 1993) to compute block similarity.
Word similarity is a function of word cooccurrence statistics in the given document.
Words that belong to the same sentence are considered to be related.
Given the co-occurrence frequencies f(wi, wj), the transition probability matrix t is computed by equation 10.
Equation 11 defines our spread activation scheme, s denotes the word similarity matrix, x is the number of activation steps and norm(y) converts a matrix y into a transition matrix, x = 5 was used in the experiment.

4 Segmenter We compare three versions of Segmenter (Kan et al., 1998).
K98(B) is the original Perl implementation of 30 30 the algoritlun (version 1.6).
K98(j) is my implementation of the algorithm, K98(j,a) is a version of K98(j) which uses a document specific chain breaking strategy.
The distribution of link distances are used to identify unusually long links.
The threshold is a function # + c x vf5 of the mean # and variance u.
We found c = 1 works well in practice.
Table 5 summarises the experimental results.
K98(p) performed significantly better than K98g,,).
This is due to the use of a different part-of-speech tagger and shallow parser.
The difference in speed is largely due to the programming languages and term clustering strategies.
Our chain breaking strategy improved accuracy (compare K98(j) with K98(j,~)).

5 Our algorithm, C99 Two versions of our algorithm were developed, C99 and C99(b).
The former is an exact implementation of the algorithm described in this paper.
The latter is given the expected number of topic segments for fair comparison with R98.
Both algorithms used a 11 x 11 ranking mask.
The first experiment focuses on the impact of our automatic termination strategy on C99(~) (table 6).
C99(b) is marginally more accurate than C99.
This indicates our automatic termination strategy is effective but not optimal.
The minor reduction in speed performance is acceptable.

The second experiment investigates the effect of different ranking mask size on the performance of C99 (table 7).
Execution time increases with mask size.
A 1 x 1 ranking mask reduces all the elements in the rank matrix to zero.
Interestingly, the increase in ranking mask size beyond 3 x 3 has insignificant effect on segmentation accuracy.
This suggests the use of extrema for clustering has a greater impact on accuracy than linearising the similarity scores (figure 4).

4.7 Summary
Experimental result (table 8) shows our algorithm C99 is more accurate than existing algorithms.
A two-fold increase in accuracy and seven-fold increase in speed was achieved (compare C99(b) with R98).
If one disregards segmentation accuracy, H94 has the best algorithmic performance (linear).
C99, K98 and R98 are all polynomial time algorithms.
The significance of our results has been confirmed by both t-test and KS-test.

5 Conclusions
and future work A segmentation algorithm has two key elements, a clustering strategy and a similarity me~sure.
Our o'~4 31 results show divisive clustering (R98) is more precise than sliding window (H94) and lexical chains (K98) for locating topic boundaries.
Four similarity measures were examined.
The cosine coefficient (R98(s,co,)) and dot density measure (R98(m,(lot)) yield similar results.
Our spread activation based semantic measure (R98( ......,)) improved a.ccura(:y.
This confirms that although Kozima's apl)roaeh (Kozima, 1993) is computationally expensive, it does produce more precise segmentation.
Tile most significant improvement was due to our ranking scheme which linearises the cosine coefficient.
Our exl)eriments demonstrate that given insuffi(:lent data, tile qualitative behaviour of the cosine m(,asul'e is indeed more reliable than the actual valII(~S.
Although our evaluation scheme is sufficient for this (:omparative study, further research requires a large scale, task independent benchmark.
It would be interesting to corot)are C99 with the multi-source method described in (Beeferman et al., 1999) using the TDT corpus.
We would also like to develop a linear time and multi-source version of the algorithIIl.
