Like CCG, MCG suffers from spurious ambiguity, although this problem can be dealt with via normalisation (Morrill, 1988; Hepple & Morrill, 1989).

Hepple & Morrill (1989) suggest a solution to this problem that involves specifying a notion of normal form (NF) for CCG proofs, and ensuring that the parser returns only NF proofs.
