Classification In the experiments presented in Hulth (2003a), the automatic keyword indexing task is treated as a binary classification task, where each candidate term is classified either as a keyword or a non-keyword.

In Hulth (2003a) an evaluation of three different methods to extract candidate terms from documents is presented.
W03-1028
In Hulth (2003b), experiments on how the performance of the keyword extraction can be improved by combining the judgement of three classifiers are presented.
W03-1028
the NP-chunk Approach It was noted in Hulth (2003b) that when extracting NPchunks, the accompanying determiners are also extracted (per definition), but that determiners are rarely found at the initial position of keywords.

For these experiments, the same machine learning system—RDS—is used as for the experiments presented by Hulth (2003a).
W03-1028
The keyword extraction discussed in this paper is based on work presented in Hulth (2003a) and Hulth (2003b).

a General Corpus In the experiments presented in Hulth (2003a), only the documents present in the training, validation, and test set respectively are used for calculating the collection frequency.
W03-1028
In the experiments discussed so far, the weights given to the positive examples are those resulting in the best performance for each individual classifier (as described in Hulth (2003a)).
