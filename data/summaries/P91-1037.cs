As noted above, syntactic constituency information is generally considered a good predictor of phrasing information (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Selkirk, 1984; Marcus and Hindle, 1985; Steedman, 1990).

The most successful empirical studies in boundary location have investigated how phrasing can disambiguate potentially syntactically ambiguous utterances in read speech (Lehiste, 1973; Ostendorf et al., 1990).
H90-1006
The importance of phrase length has also been proposed (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990) as a determiner of boundary location.

We test these possibilities by examining part-of-speech in a window of four words surrounding each potential phrase break, using Church's part-of-speech tagger (1988).

The splitting rules in the implementation employed for this study (Riley, 1989) approximate optimality by choosing at each node the split which minimizes the prediction error rate on the training data.

While most interest in boundary prediction has been focussed on synthesis (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), currently there is considerable interest in predicting boundaries to aid recognition (Ostendoff et al., 1990; Steedman, 1990).

In future, we plan to extend the set of variables for analysis to include counts of stressed syllables, automatic NP-detection (Church, 1988), MUTUAL INFORMATION, GENERALIZED MUTUAL INFORMATION scores can serve as indicators of intonational phrase boundaries (Magerman and Marcus, 1990).

To test the former, we examine the class of the lowest node in the parse tree to dominate both wi and wj, using Hindle's parser, Fidditch (1989) To test the latter we determine the class of the highest node in the parse tree to dominate wi, but not wj, and the class of the highest node in the tree to dominate wj but not wi.
