A number of bootstrapping methods have been proposed to reduce the sensetagging cost (Hearst 1991; Basili 1997).

with other methods While our method aligns pairs of related words that are statistically extracted, WSD using parallel corpora aligns instances of words (Brown, et al.1991). Both alignment techniques are quite different.

A variety of unsupervised WSD methods, which use a machinereadable dictionary or thesaurus in addition to a corpus, have also been proposed (Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1995; Karov and Edelman 1998).

Bilingual parallel corpora, in which the senses of words in the text of one language are indicated by their counterparts in the text of another language, have also been used in order to avoid manually sense-tagging training data (Brown, et al.1991). Unlike the previous methods using bilingual corpora, our method does not require parallel corpora.

of pairs of related words The corpus of each language is statistically processed in order to extract a collection of pairs of related words in the language (Kaji et al.2000). First, we extract words from the corpus and count the occurrence frequencies of each word.

S3: a sports competition that tests a playerâ€™s ability S4: annoying thing or person S5: difficulties and troubles (Dagan and Itai 1994; Kikui 1998), where instances of co-occurrence in a first-language text are aligned with co-occurrences statistically extracted from the secondlanguage corpus.

Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998).

and evaluation We used two measurements, applicability and precision (Dagan and Itai 1994), to evaluate the performance of our method.

The underlying assumption is that translations of words that are related in one language are also related in the other language (Rapp 1995).
