Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).

Since the SFG annotation is semantically oriented, the work also bears some resemblance to Propbank (Palmer et al., 2005).

This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources ??FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) ??that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.

Dependency trees have been used in a variety of NLP applications, such as relation extraction (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2005).

Ding and Palmer (2005) introduced a version of probabilistic extension of Synchronous Dependency Insertion Grammars (SDIG) to deal with the pervasive structure divergence.
