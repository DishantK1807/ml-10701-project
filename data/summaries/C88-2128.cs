As mentioned above, the technique described here is just such an exe: cution model, and is directly related to the Earley deduction model of Pereira and Warren \[1983\]..

3As Jted previously \[Shieber, 1985\], this rule of inference can lead to arbitrary numbers of cousequents through repeated application when used with a grammar formalism with an infinite \[structured\] nonterminal domain.

Finally, on a more pessimistic note, we turn to a widespread problem in all systems for automatic generation of natural language, which Appelt \[1987\] has discussed under the rubric "the problem of logical-form equivalence".

The use of an agenda and scheduling schemes to allow varying the control structure of a parser also finds precedent in the work of Kaplan \[1973\] and Kay \[1967\].

As described by Pereira and Warren \[1983\], the parsing of strings ~ccording to the specifications of a grammar with an independent logcal semantics can be thought of as the constructive proving of the ;tring's grammaticality: parsing can he viewed as logical deduction.

Jacobs notes that other systems ~ have shared at least part of the linguistic information for parsing and generation; for instance, the HAM-ANS \[Wahlster et al., 1983\]'a;nd VII~-LANG \[Steinacker and Buchberger, 1983\] systems utilize the same lexical information for both tasks.

SAssuming that the prediction inference rule uses the restriction mechanism, the architecture actually mimics the variant of Eariey's algorithm previously described in \[Shieber, 1985\].

Perhaps the clearest espousal of the notion of grammar reversability was made by Kay \[1975\], whose research into functional grammar has been motivated by the desire to "make it possible to generate and analyze sentences with the same grammar".

In sum, this ordering strategy implements a sentence-disambiguatio n parsing method that has previously been argued \[Shieber, 1983\] to model certain psycholinguistic phenomena--for instance, right association and minimal attachment \[Fra~zier and Fodor, 1978\].
