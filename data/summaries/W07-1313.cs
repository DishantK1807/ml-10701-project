A range of implicit feedback techniques have been used for query expansion and user profiling in information retrieval tasks (Oard and Kim, 2001; Kelly and Teevan, 2003).

Ke et al.(2003) has demonstrated the applicability and advantages of MOGA in the context of the vowel and tonal systems, but the model is not explicit about the process of change that could give rise to the optimal vowel systems.

Although such models have been proposed in the literature (Croft, 2000; Baxter et al., 2006), the fact, that global optimization can be an outcome of local interactions between the speakers (e.g., Kirby (1999), de 72 Boer (2001), Choudhury et al.(2006b)), alone provides sufficient ground to believe that there is also an underlying self-organizational model for the present functional explanation.

5Keerthi and Lin (2003) prove that the Gaussian kernel will always do as well as or better than the linear kernel for binary classification.

Construction of VoNet: Many typological studies (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996; Hinskens and Weijer, 2003; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b) of segmental inventories have been carried out in past on the UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID) (Maddieson, 1984).

(Keller and Lapata, 2003) show that Web page counts and n-gram frequency counts are highly correlated in a log scale.

In fact, there are also computational models satisfactorily accounting for cases of vowel deletion (Choudhury et al., 2004; Choudhury et al., 2006b) and assimilation (Dras et al., 2003).

Of late, there have been some attempts to explain the vowel systems through multi agent simulations (de Boer, 2000) and genetic algorithms (Ke et al., 2003); all of these experiments also use the principle of perceptual contrast for optimization purposes.

Linguistic research has documented a wide range of regularities across the sound systems of the world?s languages (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; Lindblom, 1986; de Boer, 2000; Choudhury et al., 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006a; Mukherjee et al., 2006b).

Consequently, with the exception of a few (e.g., Hare and Elman (1995); Dras et al.(2003); Ke et al.(2003); Choudhury et al.(2006b)), all the mathematical and computational models developed for explaining language change are built for artificial toy languages.

Formulation Choudhury et al.(2006a) has shown that a sequence of simple phonological changes, which we shall call the Atomic Phonological Operators or APO for short, when applied to the classical Bengali lexicon, gives rise to the modern dialects.

The range of reports for any given patient at any given point in their illness thus present a special class of paraphrase, with a looser adherance to semantic equivalence between versions than is typically found in other paraphrase generators, for example Kozlowski et al (2003), McKeown et al (1994), Power, Scott and Bouyaad-Agha (2003), Rosner and Stede (1994),(1996), and Scott and Souza (1990).
