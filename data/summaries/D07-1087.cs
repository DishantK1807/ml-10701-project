As a last measure for segmentation quality we used WindowDiff (Pevzner and Hearst, 2002), which only evaluates segment boundaries not the labels assigned to them.

The task of automatically finding and labelling segments in object or event descriptions has been referred to as field segmentation (Grenager et al., 2005).1 It can be seen as a sequence labelling problem, where each text is viewed as a sequence of tokens and the aim is to assign each token a label indicating to what segment the token belongs (e.g., BIOTOPE or LOCATION).

One of the few unsupervised approaches is provided by Grenager et al.(2005), who perform field segmentation on bibliographic records and classified advertisements, using EM to fit an HMM to the data.
