The algorithms for nondestructive unification have been influenced by Tomabechi (1991), but applicative expressions and residuations change the landscape significantly.
P91-1041
A line of research that the author is pursuing currently (Wittenburg 1992b) is to design a more specialized grammar formalism that finesses some of the complexity of residuation and unification through a version of "pseudo-unification" (Tomita 1990).
C90-1012
Constraints expressed as relations in frameworks such as Zajac (1992) could instead be expressed in F-PATR as compiled functions, leading perhaps to improved runtime speeds.
