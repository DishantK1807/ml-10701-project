Unlike lower-level problems in natural language processing (NLP) in which local information appears to bear highly on the outcome, including, for instance, part-of-speech tagging (Church, 1988; Brill, 1992, inter alia) and sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1994; Yarowsky, 1995, inter alia), none of the questions we have formulated appear to be particularly indicative of what effect a potential merge will have on system performance.

For instance, Kehler (1997) describes a probabilistic approach to entity-level merging that outperforms several baseline metrics.

In the second set of experiments, we used the approach to maximum entropy modeling described by Berger et al.(1996). The two possible values for each of the same 50 questions (i.e., yes or no) were paired with each of the two possible outcomes for merging (i.e., correct merge or not) to create a set of feature functions, or features for short, which were used in turn to define constraints on a probabilistic model.

As an example, we consider the task specified for the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), which was, roughly speaking, to identify information in business news that describes executives moving in and out of high-level positions within companies (Appelt et al., 1995).
