This is also the objective of the Web People Search (WePS) task (Artiles et al., 2007).

scale knowledge Resources The evaluation presented here covers a wide range of large-scale semantic resources: WordNet (WN) (Fellbaum, 1998), eXtended WordNet (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), large collections of semantic preferences acquired from SemCor (Agirre and Martinez, 2001; Agirre and Martinez, 2002) or acquired from the BNC (McCarthy, 2001), large-scale Topic Signatures for each synset acquired from the web (Agirre and de la Calle, 2004) or SemCor (Landes et al., 2006).

The goal of the Web People Search task (Artiles et al.2007) is to assign Web pages to groups, where each group contains all (and only those) pages that refer to one unique entity.

This is a disappointing result when compared to our previous work on Senseval-3 all-words where we were able to beat the best official results (Agirre et al., 2006).

In this paper, we described our participating system in the SemEval-2007 Web People Search Task (Artiles et al., 2007).

In (Agirre et al., 2006) we already tested our approach on the Senseval-3 all-words task.

This process is thoroughly explained in (Agirre et al., 2006b).

The system is based on a single k-NN classifier using the features described in (Agirre et al., 2006) and made available at the task website (cf.

The goal for SemEval-2007 task 2 (Evaluating Word Sense Induction and Discrimination Systems)(Agirre and Soroa, 2007) is to automatically discriminate the senses of English target words by the use of only untagged data.

Although the clustering results with the best settings for hierarchical and agglomerative clustering were very close with regard to F-score (combining purity and inverse purity, see (Artiles et al., 2007) for a more detailed description), manual inspection of the content of the clusters has revealed big differences between the two approaches.

This algorithm was previously tested on the datasets from previous editions of Senseval (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2006).

Our previous experience has shown that splitting the problem up into more coherent spaces, training different classifiers in each feature space, and then combining them into a single classifier is a good way to improve the results (Agirre et al., 2005; Agirre et al., 2006).

Our system was not built specifically for the web people search task WePS (Artiles et al., 2007), but is an early version of an IE system that has the more general goal to discover relations between NEs.

Sections 3 and 4 presents in more detail the implementation of the framework for the Semeval2007 WEPS task (Artiles et al., 2007) and Semeval2007 sense induction task (Agirre and Soroa, 2007), respectively.
