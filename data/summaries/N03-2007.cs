In recent work by Alshawi (2003) reported in this conference, new methods for unsupervised training of phone string recognizers have been developed, removing the need for word-level transcription.

Setup The datasets tested on and the classifier used are the same as those in the experiments on phone sequence classification reported by Alshawi (2003).

Phone Recognition Unsupervised recognition of phone sequences is carried out according to the method described by Alshawi (2003).
N03-1001
The initial model used to start the iteration is, as in (Alshawi, 2003), an unweighted phone loop.
