Compilation of this rule in the algorithm of Kaplan and Kay (1994) (KK for short) involves composing together six transducers, see Figure 1.

Clarity is important since, as pointed out by Kaplan and Kay (1994), the representation of rewrite rules by finite-state transducers involves many subtleties.
J94-3001
Finite-state transducers provide just such a compact representation (Mohri, 1994).
P94-1028
However, our methods extend straightforwardly to other modes of application (optional, right-to-left, simultaneous, batch), or kinds of rules (two-level rules) discussed by Kaplan and Kay (1994).
J94-3001
The following theorem extends to the weighted case the assertion proved by Kaplan and Kay (1994).
J94-3001
It can then be determinized and minimized (Mohri, 1994).
P94-1028
Only the necessary part of the intermediate transducers is then expanded for a given input (Pereira et al., 1994).
H94-1050
Kaplan and Kay (1994), or equivalently Karttunen (1995), provide an algorithm for compiling rewrite rules into finite-state transducers, under the condition that they do not rewrite their noncontextual part 2.
J94-3001 P95-1003
These transducers are very useful in speech processing (Pereira et al., 1994).
H94-1050
Using naive algorithms can be very time consuming and lead to very large machines (Liberman, 1994).
J94-3002
However, the weight of the transducer and those of the string or automaton need to be combined too, here added, during composition (Pereira et al., 1994).
