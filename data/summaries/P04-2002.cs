In particular, this form of the problem models exactly the “missing axiom theory” of Smith and Hipp (1994; 1995) which proposes that dialog is aimed at proving the top-level goal in a theorem-proving tree and “missing axioms” in the proof provide motivation for interactions with the dialog partner.
