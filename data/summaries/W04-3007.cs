Traditionally, most semantic parser systems have been built using hand-crafted semantic grammar rules and so-called robust parsing (Ward and Issar, 1996; Seneff, 1992; Dowding et al., 1994) is used to handle the ill-formed user input in which word patterns corresponding to semantic tokens are used to fill slots in different semantic frames in parallel.

In recent years, MAP adaptation has been successfully applied to n-gram language models (Bacchiani and Roark, 2003) and lexicalized PCFG models (Roark and Bacchiani, 2003).
