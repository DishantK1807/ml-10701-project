In the classic natural language generation (NLG) architecture (Reiter, 1994), sentence boundary decisions are made during the sentence planning stage in which the syntactic structure and wording of sentences are decided.

Recently, Walker (2002) and Stent (2004) used statistical features derived from corpus to rank generated sentence plans.

The second strategy is to employ syntactic, lexical, and sentence complexity constraints to control the aggregation of multiple propositions (Robin, 1994; Shaw, 1998).
P98-2199
To design a sentence boundary determination method that addresses these issues, we employ an instance-based approach (Varges and Mellish, 2001; Pan and Shaw, 2004).

For example, Proteus (Davey, 1979; Ritchie, 1984) produces game descriptions by employing domainspecific sentence scope heuristics.
P84-1066
Another strategy described in Mann and Moore(1981) guided the aggregation process by using an evaluation score that is sensitive to the structure and term usage of a sentence.
