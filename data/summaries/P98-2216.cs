It seems nevertheless that all 2Church and Hanks (1989), Smadja (1993) use statistics in their algorithms to extract collocations from texts.

(Viegas and Bouillon, 1994) showed that we can reduce the set of what are conventionally considered as idiosyncrasies by differentiating "true" idiosyncrasies (difficult to derive or calculate) from expressions which have well-defined calculi, being compositional in nature, and that have been called semantic collocations.

(Viegas et al., 1996) used derivational lexical rules to extend a Spanish lexicon.

We further distinguished the notion of idiosyncrasies as defined in (Viegas and Bouillon, 1994), into restricted semantic co--occurrences and restricted lexical co-occurrences.

Other classes, such as the ones below can be extracted using lexico-statistical tools, such as in (Smadja, 1993), and then checked by a human.

Computational Lexical Semantic Approach In order to account for the continuum we find in natural languages, we argue for a continuum perspective, spanning the range from free-combining words to idioms, with semantic collocations and idiosyncrasies in between as defined in (Viegas and Bouillon, 1994): • free-combining words (the girl ate candies) * semantic collocations (fast car; long book) 6 • idiosyncrasies (large coke; green jealousy) • idioms (to kick the (proverbial) bucket) Formally, we go from a purely compositional approach in "free-combining words" to a noncompositional approach in idioms.
