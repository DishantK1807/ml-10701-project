Generating Referring Expressions The Principles of Reference Dale \[1988, 1989\] presents a solution to the content determination task which is motivated by three principles of refcrence.

Conclusion Wc have shown how tile referring expression generation algorithm presented in Dale \[1988, 1989\] can bc extended to encompass the use of relations, by making use of constraint network consistency.

The solution proposed in Dale \[1988, 1989\] focuses on the second and third of these principles of reference as constraints on the content determination task.

In this paper, we point out some limitations in an earlier solution proposed in Dale \[1988, 1989\], and discuss the possibilites of extending this solution by incorporating a use of constraints motivated by the work of Haddock \[1987, 1988\].

4In the terminology of Dale \[1988, 1989\], this is equivalent to finding the property with the greatest discriminatory power.
