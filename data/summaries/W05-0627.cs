∗This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China via grant 60435020 Last year, CoNLL-2004 hold a semantic role labeling shared task (Carreras and M arquez, 2004) to test the participant systems’ performance based on shallow syntactic parser results.
W04-2412
Xue and Palmer (2004; 2005) and Kwon et al.(2004) have applied the maximum entropy classi er to semantic role labeling task successfully.
C04-1179 W04-3212
In 2005, SRL shared task is continued (Carreras and M arquez, 2005), because it is a complex task and now it is far from desired performance.
W05-0620
In our SRL system, we select maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996) as a classi er to implement the semantic role labeling system.
