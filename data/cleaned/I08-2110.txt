Abstract
This paper proposes a  exible matching
method that can assimilate the expressive
divergence. First, broad-coverage syn-
onymous expressions are automatically ex-
tracted from an ordinary dictionary, and
among them, those whose distributional
similarity in a Web corpus is high are used
forthe exiblematching. Then, toovercome
the combinatorial explosion problem in the
combination of expressive divergence, an ID
is assigned to each synonymous group, and
SYNGRAPH data structure is introduced to
pack the expressive divergence. We con-
 rmed the effectiveness of our method on
experiments of machine translation and in-
formation retrieval.
1 Introduction
In natural language, many expressions have almost
the same meaning, which brings great dif culty to
many NLP tasks, such as machine translation (MT),
information retrieval (IR), and question answering
(QA). For example, suppose an input sentence (1) is
given to a Japanese-English example-based machine
translation system.
(1) hotel ni
hotel
ichiban
best
chikai
near
eki wa
station
doko-desuka
where is
Even if a very similar translation example (TE)
 (2-a) $ (2-b) exists in the TEs, a simple exact
matching method cannot utilize this example for the
translation.
(2) a. ryokan no
Japanese hotel
moyori no
nearest
eki wa
station
doko-desuka
where is
b. Whereâ€™s the nearest station to the hotel?
How to handle these synonymous expressions has
become one of the important research topics in NLP.
This paper presents a  exible matching method,
which can assimilate the expressive divergence, to
solve this problem. This method has the following
two features:
1. Synonymy relations and hypernym-hyponym
relations are automatically extracted from an
ordinary dictionary and a Web corpus.
2. Extracted synonymous expressions are effec-
tively handled by SYNGRAPH data structure,
which can pack the expressive divergence.
An ordinary dictionary is a knowledge source
to provide synonym and hypernym-hyponym rela-
tions(NakamuraandNagao, 1988; Tsurumaruetal.,
1986). A problem in using synonymous expressions
extracted from a dictionary is that some of them are
notappropriatesincetheyarerarelyused. Forexam-
ple, a synonym pair  suidou 1 =  kaikyou(strait) is
extracted.
Recently, some work has been done on corpus-
based paraphrase extraction (Lin and Pantel, 2001;
Barzilay and Lee, 2003). The basic idea of their
methods is that two words with similar meanings
are used in similar contexts. Although their methods
can obtain broad-coverage paraphrases, the obtained
paraphrases are not accurate enough to be utilized
1This word usually means  water supply .

for achieving precise matching since they contain
synonyms, near-synonyms, coordinate terms, hyper-
nyms, and inappropriate synonymous expressions.
Our approach makes the best use of an ordi-
nary dictionary and a Web corpus to extract broad-
coverage and precise synonym and hypernym-
hyponym expressions. First, synonymous expres-
sions are extracted from a dictionary. Then, the
distributional similarity of a pair of them is calcu-
lated using a Web corpus. Among extracted syn-
onymous expressions, those whose similarity is high
are used for the  exible matching. By utilizing only
synonymousexpressionsextractedfromadictionary
whose distributional similarity is high, we can ex-
clude synonymous expressions extracted from a dic-
tionary that are rarely used, and the pair of words
whose distributional similarity is high that is not ac-
tually a synonymous expression (is not listed in a
dictionary).
Another point of our method is to introduce SYN-
GRAPH data structure. So far, the effectiveness
of handling expressive divergence has been shown
for IR using a thesaurus-based query expansion
(Voorhees, 1994; Jacquemin et al., 1997). However,
their methods are based on a bag-of-words approach
and thus does not pay attention to sentence-level
synonymy with syntactic structure. MT requires
such precise handling of synonymy, and advanced
IR and QA also need it. To handle sentence-level
synonymy precisely, we have to consider the combi-
nation of expressive divergence, which may cause
combinatorial explosion. To overcome this prob-
lem, an ID is assigned to each synonymous group,
and then SYNGRAPH data structure is introduced
to pack expressive divergence.
2 Synonymy
Database
This section describes a method for constructing a
synonymy database. First, synonym/hypernym re-
lations are automatically extracted from an ordinary
dictionary, and the distributional similarity of a pair
of synonymous expressions is calculated using a
Web corpus. Then, the extracted synonymous ex-
pressions whose similarity is high are used for the
 exible matching.
2.1 Synonym/hypernym Extraction from an
Ordinary Dictionary
Although there were some attempts to extract syn-
onymous expressions from a dictionary (Nakamura
and Nagao, 1988; Tsurumaru et al., 1986), they ex-
tracted only hypernym-hyponym relations from the
limited entries. In contrast, our method extracts not
only hypernym-hyponym relations, but also basic
synonym relations, predicate synonyms, adverbial
synonyms and synonym relations between a word
and a phrase.
The last word of the  rst de nition sentence is
usually the hypernym of an entry word. Some de -
nition sentences in a Japanese dictionary are shown
below(theleftwordof : isanentryword, theright
sentence is a de nition, and words in bold font is the
extracted words):
yushoku (dinner) : yugata (evening) no (of)
shokuji (meal).
jushin (barycenter) : omosa (weight) ga (is)
tsuriatte (balance) tyushin (center) tonaru
(become) ten (spot).
For example, the last word shokuji (meal) can be
extracted as the hypernym of yushoku (dinner). In
somecases, however,awordotherthanthelastword
can be a hypernym or synonym. These cases can be
detected by sentencenal patterns as follows (the
underlined expressions represent the patterns):
Hypernyms
dosei (Saturn) : wakusei (planet) no (of) hitotsu
(one).
tobi (kite) : taka (hawk) no (of) issyu (kind).
Synonyms / Synonymous Phrases
ice : ice cream no (of) ryaku (abbreviation).
mottomo (most) : ichiban (best). ( one word de -
nition)
moyori (nearest) : ichiban (best) chikai (near)
tokoro (place)2. ( less than three phrases)
2.2 Calculating
the Distributional Similarity
using a Web Corpus
The similarity between a pair of synonymous ex-
pressions is calculated based on distributional sim-
ilarity (J.R.Firth, 1957; Harris, 1968) using the
Web corpus collected by (Kawahara and Kurohashi,
2006). The similarity between two predicates is de-
 ned to be one between the patterns of case exam-
ples of each predicate (Kawahara and Kurohashi,
2001). Thesimilaritybetweentwonounsarede ned
2If the last word of a sentence is a highly general term such
as koto (thing) and tokoro (place), it is removed from the syn-
onymous expression.

as the ratio of the overlapped co-occurrence words
using the Simpson coef cient. The Simpson coef -
cient is computed as jT(w1)^T(w2)jmin(jT(w1)j;jT(w2)j), where T(w) is
the set of co-occurrence words of word w.
2.3 Integrating
the Distributional Similarity
into the Synonymous Expressions
Synonymous expressions can be extracted from a
dictionary as described in Section 2.1. However,
some extracted synonyms/hypernyms are not appro-
priate since they are rarely used. Especially, in the
case of that a word has multiple senses, the syn-
onym/hypernym extracted from the second or later
de nition might cause the inappropriate matching.
For example, since  suidou has two senses, the
two synonym pairs,  suidou =  jyosuidou(water
supply) and  suidou =  kaikyou(strait) , are ex-
tracted. The second sense is rarely used, and thus if
the synonymy pair extracted from the second de -
nition is used as a synonym relation, an inappropri-
atematchingthroughthissynonymmightbecaused.
Therefore, only the pairs of synonyms/hypernyms
whose distributional similarity calculated in Section
2.2 is high are utilized for the  exible matching.
Thesimilaritythresholdis setto0.4for synonyms
and to 0.3 for hypernyms. For example, since the
similarity between  suidou and  kaikyou is 0.298,
this synonym is not utilized.
2.4 Synonymy
Database Construction
With the extracted binomial relations, a synonymy
database can be constructed. Here, polysemic words
should be treated carefully3. When the relations
A=B and B=C are extracted, and B is not polysemic,
3If a word has two or more de nition items in the dictionary,
the word can be regarded as polysemic.
they can be merged into A=B=C. However, if B is
polysemic, the synonym relations are not merged
through a polysemic word. In the same way, as for
hypernym-hyponym relations, A ! B and B ! C,
and A ! B and C ! B are not merged if B is pol-
ysemic. By merging binomial synonym relations
with the exception of polysemic words, synony-
mous groups are constructed  rst. They are given
IDs, hereafter called SYNID4. Then, hypernym-
hyponym relations are established between synony-
mous groups. We call this resulting data as syn-
onymy database. Figure 1 shows examples of syn-
onymous groups in the synonymy database. In this
paper, SYNID is denoted by using English gloss
word, surrounded by  h i  .
3 SYNGRAPH
3.1 SYNGRAPH
Data Structure
SYNGRAPH data structure is an acyclic directed
graph, and the basis of SYNGRAPH is the depen-
dencystructureofanoriginalsentence(inthispaper,
a robust parser (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994) is al-
ways employed). In the dependency structure, each
node consists of one content word and zero or more
function words, which is called a basic node here-
after. If the content word of a basic node belongs to
a synonymous group, a new node with the SYNID is
attached to it, and it is called a SYN node hereafter.
For example, in Figure 2, the shaded nodes are basic
nodes and the other nodes are SYN nodes5.
Then, if the expression conjoining two or more
4Spelling variations such as use of Hiragana, Katakana
or Kanji are handled by the morphological analyzer JUMAN
(Kurohashi et al., 1994).
5The reason why we distinguish basic nodes from SYN
nodes is to give priority to exact matching over synonymous
matching.

nodes corresponds to one synonymous group, a
SYN node is added there. In Figure 2, hnearesti is
such a SYN node. Furthermore, if one SYN node
has a hyper synonymous group in the synonymy
database, the SYN node with the hyper SYNID is
also added.
In this SYNGRAPH data structure, each node has
a score, NS (Node Score), which re ects how much
the expression of the node is shifted from the orig-
inal expression. We explain how to calculate NSs
later.
3.2 SYNGRAPH
Matching
Two SYNGRAPHs match if and only if
â€  all the nodes in one SYNGRAPH can be
matched to the nodes in the other one,
â€  the matched nodes in two SYNGRAPHs have
the same dependency structure, and
â€  the nodes can cover the original sentences.
An example of SYNGRAPH matching is illustrated
in Figure 2. When two SYNGRAPHs match each
other, their matching score is calculated as follows.
First, the matching score of the matching two nodes,
NMS (Node Match Score) is calculated with their
node scores, NS1 and NS2,
NMS = NS1  NS2  FI Penalty;
where we de ne FI Penalty (Function word Incon-
sistency Penalty) is 0.9 when their function words
are not the same, and 1.0 otherwise.
Then, the matching score of two SYNGRAPHs,
SMS (SYNGRAPH Match Score) is de ned as the
average of NMSs weighted by the number of basic
nodes,
SMS =
P(# of basic nodes  NMS)
P# of basic nodes :
In an example shown in Figure 2, the NMS of the
left-hand side hotel node and the right-hand side ho-
tel node is 0.9 (= 1:0  1:0  0:9). The NMS of the
left-hand side hnearesti node and the right-hand side
hnearesti node is 0.98 (= 0:99  0:99  1:0). Then,
the SMS becomes 0:9 2+0:98 3+1:0 22+3+2 = 0:96.
3.3 SYNGRAPH
Transformation of Synonymy
Database
The synonymy database is transformed into SYN-
GRAPHs, where SYNGRAPH matching is itera-
tively applied to interpret the mutual relationships
in the synonymy database, as follows:
Step 1: Each expression in each synonymous group
is parsed and transformed into a fundamental SYN-
GRAPH.
Step 2: SYNGRAPH matching is applied to check
whetherasub-treeofoneexpressionismatchedwith
any other whole expressions. If there is a match, a
new node with the SYNID of the whole matched ex-
pression is assigned to the partially matched nodes
group. Furthermore, if the SYNID has a hyper syn-
onymous group, another new node with the hyper-
nym SYNID is also assigned. This checking process
starts from small parts to larger parts.
We de ne the NS of the newly assigned SYN
node as the SMS multiplied by a relation penalty.
Here, we de ne the synonymy relation penalty as
0.99 and the hypernym relation penalty as 0.7. For
instance, the NS of hunderwateri node is 0.99 and
that of hinsidei node is 0.7.
Step 3: Repeat Step 2, until no more new SYN node
can be assigned to any expressions. In the case of
Figure 3 example, the new SYN node, hdivingi is
given to  suityu (underwater) ni (to) moguru (dive) 
of hdiving(sport)i at the second iteration.
4 Flexible
Matching using SYNGRAPH
We use example-based machine translation (EBMT)
as an example to explain how our  exible matching
method works (Figure 4). EBMT generates a trans-
lation by combining partially matching TEs with an
input6. We use  exible matching to fully exploit the
TEs.
6How to select the best TEs and combine the selected TEs
for generating a translation is omitted in this paper.

First, TEs are transformed into SYNGRAPHs by
SYNGRAPH matching with SYNGRAPHs of the
synonymy database. Since the synonymy database
has been transformed into SYNGRAPHs, we do not
need to care the combinations of synonymous ex-
pressions any more. In the example shown in Fig-
ure 3,  sensui (diving) suru (do) sport in the TE is
given hdiving(sport)i node just by looking at SYN-
GRAPHs in hdiving(sport)i synonymous group.
Then, an input sentence is transformed into a
SYNGRAPH by SYNGRAPH matching, and then
the SYNGRAPH matching is applied between all
the sub trees of the input SYNGRAPH and SYN-
GRAPHs of TEs to retrieve the partially matching
TEs.
5 Experiments
and Discussion
5.1 Evaluation
on Machine Translation Task
To see the effectiveness of the our proposed method,
we conducted our evaluations on a MT task us-
ing Japanese-English translation training corpus
(20,000 sentence pairs) and 506 test sentences of
IWSLTâ€™057. As an evaluation measure, NIST and
BLEU were used based on 16 reference English sen-
tences for each test sentence.
7http://www.is.cs.cmu.edu/iwslt2005/.
Table 1: Size of synonymy database.
# of synonymous group 5,046
# of hypernym-hyponym relation 18,590
The synonymy database used in the experiments
was automatically extracted from the REIKAI-
SHOGAKU dictionary (a dictionary for children),
which consists of about 30,000 entries. Table
1 shows the size of the constructed synonymy
database.
As a base translation system, we used an EBMT
system developed by (Kurohashi et al., 2005). Ta-
ble 2 shows the experimental results.  None means
the baseline system without using the synonymy
database.  Synonym is the system using only
synonymous relations, and it performed best and
achieved 1.2% improvement for NIST and 0.8%
improvement for BLEU over the baseline. These
differences are statistically signi cant (p < 0:05).
Some TEs that can be retrieved by our  exible
matching are shown below:
â€  input: fujin (lady) you (for) toile (toilet) $
TE: josei (woman) you (for) toile (toilet)
â€  input: kantan-ni ieba(inshort)$TE:tsumari
(in other words)
On the other hand, if the system also uses
hypernym-hyponym relation ( Synonym Hyper-
nym ), the score goes down. It proves that hyper-
nym examples are not necessarily good for trans-
lation. For example, for a translation of depato
(department store), its hypernym  mise(store) was
used, and it lowered the score.
Major errors are caused by the de ciency of word
sense disambiguation. When a polysemic word oc-
curs in a sentence, multiple SYNIDs are attached
to the word, and thus, the incorrect matching might
be occurred. Incorporation of unsupervised word-

5.2 Evaluation
on Information Retrieval Task
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in other NLP tasks, we also evaluated it in IR.
More concretely, we extended word-based impor-
tance weighting of Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al.,
1994) to SYN node-based weighting. We used the
data set of IR evaluation workshop IREX, which
contains 30 queries and their corresponding relevant
documents in 2-year volume of newspaper articles8.
Table 3 shows the experimental results, which are
evaluated with R-precision. The baseline system is
our implementation of OKAPI BM25. Differently
from the MT task, the system using both synonym
and hypernym-hyponym relations performed best,
and its improvement over the baseline was 7.8%
relative. This difference is statistically signi cant
(p < 0:05). This result shows the wide applicabil-
ity of our  exible matching method for NLP tasks.
Some examples that can be retrieved by our  exible
matching are shown below:

ment: shou-gakkou-ni (elementary school)

6 Conclusion
This paper proposed a  exible matching method by
extracting synonymous expressions from an ordi-
nary dictionary and a Web corpus, and introducing
SYNGRAPH data structure. We con rmed the ef-
fectiveness of our method on experiments of ma-
chine translation and information retrieval.

Our future research targets are to incorporate
word sense disambiguation to our framework, and
to extend SYNGRAPH matching to more structural
paraphrases.
