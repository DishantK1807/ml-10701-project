The only similar performing tool is the Trigrams `n' Tags tagger (Brants, 2000) which uses a much simpler statistical model.

First, it recognizes non-recursive Base Noun Phrase (BNP) (our specifications for BNP resemble those in Ramshaw and Marcus 1995).

33. oravecz@nytud.hu Abstract In the world of non-proprietary NLP software the standard, and perhaps the best, HMM-based POS tagger is TnT (Brants, 2000).

Even without a formal survey it is clear that TnT (Brants, 2000) is used widely in research labs throughout the world: Google Scholar shows over 400 citations.

For the most part, these features are clever hacks, and it is unfortunate that neither Brants (2000) nor the standard HMM textbooks mention them, especially as they often yield more significant error reduction than the move from HMM to other architectures.

Stochastic models (Cutting et al., 1992; Dermatas et al., 1995; Brants, 2000) have been widely used in POS tagging for simplicity and language independence of the models.

Furthermore, in order to estimate the relative performance of the models, experiments were carried out with two existing taggers: TnT (Brants, 2000) and ACOPOST 3 . The accuracy achieved using TnT are 87.44% and 87.36% respectively with bigram and trigram model for 40K training data.
