Nevertheless, we would like to use the performance of Chinese NER identification using memory-based learning (MBL) (Zhang and Zhou, 2000) for a comparison with our approach in Table 5.

The following essential factors motivate our definition for relation features: • The relation features should be selected from multiple linguistic levels, i.e., morphology, grammar and semantics (Cardie, 1996); • They can help us to identify NERs using positive and negative case-based machine learning as their information do not only deal with NERs but also with non-NERs; and • They should embody the crucial information of Chinese language processing (Dang et al., 2002), such as word order, the context of words, and particles etc.

As an initial step, we define 14 different NERs based on six identified NEs in a sports domain based Chinese named entity recognition system (Yao et al., 2003).
