There are also a large percentage (312/1547) of “tough” abbreviation patterns (Changand Lai, 2004), which are considered “tough”in the sense that they violate some simple assumptions, and thus cannot be modeled in a simple way.

In this work, we had applied a unified word segmentation model developed in a previous works (Chang and Lai, 2004), which was able to handle the kind of “errors” introduced by the abbreviation process.

To resolve the Chinese abbreviation problems and integrate its identification into the word segmentation process, (Chang and Lai, 2004) proposes to regard the abbreviation problem in the word segmentation process as an “error recovery” problem in which the suspect root words are the “errors” to be recovered from a set of candidates according to some generation probability criteria.

Some class-based segmentation models (Sun et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2003) well integrate the identification of some regular non-lexicalized units (such as named entities).

In the following section, the HMM models as outlined in (Chang and Lai, 2004) is reviewed first.

In this work, we therefore explore the possibility of using the theories in (Chang and Lai, 2004) as a framework for constructing a large abbreviation lexicon consisting of all Chinese characters and their potential roots.

In a preliminary study (Chang and Lai, 2004), some probabilistic models had been developed to handle this problem by applying the models to a parallel corpus of compound words and their abbreviations, without knowing the context of the abbreviation pairs.

The equal weighting strategy may not be absolutely true (Chang and Lai, 2004).

High Frequency Abbreviation Patterns [by P(bit|n)] (Chang and Lai, 2004) 18 The high frequency abbreviation patterns revealed in (Chang and Lai, 2004) further break the heuristics quantitatively.

The weighting factors are directly acquired from a previous work in (Chang and Lai, 2004).
