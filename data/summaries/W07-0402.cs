Synchronous TAG (Shieber, 1994; Shieber and Schabes, 1990) extends TAG by taking the elementary structures to be pairs of TAG trees with links between particular nodes in those trees.

Previous work by Han (2006a; 2006b) and Nesson and Shieber (2006) describe this approach in detail, showing its applicability to a range of semantic phenomena.

Independently, Han (2006a) developed a similar synchronous TAG analysis of piedpiping, providing evidence for the naturalness of the analysis.

We startwith the proposalof Shieberand Schabes (1990), which used multi-component TAG for the semantic portion of a synchronous TAG.
