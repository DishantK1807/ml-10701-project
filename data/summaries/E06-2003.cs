We share some principles with GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), HoG (Callmeier et al., 2004) and NOOJ1 (Muller et al., 2004), but one important difference is that the LinguaStream platform promotes the combination of purely declarative formalisms (when GATE is mostly based on the JAPE language and NOOJ focuses on a unique formalism), and allows processing streams to be designed graphically as complex graphs (when GATE relies on the pipeline paradigm).
