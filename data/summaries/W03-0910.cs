Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).

of Speech Tagging and Chunking Our implementation of SEXTANT uses a maximum entropy POS tagger designed to be very efficient, tagging at around 100 000 words per second (Curran and Clark, 2003), trained on the entire Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).

This approach significantly outperforms the multi-class perceptron on the same dataset based on WORDNET 1.6 and 1.7.1. 1 Introduction Lexical-semantic resources have been applied successful to a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems ranging from collocation extraction (Pearce, 2001) and class-based smoothing (Clark and Weir, 2002), to text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

"the international Olympic Conference held in Paris" Figure 1 Example of DE construction Since the governing category information is encoded in the path feature, it may be redundant; indeed this redundancy might explain why the governing category feature was used in Gildea & Jurafsky(2002) but not in Gildea and Palmer(2002).
