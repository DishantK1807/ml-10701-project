The actual translations were produced with a greedy decoder (Germann et al., 2001).

alignment quality In order to directly measure the influence of the added cognate information on the word alignment quality, we performed a single experiment using a set of 500 manually aligned sentences from Hansards (Och and Ney, 2000).
P00-1056
For the evaluation of translation quality, we used the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures the n-gram overlap between the translated output and one or more reference translations.

Cognates have been employed for a number of bitextrelated tasks, including sentence alignment (Simard et al., 1992), inducing translation lexicons (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001), and improving statistical machine translation models (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).
