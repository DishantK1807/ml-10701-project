The error rate, 10.0%, is lower than that reported by Gildea and Palmer (2002), 17.2%.

Improvements along this line may be attained by use of a full TAG parser, such as Chiang (2000) for example.

We first experiment with the set of features described in Gildea and Palmer (2002): Pred HW, Arg HW, Phrase Type, Position, Path, Voice.

In this paper, we find that the use of deep linguistic representations to predict these semantic labels are more effective than the generally more surface-syntax representations previously employed (Gildea and Palmer (2002)).

Note also that the transformations which are taken into account are a superset of the transformations taken into account by Gildea and Palmer (2002).

In doing so, we follow the work of others in extracting grammars of various kinds from the PTB, whether it be TAG (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Chiang, 2000), combinatory categorial grammar (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002), or constraint dependency grammar (Wang and Harper, 2002).

The PropBank superimposes an annotation of semantic predicate-argument structures on top of the Penn Treebank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994).

Salient heuristics include the use of a head percolation table (Magerman, 1995), and another table that distinguishes between complements and adjunct nodes in the tree.

Gildea and Palmer (2002) achieve a recall of 0.50, a precision of 0.58, and an F-measure of 0.54 when using the full parser of Collins (1999).

For example, in their inclusion of voice, Gildea and Palmer (2002) note that this deep syntax feature plays an important role in connecting semantic role with surface grammatical function.

These results are comparable to the results from Gildea and Palmer (2002), but only roughly because of differences in corpora.

Supertagging (Bangalore and Joshi (1999)) is the task of assigning a single supertag to each word given raw text as input.
