the ATR English-Chinese paraphrase corpus, which con9 sists of translations of travel phrases (Zhang & Yamamoto, 2002)), are limited to short handcrafted predicates (e.g.

Until reliable metrics can be established for end-to14 end paraphrase tasks—these will probably need to be application specific—the Alignment Error Rate strategy that was successfully applied in early development of machine translation systems (Och & Ney, 2000, 2003) offers a useful intermediate representation of the coverage and precision of a corpus and extraction techniques.

Data The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRP) is distilled from a database of 13,127,938 sentence pairs, extracted from 9,516,684 sentences in 32,408 news clusters collected from the World Wide Web over a 2year period, The methods and assumptions used in building this initial data set are discussed in Quirk et al.(2004) and Dolan et al.(2004). Two heuristics based on shared lexical properties and sentence position in the document were employed to construct the initial database: Word-based Levenshtein edit distance of 1 < e g1157 20; and a length ratio > 66%; OR Both sentences in the first three sentences of each file; and length ratio > 50%.

Burger & Ferro (2005) have suggested that this data may allow researchers greater freedom to construct models based on the judgments of specific judges or combinations of judges, permitting more fine-grained use of the corpus.

Likewise, the data made available by (Barzilay & Lee, 2003: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ Info/Projects/NLP/statpar.html), while invaluable in understanding and evaluating their results, is too limited in size and domain coverage to serve as either training or test data.

We show separately that the results of training a classifier on the present corpus may be inferior to other training sets, though better than crude string or text-based heuristics (Brockett & Dolan, 2005).

It has been observed that the mean lexical overlap in the corpus is a relatively high 0.7 (Weeds et al, 2005), suggesting that more lexically divergent examples will be needed.

It has already been applied in this way by Corley & Mihalcea (2005) and Wu (2005).

we calculate that fewer than 30% of the pairs in a set of matched first-two sentences extracted from clustered news data, after application of simple heuristics, are paraphrases (Dolan et al., 2004).

g2 2 Motivation The success of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) has sparked a successful line of investigation that treats paraphrase acquisition and generation essentially as a monolingual machine translation problem (e.g., Barzilay & Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Finch et al., 2004).

Multiple translations of novels, such as those used in (Barzilay & McKeown, 2001) provide a relatively limited dataset to work with, and – since these usually involve works that are out of copyright – usually exhibit older styles of language that have little in common with modern language resources or application requirements.

In these respects, as Wu (2005) points out, the corpus is far from distributionally neutral.
