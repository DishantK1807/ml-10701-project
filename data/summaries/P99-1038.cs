Park (1995) has proposed an alternative theory of scope availability which states that available scopes are accounted for by relative scopes of arguments around relations, whereby quantifiers may not move across NP boundaries.

The language CLLS (Egg et al., 1998) has recently been developed which correctly generates the well-formed readings by using dominance constraints over trees.

This problem is rectified by nested storage (Keller, 1986) and the Hobbs and Shieber (1987) algorithm.

A recent area of interest has been with underspecified representations of an ambiguous sentence's meaning, for example, Quasi-Logical Form (QLF) (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) and Underspecified Discourse Representation The293 ory (UDRT) (Reyle, 1995).
E95-1001 P92-1005
Park (1995) has argued that the availability of readings is determined not by the well-formedness of sentences in the meaning language, but by the function-argument relationships within the sentence.
