Also, as pointed out by Voorhees (2005), a score distribution heavily skewed towards zero makes meta-analysis of evaluation stability hard to perform.

The basic intuition behind the pyramid scheme (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) is simple: the importance of a fact is directly related to the number of people that recognize it as such (i.e., its popularity).
N04-1019
Nenkova and Passonneau (2004) call for multiple assessors to annotate SCUs, which is much more involved than the methodology presented here, where the nuggets are fixed and assessors only provide additional judgments about their importance.

Previously, we have argued that the vital/okay distinction is a source of instability in the nuggetbased evaluation methodology, especially given the manner in which F-score is calculated (Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005a).

This work has been supported in part by DARPA contract HR0011-06-2-0001 (GALE), and has greatly benefited from discussions with Ellen Voorhees, Hoa Dang, and participants at TREC 2005.

This human involvement has been identified as a bottleneck in the evaluation process, although we have recently developed an automatic scoring metric called POURPRE that correlates well with human judgments (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005a).
H05-1117 W05-0906
As an example of this intellectual discourse, the recently-developed POURPRE metric for automatically evaluating answers to complex questions (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005a) employs n-gram overlap to compare system responses to reference output, an idea originally implemented in the ROUGE metric for summarization evaluation (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

The nugget-based paradigm has been previously detailed in a number of papers (Voorhees, 2003; Hildebrandt et al., 2004; Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005a); here, we present only a short summary.

Drawing additional inspiration from research on summarization evaluation, we adapt the pyramid evaluation scheme (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) to address the shortcomings of 385 the vital/okay distinction in the nugget-based evaluation methodology.

Nugget Pyramids As previously pointed out (Lin and DemnerFushman, 2005b), the question answering and summarization communities are converging on the task of addressing complex informationneeds from complementary perspectives; see, for example, the recent DUC task of query-focused multi-document summarization (AmigÂ´o et al., 2004; Dang, 2005).
