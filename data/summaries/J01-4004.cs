Finally, the work of Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) also falls under the machine learning approach.

The RESOLVE system is described in three papers: McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al.(1995), and McCarthy (1996).
M95-1011
Fisher et al.(1995) adapted RESOLVE to work in MUC-6.
M95-1011
Other baseline systems that are used are ONE_CHAIN, ONE_WRD, and HD_WRD (Cardie and Wagstaff 1999).

Our part-of-speech tagger is a standard statistical tagger based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Church 1988).
A88-1019
The RESOLVE system is presented in McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al.(1995), and McCarthy (1996).

McEnery, Tanaka, and Botley (1997) have done a study on how distance affects coreference, particularly for pronouns.
W97-1310
Among the papers that have reported quantitative evaluation results, most are not based on learning from an annotated corpus (Baldwin 1997; Kameyama 1997; Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997).

The work of Aone and Bennett (1995), McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al.(1995), and McCarthy (1996) employed decision tree learning.
M95-1011 P95-1017
In contrast to RESOLVE, our system makes use of a smaller set of 12 features and, as in Aone and Bennett's (1995) system, the features used are generic and applicable across domains.
P95-1017
Also, none of the systems in MUC-7 adopted a learning approach to coreference resolution (Chinchor 1998).
M98-1001
Similarly, Kehler (1997) used maximum entropy modeling to assign a probability distribution to alternative sets of coreference relationships among noun phrase entity templates, whereas we used decision tree learning.
W97-0319
Although Aone and Bennett's (1995) system also made use of decision tree learning for coreference resolution, they dealt with Japanese texts, and their evaluation focused only on noun phrases denoting organizations, whereas our evaluation, which dealt with English texts, encompassed noun phrases of all types, not just those denoting organizations.
P95-1017
Ge, Hale, and Charniak (1998) used a statistical model for resolving pronouns, whereas we used a decision tree learning algorithm and resolved general noun phrases, not just pronouns.
W98-1119
To our knowledge, the research efforts of Aone and Bennett (1995), Ge, Hale, and Charniak (1998), Kehler (1997), McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Fisher et al.(1995), and McCarthy (1996) are the only ones that are based on learning from an annotated corpus.

In particular, information extraction (IE) systems like those built in the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences (Chinchor 1998; Sundheim 1995) have revealed that coreference resolution is such a critical component of IE systems that a separate coreference subtask has been defined and evaluated since MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995).
