Also, a number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (Covington 1990) (Kwon, Yoon 1991) (Sleator, Temperley 1993) (Hahn et al.1994) (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996), including a stochastic treatment (Eisner 1996) and an object-oriented parallel parsing method (Neuhaus, Hahn 1996).

Neuhaus and Broker (1997) have recently showed that the general recognition problem for non-projective dependency grammars (what they call discontinuous DG) is NP-complete.

1. Introduction Many authors have developed dependency theories that cover cross-linguistically the most significant phenomena of natural language syntax: the approaches range from generative formalisms (Sgall et al.1986), to lexically-based descriptions (Mel'cuk 1988), to hierarchical organizations of linguistic knowledge (Hudson 1990) (Fraser, Hudson 1992), to constrained categorial grammars (Milward 1994).
J92-2001
Parsers and applications usually refer to grammars built around a core of dependency concepts, but there is a great variety in the description of syntactic constraints, from rules that are very similar to CFG productions (Gaifman 1965) to individual binary relations on words or syntactic categories (Covington 1990) (Sleator, Temperley 1993).
J90-4003
The introduction of non lexical categories also permits the resolution of the inconsistencies pointed out by Neuhaus and Broker in Word Grammar (1997).
P97-1043
A compilation step in the parser can produce parse tables that account for left-corner information (this optimization of the Earley algorithm has already been proven fruitful in (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996)).
C96-2122
And, in fact, it is possible to devise O(n 3) parsers for this formalism (Lombardo, Lesmo 1996), or other projective variations (Milward 1994) (Eisner 1996).
