It can also happen that morphosyntacticanalysis tools integrate their own segmentation rules based on syntactic evidence (Feng et al., 2004). The tools presented in this paper are mostly concerned with the task of disambiguating between possible word sequences. Although some attempts are made to extend those results to unknown sequences </context>

Those words are often not present in dictionaries, and their relevance may be limited to a specific domain, which is why such research is mostly met in the field of terminology extraction (Kageura et al., 2004). By contrast, in isolating languages compound words belong to the core of the language; they are present in dictionaries and extremely frequent (in Vietnamese, 28,000 compound words in a 35,000-word</context>
