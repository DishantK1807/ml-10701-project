'The problems discussed in \[Church and Patil, 1982\] -including ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment, noun-noun modification, and coordination m would seem to form a natural class of problems to investigate in this manner.

An empirical study by \[Whittemore eta/., 1990\] supports the main premise of these proposals: they observe that in naturally-occurring data, lexical preferences (e.g., arrive at, flight to) provide more reliable attachment predictions than structural strategies.

Another related alternative would be to select a single best classification -for example, using the measure of selectional association proposed in \[Resnik, 1993\] -rather than considering all possible classifications.

Denoting the set of words subsumed by a class c (that is, the set of all words that are a member of c or any subordinate class) as words(c), the frequency of a class can be estimated as follows: f(c)---~ /(n) (I).ewo.t,(c) 2This experiment was attempted using expected likelihood estimates, as in \[Hindle and Rooth, 1991l, with data extracted from the Penn Treebank as dem:ribed below.

As \[Church and Patil, 1982\] point out, the number of analyses given combinations of such "all ways ambiguous" constructions grows rapidly even for sentences of quite Marti A.

Discussions of sentence processing have focused primarily on structurally-based preference strategies such as right association and minimal attachment \[Kimball, 1973; Frazier, 1979; Ford et al., 1982\]; \[Hobbs and Bear, 1990\], while acknowledging the importance of semantics and pragmatics in attachment decisions, propose two syntactically-based attachment rules that are meant to be generalizations of those structural strategies.
C90-3029
One alternative might be to perform sense disambiguation in advance -the results of \[Yarowsky, 1993\] demonstrate that a significant reduction in the number of possible noun classifications is possible using only very limited syntactic context, rather than global word co-occurrence statistics.

Such a fusion of structural and iexical preference strategies is suggested in \[Whittemore et al., 1990\], and \[Weischedel et aL, 1989\] 63 have found that a structural strategy ("closest attachment") performs well in combination with a class-based strategy, although they use a relatively small, domainspecific taxonomy of classes and assume each word has a pointer to a unique class.
