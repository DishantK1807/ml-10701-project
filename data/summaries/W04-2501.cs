While template-based representations have been proposed for information merging in the past (Radev and McKeown, 1998), they considered only domain-specific scenarios.

In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed: (1) a knowledge-based Q/A implementation based on syntactic/semantic processing is combined using a maximum-entropy framework with (2) a statistical noisy-channel algorithm for Q/A and (3) a pattern-based approach that learn from Web data.

Our method first converts the extracted answers into a series of open-domain templates, which are based on predicate-argument frames (Surdeanu et al, 2003).
P03-1002
If the templates that are candidates for merging are selected entirely based on heuristics (Radev and McKeown, 1998; Surdeanu and Harabagiu, 2002), the application of fusion operators for QA is unreliable, due to their relatively weak semantic understanding of the...

We propose to study and develop several kernel methods that can operate in Support Vector Machines for determining the optimal strategies and compare the results with the Maximum Entropy combinations reported in (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003).
P03-1003
Based on our recent successes with the extraction of predicateargument frames (Surdeanu et al, 2003), we propose a template representation that is a direct mapping of predicate-argument frames.

The pipeline architecture was reported in (Prager et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2001).
