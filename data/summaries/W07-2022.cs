These methods perform particularly well when a large volume of labeled data from the same domain as the test set is available for training (Aue and Gamon, 2005).

Each unigram in the resulting list had the degree of membership in the category of positive or negative sentiment assigned to it using the fuzzy Net Overlap Score method described in the team?s earlier work (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006).

Unsupervised knowledge-based methods are the preferred approach to classification of sentences into positive and negative, mostly due to the lack of adequate amounts of labeled training data (Gamon and Aue, 2005).

To address this complexity, many biomedical IE systems (Alphonse et al., 2004; Rinaldi et al., 2004; Fundel et al., 2007) and annotated corpora (Kim et al., 2003; Aubin, 2005; Pyysalo et al., 2007) incorporate full syntactic analysis.

This has been carried out considering the information in Brill (1992), Brill (1994) and Brill (1995), taken as a reference starting point.

These approaches rely on presence and scores of sentiment-bearing words that have been acquired from dictionaries (Kim and Hovy, 2005) or corpora (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003).

Most of the reported work on paraphrase generation from arbitrary input sentences uses machine learning techniques trained on sentences that are known or can be inferred to be paraphrases of each other (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Dolan et al., 2004; Ibrahim et al., 2003; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004; Shinyama et al., 2002).

Since sentiment-bearing words in English have different degree of centrality to the category of sentiment, we have constructed a measure of word centrality to the category of positive or negative sentiment described in our earlier work (Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006a).

Such relations are usually represented as a set of taxonomic categories; for example the meaning of STUDENT LOAN might be specified with a POSSESSOR relation (Kim & Baldwin, 2005) or MILK COW might be specified by a MAKES relation (Gagne & Shoben, 1997).

In order to take advantage of the special properties of WordNet glosses and relations, we developed a system that used the human-annotated adjectives from (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997) as a seed list and learned additional unigrams from WordNet synsets and glosses.

3 CLaC-NB System: Nave Bayes Supervised statistical methods have been very successful in sentiment tagging of texts and in subjectivity detection at sentence level: on movie review texts they reach an accuracy of 85-90% (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004) and up to 92% accuracy on classifying movie review snippets into subjective and objective using both Nave Bayes and SVM (Pang and Lee, 2004).

In order to eliminate errors produced by part-of-speech ambiguity of some of the seed words, the glosses are processed by Brill?s part-of-speech tagger (Brill, 1995) and only the seed words with matching part-of-speech tags are considered.

Unlike previous annotations of sentiment or subjectivity (Wiebe et al., 2005; Pang and Lee, 2004), which typically relied on binary 0/1 annotations, we decided to use a finer-grained scale, hence allowing the annotators to select different degrees of emotional load.
