:3 Our Approach 3.1 The C4.5 Learning Algorithm Decision tree induction algorithms have been successfully applied for NLP problems such as sentence boundary dismnbiguation (Pahner et al.1997), parsing (Magerman 1995) and word segmentation (Mekuavin et al.1997). We employ the c4.5 (Quinhln 1993) decision tree induction program as the learning algorithm for word extraction.
