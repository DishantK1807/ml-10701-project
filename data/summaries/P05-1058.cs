This simplified version does not take word classes into account as described in (Brown et al., 1993).

In order to deal with this problem, we perform word alignment in two directions (source to target, and target to source) as described in (Och and Ney, 2000).

In recent years, many researchers have employed statistical models (Wu, 1997; Och and Ney, 2003; Cherry and Lin, 2003) or association measures (Smadja et al., 1996; Ahrenberg et al., 1998; Tufis and Barbu, 2002) to build alignment links.

In order to filter the noise caused by the error alignment links, we only retain those translation pairs whose log-likelihood ratio scores (Dunning, 1993) are above a threshold.
J93-1003
When the large-scale bilingual corpus is not available, some researchers use existing dictionaries to improve word alignment (Ker and Chang, 1997).

The selection order is similar to that in the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997).
P97-1063
Word alignment was first proposed as an intermediate result of statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993).

In addition to the above evaluations, we also evaluate our model adaptation method using the "refined" combination in Och and Ney (2000) instead of the translation dictionary.

Word Alignment According to the IBM models (Brown et al., 1993), the statistical word alignment model can be generally represented as in Equation (1).

The alignment links in this intersection set are extended by iteratively adding word alignment links into it as described in (Och and Ney, 2000).
