A high quality sound-to-letter framework (Chung et al., 2003) and a new ability to automatically derive a class n-gram from an NL grammar have facilitated this process (Seneff et al., 2003).

We have thus far applied this only to the enrollment of the user’s name as part of a personalization phase (Seneff et al., 1998; Chung et al., 2003), through a “speak and spell” mode.

Parse rules for general sub-domains such as dates, times, and prices are organized into sub-grammars that are easily embedded into any application, along with libraries for converting the resulting meaning representations into a canonical format, such as “27SEP2003.” Flexible Vocabulary: We have recently realized our goal of enabling users to automatically add a new word to an existing system through natural interaction with the system itself (Schalkwyk et al., 2003; Seneff et al., 1998; Chung et al., 2003; Chung and Seneff, 2002; Seneff et al., 2003).

Secondly, we need to be able to support incremental update of vocabularies and language models for speech recognition and understanding, in essentially instantaneous time (Schalkwyk et al., 2003; Seneff et al., 1998; Chung et al., 2003).

We make no distinction between the technology components of SpeechBuilder and those of our most sophisticated dialogue systems, such as the Mercury flight reservation domain (Seneff and Polifroni, 2000).
