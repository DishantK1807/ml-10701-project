MAGEAD provides an analysis to a root+pattern representation, it has separate phonological and orthographic representations, and it allows for combining morphemes from different dialects.
1 Introduction
In this paper we present initial work on MAGEAD, a morphological analyzer and generator for the Arabic language family, by which we mean both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the spoken dialects.1 There has been much work on Arabic morphology (for an overview, see (Al-Sughaiyer and AlKharashi, 2004)).
Our work is novel in that it explicitly addresses the need for processing the morphology of the dialects.
There are several important consequences: a2 First, we want to be able to exploit the existing regularities among the dialects and between the dialects and MSA, in particular systematic sound changes which operate at the level of the 1We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful comments, and Amittai Aviram for his feedback and help with the implementation.
The work reported in this paper was supported by NSF Award 0329163.
root consonants, and pattern changes.
This requires an explicit analysis into root and pattern.
a2 Second, the dialects are mainly used in spoken communication and in the rare cases when they are written they do not have standard orthographies, and different (inconsistent) orthographies may be used even within a single written text.
We thus need a representation of morphology that incorporates models of both phonology and orthography.
a2 Third, in certain contexts, speakers often create words with morphemes from more than one dialect, or from a dialect and MSA.
For example, the verb stem may be from MSA while the dialectal present progressive prefix is used.
This means that our analyzer needs to be able to have access to morphological data from more than one member of the language family.
In addition, we add two general requirements for morphological analyzers.
First, we want both a morphological analyzer and a morphological generator.
Second, we want to use a representation that is defined in terms of a lexeme and attribute-value pairs for morphological features such as aspect or person.
This is because we want our component to be usable in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as natural language generation and machine translation, and the lexeme provides a usable lexicographic abstraction.
We tackle these requirements by implementing the multitape approach of Kiraz (2000), which we 17 extend by adding an additional tape for independently modeling phonology and orthography.
This is the first large-scale implementation of (Kiraz, 2000).
We use the AT&T finite-state toolkit (Mohri et al., 1998) for the implementation.
The use of finite state technology makes MAGEAD usable as a generator as well as an analyzer, unlike some morphological analyzers which cannot be converted to generators in a straightforward manner (Buckwalter, 2004; Habash, 2004).
This paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we discuss the linguistic situation of the Arabicspeaking world.
In Section 3, we present the relevant facts about morphology in the Arabic language family.
We then present our approach to morphological analysis in Section 4, and its implementation in Section 5.
We conclude by sketching the planned evaluation.
2 The
Arabic Dialects The Arabic-speaking world is characterized by diglossia (Ferguson, 1959).
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the shared written language from Morocco to the Gulf, but it is not a native language of anyone.
It is spoken only in formal, scripted contexts (news, speeches).
In addition, there is a continuum of spoken dialects (varying geographically, but also by social class, gender, etc).
which are native languages, but rarely written (except in very informal contexts: blogs, email, etc).
Dialects differ phonologically, lexically, morphologically, and syntactically from one another; many pairs of dialects are mutually unintelligible.
In unscripted situations where spoken MSA would normally be required (such as talk shows on TV), speakers usually resort to repeated code-switching between their dialect and MSA, as nearly all native speakers of Arabic are unable to produce sustained spontaneous discourse in MSA.
3 Arabic
Dialect Morphology 3.1 Types of Arabic Morphemes Arabic morphemes fall into three categories: templatic morphemes, affixational morphemes, and non-templatic word stems (NTWSs).
Affixational morphemes are concatenated to form words, while templatic morphemes are interleaved.
Templatic morphemes come in three types that are equally needed to create a word stem: roots, patterns and vocalisms.
Affixes can be classified into prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes, which precede, follow or surround the word stem, respectively.
Finally NTWSs are word stems that are not constructed from a root/pattern/vocalism combination.
The following three subsections discuss each of the morpheme categories.
This is followed by a brief discussion of some morphological adjustment phenomena.
3.1.1 Roots, Patterns and Vocalism The root morpheme is a sequence of three, four, or five consonants (termed radicals) that signifies some abstract meaning shared by all its derivations.
For example, the words2 a0a2a1a4a3 katab ‘to write’, a0a6a5a8a7a3 kaAtib ‘writer’, and a9a11a10 a1a13a12a15a14 maktuwb ‘written’ all share the root morpheme ktb (a9a17a16a6a18 ) ‘writingrelated’.
The pattern morpheme is an abstract template in which roots and vocalisms are inserted.
We will represent the pattern as a string of letters including special symbols to mark where root radicals and vocalisms are inserted.
We use numbers (i.e.
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) to indicate radical position3 and the symbol V is used to indicate the position of the vocalism.
For example, the pattern 1V22V3 indicates that the second root radical is to be doubled.
A pattern can include letters for additional consonants and vowels, e.g., the verbal pattern V1tV2V3.
The vocalism morpheme specifies which short vowels to use with a pattern.4 A word stem is constructed by interleaving the three types of templatic morphemes.
For example, the word stem a0a6a1a4a3 katab ‘to write’ is constructed from the root ktb (a9a17a16a6a18 ), the pattern 1V2V3 and the vocalism aa.
2In this paper, we use the following conventions for representing examples.
All orthographic word forms are provided in undiacritized Arabic script followed by a diacritized version in the Buckwalter transliteration scheme, which is a 1to-1 transliteration of MSA orthographic symbols using ASCII characters (Buckwalter, 2004).
All morphemes are shown diacritized in the Buckwalter transliteration of a plausible standard orthographic representation, though we sometimes include an undiacritized version in Arabic script in parentheses for clarity.
All phonemic sequences are written between the usual slashes, but we use the Buckwalter scheme (with obvious adjustments) rather than IPA to represent phonemes.
3Often in the literature, radical position is indicated with C.
4Traditional accounts of Arabic morphology collapse vocalism and pattern.
18 3.1.2 Affixational Morphemes Arabic affixes can be prefixes such as sa+ (+a0 ) ‘will/[future]’, suffixes such as +uwna (a1a3a2 +) ‘[masculine plural]’ or circumfixes such as ta++na (a1 ++a5 ) ‘[subject 2nd person feminine plural]’.
Multiple affixes can appear in a word.
For example, the word a7a4a6a5 a10a8a7 a1a12a10a9 a0 a2 wasayaktubuwnahA ‘and they will write it’ has two prefixes, one circumfix and one suffixes:5 (1) wasayaktubuwnahA wa+ and sa+ will y+ 3person aktub write +uwna masculine-plural +hA it Some of the affixes can be thought of as orthographic clitics, such as w+ (+a2 ) ‘and’ prepositions (l+ (+a11 ) ‘to/for’, b+ (+a12 ) ‘in/with’ and k+ (+a3 ) ‘as’) or the pronominal object clitics (e.g., +hA (a7a13 +) in the example above).
Others are bound morphemes.
3.1.3 Non-Templatic Word Stem NTWS are word stems that are not derivable from templatic morphemes.
They tend to be foreign names and borrowed terms.
For example, a14a16a15a18a17a20a19a22a21a2 waA$inTun ‘Washington’.
Word stems can still take affixational morphemes, e.g., a1 a10 a9 a17a20a15a18a17a20a19a22a21a10 a11 a21a2 waAlwaA$inTuniy˜uwn ‘and the Washingtonians’.
3.1.4 Morphological
Rewrite Rules An Arabic word is constructed by first creating a word stem from templatic morphemes or by using a NTWS.
Affixational morphemes are then added to this stem.
The process of combining morphemes involves a number of phonological, morphemic and orthographic rules that modify the form of the created word so it is not a simple interleaving or concatenation of its morphemic components.
An example of a phonological rewrite rule is the voicing of the /t/ of the verbal pattern V1tV2V3 (Form VIII) when the first root radical is /z/, /d/, or /*/ (a23, a24, or a25 ): the verbal stem zhr+V1tV2V3+iaa is realized phonologically as /izdahar/ (orthographically: a26 a13 a24a27a23a28a21 ) ‘flourish’ not /iztahar/ (orthographically: a26 a4 a5 a23a29a21 ).
An example of a morphemic rewrite rule is the feminine morpheme, +p (a30 +).
Phonologically, it is realized as /t/ word-internally, but it 5We analyze the imperfective word stem as including an initial short vowel, and leave a discussion of this analysis to future publications.
is silent at the end of a word.
Orthographically, it is realized as a16 t in word-internal position (i.e., when followed by a letter), but as a30 + +p word-finally.
For example, a31 amiyrap+nA (a7a5 +a30a20a26 a9a4a14a33a32 ) is realized as a7 a17 a5 a26 a9a4a14a33a32 a31 amiyratnA ‘our princess’ (phonologically: /’amiyratnA/)6.
Finally, an example of an orthographic rewrite rule is the deletion of the Alif (a21 ) of the definite article morpheme Al+ (+a34a3a21 ) in nouns when preceded by the preposition l+ (+a11 ) (in both of the following examples, the Alif is silent): (2) a.
a35 a9 a7a20a36 a11 lilbayti /lilbayti/ ‘to the house’ li+ to+ Al+ the+ bayt house +i +[genitive] b.
a35 a9 a7 a11 a7a12 biAlbayti /bilbayti/ ‘in the house’ bi+ in+ Al+ the+ bayt house +i +[genitive] 3.2 Morpheme Type and Function and the Lexeme The type of morpheme is independent of the morphological function it is used for (derivational or inflectional).
Although affixational morphemes tend to be inflectional and templatic morphemes derivational, there are many exceptions.
For example, the plural of a9 a7a1a4a3 kitAb ‘book’ is not formed through affixation of the inflectional plural morphemes +At (a16a37a21 +) or +uwn (a1a38a2 +), but rather through the use of a different pattern, resulting in a0a6a1a4a3 kutub ‘books’.
This form of plural construction is called “broken plural” in Arabic to distinguish it from the strictly affixational “sound plural”.
Conversely, the adjective a39a40a7 a1a4a3 kutubiy˜ ‘book-related’ is derived from the noun a0a6a1a4a3 kutub ‘books’ using affixational morphemes.
Note that approaches for Arabic stemming that are limited to handling affixational morphology will both miss related terms that are inflected templatically and conflate derived forms generated affixationally.
A common misconception about Arabic morphology concerns the regularity of derivational morphology.
However, the meaning of a word cannot be predicted from the root and the pattern+vocalism pair.
For example, the masculine noun a0a6a1a12a15a14 maktab ‘office/bureau/agency’ and the feminine noun 6The case markers are ignored in this example for the sake of simplicity.
19 a0 a7 a1a13a12a15a14 maktabap ‘library/bookstore’ are derived from the root a9a17a16a6a18 ktb ‘writing-related’ with the pattern+vocalism ma12a3, which indicates location.
The exact type of the location is thus idiosyncratic, and it is not clear how the gender can account for the semantic difference.
It is this unpredictability of derivational meaning that makes us prefer lexemes as deepest units of morphological analysis, rather than root+pattern pairs.
We use the root+pattern analysis only to relate different dialects, and since it has proven useful for certain natural language processing tasks, such as IR (Abu-Salem et al., 1999).
We use the lexemic representation to represent the lexicon for applications such as machine translation, including translation between dialects.
We return to the definition of “lexeme” in Section 4.2. 3.3 Dialect Morphology Arabic dialect morphology shares with MSA morphology the root-and-pattern system.
Additionally, each dialect morphology shares with MSA morphology some of the morphology lexicon (inventory of morphemes), and the morphological rules.
Consider the following forms by way of example: (3) Egyptian: a1 a12 a36 a4 a36a3a2a20a17 a7 a14 mabina4 ulhalak$ = ma+ b+ n+ [’wl + V12V3 + iu] +ha +lak +$ MSA: a5 a11 a7a4 a11 a10a7a6 a5a9a8 lA naquwluha laka = lA / n+ [qwl + V12V3 + au] +u +ha / la +ka Here, the Egyptian stem is formed from the same pattern as the MSA stem, but the initial radical, q in MSA, has become ’ in Egyptian through regular sound change.
The vocalism in Egyptian also differs from that in MSA.
Then, we add the first person plural subject agreement marker, the prefix n+ (which in MSA is the circumfix n++u) and the third person feminine singular object clitic +ha (same in MSA).
In Egyptian, we add a second person masculine singular indirect object clitic +lak, the present progressive prefix b+, and the negation circumfix ma++$.
None of these exist in MSA: their meaning is represented with separate words, or as a zero morpheme in the case of the present tense marker.
Note that Egyptian orthography is not standardized, so that the form above could be plausibly written in any of the following orthographies, among others: a1 a12 a36 a4 a11a11a10 a17a20a12 a7a14 mAbin&ulhalak$, a1 a12 a36 a4 a36a3a2a20a17 a12 a7a14 mA bina4 ulhAlak$, a1 a12 a36 a4 a36a12a6a20a17a20a7 a14 mabinqulhalak$, a1 a12 a11 a7a4 a36a3a6a20a17a20a12 a7a14 mA binqulhA lak$, a1 a12 a11 a7a4 a11 a10a13a6a20a17 a12 a7a14 mA binquwlhA lak$.
Within a word form, all morphemes need not be from the same dialect.
Consider the following example.7 The speaker, who is a journalist conducting an interview, switches from MSA to Egyptian (between square brackets) for a complementizer (a39 a36 a11 a21 Ailliy) that introduces a relative clause.
He then continues in Egyptian with the prefix b+ (+a12 ) ‘[present progressive]’, and then, inside the word, returns to MSA, using an MSA verb in which the passive voice is formed with MSA morphology, -tuwaj˜ah (a14a16a15a2a10 a5 ) ‘be directed’.
(4) a7a4 a11 a14a17a15a6a10 a5 [ +a12 a39 a36 a11 a21 ] a18 a11 a2a20a19 a21 a39 a13a22a21 a9a11a23 a21a26a28a0a25a24 a35 a5a8a7a3a26a21 a13 a0 a9 a12 a26a28a27 a16a37a21a10a7a29a31a30a33a32a34a14a17a15a6a10 a5 a35 a5a8a7a3 a2 a32 a0a17a35 a26a28a36a38a37 a11 a21 a16a37a21a10a7a6 a11 a21 a39a16a40 a26a28a41 a32 hal kaAnat a42 israa4 iyl AilmafruwD hiya Aala31 uwlaY [Ailliy bi+] tuwaj˜ah laha Ailquw˜aAt AilmaSriy˜ap a31 aw kaAnat tuwaj˜ah Did quw˜aAt Earabiy˜ap a31 uxraY?
Should it have been Israel first [that] Egyptian armies were directed towards, or were they to be directed against other Arab armies? 4 Morphological Analysis of Arabic 4.1 Previous Work Despite the complexity of Semitic root-and-pattern morphology, computational morphologists have taken up the challenge of devising tractable systems for computing it both under finite-state methods and non-finite-state methods.
Kataja and Koskenniemi (1988) presented a system for handling Akkadian root-and-pattern morphology by adding a additional lexicon component to Koskenniemi’s two-level morphology (1983).
The first large scale implementation of Arabic morphology within the constraints of finite-state methods was that of Beesley et al.(1989) with a ‘detouring’ mechanism for access to multiple lexica, which later gave rise to other works by Beesley (Beesley, 1998) and, independently, by Buckwalter (2004).
The now ubiquitous linguistic approach of McCarthy (1981) to describe root-and-pattern morphol7This example is a transcript of a broadcast originally taken from the Al-Jazeera web site.
It can now be found at http://web.archive.org/web/20030210100557/www.aljazeera.net/ programs/century witness/articles/2003/1/1-24-1.htm. 20 ogy under the framework of autosegmental phonology gave rise to a number of computational proposals.
Kay (1987) devised a framework with which each of the autosegmental tiers is assigned a tape in a multi-tape finite state machine, with an additional tape for the surface form.
Kiraz (2000,2001) extended Kay’s approach and implemented a working multi-tape system with pilot grammars for Arabic and Syriac.
Other autosegmental approaches (described in more details in Kiraz 2001 (Chapter 4)) include those of Kornai (1995), Bird and Ellison (1994), Pulman and Hepple (1993), whose formalism Kiraz adopted, and others.
In this work we follow the multi-tape approach, and specifically that of (Kiraz, 2000).
This is the first large-scale implementation of that approach.
4.2 Our
Approach: Outline In our approach, there are three levels of representation: Lexeme Level.
Words are represented in terms of a lexeme and features.
Example: (5) Aizdaharat: Aizdahar a0 POS:V PER:3 GEN:F NUM:SG ASPECT:PERF The list of features is dialect-independent.
The lexeme itself can be thought of as a triple consisting of a root (or an NTWS), a meaning index, and a morphological behavior class (MBC).
The MBC maps the features to morphemes.
For example, [+FEM] for a0a6a5a8a7a3 kaAtib ‘writerMASC ’ yields a0 a7 a5a8a7a3 kaAtibap ‘writerFEM ’ which is different from [+FEM] for a1 a9 a12a6a21 AabyaD ‘whiteMASC ’ which yields a2 a7 a3 a9 a12 bayDaA’ ‘whiteFEM ’.
The MBCs are of course specific to the dialect in question or MSA (though conceivably some can be shared between dialects).
For convenience (as in the example above), lexemes are often represented using a citation form.
Morpheme Level.
Words are represented in terms of morphemes.
(5) is now represented as follows: (6) Aizdaharat: [zhr + V1tV2V3 + iaa] + at Surface Level.
Words are a string of characters.
Using standard MSA orthography, our example becomes: (7) a16 a26 a13 a24a27a23a28a21 Aizdaharat Phonologically, we get: (8) /izdaharat/ This paper focuses on the morpheme layer (morphology) and the transition between the morpheme and the surface levels.
This transition draws on the following resources: a2 a unified context-free grammar for morphemes (for all dialects together) which specifies the ordering of affixival morphemes.
a2 Morphophonemic and phonological rules that map from the morphemic representation to the phonological representation.
a2 Orthographic rules that map from phonology and morphology to an orthographic representation.
We will next discuss the formal representational and computational framework for these resources.
4.3 Multitape
Automata We follow (Kiraz, 2000) in using a multitape analysis.
We extend that analysis by introducing a fifth tier.
The five tiers are used as follows: a2 Tier 1: pattern and affixival morphemes.
a2 Tier 2: root.
a2 Tier 3: vocalism.
a2 Tier 4: phonological representation.
a2 Tier 5: orthographic representation.
Tiers 1 through 3 are always input tiers.
Tier 4 is first an output tier, and subsequently an input tier.
Tier 5 is always an output tier.
All tiers are read or written at the same time, so that the rules of the multi-tier automaton are rules which scan the input tiers and, depending on the state, write to the output tier.
The introduction of two surface-like tiers is due to the fact that many dialects do not have a standard orthography, as discussed above in Section 3.3. 5 Implementing Multitape Automata We have implemented multi-tape finite state automata as a layer on top of the AT&T two-tape finite state transducers.
Conversion from this higher layer (the new Morphtools format) to the Lextools format (an NLP-oriented extension of the AT&T toolkit 21 for finite-state machines, (Sproat, 1995)) is done for different types of Lextools files such as rule files or context-free grammar files.
A central concept here is that of the multitape string (MTS), a special representation of multiple tiers in Morphtools that gets converted to a sequence of multi-tier tokens (MTT) compatible with Lextools.
In the next section, we discuss the conversion of MTS into MTT.
Then, we discuss an example rule conversion.
5.1 The
Multitape String A multitape string (MTS) is represented as <T,R,V,P,O>.
where: a2 T is the template or basic pattern.
The template is represented as a string indicating the position of root consonant (1,2,3,4,5 or C), vowel (V), and any consonant or vowel deemed to be part of the template but not a separate morpheme.
For example, Arabic verb form II pattern is represented as 1V22V3 and form VIII is represented as V1tV2V3.
a2 R is the root radicals (consonants).
a2 V is the vocalism vowels.
a2 P is the phonological level.
a2 O is the orthographic level.
There are two special symbols: (1) % is a wild card symbol that can match anything (appropriate for that tier) and (2) @<Letter> (e.g., @X) is a variable whose type can be defined explicitly.
Both symbols can appear in any tier (except that in our current implementation, % cannot appear in tier T).
The first (or template) tier (T) is always required.
The additional tiers can be left underspecified.
For example, the full MTS specification for the root zhr with form VIII with active vocalism is: (9) a0 V1tV2V3,zhr,iaaa1 When converting an MTS to Lextools format, the T tier is used to create a basic default sequence of multi tier tokens (MTTs).
For our example (9), V1tV2V3 leads to this initial MTT sequence: (10) [V0%00] [1%000] [t0000] [V0%00] [2%000] [V0%00] [3%000] When the symbol V appears in the template, a 0 is inserted in the radical position (since no radical can be inserted here) and a wild card is inserted in the vocalism position.
The opposite is true for when radical symbol (C,1,2,3,4,5) appears in the template, a 0 is inserted in the vocalism tier (as no vowel from the vocalism can be inserted here) and a wild card in the radical tier.
all other characters appearing in the template tier (e.g., t in the example above), are paired with 0s in all other tiers.
Additional information from other tiers are then written on top of the default MTT sequence created from the template tier.
The representation in (10) is transformed into (12), using the information from the root and vocalism tiers in (9): (11) [V0i00] [1z000] [t0000] [V0a00] [2h000] [V0a00] [3r000] This sequence corresponds to the form /iztahar/.
After applying phonological rules, which will be discussed in the next section, the MTT sequence is as follows.
Note that the fourth tier has been filled in.
(12) [V0ii0] [1z0z0] [t00d0] [V0aa0] [2h0h0] [V0aa0] [3r0r0] In this fourth tier, this represents the phonological form /izdahar/.
Applying orthographic rules for diacritized orthography, we write symbols into the fifth tier, which corresponds to the orthographic form a26 a13 a24a27a23a28a21 Aizdahar.
(13) [0000A] [V0iii] [1z0zz] [t00dd] [V0aaa] [2h0hh] [V0aaa] [3r0rr] Note that the fourth tier provides the (phonemic) pronunciation for the orthography in the fifth tier.
5.2 Representing
the Structure of the Word The basic structure of the word is represented using a context-free grammar (CFG).
The CFG covers all dialects and MSA, and only when they differ in terms of the morpheme sequencing does the CFG express dialect-specific rules.
How exactly to write this CFG is an empirical question: for example, if frequently speakers mix MSA verb stems with ECA subject agreement suffixes, then the following grammar fragment would not be sufficient.
We intend to develop probabilistic models of intra-word code switching in order to guide the morphological analysis in the presence of code switching.
The following rule is the top-level rule which 22 states that a word is a verb, a noun, or a particle, and it can be preceded by an optional conjunction (for example, w+).
It holds in all dialects and MSA.
(14) [WORD] -> [CONJ]?
([VERB]|[NOUN]|[PART]) The following rule expands verbs to three inflectional types and adds an optional object clitic.
For Egyptian (ECA) only, an indirect object clitic can also be added.
(15) [VERB] -> ([PV VERB]|[IV VERB]) [OBJ PRON]?
[ECA:IOBJ PRON]?
The next level of expansion then introduces specific morphemes for the two classes of perfective verbs and imperfective verbs.
Here, we split into separate forms for each dialect and MSA; we give examples for MSA and Egyptian.
(16) a.
[PV VERB] -> [MSA:PV VERB STEM] [MSA:SUF:PVSUBJ 1S] b.
[PV VERB] -> [ECA:PV VERB STEM] [ECA:SUF:PVSUBJ 1S] This list is continued (for all dialects and MSA) for all combinations of person, number, and gender.
In the case of the imperfective, we get additional prefixes, and circumfixes for the subject clitics.
Note that here we allow a combination of the MSA imperfective verb stem with the Egyptian prefixes, but we do not allow the MSA prefixes with the Egyptian verb stem.
(17) a.
[IV VERB] -> ([MSA:FUT]| [MSA:RESULT]| [MSA:SUBJUNC]| [MSA:EMPHATIC]| [ECA:PRESENT] | [ECA:FUT])?
[MSA:IV VERB CONJUG] b.
[IV VERB] -> ([ECA:FUT]| [ECA:PRESENT])?
[ECA:IV VERB CONJUG] We then give the verbal stem morphology for MSA (the Egyptian case is similar).
(18) [MSA:IV VERB CONJUG] -> [MSA:PRE:IVSUBJ 1S] [MSA:IV VERB STEM] [MSA:SUF:IVSUBJ 1S] Again, this list is continued for all valid combinations of person, number, and gender.
The verbal stems are expanded to possible forms (combination of pattern and vocalism, not specified for root), or NTWSs.
Since the forms are specific to perfective or imperfective aspect, they are listed separately.
(19) [MSA:PV VERB STEM] -> ([MSA:FORM I PV]| [MSA:FORM II PV]| [MSA:FORM III PV]| [MSA:FORM IV PV]| ...) Each form is expanded separately: (20) a.
[MSA:FORM I PV] -> (<1V2V3,%,aa>| <1V2V3,%,ai>| <1V2V3,%,au>) b.
[MSA:FORM II PV] -> <1V22V3,%,aa> Separate rules introduce the morphemes which are represented by nonterminals such as [MSA:PRE:IVSUBJ1S] or [ECA:PRESENT].
Such a context-free specification using MTS is then compiled into MTT sequences in the same manner as described above.
The resulting specification is a valid input to Lextools, which generates the finite state machines.
5.3 Representing
Rules We now discuss the representation of rules.
We start out with three default rules which are the same for all Arabic dialects and MSA (and possibly for all languages that use templatic morphology).
Rule (21a) writes a letter which is in the pattern tier but which is not specified as either root or vocalism to the fourth (phonological) tier, while Rule (21b) and (21c) write a radical and a pattern vowel, respectively.
(21) a.
<@X,,,0> -> @X, @X=[LETTER] b.
<C,@X,,0> -> @X c.
<V,,@X,0> -> @X Phonological and morphemic rules have the same format, as they write to the fourth tier, usually overwriting a symbol placed there by the default rules.
Rule (22) implements the rule mentioned in Section 3.1.4 (in Form VIII, the /t/ of the pattern changes to a /d/ if the first radical is /z/, /d/, or /*/).
Rule (22) accounts for the surface phonological form in (8); without Rule (22), we would have iztahar instead of izdahar.
(22) <t,,,t> -> d / <1,@M,,>, @M=[zda0 ] For the orthography we use the fifth tier.
As in the case of phonology, we have default rules, which yield a simple phonemic orthography.
(23) a.
<@Y,,,@X,0> -> @X, @Y=[LETTER], @X=[LETTER] b.
<V,,@V,@X,0> -> @X, @X=[LETTER] c.
<C,@C,,@X,0> -> @X, @X=[LETTER] d.
<+,,,+,+> -> 0 23 These default rules cover much of MSA orthography, but in addition, there are some special orthographic rules, for example: (24) <0V,,@X,@X,0> -> A@X, #, @X=[LETTER] This rule inserts an Alif at the beginning of a word which starts with a pattern vowel.
6 Outlook
This paper describes work in progress.
We are currently in the process of populating MAGEAD with morphological data and rules for MSA and Egyptian, with smaller efforts for Yemeni and Levantine.
We intend to evaluate MAGEAD using a double strategy: a test suite of selected surface word/analysis pairs which tests the breadth of phenomena covered, and a test corpus, which tests the adequacy on real text.
The test suite can be assembled by hand over time from individual examples and is used for regression testing during development, as well as for qualitative assessment of the analyzer or generator.
The only test corpus we currently have is the Penn Arabic Treebank for MSA.
In the next phase of the development work, we will link the list of morphemes obtained during analysis to the lexeme level of representation.
This will be done using a dialect-specific lexicon, but we will also develop tools to exploit the lexical similarity between the dialects and MSA (and among the dialects) by hypothesizing lexemes based on regular sound change rules.
