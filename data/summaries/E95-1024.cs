However, both approaches can just as well take a declarative grammar specification as input to produce generator and/or parser-oriented grammars as in Dymetman et al.(1990). In this paper we adopt the latter theoretically more interesting perspective.

Shieber (1988) gave the first use of Earley's algorithm for generation, but this algorithm does not *The presented research was sponsored by 'l~eilpro jekt B4 "Constraints on Grammar for Efficient Generation" of the Sonderforschungsbereich 340 "Sprachtheoretische Grundlagen fiir die Computerllnguistik" of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

This testgrammar is based on the implementation of an analysis of partial vP topicalization in German (Hinrichs et al., 1994) in the Troll system (Gerdemann and King, 1994).

Earley Generation As Shieber (1988) noted, the main shortcoming of Earley generation is a lack of goal-directedness that results in a proliferation of edges.
C88-2128
This is mainly due to the clear theoretical and practical advantages of bidirectional grammar use (see, among others, Appelt, 1987).

Heads Empty or displaced heads present the principal goaldirectedness problem for any head-driven generation approach (Shieber et al., 1990; K6nig, 1994; Gerdemann and IIinrichs, in press), where empty head refers not just to a construction in which the head has an empty phonology, but to any construction in which the head is partially unspecified.

Shieber et al.(1990) show that a top-down evaluation strategy will fail for rules such as vP --* vp x, irrespective of the order of evaluation of the right-hand side categories in the rule.
J90-1004
The resulting evaluation strategy is similar to that of the head-corner approach (Shieber et al., 1990; Gerdemann and IIinrichs, in press): prediction follows the main flow of semantic information until a lexical pivot is reached, and only then are the headdependent subparts of the construction built up in a bottom-up fashion.
