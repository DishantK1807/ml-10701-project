Lexical methods split each pre-terminal symbol into many subsymbols, one for each word, and then focus on smoothing sparse lexical statis688 tics (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).

We compare an ordinary PCFG estimated with maximum likelihood (Matsuzaki et al., 2005) and the HDP-PCFG estimated using the variational inference algorithm described in Section 2.6.

Examples of such penalized likelihood procedures include Stolcke and Omohundro (1994), which used an asymptotic Bayesian model selection criterion and Petrov et al.(2006), which used a split-merge algorithm which procedurally determines when to switch between grammars of various complexities.

Unlexicalized methods refine the grammar in a more conservative fashion, splitting each non-terminal or pre-terminal symbol into a much smaller number of subsymbols (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).

DP mixture models have since been extended to hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) and HDP-HMMs (Teh et al., 2006; Beal et al., 2002) and applied to many different types of clustering/induction problems in NLP (Johnson et al., 2006; Goldwater et al., 2006).

Finkel et al.(2007) independently developed another nonparametric model of grammars.
