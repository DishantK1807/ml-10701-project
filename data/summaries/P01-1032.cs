More recently, context-based models of disambiguation have been shown to represent significant improvements over the baseline (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000), (Ratnaparkhi, 2000).

Following the model of (Dorr and Olsen, 1997), each Levin+ class is associated with a thematic grid (henceforth abbreviated a6 -grid), which summarizes a verbâ€™s syntactic behavior by specifying its predicate argument structure.

The following probabilities were generated from the training data: a8a10a9a12a11a2a13a15a14a12a16a17a11a19a18a21a20a23a22a24a20a25a13a27a26a15a13a29a28a31a30a33a32 a34 a35a36a38a37a40a39a33a41a43a42a23a44a46a45a47a42a47a48a50a49a51a35 a35a36a52a37a53a39a54a49a51a35, where a55 a32 is a relation (of relationship type a56, e.g., synonymy) between two synsets, a57a19a58 and a57a54a59, where a57 a58 is mapped to by a verb in Grid class Ga58 and a57a54a59 is mapped to by a verb in Grid class Ga59. 4The full set of Spanish translations is selected from WordNet associations developed in the EuroWordNet effort (Dorr et al., 1997).

On the one hand, even the higher of the kappa coefficients mentioned above is significantly lower than the standard suggested for good reliability (a124a126a125a128a127a130a129 ) or even the level where tentative conclusions may be drawn (a127a130a131a133a132a135a134a72a124 a134 a127a130a129 ) (Carletta, 1996), (Krippendorff, 1980).
