As such, discourse markers play an important role in the parsing of natural language discourse (Forbes et al., 2001; Marcu, 2000), and their correspondence with discourse relations can be exploited for the unsupervised learning of discourse relations (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).

This work can be seen as orthogonal to that of Di Eugenio et al.(1997), which addresses the problem of learning if and where discourse markers should be generated.
P97-1011
This meant that the clauses linked syntactically were also related at the discourse level (Webber et al., 2003).

This approach of classifying linguistic types by the distribution of linguistic tokens makes this research similar in spirit to that of Baldwin and Bond (2003) and Stevenson and Merlo (1999).

In addition, generating natural language discourse requires the appropriate selection and placement of discourse markers (Moser and Moore, 1995; Grote and Stede, 1998).

These markers, even though they may be multiword expressions, function syntactically as if they were coordinating or subordinating conjunctions (Webber et al., 2003).

These sentences were then parsed using a statistical parser (Charniak, 2000).

The feature TEMPEX recorded the number of temporal expressions in each clause, as returned by a temporal expression tagger (Mani and Wilson, 2000).

co-occurrences Lexical co-occurrences have previously been shown to be useful for discourse level learning tasks (Lapata and Lascarides, 2004; Marcu and Echihabi, 2002).
