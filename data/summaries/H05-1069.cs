A classic one is to acquire sense examples using bilingual parallel texts (Gale et al., 1992; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997; Diab and Resnik, 2002; Ng et al., 2003): given a word-aligned parallel corpus, the different translations in a target language serve as the “sense tags” of an ambiguous word in the source language.

The results of the recent Senseval-3 competition (Mihalcea et al., 2004) have shown that supervised WSD methods can yield up to 72.9% accuracy1 on words for which manually sense-tagged data are available.

For example, Ng et al.(2003) acquired sense examples using English-Chinese parallel corpora, which were manually or automatically aligned at sentence level and then word-aligned using software.

In previous work, we proposed to use Chinese monolingual corpora and Chinese-English bilingual dictionaries to acquire sense examples (Wang, 2004)2.

of Sense Examples Following our previous proposal (Wang, 2004), we automatically acquire English sense examples using large quantities of Chinese text and English-Chinese and Chinese-English dictionaries.

With a small amount of classified data and a large amount of unclassified data in both the source and the target languages, Li and Li (2004) proposed bilingual bootstrapping.

First, parallel corpora, especially accurately aligned parallel corpora are rare, although attempts have been made to mine them from the Web (Resnik, 1999).
P99-1068
A possible way to alleviate this problem is to select training sense examples according to an estimated distribution in natural English text, which can be done by analysing available sense-tagged corpora with help of smoothing techniques, or with the unsupervised approach of (McCarthy et al., 2004).

McCarthy et al.(2004) argue that this is a very tough baseline for an unsupervised WSD system to beat.

The Chinese language was chosen because it is a distant language from English and the more distant two languages are, the more likely that senses are lexicalised differently (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).

Dagan and Itai (1994) proposed an approach to WSD using monolingual corpora, a bilingual lexicon and a parser for the source language.
