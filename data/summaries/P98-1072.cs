A USR is interpreted with respect to a "plugging", a mapping from holes to labels (Bos, 1996).

The resolution algorithm has been implemented in Verbmobil in both the German semantic processing (Bos et al., 1996) and the (substantially smaller) Japanese one (Gamb~ick et al., 1996).
C96-1024
The representations we will use resembles Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (Reyle, 1993) and Hole Semantics (Bos, 1996).
C96-1024
The key idea is to have a common representation for all the possible interpretations of an ambiguous expression, as in Alshawi et al.(1991). Scopal ambiguities in the source language can then carry over to the target language.
P91-1021
The underspecified semantic representation technique we have used in this paper reflects the core semantic part of the Verbmobil Interface Term, VIT (Bos et al., 1998).
