2 Semantically-driven Induction of Lexical Information Several phenomena have been (more or less successfully) modeled in the LA literature: 66 • Acquisition of word taxonomies from a corpus by means of syntactic (Hindle,1990) (Pereira et al.,1993) as well semantic (Basili et al.,1993a,1996) evidence • Probability driven PP-disambignation (Hindle and Rooths,1993), (Basili et ai.,1993c), (Brill and Resnik,1994),(Resnik,1995), (Frank,1995), (Collins and Brooks,1995).

Step 2 uses the kernel words to build (as in (Yarowsky,1992)) a probabilistic model of a class: distributions of class relevance of the surrounding terms in typical contexts for each class are built.

Many authors claim that class-based methods are more robust against data sparseness problems (Dagan,1994), (Pereira, 1993), (Brown et al.,1992). Other works (Basili et al.,1993a, 1996) demonstrated that a variety of lexical acquisition methods over small size corpora are viable whenever a domain specific semantic bias is available: using high level semantic classes (rather than simple words) increase the robustness of the probability driven methods, usually affected by coverage and data sparseness problems.

data now available for any lexical acquisition techniques are not only bigrams or trigrams, or syntactic collocations (like those derived by a robust parser (as in (Grishman and Sterling,1994) or (Basili et al, 1994)) but also disambignated semantic tags for co-occurring words.

(Yarowsky,1992)) report verb as a category that is more problematic than noun for context driven classification tasks.
