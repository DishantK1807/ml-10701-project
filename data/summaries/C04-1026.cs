We formalise our syntax-semantics interface using Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), a new grammar formalism which generalises earlier work on Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).
P01-1024
XDG generalizes previous work on Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), which focussed on word order phenomena in German.
P01-1024
Because XDG allows us to write grammars with completely free word order, XDG solving is an NPcomplete problem (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002).
P02-1003
One way is to recast semantic ambiguity as syntactic ambiguity by compiling semantic distinctions into the syntax (Montague, 1974; Steedman, 1999; Moortgat, 2002).
P99-1039
For LFG, the operation of functional uncertaintainty allows for a restricted form of relationality (Kaplan and Maxwell III, 1988).
C88-1060
Finally, underspecification (Egg et al., 2001; Gupta and Lamping, 1998; Copestake et al., 2004) introduces a new level of representation, which can be computed functionally from a syntactic analysis and encapsulates semantic ambiguity in a way that supports the enumeration of all semantic readings by need.
P98-1077
Such new edges on SC could come from inferences with world or discourse knowledge (Koller and Niehren, 2000), scope preferences, or interactions with information structure (Duchier and Kruijff, 2003).
