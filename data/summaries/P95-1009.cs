This was done by generalizing the work on nonmonotonic sorts (Young and Rounds, 1993) to allow not only normal defaults rules but general default rules that are defined by the user.

This is done through generalizing the work on nonmonotonic sorts (Young and Rounds, 1993).
P93-1028
The rule defined here is treated as the one in (Young and Rounds, 1993).
P93-1028
The definitions are generalizations of the definitions in Young and Rounds (1993).
P93-1028
There are three main advantages to Young and Rounds' work compared with other approaches to default unification (Bouma, 1990; Bouma, 1992; Russel et al., 1992) which justify choosing it as a starting point for this work.
J92-2003 P90-1021
It is important to note that this generalization of the original definition of nonmonotonic unification from Young and Rounds (1993) preserves the property of order independence for default unification.
P93-1028
In this paper we show how nonmonotonic operations can also be user-defined by applying default logic (Reiter, 1980) and generalizing previous results on nonmonotonic sorts (Young and Rounds, 1993).
P93-1028
Most of the more recent unification-based formalisms, such as TFS (Emele and Zajac, 1990), UD (Johnson and Rosner, 1989), CUF (DSrre and Eisele, 1991), and FLUF (StrSmb~ick, 1994), provide some possibility for the user to define constructions of his own.
