. The text is tagged using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1992) and a translation is carried out using a manually defined mapping from the syntactic tags assigned by Brill (Penn Tree Bank tags (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993)) onto the simpler part-of-speech categories associated with LDOCE senses 6.

This paper is about two things: a novel hybrid sense tagger for unrestricted text (Wilks and Stevenson, 1997), and the experience of developing this system within GATE a General Architecture for Text Engineering (Cunninham et al., 1997; Cunningham, Wilks, and Gaizauskas, 1996a).

6The BriU tagger uses the tag set from the Penn Tree Bank which contains 48 tags (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993), LDOCE uses a set of 17, more general, tags.

We hope you can forgive this mild schizophrenia we feel that both topics are relevant to the subject of new methods in NLP: the first because both the problem of arriving at methods for sense tagging and of tuning those methods to specific domains and lexical resources is an increasingly active topic in the field (Basili, Della Rocca, and Pazienza, 1997; Harley and Gleanon, 1997); the second because work on NLP components shares a heap of problems with other language processing work to do with reusability, data visualisation, and software-level robustness and efficiency that, we feel, are best solved by the provision of a inclusive and general architecture and development environment for the field.

The text is first processed by a namedentity identifier, which we developed as part of Sheffield's entry for MUC-6 (Wakao, Gaizauskas, and Humphries, 1996; Gaizauskas et al., 1996).

Our system is in the tradition of McRoy (McRoy, 1992), who also made use of several knowledge sources for word sense disambiguation, although the information sources she used were not independent, making it difficult to evaluate the contribution of each component.

Another problem may arise when the architecture includes facilities for distributed processing (Zajac et al., 1997; Zajac, 1997), as it is not obvious how the linear model currently embodied in the graphs could be extended to support non-linear control strucures.
