The only parsing algorithms presented for linear contextfree rewriting systems (LCFRS; Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987) and the equivalent formalism multiple context-free grammar (MCFG; Seki et al., 1991) are extensions of the CKY algorithm (Younger, 1967), more designed for their theoretical interest, and not for practical purposes.
