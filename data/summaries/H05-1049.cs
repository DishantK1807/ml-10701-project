False True 0.64 Failed to penalize switch in semantic role structure enough Table 4: Analysis of results on some RTE examples along with out guesses and confidence probabilities inference of (Moldovan et al., 2003) and have proposed a way to capture common cases of this phenomenon.

Text To Graphs Starting with raw English text, we use a version of the parser described in (Klein and Manning, 2003), to obtain a parse tree.

• LSA Match: v and M(v) are distributionally similar according to a freely available Latent Semantic Indexing package,2 or for verbs similar according to VerbOcean (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004).

We have presented a learned graph matching approach to approximating textual entailment which outperforms models which only match at the word level, and is competitive with recent weighed abduction models (Moldovan et al., 2003).

3. Semantic Role Labeling: We also augment the graph representation with Probank-style semantic roles via the system described in (Toutanova et al., 2005).
P05-1073
In contrast to recent work which has successfully utilized logicbased abductive approaches to inference (Moldovan et al., 2003; Raina et al., 2005b), we adopt a graphbased representation of sentences, and use graph matching approach to measure the semantic overlap of text.

This assumption, also made by other recent abductive approaches (Moldovan et al., 2003), does not hold for several classes of examples.

Representation 3.1 The Need for Dependencies Perhaps the most common representation of text for assessing content is “Bag-Of-Words” or “Bag-of-NGrams” (Papineni et al., 2002).
