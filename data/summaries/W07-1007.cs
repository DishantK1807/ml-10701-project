Kelly and Stone (1975) consider hand-constructed disambiguation rules; Lesk (1986), Krovetz and Croft (1989), Guthrie et al.(1991), and Karov and Edelman (1996) use on-line dictionaries; Hirst (1987) constructs knowledge bases; Cottrell (1989) uses syntactic and semantic structure encoded in a connectionist net; Brown et al.(1991) and Church and Gale (1991) exploit bilingual corpora; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall (1991) use a bilingual dictionary; Hearst (1991), Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees (1993), Niwa and Nitta (1994), and Bruce and Wiebe (1994) exploit a hand-labeled training set; and Yarowsky (1992) and Walker and Amsler (1986) perform computations based on a hand-constructed semantic categorization of words (Roget's Thesaurus and Longman's subject codes, respectively).

A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993).

Jacquemin and colleagues (1997) identify morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms.

Gale and Church (1991) do not follow the EM model, but rather nd French translations of English words using a ?2-like measure of association.

Barzilay and McKeown (2001) identify multi-word paraphrases from a sentence-aligned corpus of monolingual parallel texts.

Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.
