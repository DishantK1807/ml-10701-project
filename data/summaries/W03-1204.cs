Hirao et al.(2002) reported the results of a sentence extraction system using an SVM, which categorized sequential feature values into ranges in order to make the features binary.

For sentence extraction from training data, Kupiec et al.(1995) and Aone et al.(1998) used Bayesâ€™ rule, Lin (1999) and Nomoto and Matsumoto (1997) generated a decision tree, and Hirao et al.(2002) generated an SVM.

These patterns were extracted by pattern discovery during information extraction (Sudo et al., 2001).
