and Future Work We have described a system, UNN-WePS that disambiguates individuals in web pages as required for Semeval task 13 (Artiles et al.2007). UNN-WePS was composed of three modules.

Consequently, to reduce the search space, we used the ‘one sense per discourse’ heuristic (Gale et al.1992). This assumes that one web page would not refer to two different individuals that share a name.

UNN-WePS achieved an average purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73 in Semeval Task 13, achieving seventh position out of sixteen competing systems (Artiles et al.2007). However there was considerable variance in UNN-WePS results as shown in graph 1 below.
