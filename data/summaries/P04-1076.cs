To evaluate the effectiveness of our new algorithm, we implemented the previous algorithm described in [Bagga & Baldwin 1998] as our baseline.

Previous research for cross-document name disambiguation applies vector space model (VSM) for context similarity, only using co-occurring words [Bagga & Baldwin 1998].
P98-1012
Compared with within-document name disambiguation which can leverage highly reliable discourse heuristics such as one sense per discourse [Gale et al 1992], cross-document name disambiguation is a much harder problem.
H92-1045
Before the person name disambiguation learning starts, a large pool of textual documents are processed by an IE engine InfoXtract [Srihari et al 2003].
