The smoothing methods proposed in the literature (overviews are provided by Dagan et al.(1999) and Lee (1999)) can be generally divided into three types: discounting (Katz, 1987), class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993), and distance-weighted averaging (Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Dagan et al., 1999).

Those two measures have been previously shown to give promising performance for the task of estimating the frequencies of unseen verb-argument pairs (Dagan et al., 1999; Grishman and Sterling, 1994; Lapata, 2000; Lee, 1999).

This means that we will increment the observed co-occurrence count of proud and hpersoni, proud and hlife formi, proud and hentityi, and proud and hcausal agenti by 1 8.Sincewe 2 There are several ways of addressing this problem, e.g., by discounting the contribution of very general classes by finding a suitable class to represent a given concept (Clark and Weir, 2001).

The experiment used the same set of 30 adjectives discussed in Lapata et al.(1999). These adjectives were chosen to be minimally ambiguous: each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet and was unambiguously tagged as ‘adjective’ 98.6% of the time, measured as the number of different part-of-speech tags assigned to the word in the BNC.

Classes can be induced directly from the corpus (Pereira et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1992) or taken from a manually crafted taxonomy (Resnik, 1993).

Finally, we carried out a further test of the quality of the recreated frequencies by correlating them with the plausibility judgements reported by Lapata et al.(1999). Again, a significant correlation was found for all methods (see Table 5).

Extending the results of Lapata et al.(1999), we confirmed that cooccurrence frequency can be used to estimate the plausibility of an adjective-noun pair.

To address this question, we applied the class-based smoothing procedure to a set of adjective-noun pairs that occur in the corpus with varying frequencies, using the materials from Lapata et al.(1999). First, we removed all relevant adjective-noun combinations from the corpus.

The collocational hypothesis has recently been investigated in a corpus study by Lapata et al.(1999). This study investigated potential statistical predictors of adjective-noun plausibility by using correlation analysis to compare judgements elicited from human subjects with five corpus-derived measures: co-occurrence frequency of the adjective-noun pair, noun frequency, conditional probability of the noun given the adjective, the log-likelihood ratio, and Resnik’s (1993) selectional association measure.
E99-1005
However, Lapata et al.(1999) found that the success of selectional association as a predictor of plausibility does not seem to carry over to adjective-noun plausibility.

Several measures of distributional similarity have been proposed in the literature (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999).

However, all correlations were lower than the correlation of the actual frequencies with plausibility (r = :570, p <:01) reported by Lapata et al.(1999). Note also that the confusion probability outperformed Jensen-Shannon divergence, in line with our results on unfamiliar adjective-noun pairs.

Rather, our aim is to establish an independent criterion for the validity of smoothing techniques by comparing them to plausibility judgements, which are known to correlate with co-occurrence frequency (Lapata et al., 1999).
E99-1005
Lapata et al.(1999) demonstrated that the cooccurrence frequency of an adjective-noun combination is the best predictor of its rated plausibility.
