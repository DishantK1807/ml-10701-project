This approach is exemplified by Combinatory Categorial Grammar, CCG (Steedman 1991), which takes a basic CG with just application, and adds various new ways of combining elements together 2.

There are also potential computational applications for incremental interpretation, including early parse filtering using statistics based on logical form plausibility, and interpretation of fragments of dialogues (a survey is provided by Milward and Cooper, 1994, henceforth referred to as M&:C).

The approach which we will adopt here is based on Milward (1992, 1994).

The main difference between our approach and that of Milward (1992, 1994) is that it is based on a more expressive grammar formalism, Applicative Categorial Grammar, as opposed to Lexicalised Dependency Grammar.

S /\ np vp Mary / \ V S thinks / \ np vp^ John M&C suggest various possibilities for packing the partial syntax trees, including using Tree Adjoining Grammar (Joshi 1987) or Description Theory (Marcus et al.1983). One further possibility is to choose a single syntax tree, and to use destructive tree operations later in the parse a.

In contrast, a packed recogniser based on a similar, but much simpler, incremental parser for Lexicalised Dependency Grammar has O(n a) time complexity (Milward 1994) and good practical performance, taking a couple of seconds on 30 word sentences.

We obtain a sequence of transitions as follows: 9This approach is described in greater detail in Milward (1994), where parsers are specified formally in terms of their dynamics.

14The usage of the term language tuning is perhaps broader here than its use in the psycholinguistic literature to refer to different structural preferences between languages e.g. for high versus low attachment (Mitchell et al.1992). 125 There has already been some early work done on providing statistically based parsing using transitions between recursively structured syntactic categories (Tugwell 1995) 15.
