Parser Evaluation The first results on parsing the ATB were presented in (Bikel, 2004).

Therefore, one might decide to use the unvoweled data as input to the parser because, as (Bikel, 2004) put it, ”that would ultimately be necessary for any real-world parser”, and that is indeed the choice that (Bikel, 2004; Kulick et al., 2006) made. &lt;solution&gt; &lt;lemmaID&gt;katab-u_1&lt;/lemmaID&gt; &lt;voc&gt;katab</context>

<context> 2. The ATB uses a level of annotation more accurately described as morphological analysis than as part-ofspeech tagging. The source token is run through the Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (Buckwalter, 2004). This provides all possible analyses of the token, each analysis consisting of (1) breaking a word into its various segments (prefixes, suffixes, gender and Case endings) and (2) providing a vocaliz</context>

The role of diacritic annotation in the ATB is discussed in (Maamouri and Bies, 2004) but for our purposes the crucial points are these: 1. The source text consists of words that are treated as whitespace-delimited tokens. (We call these the ”source” tokens.) As noted above, these to</context>
