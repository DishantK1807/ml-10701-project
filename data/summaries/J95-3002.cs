Previous work has demonstrated that this scoring function is able to provide high discrimination power for a variety of applications (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1992; Chen et al.1991; Su and Chang 1990).

To integrate various knowledge sources in a uniform formulation, a unified probabilistic scoring function was proposed by Su et al.(1991). This scoring function has been successfully applied to resolve ambiguity problems in an English-to-Chinese machine translation system (BehaviorTran) (Chen et al.1991) and a spoken language processing system (Su, Chiang, and Lin 1991; 1992).

It is interesting to compare our frameworks (Suet al.1991) with the work by Briscoe and Carroll (1993) on probabilistic LR parsing.

Furthermore, Briscoe and Carroll (1993) use the geometric mean of the probabilities, not their product, as the preference score, to avoid biasing their procedure in favor of parse trees that have a smaller number of nodes (i.e., a smaller number of rules being applied).

In addition, explicitly using the left context symbols allows easy use of smoothing techniques, such as deleted interpolation (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983), clustering techniques (Brown et al.1992), and model refinement techniques (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994) to estimate the probabilities more reliably by changing the window sizes of the context and weighting the various estimates dynamically.

In addition, the formulation of Equation 9 will result in the normalization problem (Suet al.1991; Briscoe and Carroll 1993) when various syntactic trees have different number of nodes.

Score Function The lexical score for the kth lexical sequence LeXk associated with the input word sequence w~ is expressed as follows (Chiang, Lin, and Su 1992): Slex(LeXk) = P(LeXk I w~) = P (c~i~ l w~) 1 Note that the effect of word sense on the syntax disambiguation task is considered in a semantic scoring function, which is not discussed in this paper.

To further improve the lexical scoring module, some refinement mechanisms developed for our part-of-speech tagger (Lin, Chiang, and Su 1994) will be incorporated into this system.

Among the statistical approaches, Su and Chang (1988) and Suet al.(1991) proposed a unified scoring function for resolving syntactic ambiguity.
