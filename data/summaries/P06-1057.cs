Another option is to use statistical word similarities, such asin thedatabaseconstructed byDekang Lin(Lin, 1998).

A highly related task was proposed in (McCarthy, 2002).

In future work it may be possible to apply automatic methods for filtering infrequent sense correspondences in the dataset, by adopting algorithms such as in (McCarthy et al., 2004).

(Gonzalo et al., 1998) demonstrates an increment in performance over an IR test collection using the sense data contained in SemCor over a purely term based model.

A possible solution may be obtained using clustering-based word sense discrimination methods (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997; Sch¨utze, 1998), in order to train different one-class models from different sense clusters.

(Yarowsky, 1994)), and using the mxpost1 part of speech tagger and WordNet’s lemmatization, the following feature set was used: bag of word lemmas for the context words in the preceding, current and following sentence; unigrams of lemmas and parts of speech in a window of +/three words, where each position provides a distinct feature; and bigrams of lemmas in the same window.
