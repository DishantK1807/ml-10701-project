The authors of (Lin and Kan, 2007) extended these methods to include timestamped graphs where nodes are added over time and applied it to multidocument summarization.

Some other possible similarity measures are document edit distance, the language models from (Kurland and Lee, 2005), or generation probabilities from (Erkan, 2006).

In (Thomas et al., 2006), the authors use the transcripts of debates from the US Congress to automatically classify speeches as supporting or opposing a given topic by taking advantage of the voting records of the speakers.

It is similar to the methods in (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005), which can be used for ranking sentences in extractive summaries and documentsinaninformationretrievalsystem.

Eigenvector centrality in particular has been successfully applied to many different types of networks, including hyperlinked web pages (Brin and Page, 1998; Kleinberg, 1998), lexical networks (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004; Kurland and Lee, 2005; Kurland and Lee, 2006), and semantic networks (Mihalcea et al., 2004).

Our method is based on the one described in (Erkan 658 and Radev, 2004) and (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), but modified to rank speakers instead of documents or sentences.
