In the future, we will consider making an increase the context-size, which helped Toutanova et al.(2003). 8 Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Gideon Mann for performing some initial experiments with a publicly available implementation of UTBL, and Eric Brill for discussions regarding his work on unsupervised transformation based learning.

Tagging: A Comparison 4.1 Corpora and Lexicon Construction For our comparison of unsupervised tagging methods, we implemented the HMM taggers described in Merialdo (1991) and Kupiec (1992), as well as the UTBL tagger described in Brill (1995).

Derived from his supervised transformation-based tagger (Brill, 1992), UTBL uses information from the distribution of unambiguously tagged data to make informed labeling decisions in ambiguous contexts.

Recently, Toutanova et al.(2003) presented a supervised conditional Markov Model part-of-speech tagger (CMM) which exploited information coming from both left and right contexts.

Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging, as defined above, has been attempted using a variety of learning algorithms (Brill 1995, Church, 1988, Cutting et.

The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al.(2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm.

Another highly-accurate method for part-ofspeech tagging from unlabelled data is Brillâ€™s unsupervised transformation-based learner (UTBL) (Brill, 1995).
