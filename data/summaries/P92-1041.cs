This is the reason why more recent works have focussed on ATMS techniques (Charniak, Goldman 1988) and their relations to chart parsing (Wiren 1990).
C90-3051 P88-1011
Actually, the flexibility of a partially configurational language like Italian (that can be considered at an intermediate level between the totally configurational languages like English and the totally inflected free-ordered Slavonic languages) can be accounted for with a relaxation of the strong constraints posed by a constituency grammar (Stock 1989) or by constraining to a certain level a dependency grammar.

PARSING PREFERENCES Many preference strategies have been proposed in the literature for guiding parsers (Hobbs and Bear (1990) present a review).
C90-3029
Lexical preferencing (Stock 1989) (van der Linden 1991) is particularly useful for the treatment of idiomatic expressions.
J89-1001
Semantic preferences, like the assignment of thematic roles to the elements in the sentence 1 can contradict the expectations of the syntactic preferences (Schubert 1984).
