In fact, although the concept is not new (Hobbs, 1983), state of the art frameworks such as (Moll´a et al., 2003; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002) are using flat semantic representations, taht is formulas with no embedded structures (see (Moll´a, 2000) for details about flatness), which simplify the syntactic-semantic interface.
