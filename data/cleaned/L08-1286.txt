Using Cognates for Synchronization An obvious idea for anchor point identification is to use socalled “cognates”1 known to be useful for sentence alignment (see, e.g., (Simard et al., 1992; Melamed, 1996)). The cognate approach for anchor point identification in subtitle alignment has already been used in the study presented in (Tiedemann, 2007).

However, synchronization differences in terms of starting time and speed cause serious alignment problems as shown in the same study. In (Tiedemann, 2006a), several ways of synchronizing misaligned subtitles have been discussed already. Synchronization is done by re-computing time information in one subtitle file by adjusting speed and time offset acc</context>

Besides of manually defining them two automatic methods have been compared in (Tiedemann, 2006a). They are both based on a “cognate filter” using string similarity measures and some heuristics for selecting the two points necessary for synchronization. Although this technique produces promisin</context>

The impact of such erroneous selections is minimized by considering all combinations of candidates and selecting the most promising pair according to some heuristics as described in (Tiedemann, 2006a). Finally, the most severe drawback of string similarity measures is the restriction to languages with at least similar alphabets. This problem will be addressed in this paper. The remaining part is</context>

The approach suggested in (Tiedemann, 2006a) uses two fixed anchor points to compute the speed and time offset for a given subtitle pair to recalculate time stamps in one of the files.

<context>4.1. Manually Adding Anchor Points The safest way of synchronizing subtitles using anchor points is to manually mark corresponding frames. For this, the interactive sentence alignment front-end, ISA (Tiedemann, 2006b) can be used. ISA includes features to manually add hard boundaries before aligning a bitext. It allows to easily jump to the end and back to the beginning of the current bitext and hard boundaries </context>

Commonly, corresponding sentences are aligned assuming that they are the smallest linguistic units that still can be aligned monotonically between two languages.
