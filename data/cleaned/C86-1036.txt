Carbone\]l, Gary G.
HendriÃ—, Marry Tnnnant The goal of this panel is to evaluate three natural language in terfaces which were introduced to the commercial market in 1985 (cf.
Carnegie Group 1985, Kamins 1985, Texas Instru ments 1985) and to >'elate them to current research in corn putational linguistics.
Each of the commercial systems selected as a starting point for the discussion (see Wahlsler 1986 for a functional comparision) was developed by a well-known scientist with considerable research experience in NL processing: Language Craft TM by Carnegie Group (designed under tile direction of.\].
Carboncll), NLMenu by Texas Instruments (designed untler the direclion of II.
Tennant), and Q & A TM by Symamec (designed under the direction of G.
Hendrix). This discussion colnplements a panel at COLING 84(see Sparck Jones et al.1984), which debated the proposition that database query is no longer a paradigmatic problem tor computational linguistics.
A commercial success ofNI, imerfaces could have a great value to our tield.
When thousanct~ of users appreciate the capabilities of NI, interlaces, computational linguists have something to be proud of.
The economic interest might push fbrward the ne.eded basic research and secure its funding.
For the first time in the history of computational linguistics tile large user comumnities of NL systems sold as mass products provide a basis tbr serious empirical research on the dialog behavior of real end-users.
The discussion may inlluenc.e computational linguistics as a basic science by tbeussing it to actual needs and by pointing out new problems which are typically identified when NL interfaces are transle.rred out of research laboratories.
I askcd tile panelists to discuss the following questions in par-ticular: I) How successful are the comnmrcial sys|ems? \]\[low many copies have been sold? To what extent are they being used on a regular basis by the customers?
How much money do they save?
Are there any costbenefit analyses?
Are the systems empirically evaluated in a cmnmercial environment?
Which evaluation methodologies are used ? How well do current users adapt to the limitations of the syslems?
What are the main areas of application? 2) Wha| are the most important factors for success ofa NL interf?tce: -the linguistic and conceptual coverage? its robuslness? the degree of portability and transportability? the qualily of tools lbr adapting the systems to a new altplication? 3) Isn't it too early tbr a commercialization of NL systems? 4) l)on't you see the danger that tile customers lose interest in NL processing forever if their ow:rblown expectations cannot be fulfilled by the systems currently available? 5) Is it just a tremendous amount of engineering to transff)rm a research system into a commercial product mr is it much more (e.g.
new concepts, algorithms, data structures)? 6) How do you see the evolution of tile market for NL interfaces?
What are your market forcast hypotheses? 7) Should commercial systems be designed for mainframes, powerful AI workstations or personal computers? 8) Is it a market advantage if the system is multilingual (e.g.
if there exists not only an English version but also a French, German, Spanish and Italian one)? 9) What cm'rent research in.computational linguistics and artificial intelligence seems most important tbr improving lhe quality of the current products? 10) Considering the next generation of commercial NL systems, how do you assess the role of NL generation cooperative response generation speech act recognition -user modeling -hybrid representation languages (e.g.
KL-TWO, KRYPTON) new types of grammars (e.g.
FUG, GPSG, LFG, TAG) multimedia communication (e.g.
luixtures of text, graphics, gestural input).
