32:395	American Journal of Computational Linguistics ~icrofiche 9 : 4 INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOP THEORETICAL ISSUES IN AATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSINGo MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY Sponsored by the Association for C~mputational Linguistics Supported by the Mathematical Social Science Board with funds granted by the Nathal Science Foundati~n DIRECTORS : BONNIE NASH-WEBBER AND ROGER SCHANK The announcement and program appear on Card 25.
33:395	The following account is presented as a sratement bf the needs and condition of the field; it was prepared by BNW and RS.
34:395	The workshop is to promote interaction among researchers in computational linguistics, psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.
35:395	The primary purpose of the workshop is to explore two major areas of common research, memory and knowledge, both with respect to their relatiofi to human language behavior.
36:395	Specifically, we hope to consider such questions as: (1).
37:395	What computational models and mechanisms have been proposed up to now in these areas?
38:395	(2) What aspects of huma~ language behavior are they meant to account for?
39:395	(3) Are these models and mechanisms compatible?
40:395	(4) Is there a single global view of language understanding and use that is adequately modelled by some combination of them?
41:395	THEQRETICAL ISSUES (5) Are there still significant aspects of human language use which they cannot account for?
42:395	(6) What is the best model of human lanquage use that can be assembled out of the concepts that nave been developed in computational linguistics, linguistics, P psychology, and artificial intelligence?
43:395	(7) How well does it really -approxima%e what humans do with language?
44:395	(8) With respect to gaps in the model, is thefe anything currently in the wind-adequate to complete them?
45:395	Thus our primary purpose is both to provide an assessment of our mowledge and goals in this area .with respect to language processing and to provide a cross-disciplinary tutorial for the participants.
46:395	A secondary purpose of the ~orkshop is to discuss the important issue of valid methodology in such research.
47:395	In eight ses:sisions, speakers will address the audience on points made by themselves or others in posimtioh papers pxeviausly distributed to all participants.
48:395	After these presentations are finished, speakers and audience will take part in general discussions.
49:395	MOT I VAT1 ON AND GOALS In recent years, researchers in several disciplines have been converging on the problem of language understanding and memory as providing a handle on the problems in their own fields.
50:395	Researchers in Artificial Intelligence, conce.rnad with building models of intelligent behavior, have.started to develop and study models of conversational interaction, which naturally rely on models of language understanding.
51:395	This is often done without reference to the work of researchers in other disciplines.
52:395	Lingui,sti-cs, of course, has always been concerned with language, but "frequently at no level higher than that of the sen-.
53:395	fence.
54:395	Such theories as derived fkom the consideration of sinale sentences out of context are diffioult to apply to the task of understanding.
55:395	Recently*some linguists such as Chafe have shifted thelr emphasis towards understanding and modelling discourse, which is af direct relevance to questiorls of understanding.
56:395	Psychologists have also been interested in problems of language understanding and memory.
57:395	While early research did look to l~.nguistics to p-ovide plausible theories of human language behavior the then-curtent theories proved insufficient to the task.
58:395	As a result, some psychologists have begun to create their own theories, while others have begun to pay attektion to the wark of A1 researchers.
59:395	Computer models are now appearing which are ex-.
60:395	pli-,cations of these theories: In the field of computational linguistics, the challenge of building computer systems which can carry on fluent and helpful dialogues with a user has dlso shifted the emphasis in the field from more efficient parsers to mote capable understanders, In spite of this convergence of many different disciplines on the same problem, there is sqrprisingly little communicat.ion between researchers in the different fields, apart, from occasional discovery of nrelevant paper$ in one field by members of anmother.
61:395	Without conferenqes of the sort that we are proposing, there is. no opportur)ity for the individual researchers in these different fields to talk to each othek directly.
62:395	Th'e value of SUCR face-to-face confrontation and the opportunity for asking questions and sxploring tne applicability of techniques in areas other than the ones that the author had in mind are well appreciated.
63:395	Wjthin disciplines such opportunities exist in traditional professional conferences.
64:395	Our conference will provide an opportunity for such interaction across a diversity of fields which would not otherwise be possible.
65:395	THEORETICAL ISSUES The need for such a conference' is especially great in the area of natural language understandlnu.
66:395	The many different fields whlch are beginning to glve Strong attention to this problem all havz different interests and consequently different emphases on the problem.
67:395	Researchers in a particular field tend to focus only on their own interests and ignore other aspects of the problem.
68:395	For example, the classical transformational grammar theory has largely ignored the necessity for the theory to account for psycholingulstlc and other pefformance aspe~ts of language.
69:395	This is a reasonable way t~ gain a restricted research problem, but the result of such research mag suffer if the researcher does not have some general idea of the problems associated wsth the aspects that are being ignored.
70:395	Thls conference will attempt to provide speclallsts in different fields with this type of general understanding of the problems of concern in other flelds.
71:395	We feel that thrs exposure to different aspects and enfphases will have a very beneflclal effect on all flelds of natural language research, and that wlthout such'interchange the potential for much of that research will not be reallzed.
72:395	The opportunity for duch a rneetlng as we are preparing does not currently exlst elsewhere.
73:395	~onferencbs sponsored by professional socletles invarlabky present intradlsclpllnary news rather than interdlsclpl~nary.
74:395	ones, and past interdlsclpllnary workshops have always been on a very small scale.
75:395	For example, at the NSF spoqsored workshop in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1971, some 25 researchers interested in Computational Semantics were brought together for two weeks of worthwhile talks.
76:395	Wh~le the results of such a conference are largely intangible, a number of partioipants In that oonference have attested to the lmpact of that conference on thelr way of thlnklng about problems aqd the course~of thelz research.
77:395	We plan to adhere to the model of the Woods Hole cob ference, but with the following two changes.
78:395	THEORETICAL ISSUES First it is important to creatb the possibility fol: the many new researchers from different 'fields who have entered this area to gain an appreciation of the different emphases of other fields.
79:395	Secondly, it is important that a much larger number of people whose interests are .in one discioline or another be exposed to the Ideas emerging from the synthesis of these di-sciplines.
80:395	It is important that more than just a small group 'be able to exchange ideas.
81:395	ence ing Since a long workshop would be very re proposing, we are relying on an e papers to familiarize all participa alike, with the current ideas.
82:395	on na in each of the fields.
83:395	These prepri diffic arly ci .nts, sp tural 1 nts wil ult on rculati eakers anguage 1 also the scale on of ~osi and audiunderstan serve the valuable job of informing those unable to participate in the workshop of these current iaeas, and de therefore intend to make copies of the preprints widely available.
84:395	ORGANIZATION The two sessions of each day will be held in the morning.and in the late afternoon.
85:395	The long break for\ lunch in between wfll facilitate discussions 04 the morning's topic, without the need to get back to another session immediately.
86:395	All sess'ions will be open to the public, and we expect about I50 people to participate.
87:395	MIT was selected as a site so that the widest group of interested people.
88:395	might be able to come at a reasonable cost.
89:395	MIT has made a large air-conditioned lecture room available, and will also provide low-cost dormitory housing for the participants.
90:395	Ihe sessions will-not simply be introductions to working systems or wel-1-known theosaies . Posit i on papers will have been distributed to all' participants at least a nonth in advance of THEORETICAL I-SSUES the workshop to f~amiliarize them with the ideas of aach speaker.
91:395	The sessions will consist of short presentations (1'0-15 minutes) by the speakers outlining their already circulated ideas.
92:395	Following a break, each speaker will have the opportunity to respond to earlier remarks, after which discussion will be opened to the audience.
93:395	A session chairman will bB responsible for maintaining the Level and direction of the sessim.

192:395	to the problems of automatic high quality translation and, more generally, of automafic language data processing, based on the restriction of the input of MT and other systems to 3 certain type of suhlanguac/e. The approach was proposed by then present author in the framework of a general theory of sublanguages (see Raskin, 1971) and subsequently tested and used by his own and other groups of researchers in the USSR on tne, material of diverse restricted sublanguages (see ibid; Gorodeckij and Raskin, 19711 R.1).
193:395	The paper consists of two parts.
194:395	Part 1,cpntains a very brief expositionc the basic principles of the approach.
195:395	In Part z some advantages of the approach over other (unspecified) approaches unrestricted in this way are mentioned in the context of a few important problems of high quality translation.
196:395	Since these problems were also discussed by the contributors to Feasibility Study on Fully Automatic High Quality Translation, &t certain points of Part 2 the paper enters a dialogue ofd a sort with some of then1 (all the quotations and references followed by a name only are taken from-the coiitribution by the corresponding author to the said report).
197:395	RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES 1, SOME BASIC PPINCI PLES OF THE PESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGE APPROACH It might'be observed that in rrost cases when the practica; neecl of constructing an MT system arises, its input, 1.e. the lincuistic material which is to be subjected to such treatment, is highly restricted 4y certain conditions: it is usually a relatively narrow field of science or kechnology with texts which are relatively, hcmogeneous, with a limited vocabulary, a restricted set of Byntactic constructions, a highly structured substance of the content plane, and a relatively constant system of values for ail the re-letrant pragmatic parameters which aredetermined in this case not by the individual prwerties of any -partdculal; situation of comunication, as is usually the case in casual com-.unlcation, but rather by the position of che field itself among the contiguous fields as veil as in nor?.-linguistic reality, in general.
198:395	For sucB restricteci sutlanguaces a simple algorithn of autom'atic processing was constructed and proved to be hig!~ly efficient 'in its practical applications.
199:395	The algorithfi is based on an over-i~portant property whicil follo\:s, logically and practically, from the features which characterize the class of restricted sublanguaaes in the theory of sublanguages, including tilose which were emphasizes above and \~hi'ch result in the irrelevdnce of all surface srructure distinctions among sentences with identical deep structure or the exact synonymity of all-paraphrases (and, in fact, even near-paraphrases!.
200:395	his proljerty implies that each stem in thevocabulary bf e restricted su61awuace tends to pla;,certain permanent role in RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES a11 the situations described by those Sentences where t!ic sten occurs, no nlatter t~hetl~er it tal;es the ior~ of a vcr11, nwn, or any other part of speech.
201:395	A riinimal sufficient inventory of these roles, wl~ich arc qiven the status 01 sernntic characteristics of stems, is conpiled (usual 1y It does not eAcecd 15' iters) and each dictidnary entry is assiqncd a ccrtain characteristic.
202:395	Then a schere of the maxi~ally extended scn'tcncc of the restricted suhlancuage, a maximal deep structure of a sort, is postulated in, such a k:ay that each sentence (or rather, eat?]
203:395	clause) can be represented as a (partial) realization of this structure.
204:395	Such structures can ernl~ec?, nest in, erc.
205:395	, each other.
206:395	The dictionary of the restricted sublanguagc wjth all its entries beinc assigned serantic ~Jlaracteristics ?nd the sc?er.e of the rr;l~ir.:all~~ extended sentence of the restricted sublanyuaue are t1.e two instrunents cn which, the univcrs.al-alqoril is founded.

212:395	RESTRICTEP SUBLANGUAGES.
213:395	Is Restricted Sublangadge Approach, RSA, applicable to all, or at least mostl relevant caseg or can it be applied only in a few exceptional situations?.
214:395	It has been argued elsewhere (see Xaskin, 1971; Ch.4.1) that the first alternative holds true while in the cases in which a polythematic informational system is needed it seems worthwhile to treat the processed tex-ts as belonging to several distinct restricted sublanguages; and after distinguish-, ing them.with the help of a not too complicated device, t~ make use of the technique developed for restricted sublanguages.
215:395	2, RESTRICTED SUBLAkEUAGE SOLUTIONS TO SOME PRQ9LEIiS OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSLATIQN Semant&cs and pragrna tics-a'nd.
216:395	the quali ty of translation.
217:395	Recent developments in semaqtic and syntactic theory have demonstrated the practically indefinite potential depth of a complete linguistic description which seeps to require much scarcely acces-, sible (at present, if not in-principle).
218:395	information on "speech act conditions, conversation rules, and semantic interpretation which must be associated in an idi'osyncratic way with the lexical item in question", op ':a theory af illocntionary acts", on "a theory of discourse which relates the use of sefitences in social and conversational situations", and.on "a theory of natural logic" (Fillmore), while the pragmatic dimension of the text is said to include answers to such heteroqeneous questions as "by ~IIOK tithe text was produced, for which kind of audience it was meant, which kind of background kno~~ledge the producer of the text assumed to be RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES available to the audience, the time, the place, and other parameters of the situation in which the text was produced.
219:395	etc. I' (Bar-Hillel) . Now, it bs obvious that for an adequate translation, no matker whethex it: is liman Or automatic, all this, highly complex information must be obtained and taken into.consideration, otherwise the quality of translation falls down sharp1.y. It is equally obvious that all this is far beyond the linguist's reach at the present staae of linquistic knowledge.
220:395	In order to arrive at a practical solution of this problem one swould impose sorre restrictions on the process of FIT.
221:395	In other words, certiain criteria of the quality of translation shohld be formulated, and if necessary and possible, lowered.
222:395	One might try to restrict the output of an MT system in khe sense that it should certainly not produce what the user does not actually need It is evident that the user of a translation of a scientific or techniml text will not require as much finesse and subtlety as the user of a translation of a literary text.
223:395	So~e (e.9.
224:395	Garvin) are prepared to go even further and construct system which would produce clearly inadeouate though still tolerable translations (in a swense nobody has even suc~~eeded in defining) in order to gain in speed,.
225:395	Now, when "machine-aided translation" or similar approaches are suggested, a restriction is imposed on what the computer is supposed (and thought of as capable), to ao.
226:395	The restriction on the input in RSA determines,.
227:395	01 course', sore restrictions on the output (but, certainly, not to the extent RESTRICTGD SUBLANGUAGES of tolerating barely acceptable tran~lations').
228:395	On &he other hand, rather on the contrary, the simplicity and easier observability of the material of a restricted sublanguage0mak,e automatic translation feasible, allowing at* the same time and Cor the same reason for the total accountability of the sublanquage which makeg it possible to account for and use for the practical purposes of translation all the complex semantic and pragmatic in/fomation which might be relevant for translqtion.
229:395	Of course, what makes it.
230:395	possiblg is that the degree of complexity of such information in the restructea sublanguage is very much inferior to what might be observed in language as a whole.
231:395	What follows, However, is that restricting the input of an MT syste~ to a sublanguage of a certain type RSA ensures high quality translation within the sublanguage and no further restrictions or lowering of the quality of translation is necessary.
232:395	It should'be mentioned at.
233:395	this point that RSA shares wsth "nachine-aided translation" the property of requiring a limited amount of predetermined and routine huvan participation prior to automatic processing.
234:395	Syn'tax and semantics, lexicon and grammar.
235:395	One of the major claims of RSA is that, at least in applications to restricted sublanguages, intricabe and labor-consuming syntactic alg~r~thms (cf.
236:395	Me1 cuk, 1964) are redundant.
237:395	The universal algorithm is based on semantics and is desicped to use linguistic information of "lower'" linnuistic e levels (viz.
238:395	morphology and syntax) in a few exceptional RESTRICTED ISUBLANGUAGES cases of semantic'ambiguity.
239:395	This emphasis an semantics rather than on syntax in automatic language data processing systems takes on a new value when compared to current discussions of the reLa-.
240:395	tions of syntaxg and semantics in linguistic theory and the existence of a clear-cut boundary between.them.
241:395	Probably influenced by the tendency, at 'present prevailing statistically in theoretical Linguistics, to claim the priimity of semantics over syntax, and, moreover, to neoate 4 the existence of the bouddary, even lth'ose researchers in MTawho do not seem to be influenced by RSA also speak in favor of such a "semantically-based" position (e.g Eley) . The latter position is indirectly reinforcedoby the fact that purely syntactic contributions to the stud% (e.g. Petrick) fail to prove their pertinence to the problem of actual realization of MT bearing insteed on the relation of recent theoretical innovations to the feasibility of MT (see.
242:395	below) . Thanks to its basie principles and internal organization RSA came inde~endent~y~to a justificatidn of the claim rnadd by Garvin khat it is aperationally more effective to delegate most of the gramatical irlformation used in an MT system to the lexicon rather than to the parsing alqorithm.
243:395	~inguistic theor9 and feasibility of MT. RSA seems to contribute to the solotion of the major clilema concealed in this phrase by providing, in a.wy similar td the one discussed above in conI nection with semantic and pragmatic problems, an interesting halfway position, a middle ground of a sort which in a sense combines RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES some rehvant properties of the two extremes-.
244:395	In the light of quite a number of promi~ing developments and achievements in liriguistic theorv, the pertinent question is whether these have, do, or will, contribute anythirfg to ?IT, or the latter, as Lyons thinks, "will neither contribute very directly to, nor depend very direktly upon, advances in linguistic theory'!
245:395	This basically defeatist position has at least two aspects, the one being that Language is claimed to be too complicated to be successfully subjected to autonatic processing, an opinion many theorists would subscribe to, and the other, proclaimed by t4T operationalists" (e.g. Garvin) that much of what has been recently proposed in grammatical and semantical theory is far.too strong for W, and much weaker models, as a possible theoretical basis for practically feasible !IT are required.
246:395	Ttd latter consideration is interestingly illustrated by -the fact of the recent emergence of working automatic systems of lanquage data processing, ouite A close, in their restrictiveness to RSA thouqh, rather contrary to it, not aiming at theoretical generalization, which use: "analvsis-based grammars" (cf . tlinograd, 1972) . -However, it i's natural for the bingu'ist to be suspicious of any attempts fo base an MT systen?
247:395	on a theory.
248:395	or a model, which has been dempnstrated to be inferiar to some other theory or model.
249:395	Any serious attempt to maKe use of any lixguistic knowledge for any-purpose must, he might feel, be based on an adequate theoretical framework-, .otherwise the ever present danger of ad hoc decisions could hardly be avoided.
250:395	What niqht 'be missed in this* MSTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES argumentation is the fact that, when dealing tzrith computerized applications 6f linguistics,,we impose on thk linguistic material a fundamentally different phenomenon, with laws and logic of its own, whi"ch may be, very foreign to the nature of human language and the mental mechanism which uriderlies it, and this might force us to give up purely 1inauis.tic theories, even if they seem based on the properties 'nherent in man's nature, and,to adopt, in manmachine partnership, a cornprornlslng approach which would account for botri human and machine nature It is not unimaginable, though rather distressing if true, that, due to theessential difference betweed the two, no linguistic theory claiming .or exhibiting the property of adequacy to the nature or human lansuase can be directly "computed", i,e. taken in by the computer; It seems,.
251:395	and this is substantiated bv the material a some papers contributed to the study (e.g. Rarktunen), that the Fore dependent on some recent development in "PUL~ li,ngulsticst' 3 paper is, the less pertinent to MT it becomes.
252:395	The contradiction Between linguistic theory aiming at adequacy and practfcal needs of MT and,, for that matter, other problems of computational lin~uistics, id self-evident.
253:395	In this situation RSA seems to be doing a uniq~ job of reconciling the two extremes, since on the paterial of a restricted subLanguage it might turn out Chat the application of a .grammar based on adequate linguistic theory would be quite practical and there would not be any need to seek more feasible ad hoc solutions.
254:395	Besides that, RSA may contribute a great deal to what is essentially RESTRICTED SUBLANGUAGES an issue between "thepry" dnd "practice" by: (1) providing a suitable "testing 'grcund" 'for various conflicting theories or models, both for those which claim linguistic adequacy and analysis-based ones; (2) allowing one to select the moSt.breXerable alternative on the basis of complete and easily accessible, evidence which night be relevant for the choice; (3) enabling Qne to linit the stren~th of a too powerful but valid theory or model bv ma'kins suitable n-odifications on the basis of eas2ly observable linguistic material 05 the restricted subdanguage.
255:395	The D,aslc principles of RSA make one think of its language ~ndependence.
256:395	Ameri~an Journal of Computational Linguistics Microfiche 9 : 38 LETTERS WITH VARIABLE VALUES AND THE MECHANICAL INFLECTION OF RUMANIAN WORDS Minerva Bocsa Universi t y of Timi~oara Romania The generation by computer of written Rumanian words faces two difficult problems: to produce automatically the numerous alternations which modify the stem and to add the inflectional endings, building a rich set of classes and sub~lasses.
257:395	The mechanical morphological analysls is also complicated because of the stem's phonetic alternatioris.
258:395	For example, the Rumanian words UNIVERSITATE -/ UNIVERSIT~~I -.
259:395	(university) SE3lQC?
260:395	-/ SERIQSI' -.
261:395	/ SERIQASA --e (serious) PUTEA -/ P_OT/PQTI ;/ POATE ----(may V~DEA -/ V~/VE_EI --/ V~ZUI -/ VADA (to see) --prednt the alternations Phonetic rules describing the occurrence of these stem modifications have several exceptions and must inelude the presence or absehce of stress, which is not marked in ordinary Rumanian Inf Lection experiments in mechanical translation from ~ngli-sh into Rumanian [16] and so on.
262:395	Phonetic alternation in Rumanian has been investigated by Lombard [Ill, Felix [7], Juglland and Edwards [lo], Augerot [l'], and others.
263:395	The preparatory work for our automatic linguistic task has several stages : Examine the inflection of each word.
264:395	Establish the set of phonetic alternations.
265:395	Attach a specific variable letter to each alternation.
266:395	In our conception [4] these are different from those of [9, 14, 151.
267:395	Design a binary code for the variable letters, tailing into 'acc~un~the possibilities of the IRIS 50.
268:395	Detach morphological parameters.
269:395	Code each word.
270:395	Punch a deck of cards.
271:395	The card file is the Morphological Dictionary.
272:395	It is exploited by the programs in various ways.
273:395	Here the working principles of a program to produce the paradigm (set of inflected forms) of each word in the Morphological Dictionaryare presented.
274:395	Ir.
275:395	this process the computer writes the inflected forms in the P positions of the paradigm ? The stem allomorphs constitute a set A with n elements.
276:395	The different distributions of the allomorphs of A in P are described by a see C; of grouping functions Rumanian Infle~tion spelling.
277:395	Nevertheless, the words with nonc'onstant stem are too numerous to be considered irreqular.
278:395	The method of storinq the several al,lomqrphs of the stem fortautomatic inflection misses the natural uriity of, the word.
279:395	We* have Constructed a mechanical Morphol ogi cal Di otionary/, containing 2058 written Rumanian words with a synthetic representation of all these phonetic alternations.
280:395	An algorithm based on this representatlon generates tne inriecrlonai noncompouna fbrms of these words.
281:395	They, are Rumanian nouns, adjectives, and verbs, the main part belonging to the basic word sbck [8, 171.
282:395	About 45 percent of them present stem alternations.
283:395	1 The algorithm whose logic was given in [3] is the background of a set of programs written in the programming language ASSIRIS for the French computer IRIS 50 and its Rumanian counterpart FELIX C-256.
284:395	The proqrams were recently run at trhe Territorial Electronic Calculus Center of Tirnisoara, verifying the algorithm.
285:395	The synthetic representation uses G. C. Moisills notion of letters with variable values [14, 151, which V. Gut.u Romalo developed [9].
286:395	The setting of our research is arcu us's theory of mathematical linguistics [12, 131, Diaconesculs study of word segmentation and the degree of regularity [5, 61, Domonkosl s '1t seems that in Rumanian only 28 percent or e*en less of the total number of words have these phonetic alternations, but in our dictionary.
287:395	reference is made generally to the most frequently used words, with relative frequency above 0.22% [17].
288:395	Rumanian Inflection identified bv numerals.
289:395	Thus grouping function 00 associates allomorph a in A with positions 1, 2, 5, -6, . in p, allomorph b in A with positions 3, 8,  in P, etc. The different partitions of A are called allamorph configunations and syniholized by a/b (with n = 2), ab/c, a/bc, a/b/c,  (with n = 3), etc. A varlab3e letter maps the elements of the partition into the Rumanian alphabet A, A, A, B,  , 2, j3 (here pl represents the empty letter) . Thue the varxable letter T/C with the configuration ac/bd has the realization T in allomorphs a and c, and another realization C kn allomorphs b and d. Not all of the theoretically possible variable letters exist in Rumanian; we Eound 85.
290:395	Thg set of fixed, vaxiable, and empty letters is called the generalized Rumanian alphabet.
291:395	A version of i,t is given in [2].
292:395	Words can be represented in this alphabet in either external or internal code.
293:395	The program operates in several steps which are described and then illustrated.

295:395	In the Morphological Dictionary, the fixed letters are punched in accordiance with the standard card code.
296:395	Each variable letter is punched as a numerical prefix of one or two decimaA digits followed by a letter.

298:395	Rumanian Inflection 1.
299:395	Receding.
300:395	The computer reads the word on the punched card and recodes it into an internal kdde; each letter is one byte.
301:395	A fixed letter has zone E or F (leading four bits I110 or 1111); variable letters have other zones.
302:395	The recoding instruction in IRIS 50 is TRTR (translate and test).
303:395	2.
304:395	Realization.
305:395	The program reads the word byte by byte.
306:395	If the zone is E or F, it writes the byte into the allomorph registers.
307:395	If the zone is less than E, the program constxucts a realizatidn for each aIlomorph and stores it in the allomorph register.
308:395	The principles that #govern the decoding of a variable letter into realiiatiohs are given in [3].
309:395	As an example, take the rule for regular variable letters (zone 0, 1 . . .
310:395	7).
311:395	Each regular variable letter has two realizations, and in the internal code the zone of each realization is F. The numeric of one realization is identical with the numeric of the regular variable letter, and the numeric of the other realization is greater by 1.
312:395	The method of encodihg partitions for regular variable letters is explained on the next frame.

386:395	Of this number, 10 have been published as microfiches 4 have been published as notes in The Finite String 10 are with the author for minor revision 7 are with the author for major revision 9 have been rejected 4 were returned to the author withoot substantive comment because tKey fall outo'ide our scope More than 2 out of 3 manuscripts go back to the author for some reason.
387:395	Perhaps somewhat more than 1 out of 3 will eventually appear in this Journal.
388:395	If our rejection rate remains low, it will be thanks to the microfiche format, which permits us to publish more pages per year than most journals.
389:395	The 1974 series contains about 900 frames, As more contributors take advantage of the space available to them, individual fiche's will be filled more often, As nore workers in the field become aware of the quality of the audience, the rapidity of publication, and the value of space in which to make a full presentation of methods and results, the number of contributions per year will increase.
390:395	We anticipate a larger series for 1975.
391:395	A new policy, effective immediately will probably make it possible in almost all instances to give the contributor the answer in &out a month that has been the intent of the editor from the beginning.
392:395	The editor acknowledges with gratitude the support of the ~ationai Science Foundation, the general help of the Center for Applied Linguistics, the support provided by the Executive Committee and membership of the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the imagination and effort rendered by several persons--not including the editor--which led to the creation of AJCL.
393:395	The work of the Editorial Board has been, and must continue to be, one of the foundations of the journal.
394:395	Those whose names appear with mine on the first frame of this fiche work hafd and well to make the journal useful to its readers.
395:395	The comments of all concerned are always welcome.
