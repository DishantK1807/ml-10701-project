2 qlanako' is ;i typical giN's li&iil(L 679 Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backward center of the subordinate clause.
Therefore the hackward center of the subordinatc clause is tlanak% arm consequently zero subject qh,,,bj refers to Itanako.
By the same way as the subordinate clause case is dealt with, the zero subject o\[' the main clause 4~z,~bj is known to refer to tlanako, too.
This result is neither interpretation a nor b shown above.
Another candidate is the property sharing thoery \[Kameyama 88\].
In her theory, since the both of zero subjects share the snbjecthood, both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topic for both of these clauses.
Therefore the prol)erty sharing theory also fails to account for the iutuitive interpretations.
Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one, ill which,roughly speaking, the important part of semantics of complex sentence is tbrmalized as relations among semantic roles that appear ill tile main clause or the subordinate clause.
At the first glance, the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of mMn or subordinate clauses, hr other words, semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear ill the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence.
However, looking more carefiflly, we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and tile cons(fronts of main cla.use are represented as local constraints by introduciug the new notion of motivated which is characterized as a llerson who has euollgh reason to act as the lllain clause describes.
More precisely, moZivated is one of tire pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate chmse are stated as identity relations between molivaled and other semantic/pragmatic roles appearing ill subordinate clause.
Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause.
The constraints ill main clause are stated as identity relations hetween molivaled which con|es from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles al / pearing in main clause.
Therefore in understanding the mail( clause we (h)u't have to be care M)out semantic/pragmatic roles in subordinate cla.use other than a molivaled.
In this sense, the constraints ill the main clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause.
The next question is how to represent tile semantics of complex sentence in feature structure( called lPS henceforth ).
l?or this, we shouhl write down the constraints about these relations among semantic/pragmatic roles ill a feature structure formalism.
Due to the space limitation, in this l)aper we ma.inly pursue the constraints about semantic feature structares.
2 Hierarchical
Structure of Complex Sentence We pay our attention to the general structure of 3apanese utterance which is helphfl to rel)resent semantics of complex sentence.
Several Japanese linguists have Mready proposed the general structm'e of Japanese utterances \[Mikami 53~ Minami 74, Takuho 87, (~Ullji 89\].
Mikami categorized clauses into three (:lasses, namely 'open', 'semi-open' and 'closed'.
'\['his categorization indicates how freely the content of clause interacts with the outside o/' clause.
For instance, they arc categorized by the degree of possibilities of coreference between zero pronouns inside the subordinate clause and nominM or topic that appear in tile main clause.
Following Mikami's idea., Minami proposed four levels, namely level A, B, C and D which correspond roughly to VP, proposition, sentence without eommuni(-~tion mood and utterance which takes into a.ccount a hearer, respectively.
\[Takubo 87\] divided level A into two levels.
One of them corresponds to VI', the other corresponds to VP + a certain kind of subject which is called "objective subject".
g~unji proposed the more detailed structure, in which starting from predicate, say, verb and adjective, objects, voice, subject, aspect, tense, modality, topic and mood are or might be sequin> tially added to make all inIbrmatioually more fultilled sentence component, l"iually, it; ends up with all utterallce.
\[n GIlIlji's strllctlll:e, solne node ('all have more than two (laughter nodes to make more coutl)lexsentence.
Following them, tim structure of the so called (chlase level) complex sentence is the following shown in Fig.
I. (ltl,eraace,J udgerlleIlt Mood Topic CJounnent Event Modal Suh-Clause I)roposition Conullel/t Conjunct Process 'Fense Action/State Aspect Suh,iert VP Object V l' l'redicate Voice Figure.l: The hie.rarchical structure of,/apauese utterances In Fig.l, Sub-Clause and Conjunct mean subof dinate clause and conjunctive partich: respectiw,Ay.
Note that Fig.l represeuts not only the hierarchical structure but Mso the word order of a corn+ plex sentence in Japanese.
The structure is almost tile same as Gunji's structure except for explicitly showing complex prolYosition, subordinate-clause 680 and conjunetiv<>l}artic\]e tha.t are newly added t(} deal with COml)lex se\[Itenees.
Note that '(;ommenl;' a.pl}earing in 'Sub Clause' has the same structure ~ts '(',olnlilCllt; } al)l>Cal:ing just below 'JudgelHe.ut'.
r\['h~tl, is to say, '(~omment' is re<'ursivcly delh~ed.

3 Subordinate
Clause In this section, a.t first we show tim predicate cat.ep;ories used in the subordina.te clauses that we deal with ill this 1)al)er, in Tal)le.I.
lu each category of 2,;I,4,5 a.nd 6, exists there+ a i)ersoll who is alfectel by the situation descril>e(I I)y the sul>or(li,ml.e clause.
On the eontra.ry, in earl'gory 1, there is not necessarily an exltliciL aIfe:ted l)erstm.
In our tll!ory, this affec.l.ed iterson plays a, key role for selnantics of eomIflex sentence.
As tim re, suit, in general we cannot derive a useful result for ca.l,eg(n'y 1 in our theory.
There17orc we d}n't dea.1 wiLh category 1 in this pal>e r.
At this momeut, we shml<l expl;fiu the tml.urc of the.
so called sul).iect.ive l>redicate Inentione.d in Td)le.I.

Firstly we show.<larU's syntax.

Therefore inlle.eti(ms are as fol hiws: #(t'c:vc}#aP-i, et(;.
In addition, .q~u'u has &ll 8.1lophonic root I'(}rnl gal an(I, .qag=la(ltast-forln), galleiru(progressive..fortn) a.nd so on are derived frour gal.
Some. (}f these forms will a\[}i)e~u' in our exatnliles.
Next we talk about th; sere;reties {if garu.
Uaru roughly means "show a.
sign of" or "ltehave like 7F+ Als,, i,, ss\] its se,,,..ti(-s is informa.lly explained, however our \]>r/p>sal is 1.o formalize tar'it's semantics in U(.I (>r more generally in computa.tiona.I linguisties, l"or I,his, tirst of all, we introduce a.
new pra.gmalie role called observer.
Delinit;ion 1 (OI}server)Observer is :l person who direclly observes or is iudireclly in.formed lhe sil.uahon described by lhe p'roposiliou parl.

-~--\] verb-t t~t-g(trlt (l>ehave= as s/he wants to rl' ) ____._+ (i I transitive passive anti iutransitiw~ i>assiw~ (a<lversity i>assive.).
Tal)le 1: Ih'e(licate C, ategoPics Although 1,his notion of observer'shares a large part with PIVOT of \[iida-Sells 88\], our notion of' observer is introduced only by garu.
Therefore it is much narr<}wer notion.
As y,u will see later, this ne.wly inl,roduecd role is playing a key role which bridges semantic roles of subordinal:e.
<:lause t,o sclnantic roles of main clause, #ks for an observer introduced by garu, one o17 the widely known consequcnc.e aboul; the nature of suD jective predicate is the following, ht a sentence, if a subjectiw" adjective is used without being fo\[lowed by a verbal sulfix gar'u, the ez'periencer of the subjective adjective, should he tit<; sl>eaker of the sentence.
The next thit,g we should do about a newly introduced notion of observer is to make (:lear the way to deal with it in FS.
First of all, in our t"S, a semantic cmltent:Sl,;M is I)asically a sea.
(state of alfa.ir) form of sit.uation semantics.
Ilowever we use semantic role like "agent", "patient", "experiencer", and so on, as argument roles of sea.
Since= an observer observes the situation which is characterized by a sea, if we know that there exisl.s an observer, the observed soa is eml)edded in (/bserving situation, which, in turn, is elnl)edde.d ill the whole semantic (;otltel|t.
In this SeAlS(+., the observed sea's itr~ttttlellt role is observed.
I~llt ;iS \[~,1" ;IS W(? hl/,ve IIO (;()llfltsiOtl, we omit role llatlle 'ol)served' henceforth.
A tyl>ical scltcma of SI",M <if I"S of this l,yl}e is {,lie following.
Note that we use :Iar*t as a value o\[' the rela.l, itm feature meaM I>y 'rel'.
The Et@ish gross of this relation garu is %bserve'.
rel: garu ol)servel': ~\] rcl:lL (:l) SI,;M = ~gent: \[k~ so~: e~perie,,{,cr: ~\],t <e,tt: 2 l Now we explain l.he semanti<:s of chmse wlfielt c<msists of sul>jcctive adjective with 9aru or la-garu., l.\[laA, ;+ire ill categories 4 and 5.
These categories' \[\>rms are "(/:<~p P-garu" or its past form "4e:cv \]'gat-/,a.", where 1' is a subjective adjective (category 4 iH '\['ahle.l) or is a verb followed by la-(lar (ca.regory,5 in Table.l), and </)<,r is the c:rperiencee of P which is l)ossibly zero.
lu these categories, there exist.
el)servers who are not the+ e:cperiencer of 1', and observe, that exl>erlence.
The gEM feature of "qSex P I'-garu/gat:ta" is the followiltg.
ol,.e, ver:D wl..'e \[\] ¢ \[\] (4),'el:P \] where " -/ " means "not token identical".
lit our l"~q, eoustra.ilfl;s 17or toke=ns like\[~ are written with "where" as shown in I.his FS.
Since constraint satisfaction method in UG ha.s been and is develOl)ed hy lnalhy resea.r(;hers rece=ntly i.e.
\[Tsuda 91\], 681 our theory will be able to be iml}lemented in systems like theirs.
If the sentence finishes just after "garu/gat-ta", the iml)ortant points arc l) an introduced observer is the speaker, and consequently 2) the es'perienccr cannot be the speaker.
If a clause with "garu/ga.tta"is a subordinate claus(;, the ca'per, cheer cannot be identified with a semantic role corresponding to the.
subject of main clause or higher clause.
As for category 2, subjective verbs like "kurusimu" (feel sick) and "kanasimu" (feel sadness) that describe subjective and/or emotional experience in verb form, are used.
Like the case of gar'u, an observer who observers the experience can be illtroduced.
However this observer is not obligatory.
Therefore unlike the "garu/gat--ta" case, the experiencer also can be an obligatory senrantic role of higher clause as well as the speaker.
4 Complex
Sentence 4.1 Feature Structure According to the hierachieal structure of Japanese sentence shown it\] Fig.1, the essential l)art of hierarchical structure of the following sentence (5) is sllown in Fig.2 . In this figure, the structure just below e~ch proposition is replaced with the corresponding parts ol" sen,elite, (8) \[~:,p smnu -gat-ta \[ feel cold l)ehaved like node, ¢,nll mada-o sime-ta.

l . To grasp the image of the relation between a, hierarchical strH(;ture and the corl:esl)oltd ing I!'S, we show an example, of FS of the above complex sentence (5) analyzed based on this tfierarchical structure in the following.
This 1eS is the result of tile unifi(-ation between the FSs of subordinate clause and main clause, where the contents of syntactic fea~ t.ure IIEAD, namely ~ is omitted.

The key point of the semantics of complex sentence is the role lnotivated that appe.ars in which corresponds to the content of the subordinate Cause.
'\['he role molivalcd is the link between the content of subordinate clause and the main clause.
Semantically motivated is characterized as the following.
Definition 2 (Motiwlted) Motivated is a person who is aj\]~cled by the situation described by the subordinale clause deeply enough Io feel or acl as the main clause describes.
The important and indispensable, part of semantics of cnnplex se.ntence is, roughly speaking, the relation between a subordinate clause aud the lib'.till clause.
But if you look more closely, I;his relation is actually tim relations among semantic/pragmatic roles appearing ill the s,fllordimlt.e clause aM those appeariug in the main clause.
The newly in~ro(tuced role of motivated gives {.he most important chic for this relation.
Therefore, in the rest of this paper, our effort will be concentrated il,to whom a motivated refers {,o.
More precisely, in FS, our main concerns are which sema,tic role in the SIqM of subordinate clause the molivaled can or cannot be.
unitied with, and which semantic role in the SEM of main clause the molivalcd can or cannot be unified with.
4.2 Constraints
In this subsection, we propose the co.straints on complex sentence.
For t;his, al; tirst we categorize the relations between subordinate, clause and main clause t)ased on their semantics.
They are divided up to many types of complex sentence.
We show the most important and tyl)ical types in 'l'al)le.2, where SC an(l MC mean 'subordinate clause' and 'tnain clause' respectively.

In both of (6) and (7), the m.otivateds of subordinate clause are constrained by $2, namely motivateds can be either q5~, v or the observe," of subordinate clause.
Constraint M1 says that in both cases, qS~.qt is unified with the reel\[rated.
Intuitively in (6), qS~gt is ~b~,.p.
On the other hand in (7), G qt is the observer.
Both of these interpretations comply with constraints $2, and M1.
\[q51exp atui node \] (8) \[ behot because\] q52exp komaru.
be in trouble.
'Since it is hot, I am in trouble'.
Intuitively q$1~.,.p corefer with q52<.:~ v.
This interpretation is expected by eonstrMnt $3 and M2 that apply in this case.
As you know from these exainples, our constrMnts are not strong enough to identify the antecedent of qSan, uniquely, lint makes safe interpretations.
Moreover disambiguation done by these constraints is useflfl for further inference that will be done with comnionsense knowledge or with a special vocabulary like 'kekkyokn(finally)' used in (7).
In case of $5, namely iritransitive passive or adversity passive, it is well known, i.e.
\[Gnnji 87\] that tbere exists a person who is affected by tile situation described by tile passive sentence.
An example sentence is the following.
\[~Jaffect trirriani sin -are (9) \[ wife be dead -PASSIVE -ta noni\] -PAST but\] ~exp kanasimi me -st nat.
show sadness not, 'Although his wife had gone, 05~:,,~> doesn't show a bit of sadness.
The semantic role of this a.ffected l)erson, ill (9) zero role:Gqj~t whose wiD was dead, is ~tl'i ajfected.
Tile intuitive interl)retation that 6~*'i, = Gd.r~t( = motivated), is expected by our constraints: $5 of Table.3 and M1 of Table.'\].
On the contrary, lit case of $6, namely transitive passive, gellera.lly we don't have an affecled, ltowever in seine context, a transitive passive form lnay require the role affeclcd which is inherent to adversity passive.
For instance, (10) ~a.Uect saihnga.
iillSUni walletSUFI3 steal are t a -PASSIVE -PAST 'd)a.ffect's wallet was sl.olen'. hi this case, a.
person whose wallet was stolen is not explicit but regarded as an affected.
Another case having an affected is that a rela.tional noun is the subject of trlmsitive passive.
Then a person who is in the relation exl)ressed by the relational aolln is thought to be affected by that situation,too.
Here we take 'lnother', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'supervisor', and so forth as a relationM noun.
A couple of exanlple sentences are tbe following.
(12) \[ kobnn -ga yar -are (ll) \[ henchman -SUB3 attack -PASSIVE -ta node \] -PAST because\] ~b<,nt sikaesini it-ta.
retaliate goI)AST 'Since his henchman was a.ttacked, the boss retMiated'.
\[ kobun -ga yar -are \[ himchman -SUBJ attack -PA.SSIVE -ta noni\] 4b<q~ te-o komaneite-iru.
-PAST but \] did nothing.
'Although his henchman was attacked, the boss didn't retaliate'.
qJ,<.qt who retaliated (1 1) (or didn't retaliate (12)) has a certain relation between the henchman who had been attacked.
For instance, q$<</t may be the boss of that henchnian.
In ill), since constraint $6 of TaMe.3 and M1 of Table.4 apply, ?5ant is an affectedof attacking event described in tile suboMina.te clause.
This interpretation coincides with native's intuition.
In sum, with these constraints, a constraint satisfa.ction process in {JO based parsing can be done locally and consequently very efficiently.
In other words, l)rimarily a constraint satisfaction process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of subordinate clause, and tllat of the main clause can be done within it except for using motivaled whose value has already been constl:ained in the subordinate clause.

Works and Conclusions One of the relevant researches to ours is JPSG that has l)een developed I)y Gunji\[(hirtji 87, Gunji 89\] and is further studied by tile ICOT working group.
Ollr focus is a l/lore praginatics oriented one tha.n,IPSG is.
Many Jatlanose \[inguisl.s have ah'eady done the enormous aliiount of I)asic observations aim proposed linguistie IJleories about the plieliOlrlena, we deal with in this paper \[Mikaini 53, \[(till() 73, \](lllIO 78, Ohye 75, Minaret 74, "\]'akul)o 87, Tera.l\[iura 84, Terali'lllra 9(), Saito 92\].
Of ('.Ollrse Ollr research is based on their works and obserwrtions.
Ill \[Ohye 75\], it is said that if garu is used ill a subordinate.

Inain clause is not the experiencer of the sut)ordina.te clause.
In \[Saito 92\], she says tllat 1) a cognizcr that (;orresponds to our observer is introduced if .qaru is used, and 2) if an observer is introduced in the sul)ordinate clause, the mentally responsible lie*son appearing in tile main clause is identical with the observer.
In linguistic l)}lenomena, these observations are similar to the 684 constraint we propose here.
So what is new?
The answer is I, hal,: 1) We explicitly stat, e the semanl.ics of complex sentence as the relations amot~g semttnt.ic roles.
Namely, sittce we use scmantic/pragmal, ic roles instead of grammal.ical roles in constra.ints, our <-onsl;traints (;311 ~-t(;('.Ollllt for geFo tLllO,l)hoI;iL ill a.
s(:ntel.:e where tit(: main ela.use is l>assive where an agc)tl ol: an exl)er.iencer is not; necessarily l;he subject, like the following example.
113) Taro -wa \[ gakkou e iku-no -we -qbpic \[ to school g<>NOM -ACC iya -gab ta.
node \] hate behaved like because \] 4,~11, @,,t okor :are -ta.
scold -I'ASSIVE -PAST 'Since Taro l>ehaved like hating to go t.o school, he was scolded'.
where the intuitive, reading is the followiug: era', thai, is zero subject, refers t.o 'l'aro, and ¢,st, that is not the zero subject, refers to Ta.ro's parcnt.s who are the observer and molivalcdof the subordin;tte, clause.
2) We formalize this t.heory in 111~ Ibl'malis,,t, even though the details are omitted due to the space limitation.
3) We find that l.hc constraixg.s of complex sentences arc, actually local ones.
This localization el eonstra.lnt was found hy hltroducing new pragm+d.ic roles observer atl<l ?~toliv(tlcd, and is extretr,ely iml>ortant tbr ellieiency of UG based parsing.
'\['his localization also makes l.he prol>OSe.d constrainl.s be coml>osil;ional ones, I+ecause in l.he case el deeply <un I)eddcd complex scnteuce, l;o identify the rel+erenC of each m.otiva¢ed that, bridges I)etween a.
