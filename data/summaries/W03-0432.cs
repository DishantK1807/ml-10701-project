Chieu and Ng used global information such as the occurrence of the same word with other capitalisation in the same document (Chieu and Ng, 2002a), and have also used a mixed-case classifier to teach a “weaker” classifier that did not use case information at all (Chieu and Ng, 2002b).

Most commonly, feature-based classifiers use a set of capitalisation features and a sentence-initial feature (Bikel et al., 1997).

MD-tries have been shown to give better performance than a standard trie with the same number of nodes (Whitelaw and Patrick, 2002).

Tries have previously been used in both supervised (Patrick et al., 2002) and unsupervised (Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999) named entity recognition.
