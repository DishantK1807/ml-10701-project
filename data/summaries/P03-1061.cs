In conventional models (e.g., (Mori and Nagao, 1996; Nagata, 1999)), probabilities were estimated for candidate morphemes that were found in a dictionary or a corpus and for the remaining strings obtained by eliminating the candidate morphemes from a given sentence.

However, Uchimoto et al.reported that the accuracy of automatic word segmentation and POS tagging was 94 points in F-measure (Uchimoto et al., 2002).

The terms used in the table are basically as same as those that Uchimoto et al.used (Uchimoto et al., 2002).

We implemented this model within an ME modeling framework (Jaynes, 1957; Jaynes, 1979; Berger et al., 1996).

One of the solutions is to use dictionaries developed for a corpus on another domain to reduce the number of unknown words, but the improvement achieved is slight (Uchimoto et al., 2002).

One is to find unknown words from corpora and put them into a dictionary (e.g., (Mori and Nagao, 1996)), and the other is to estimate a model that can identify unknown words correctly (e.g., (Kashioka et al., 1997; Nagata, 1999)).

They proposed a morphological analysis method based on a maximum entropy (ME) model (Uchimoto et al., 2001).
