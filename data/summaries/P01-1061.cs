This extended sharing is similar to the ‘packing’ approach employed in the Core Language Engine (Alshawi, 1992), except that the CLE relies on a quasi-logical form to underspecify semantic information such as quantifier scope (the calculation of which is deferred until syntactic ambiguities have been at least partially resolved by other means); whereas the approach described here extends structure sharing to incorporate a certain amount of quantifier scope ambiguity in order to allow a complete evaluation of all subderivations in a shared forest before making any disambiguation decisions in syntax.3 Various synchronous formalisms have been introduced for associating syntactic representations with logical functions in isomorphic or locally non-isomorphic derivations, including Categorial Grammars (CGs) (Wood, 1993), Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Joshi, 1985; Shieber and Schabes, 1990; Shieber, 1994), and Synchronous Description Tree Grammars (DTGs) (Rambow et al., 1995; Rambow and Satta, 1996).
