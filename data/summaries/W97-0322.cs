While (Yarowsky, 1995) does not discuss distinguishing more than 2 senses of a word, there is no immediate reason to doubt that the "one sense per collocation" rule (Yarowsky, 1993) would still hold for a larger number of senses.

This data is described in more detail in (Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees, 1993).
H93-1051
In previous unsupervised experiments with interest, using a modified version of Feature Set A, we were able to achieve an increase of 36 percentage points over the accuracy of the majority classifier when the 3 classes were evenly distributed in the sample (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997b).

(Guthrie et al., 1991) propose that neighborhoods be subject dependent.

Clustering has most often been applied in natural language processing as a method for inducing syntactic or semantically related groupings of words (e.g., (Rosenfeld, Huang, and Schneider, 1969), (Kiss, 1973), (Ritter and Kohonen, 1989), (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee, 1993), (Sch/itze, 1993), (Resnik, 1995a)).

(Zipf, 1935), (Pedersen, Kayaalp, and Bruce, 1996)), there is evidence that our data, when represented by a dissimilarity matrix, can be adequately characterized by a normal distribution.

All data, with the exception of the data for line, come from the ACL/DCI Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz, 1993).
J93-2004
(Yarowsky, 1995) compares his method to (Schiitze, 1992) and shows that for four words the former performs significantly better in distinguishing between two senses.
C92-2070 P95-1026
The data for the 12 words tagged using LDOCE senses are described in more detail in (Bruce, Wiebe, and Pedersen, 1996).

algorithm The only other application of the EM algorithm to word-sense disambiguation is described in (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
In future work, we will expand all of the above types of features and employ techniques to reduce dimensionality along the lines suggested in (Duda and Hart, 1973) and (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
(Resnik, 1995b) provides an information theoretic definition of semantic distance based on WordNet.

A more recent bootstrapping approach is described in (Yarowsky, 1995).
