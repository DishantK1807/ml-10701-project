Translation using Inversion Transduction Grammar The Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) of Wu (1997) is a type of context-free grammar (CFG) for generating two languages synchronously.

Decoding Wu (1996) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for decoding ITG combined with an m-gram language model.

Eisner and Satta (1999) pointed out we donâ€™t have to enumerate k and hprime simultaneously.
P99-1059
This is the same complexity as the ITG alignment algorithm used by Wu (1997) and others, meaning complete Viterbi decoding is possible without pruning for realistic-length sentences.

Melamed (2003) discussed the applicability of the hook trick for parsing bilexical multitext grammars.
N03-1021
Bilexical CFG is at the heart of most modern statistical parsers (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), because the statistics associated with word-specific rules are more informative for disambiguation purposes.
