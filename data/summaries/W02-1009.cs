The transformation model approach is therefore a full stochastic treatment of lexicalized syntax— apparently the first to treat lexical redundancy rules, although (Briscoe and Copestake, 1999) give an ad hoc approach.

Each dataset consisted of a collection of flat rules such as Sput!NP put NP PP extracted from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

(In the semi-supervised experiments here, training data is not raw text but a sparse sample of flat rules.) Indeed a good deal of syntax induction work has been carried out in just this framework (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994; Chen, 1996; De Marcken, 1996; Gr¨unwald, 1996; Osborne and Briscoe, 1997).

Collins (1997, model 2) uses a more sophisticated model in which all arguments in this sequence are generated jointly, as in a Treebank grammar, and then a Markov process is used to insert adjuncts among the arguments.

Extending Johnson (1998), it shows the inappropriateness of the traditional independence assumptions that build up a frame by several rule expansions (section 2).

The set of arcs leav8Carpenter (1991) writes that whenever linguists run into the problem of systematic redundancy in the syntactic lexicon, they design a scheme in which lexical entries can be derived from one another by just these operations.

Most researchers have used an n-gram model (Eisner, 1996; Charniak, 2000) or more general Markov model (Alshawi, 1996) to model the sequence of nonterminals in the RHS.

This perspective allows use of generic methods for finite-state parameter estimation (Eisner, 2002b).
