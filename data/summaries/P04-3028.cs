We have applied Weka’s (Witten and Frank, 2000) AdaBoost’s version of j48 decision trees (as used in Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004) to the 140 unseen examples of the test set for generating the learning curve shown in figure 4.

The motivation for our research arises from the need to annotate a human-human speech corpus for the ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue System) project (Litman and Silliman, 2004).

Also prior to our study, each annotated turn was represented as a vector of 449 features hypothesized to be relevant for emotion prediction (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004).

We will also try to address the limitation of noise in our Co-training System, and generalize our solution to a corresponding corpus of humancomputer data (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004).

Prior to our study, the 453 student turns in these 10 dialogues were manually labeled by two annotators as either "Emotional" or "Non-Emotional" (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004).
