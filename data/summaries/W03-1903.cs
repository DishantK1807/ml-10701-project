In fact, we will understand the term anaphoric in a much wider sense in line with (Krahmer and Piwek, 2000) and (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).

In addition, we distinguish between three types of (meta-) entities: sets of entities, intensional entities (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) and (real-world) entities together with the potential relations such as member of, part of, etc.

The annotation of word senses such as used by machine-learning based word sense disambiguation (WSD) tools corresponds to the task of selecting the correct semantic class or concept for a word from an underlying ontology such as WordNet (Resnik, 1997).

The core scheme is in principle identical with the MUC coreference scheme and is restricted to the annotation of coreference in the sense of (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).

In line with (Krahmer and Piwek, 2000) and (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) this is in our view a too strict definition of anaphora so that we propose a more relation-based classification of anaphoric and bridging relations.

The annotation scheme proposed by Poesio et al.(Poesio and Vieira, 1998) is a product of a corpusbased analysis of definite description (DD) use showing that more than 50% of the DDs in their corpus are discourse new or unfamiliar.

With such a concept hierarchy as well as semantic relations with a precisely defined signature, we can for example overcome annotation problems of intensionality and predication as discussed in (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).

Part-of-Speech (POS) annotation for example can be seen as the task of choosing the appropriate tag for a word from an ontology of word categories (compare for example the Penn Treebank POS tagset as described in (Marcus et al., 1993)).

In this sense, instead of measuring only the categorial agreement between annotators with the kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) or the performance of a system in terms of precision/recall, we could take into account the hierarchical organization of the categories or concepts by making use of measures considering the ’hierarchical distance’ between two concepts such as proposed by (Hahn and Schnattinger, 1998) or (M¨adche et al., 2002).
J96-2004
In fact, it has been shown that the agreement of subjects annotating bridging (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) or discourse (Cimiano, 2003) relations can be too low for tentative conclusion to be drawn (Carletta, 1996).
