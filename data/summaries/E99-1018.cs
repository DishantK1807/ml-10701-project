More sophisticated guessers further examine the prefixes of unknown words (Mikheev, 1996) and the categories of contextual tokens (Brill, 1995; Daelemans et aL, 1996).

On one hand, according to the linguistic approach, experts encode handcrafted rules or constraints based on abstractions derived from language paradigms (usually with the aid of corpora) (Green and Rubin, 1971; Voutilainen 1995).

As a common strategy, POS guessers examine the endings of unknown words (Cutting et al.1992) along with their capitalization, or consider the distribution of unknown words over specific parts-of-speech (Weischedel et aL, 1993).

This fact prohibits the feeding of the training algorithms with patterns that have the form: (Tagi_2, Tagi_b Tagi, Tagi.~, Manual_Tagi), which is the ease for similar systems that learn POS disambiguation (e.g., Daelemans et al., 1996).

On the other hand, according to the data-driven approach, a frequency-based language model is acquired from corpora and has the forms of ngrams (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992), rules (Hindle, 1989; Brill, 1995), decision trees (Cardie, 1994; Daelemans et al., 1996) or neural networks (Schmid, 1994).

Comparing our tree-induction algorithm and IGTREE, the algorithm used in MBT (Daelemans et al., 1996), their main difference is that IGTREE produces oblivious decision trees by supplying an a priori ordered list of best features instead of re-computing the best feature during each branching, which is our case.

The disambiguating methodology followed is highly influenced by the Memory-Based Tagger (MBT) presented in (Daelemans et aL, 1996).
