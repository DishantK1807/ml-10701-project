(Shen et al., 2003) explored an adaptation of a general Hidden Markov Model-based term recognizer to biological domain.

They extracted affix features in a similar way with (Shen et al., 2003).

Without using other specific domain resources, the system achieves comparable results to some other state-of-the-art systems (Finkel et al., 2004; Settles, 2004) which resort to external knowledge, such as protein dictionaries.

Most previous work on paraphrase has focused on high quality rather than coverage (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004), but generating artificial references for MT parameter tuning in our setting has two unique properties compared to other paraphrase applications.

At the sentence level, (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) employed an unsupervised learning approach to cluster sentences and extract lattice pairs from comparable monolingual corpora.

(Lee et al., 2003) used prefix and suffix features coupled with a dictionary-based refinement of boundaries of the selected candidates in their experiments for term annotation.
