A similar approach was used by Berland and Charniak (1999) and Poesio et al (2002) to extract information about part-of relations using patterns such as the N of the N is ….

The collected data were used to build a vectorial representation of attributes as done in (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004).

Extraction and Classification The goal of this work is to identify genuine attributes by classifying candidate attributes collected using text patterns as discussed in (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004) according to a scheme inspired by those proposed by Guarino and Pustejovsky.

This observation suggests that it should be possible to find similar attributes in an unsupervised fashion by looking at their attributes, just as we did earlier for concepts (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004).

work on the acquisition of lexical information about verbs there has been some work on the acquisition of thematic roles, (e.g., Merlo and Stevenson, 2001).

In addition to derivational morphology, we used the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) to filter out adjectives and other types of words that can occasionally be used as nouns such as better, first, and whole before training.

On the other hand, the only work on the extraction of lexical semantic relations we are aware of has concentrated on the type of relations found in WordNet: hyponymy (Hearst, 1998; Caraballo, 1999) and meronymy (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Poesio et al, 2002).

(This was also done by Berland and Charniak (1999)).

In previous work (Almuhareb and Poesio, 2004) we used this same approach to extract attributes, using the pattern “the * of the C [is|was]” (suggested by, e.g., (Woods, 1975) as a test for ‘attributehood’) to search for attributes of concept C in the Web, using the Google API.
