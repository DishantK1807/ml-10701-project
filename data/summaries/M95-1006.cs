TECHNICAL APPROACH Our approach is a synthesis of statistical and linguistic models of language, embodied for MUC-6 in the PLU M system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) . We began this research in 1991 and applied it that year i n MUC-3 . Since that time, we have successfully applied probabilistic models to the following : • part of speech tagging, using Hidden Markov Models (Weischedel, et al ., 1993), • judgments of relevance of text (at the paragraph level) via a log odds model (Ayuso, et al ., 1992), • learning semantic information (selection restrictions, or case frames) from supervised training (Weischedel, et.

The lightweight procedures in IdentiFinder are SGML recognition, hidde n Markov models, finite state pattern recognition, and SGML output . By heavyweight processing, we mean procedures that depend on global evidence and involve deeper understanding . The SPATTER full parser of English and the new semantic inference procedure are examples . 55 KEY SYSTEM FEATURE S Two key design features of PLUM are : statistical language modeling with the associated learning algorithms, an d partial understanding . The first key feature is the use of statistical modeling to guide processing . For the version of PLUM used in MUC-6, part of speech information was determined by using well-known Markov modelin g techniques embodied in BBN's part-of-speech tagger POST (Weischedel, et al ., 1993).
