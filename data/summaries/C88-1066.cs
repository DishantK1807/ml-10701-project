The elimination of metarules (cf Kilbury 1986), which lead to particular difficulties in parsing with GPSGs, was in fact the immediate motivation for developing and implementing the formalism, but its main justification lies in its capacity to express generalizations which cannot be captured in GPSG or other present formalisms.

Although it is not intended as a vehicle for the implementation of other grammar formalisms, it is 'tooloriented' in the sense of Shieber (1986) in that it provides a clearer picture of the relation GPSG has to other formalisms (cf Kilbury 1987).

1. The CCR formalism The CCR formalism, introduced in Kilbury (1986, 1987), has its origin in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG; cf Gazdar et al.1985, henceforth 'GKPS') and is a special type of unification grammar (cf Shieber 1986).

Given the VP expansions of (5), an elementary logical technique employing truth tables (of Kilbury 1986) allows us to construct tim three CCRs of (9), which taken together with (7) and (8) admit the same set of iÂ°Ts as the ID rttles of (5): (9) CCR 5': CCR 6': CCR 7': VP II AtlX -~V \]1 VP I\[ ALIX D (VP A ~ NP) II VP I\[ V D (VP V NP) \]1 The CCRs of (9) have been formulated only on tile basis of LTs with VP as root, however, and therefore fail to capture generalizations that apply to all LTs.
