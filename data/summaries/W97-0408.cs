Head transducers were introduced in Alshawi 1996b, where the symbols in the source and target sequences are source and target words respectively.

The transducer model can be characterized as a statistical translation model, but unlike the models proposed by Brown et al.(1990, 1993), these models have non-uniform linguistically motivated structure, at present coded by hand.

The search algorithm used in our implementation is a head-outwards dynamic programming algorithm similar to the parsing algorithm for monolingual head acceptors described in Alshawi 1996a.

Details of this cost assignment method are presented in Alshawi and Buchsbaum 1997.
P97-1046
Details of the experiment are presented in Alshawi, Buchsbaum, and Xia, 1997.
P97-1046
The head transducers were built by modifying the English head acceptors defined for an earlier transfer-based system (Alshawi 1996a).

Construction The head transducer model was trained and evaluated on English-to-Mandarin Chinese translation of transcribed utterances from the ATIS corpus (Hirschman et al.1993). By training here we 57 DE,O.-2 cardinaJ..
