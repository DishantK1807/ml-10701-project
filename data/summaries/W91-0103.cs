Shieber (1988) argues for a uniform architecture for parsing in generation.
C88-2128
The constraint language at least consists of the path equations known from PATR II (Shieber, 1989), augmented with variables.

First I show how Reape's analysis of Dutch and German verb raising constructions can be incorporated in the current grammar (Reape, 1989; Reape, 1990a).

If the above sketched approach to semantic interpretation is followed systematically, it is possible to show that such a semantic-head-driven generation algorithm terminates (Dymetman et al., 1990).
C90-3017
The grammar rules simply percolate the semantics upwards; by the selection of the arguments, this semantic formula then gets further instantiated (Moore, 1989).

For generation headdriven generators can be used (van Noord, 1989; Calder et al., 1989; Shieber et al., 1990).

The meta-interpreter defines a head-driven bottom-up strategy with top-down prediction (figure 2), and is a generalization of the head-driven generator (van Noord, 1989; Calder et al., 1989; van Noord, 1990a) and the head-corner parser (Kay, 1989; van Noord, 1991).

This result should be compared with other uniform scheme's such as SLD-resolution or some implementations of type inference (Zajae, 1991, this volume) which clearly are also uniform but facessevere problems in the case of lexicalist grammars, as such scheme's do not take into account the specific nature of lexicalist grammars (Shieber et al., 1990).
J90-1004
The head-corner parser knows about strings and performs operations on them; in the types of grammars defined here these operations are replaced by general constraint-solving techniques (HShfeld and Smolka, 1988; Tuda et al., 1989; Damas et al., 1991).
E89-1013 E91-1030
Note that this implies that an unsaturated sign is not associated with one string, but merely with a set of possible strings (this is similar to the semantic interpretation of unsaturated signs (Moore, 1989)).
P89-1005
Following Shieber (1989) I assume that the interpretation of a set of path equations is defined in terms of directed graphs; the interpretation of a lexical entry is a set of such graphs.
P89-1002
In van Noord (1991) I define a head-driven parser (based on Kay (1989)) for a class of constraint-based grammars in which the construction of strings may use more complex operations that simple context-free concatenation.

The string associated with a linguistic object (sign) is defined in terms of its word-order domain (Reape, 1989; Reape, 1990a).
E89-1014
The associated interpreter is a Prolog like topdown backtrack interpreter where term unification is replaced by more general constraintsolving techniques~, (HShfeld and Smolka, 1988; Tuda et aL, 1989; Damas et al., 1991).
E89-1013 E91-1030
Such an organization of a grammar is the starting point of a class of generation algorithms that have become popular recently (Calder et al., 1989; Shieber et al., 1989; Shieber el al., 1990).
