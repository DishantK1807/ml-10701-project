Translations and collocations were abstracted automatically from the parsed version of CR (see Neff and Boguraev 1989) using LQL (Neff et al.1988). For illustration, a partial entry for dance is: +-bdw: dance +-superhom +-Im~og~aph +-homr.Jm: 2 +-pos : v~ +-Iransla~ I +-argxJlm~r1~:: leal~z e~c I +-+*ord: danser J.o, :t For example, the ACL Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI) coordinated by Dr.

These problems have recently been the topic of intense research (Klavans 1988, Boguraev and Briscoe 1989, Boguraev et al.1989, Zemick 1990).

As for the second type of application, systems such as described in Brown et al.1988 which use purely statistical approaches to infer translations from a bilingual corpus can benefit di~ rectly from the information already given in the MRD.

Using purely statistical techniques, Brown et al.1988 make use of the Itansard bilingual corpus for the purpose of building a machine translation system.

On more syntactic note, Dagan and Itai 1990 use statistical methods over linguistically parsed text (Jensen 1986) to resolve anaphorie reference.

Church and ttanks 1989 and Church et al.1990 develop a battery of statistical methods to induce linguistic regularities.
