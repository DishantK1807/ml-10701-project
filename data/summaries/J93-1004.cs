Although there has been some previous work on the sentence alignment (e.g., Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991 \[at IBM\], Kay and R6scheisen \[this issue; at Xerox\], and Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, in press \[at ISSCO\], the alignment task remains a significant obstacle preventing many potential users from reaping many of the benefits of bilingual corpora, because the proposed solutions are often unavailable, unreliable, and/or computationally prohibitive.

Brown et al.(1990) mention that sentence lengths formed the basis of their method.

The overall error, 4.2%, that we get on the UBS corpus is considerably higher than the 0.6% error reported by Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991).
P91-1022
Although Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) used lengths measured in words, comparisons of error rates between our work and theirs will not test whether characters or words are more useful.

Aligning sentences is just a first step toward constructing a probabilistic dictionary (Table 3) for use in aligning words in machine translation (Brown et al.1990), or for constructing a bilingual concordance (Table 4) for use in lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990).
J90-2002
(Brown et al.1988a,b) start from a set of aligned sentences, suggesting that they had a solution to the sentence alignment problem back in 1988.

1. Introduction Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al.1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debates), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).

Church* AT&T Bell Laboratories Researchers in both machine translation (e.g., Brown et al.1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary proceedings), which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).

The IBM algorithm is much more efficient since they were able to extract nearly 3 million pairs of sentences from Hansard materials in 10 days of running time on an IBM Model 3090 mainframe computer with access to 16 megabytes of virtual memory (Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).

We used the same procedure that is used in Church (1988).

Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) report that they achieve a 0.6% error rate when the algorithm suggests aligning one sentence with one sentence.
