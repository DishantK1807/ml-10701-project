Problem of VP Ellipsis VP ellipsis has received a great deal of attention in theoretical and computational linguistics (Asher, 1993; Crouch, 1995; Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991; Fiengo and May, 1994; Gawron and Peters, 1990; Hardt, 1992; Kehler, 1993; Lappin and McCord, 1990; Priist, 1992; Sag, 1976; Webbet, 1978; Williams, 1977, inter alia).

In non-identity approaches (Dalrymple, Shieber, and Pereira, 1991; Kehler, 1993; Crouch, 1995, inter alia) strict/sloppy readings result from a choice point within the resolution algorithm.
