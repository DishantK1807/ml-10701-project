Aside from purely linguistic interest, bracket structure has been empirically shown to be highly effective at constraining subsequent training of, for example, stochastic context-free grammars (Pereira & ~ 1992; Black et al.1993). Previous algorithms for automatic bracketing operate on monolingual texts and hence require more grammatical constraints; for example, tactics employing mutual information have been applied to tagged text (Magerumn & Marcus 1990).

Since Chinese text is not orthographically separated into words, the standard methodology is to first preproce~ input texts through a segmentation module (Chiang et al.1992; Linet al.1992; Chang & Chert 1993; Linet al.1993; Wu & Tseng 1993; Sproat et al.1994). However, this serionsly degrades our algorithm's performance, since the the segmenter may encounter ambiguities that are unresolvable monolingually and thereby introduce errors.

The translation lexicon was automatically learned from the same corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994).

All experiments reported in this paper were performed on sentence-pairs from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus, which consists of governmental transcripts (Wu 1994).

A simpler, related idea of penalizing distortion from some ideal matching pattern can be found in the statistical translation (Brown et al.1990; Brown et al.1993) and word alignment (Dagan et al.1993; Dagan & Church 1994) models.

Parallel corpora have been shown to provide an extremely rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al.1990; Gale & Church 1991; Gale et al.1992; Church 1993; Brown et al.1993; Dagan et al.1993; Dagan & Church 1994; Fung & Church 1994; Wu & Xia 1994; Fung & McKeown 1994).
