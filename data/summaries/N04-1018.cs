Edit dis uency detection systems that rely exclusively on word-based information have been presented by Heeman et al.(Heeman et al., 1996) and Charniak and Johnson (Charniak and Johnson, 2001).

Bear et al.(1992) explored pattern matching, parsing and acoustic cues and concluded that multiple sources of information would be needed to detect edit dis uencies.

We used Florian and Ngai’s Fast TBL system (fnTBL) (Ngai and Florian, 2001) to train rules using dis uency annotated conversational speech data.

The POS tag features were produced by rst predicting the tags with Ratnaparkhi’s Maximum Entropy Tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and then clustered by hand into a smaller number of groups based on their syntactic role.

TBL is an automatic rule learning technique that has been successfully applied to a variety of problems in natural language processing, including part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995), spelling correction (Mangu and Brill, 1997), error correction in automatic speech recognition (Mangu and Padmanabhan, 2001), and named entity detection (Kim and Woodland, 2000).
