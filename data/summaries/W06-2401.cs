We have carried out two main different experiments: one using a language-dependent grammar, implementing transliteration transformations (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002b) and rules related to elements’ order; and another one based on the edition distance (Kukich, 1992) grammar, simulating simple cognates and transliteration transformations, but in a language-independent way.

Two kinds of translations can be distinguished in both systems: direct/simple translations and transliterations (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002b).

For example, Moore’s work (Moore, 2003) uses a bilingual parallel aligned English-French corpora, and applying different statistical techniques, he obtains a French form for each English entity.

For instance, the Chinese-English translation tool presented in ACL 2003 (Chen et al., 2003), or the one published in the ACL 2002 edition for translating entity names from Arabic to English (Al-Onaizan et al., 2002a).

But besides using that data source, we decided also to resort to the web as a complementary data set too, as in (Moore, 2003).
