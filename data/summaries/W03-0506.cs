There are a lot of measures to make the comparisons (Firmin and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999), such as precision, recall, some of which will be used for our evaluation.

A lot of approaches were proposed in text summarization, such as word frequency based method (Luhn, 1958), cue phrase method (Edmundson, 1969), Positionbased methods (Edmundson, 1969; Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997).

Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source (or sources) to produce an abridged version for a particular user (or users) and task (or tasks) (Mani and Maybury, 1999).
E99-1011
In general, methods for text summarization can be classified into two categories (Firmin and B, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999).

In fact, we only found one work about summarization based on annotation (Nagao and Hasida, 1998), but annotations there are defined on a complex set of GDA (Global Document Annotation) tags, which is an XML-based tag set, and allows machines to automatically infer underlying structures of documents by parsing, and authors of WWW files can annotate their documents by those tags, but they are not studied further about how to affect the summarization.

However, past experiments show that keywords method has a lower performance when working with other methods (Edmundson, 1969; Teufel and Moens, 1997), so the main approach we used here is based on key words frequency.
