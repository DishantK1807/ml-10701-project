Our approach is tested on a state-ofthe-art Chinese word segmentation system (Gao et al., 2003, 2004).
P03-1035 P04-1059
The Chinese word segmenter used in this study is described in Gao et al.(2003). The segmenter provides a unified approach to word segmentation and named entity (NE) recognition.
P03-1035
We test this method on Gaoâ€™s Chinese word segmentation system, which achieves a state-of-the-art performance on SIGHAN backoff data sets (Gao et al, 2004).
P04-1059
The method to be presented has been discussed briefly in Gao et al.(2003). This paper presents an extended description with more details and experimental results.
P03-1035
This paper presents our method of creating training data for the statistical Chinese word segmenter proposed in Gao et al.(2003). The segmenter is based on improved source-channel models, which are trained on a large amount of annotated training data.

Wu (2003) also used the training data to tune the segmentation parameters of their MSR-NLP Chinese system.
