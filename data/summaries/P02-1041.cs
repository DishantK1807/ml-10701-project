Also, a wide-coverage statistical parser which produces syntactic dependency structures for English is available for CCG (Clark et al., 2002).

The Î»-calculus has enjoyed many years as the standard semantic encoding for categorial grammars and other grammatical frameworks, but recent work has highlighted its inadequacies for both linguistic and computational concerns of representing natural language semantics (Copestake et al., 1999; Kruijff, 2001).

In future work, we intend to combine techniques for building wide-coverage statistical parsers for CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark et al., 2002) with corpora that have explicitly marked semantic dependency relations (such as the Prague Dependency Treebank and NEGRA) to produce HLDS terms as the parse output.

Finally, the rich temporal ontology underlying models of tense and aspect such as Moens and Steedman (1988) can be captured using the sorting strategy.

Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999; Copestake et al., 2001) is a framework for computational semantics that is designed to simplify the work of algorithms which produce or use semantic representations.
