In this paper, we propose new constraints and defaults based on properties of linguistic expressions, which are useful to estimate omitted subjects in addition to the constraints and defaults proposed by Mori et al.A large number of researchers have come to grip with the method of understanding some types of text including instruction manuals(Abe et al., 1988; Nomura, 1992; Eugenio, 1992).

Mori et al.(Mori and Nakagawa, 1996) show that properties of Japanese conditionals can be used to resolve them.
C96-2132
Nakaiwa et.al.(Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996) also propose the method which is based on semantic and pragmatic constraints.
C96-2137
As for the identifying method available in general discourses, the centering theory(Brennan et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1990) and the property sharing theory(Kameyama, 1988) are proposed.
