A shallow parser (see details in Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi \[1994\]) extracts from the learning corpus elementary syntactic relations such as Subject-Object, Noun-Preposition-Noun, etc.

Plausibility is a measure of the statistical evidence of a detected syntactic relation (Basili, Marziali, and Pazienza 1994; Grishman and Sterling 1994) that depends upon local (i.e., sentence-level) syntactic ambiguity and global corpus evidence.
C94-1074 C94-2119
We applied a pruning method on WordNet (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 1998) to reduce initial ambiguity of contexts.

The smoothing is tuned to be higher in ESLB a and fl are parametric, and can be used to study the evidence provided by ESLA and ESLB 125 Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 D(x, C(PNj)) is a discrimination factor used to determine the saliency (Yarowsky 1992) of a context esli(x, _) for a category C(PNj), i.e., how good a context is at discriminating between C(PNj)and the other categories.

The use of on-line thesauri for context generalization has already been investigated with limited success (Hearst and Schuetze 1993; Brill and Resnik 1994; Resnik 1997; Agirre and Rigau 1996).

2. Description of the U_PN Classification Method In this section we briefly summarize the corpus-based tagging technique for the classification of unknown proper nouns (for more details, see Cucchiarelli, Luzi, and Velardi \[1998\]).

• the SSA shallow syntactic analyzer (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1994) for surface corpus parsing.

This is a reasonable restriction for Proper Nouns, supported by empirical evidence, though we would be more skeptical about the applicability of the one-sense-per-discourse paradigm (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992) to generic words.
