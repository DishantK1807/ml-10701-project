It should be noted that BFP makes use of Centering Rule 2 (Grosz et al., 1995), LRC does not use the transition generated or Rule 2 in steps 4 and 5 since Rule 2's role in pronoun resolution is not yet known (see Kehler 1997 for a critique of its use by BFP).

Tetreault University of Rochester Department of Computer Science Rochester, NY, 14627 tetreaul@cs, rochester, edu Abstract This paper presents a pronoun resolution algorithm that adheres to the constraints and rules of Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) and is an alternative to Brennan et al.'s 1987 algorithm.
J95-2003 P87-1022
In this project, the new algorithm is tested against three leading syntax-based pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs' naive algorithm (1977), S-list (Strube 1998), and BFP.
P98-2204
Many small comparisons of methods have been made, such as by Strube (1998) and Walker (1989), but those usually consist of statistics based on a small handtested corpus.

5. Identify Transition with the Cb and Cf resolved, use the criteria from (Brennan et al., 1987) to assign the transition.

Strube and Hahn (1996) developed a heuristic of ranking transition pairs by cost to evaluate different Cfranking schemes.

The aim of this project is to develop a pronoun resolution algorithm which performs better than the Brennan et al.1987 algorithm 1 as a cognitive model while also performing well empirically.

of Algorithms All four algorithms were run on a 3900 utterance subset of the Penn Treebank annotated corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) provided by Charniak and Ge (1998).

The first is BFP's limitation as a cognitive model since it makes no provision for incremental resolution of pronouns (Kehler 1997).
