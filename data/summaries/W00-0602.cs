Preliminary research in fully-automated techniques for reading comprehension, such as the Deep Read system developed by Hirschman et al.(1999), has included many standard NLP components, such as part-of-speech tagging, coreference/pronoun resolution, proper name finding, and morphological analysis (stemming).

This is comparable to or better than the accuracy (76.5%) of the named entity system that Hirschman et al.(1999) report improves their reading comprehension system.
P99-1042
Hirschman et al.(1999) report initial results in developing a reading comprehension system using a "bag of words" approach, in which the sentences in a passage that are deemed most likely to contain the answer are those with the maximum lexical overlap with the question, without regard for word order within the sentence.

In fact, Hirschman et al.(1999) report that identifying named entities in reading comprehension passages and questions consistently improves the performance of their system, even when the name recognition has an accuracy as low as 76.5%.
