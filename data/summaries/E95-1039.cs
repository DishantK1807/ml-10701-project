The approach described here differs from that of Brown et al.(1992) in that context words both preceding and following the target word are considered (although information about the ordering of the context was not used), and in that Euclidean distance, rather than average mutual information, is used for clustering.

Using an approach similar to that of Brown et al.(1992), each 'target word '1 wi in the corpus was represented as a vector in which each component j is the probability that any one 1 For convenience, target words were taken as the n most frequent words in the corpus, with n often equal to 1000 278 word position in a 'context window' will be occupied by a 'context word' wj, given that the window is centred on word wi.
