With rule-based approaches (Schilder and Habel, 2001; Filatova and Hovy, 2001), the main problems are related to the fact that the porting process requires rewriting from scratch, or adapting to each new language, large numbers of rules, which is costly and time2http://www.clef-campaign.org/ 3http://timex2.mitre.org/tern.html 1 consuming work.

Machine learning approaches (Setzer and Gaizauskas, 2002; Katz and Arosio, 2001), on the other hand, can be extended with little human intervention through the use of language corpora.

Among others, (Moia, 2001; Wilson et al., 2001; Negri and Marseglia, 2004) emphasized the potentialities of such applications for different information retrieval related tasks.
