Considerations for Mapping Out the Inheritance Hierarchy Of the 847 senses described in Litkowski (2002), and used as the starting point for the analysis in TPP, most follow the prototypical form of a prepositional phrase followed by a terminal (dangling) preposition, e.g., for sense 1 of about, on the subject of.

With a firmer basis established in section 4 above for inheritance mechanisms, combined with the digraph analysis described in Litkowski (2002), it seems possible to move toward a representation that is similar to WordNet.

Next, we critically examine claims of the inheritance of preposition meaning as described in Litkowski (2002), including consideration of inheritance mechanisms in FrameNet.

In the digraph analysis in Litkowski (2002), where the prepositions were analyzed as aggregated nodes, the inheritance mechanism provides the basis for splitting nodes based on the specific sense assignments that can now be made.

Most of these remaining senses, in fact, are the ones that gave rise to the definitional cycles and hierarchical analysis of the digraph described in Litkowski (2002).

Gildea & Jurafsky (2002) present a list of 18 that may be viewed as reasonably well-accepted.

In summary, the 13 prepositions (out of 373 identified in Litkowski, 2002) have 210 senses (19 have been added during the course of TPP) out of the original 847 senses.

However, viewed from the perspective of the digraph analysis performed in Litkowski (2002), this inheritance analysis provides confidence that there is an ordering relationship within the preposition sense inventory that can be exploited.

Litkowski (2002) provided a graph-theoretical analysis that arranged prepositions into a hierarchy.
