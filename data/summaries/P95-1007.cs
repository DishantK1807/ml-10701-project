Similarly, Smadja (1993) uses a six content word window to extract significant collocations.

The fourth algorithm, first described in Lauer (1994), differs in one striking manner from the other three.
P94-1052
Another significant difference between the models is the predictions they make about the proportion 1Lauer and Dras (1994) give a formal construction motivating the algorithm given in Lauer (1994).
P94-1052
Resnik (1993) used unambiguous noun compounds from the parsed Wall Stree~ Journal (WSJ) corpus to estimate the association ~alues and analysed a test set of around 160 compounds.
W93-0307
In Lauer (1994), the degree of acceptability is again provided by statistical measures over a corpus.
P94-1052
Schemes While Hindle and Rooth (1993) use a partial parser to acquire training data, such machinery appears unnecessary for noun compounds.
J93-1005
In the test set used here and in that of Resnik (1993), the proportion of leftbranching compounds is 67% and 64% respectively.
W93-0307
The problem is analogous to the prepositional phrase attachment task explored in Hindle and Rooth (1993).
J93-1005
Brent (1993) has proposed the use of simple word patterns for the acquisition of verb subcategorisation information.
J93-2002
Following Lauer and Dras (1994) we can formally write this parameter as Pr(tl ~ t2) where the event tl ~ t2 denotes the modification of a noun in t2 by a noun in tl.
P94-1052
Lauer and Dras (1994) suggest two improvements to the method used above.
P94-1052
The third proposal based on the adjacency model appears in Resnik (1993) and is rather more complex again.
W93-0307
An analogous approach to compounds is used in Lauer (1994) and constitutes one scheme evaluated below.
P94-1052
Lauer and Dras (1994) show that under a dependency model, left-branching compounds should occur twice as often as right-branching compounds (that is twothirds of the time).
P94-1052
Resnik and Hearst (1993) coined the term CONCEPTUAL ASSOCIATION to refer to association values computed between groups of words.
W93-0307
The simplest of these is reported in Pustejovsky et al (1993).
J93-2005
The equations presented above for the dependency model differ from those developed in Lauer and Dras (1994) in one way.
P94-1052
Levi, 1978; Ryder, 1994) and computational linguistics (Finin, 1980; McDonald, 1982; Isabelle, 1984), techniques suitable for broad coverage parsing remain unavailable.
P84-1109
Yarowsky (1992) uses a fixed 100 word window to collect information used for sense disambiguation.
C92-2070
This paper explores the application of corpus statistics (Charniak, 1993) to noun compound parsing (other computational problems are addressed in Arens el al, 1987; Vanderwende, 1993 and Sproat, 1994).
P87-1009
To distinguish nouns from other words, the University of Pennsylvania morphological analyser (described in Karp et al, 1992) was used to generate the set of words that can only be used as nouns (I shall henceforth call this set AZ).
C92-3145
Also, the work reported in Lauer and Dras (1994) uses simplistic estimates of the probability of a word given its thesaurus category.
P94-1052
The first employs a pattern that follows Pustejovsky (1993) in counting the occurrences of subcomponents.
