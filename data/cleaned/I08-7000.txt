2:16	Preface This volume contains the papers presented at the sixth workshop on Asian Language Resources, held on 11 12 January 2008 in conjunction with the third International Joint Conference on Natural Langauge Processing (IJCNLP 2008).

4:16	Previous concerted efforts on construction of language resources, particularly in the US and European countries, have laid a solid foundation for the pioneering NLP researches in these two communities.
5:16	In comparison, the availability and accessibility of many Asian language resources are still very limited except for a few languages.
6:16	Moreover, there is a greater diversity in Asian languages with respect to character sets, grammatical properties and the cultural background.
7:16	Motivated by such a context, we have organised a series of workshops on Asian language resources since 2001.
8:16	This workshop series has contributed to the activation of the NLP research in Asia particularly of building and utilising corpora of various types and languages.
9:16	In this sixth workshop, we had 31 submissions encompassing 13 languages.
10:16	The paper selection was highly competitive compared with the last ve workshops.
11:16	The program committee selected 10 regular papers, 3 short papers and 8 resource reports for presentation at the workshop.
12:16	The workshop is comprised of two parts, technical sessions and a session devoted to reporting activities related to language resources in several languages.
13:16	Following the resource report session, we have an open discussion on the collaboration in building, standardising and exchanging language resources in Asia.
14:16	We hope this workshop further accelerates the already thriving NLP research in Asia.
