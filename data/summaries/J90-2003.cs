However, the solution (as far as scoping goes) is by now standard, and has been successfully implemented in a number of well-known systems (e.g., Pereira 1983; Lesmo 1985; Grosz et al.1986; Alshawi et al.1989); the methodology can originally be traced back to Woods (1978).
P85-1023
We consequently recast it in a form more suitable for implementation purposes, which draws its inspiration from the well-known treatment of scoping phenomena originally described in Woods et al.(1972); later elaborations and refinements have been implemented in a number of systems, notably CHAT-80 (Pereira 1983), TEAM (Grosz et al.1986), and CLE (Moran 1988; Alshawi et al.1989). We will continue to use this framework in Section 4, where we consider clausal comparatives, and now describe it in more detail.
P88-1005
Like Bresnan and Pinkham, but unlike Friedmann (1989), we will also regard the comparative clause as in general modifying the comparative head in the main clause, as opposed to treating the two clauses as parallel; we discuss further in Section 4 the reasons behind this decision.
P89-1020
So far, there has been a surprisingly small amount of work done in computational frameworks: the only major attempts known to us that integrate syntactic and semantic processing are those reported in Ballard (1988) and Friedmann (1989).
P88-1006 P89-1020
We speculate that one may be able to do this in a framework like that described in Pereira and Pollack (1988), which allows conditional interpretation.
P88-1010
A solution along these lines, which builds on previously reported work (Banks 1986; Banks and Rayner 1987; Rayner and Banks 1988), is described in Section 3.

SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC ASSUMPTIONS The basic scheme, or some not too distant relative, is the one used in many large-scale implemented systems; as examples, we can quote TEAM (Grosz et al.1987), PUNDIT (Dahl et al.1987), TACITUS (Hobbs et al.1988), MODL (McCord 1987), CLE (Alshawi et al.1989), and SNACK-85 (Rayner and Banks 1986).
P88-1012
In a computational treatment, this means that the deletion rule has to be "reversed," so as to reconstruct the deleted material from the phrasal remnant: this is the method used in Sager (1981) and Friedmann (1989).

A relatively simp\]\[e example is 12a), which we quoted in Rayner and Banks (1988); the sentence is also discussed at length by Friedmann.
P88-1007
Earlier versions of several of the results herein have already been published in Banks (1986), Rayner and Banks (1986), Banks and Rayner (1987), and Rayner and Banks (1988a; 1988b).
P88-1007
We will ignore complex comparative operators ("more than twice as much as"; "at least two inches longer than three times as long as"); these are well dealt with in Ballard (1988), and in any case do not seem to pose fundamental difficulties.
