What Webber et al.(2003) call anaphoric discourse connectives (some, but not all, discourse adverbials, such as “otherwise”, “instead”, “furthermore”, etc).

The motivation for such an approach stems from work by Webber and Joshi (1998), Webber et al.(1999a), Webber et al.(2000) which integrates sentence level structures with discourse level structure (using tree-adjoining grammars for both cases, LTAG and DLTAG, respectively).1 This allows structural composition and its associated semantic composition at the sentence level to be smoothly carried over to the discourse level, a goal also shared by Gardent (1997), Schilder (1997) and Polanyi and van den Berg (1996), among others.2 Discourse connectives and their arguments can be successfully annotated with high reliability (cf.

background The annotation project presented in this paper builds on basic ideas presented in Webber and Joshi (1998), Webber et al.(1999b) and Webber et al.(2003) – that connectives are discourse-level predicates which project predicate-argument structure on a par with verbs at the sentence level.

The Penn TreeBank (PTB) is an example of such a resource with worldwide impact on natural language processing (Marcus et al., 1993).

Webber and Joshi (1998) propose a treeadjoining grammar for discourse (DLTAG) in which compositional aspects of discourse meaning are formally defined, thus teasing apart compositional from noncompositional layers of meaning.

analysis To test the reliability of the annotation, we first considered the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) which is used extensively in empirical studies of discourse (Carletta, 1996).

The annotators are also informed that in some cases, an argument of a connective must be derived from the selected textual span (Webber et al., 1999a; Webber et al., 2003).
