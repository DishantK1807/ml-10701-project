Entropy Training For these experiments we use the Maximum Entropy formulation (Della Pietra et al., 1995) and model the distribution (Ittycheriah, 2001b), a12a14a13a16a15a18a17a19a21a20a23a22a25a24a27a26a29a28a31a30a21a12a14a13a16a15a18a17a32a18a20a33a19a21a20a34a22a25a24a35a12a14a13a36a32a21a17a19a21a20a33a22a25a24 (1) The patterns derived above are used as features to model the distribution a37a39a38a41a40a43a42a44a46a45a48a47a49a45a48a50a52a51, which predicts the “correctness” of the configuration of the question, a47, the predicted answer tag, a44, and the answer candidate, a50 . The training data for the algorithm consists of TREC-8, TREC-9, and a subset of the KM questions which have been judged to have answers in the TREC corpus5.

Several QA systems have investigated the use of text patterns for QA (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001), (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002), (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).
P02-1006
This method was first described in Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).

IBM’s Statistical QA (Ittycheriah et al., 2001a) system uses a probabilistic model trainable from Question-Answer sentence pairs.
