As a clustering technique we exploit Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), following the methodology described in (Gliozzo et al., 2005b).

In general, the strategy adopted to model syntagmatic relations is to provide bigrams and trigrams of collocated words as features to describe local contexts (Yarowsky, 1994), and each word is regarded as a different instance to classify.
P94-1013
Hence modeling syntagmatic relations is crucial for a wide variety of NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (Gliozzo etal., 2005a) and WordSenseDisambiguation (WSD) (Strapparava et al., 2004).

Semantic Domains are groups of strongly paradigmatically related words, and can be acquired automatically from corpora in a totally unsupervised way (Gliozzo, 2005).

ing a lexical coherence assumption (Gliozzo, 2005).

Indeed, we followed this approach in the participation to Senseval-3 competition, reaching the state-of-theart in many lexical-sample tasks (Strapparava et al., 2004).

As baseline, we report the result of a standard approach consisting on explicit bigrams and trigrams of words and PoS tags around the words to be disambiguated (Yarowsky, 1994).
