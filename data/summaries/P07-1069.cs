3For decoding, αloc is averaged over the training iterations as in Collins and Roark (2004).

Similar models have been successfully applied in the past to other tasks including parsing (Collins and Roark, 2004), chunking (Daum´e and Marcu, 2005), and machine translation (Cowan et al., 2006).

Finally, our work is also related to research on title generation (Banko et al., 2000; Jin and Hauptmann, 2001; Dorr et al., 2003).

Experimental Design: Comparison with reference tables-of-contents Reference based evaluation is commonly used to assess the quality of machine-generated headlines (Wang et al., 2005).

This linear model is learned using a variant of the incremental perceptron algorithm (Collins and Roark, 2004; Daum´e and Marcu, 2005).

The first task can be addressed by using the hierarchical structure readily available in the text (e.g., chapters, sections and subsections) or by employing existing topic segmentation algorithms (Hearst, 1994).
P94-1002
This division can either be automatically computed using one of the many available text segmentation algorithms (Hearst, 1994), or it can be based on demarcations already present in the input (e.g., paragraph markers).
P94-1002
For instance, Teufel and Moens (2002) summarize scientific articles by selecting rhetorical elements that are commonly present in scientific abstracts.
J02-4002
The second baseline is based on the noisy-channel generative (flat generative, FG) model proposed by Banko et al., (2000).
