The third estimates the equivalence based on word alignment composed using templates or translation probabilities derived from a set of parallel text (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Brockett and Dolan, 2005).

On this issue, we speculate that one of the feasible approach to realize a robust system is to divide phenomena into compositional and non-compositional (idiosyncratic) ones 1, and separately develop resources to handle them as described in (Fujita and Inui, 2005).

Kaji et al.(2002) introduced amethod ofcase frame alignment in paraphrase generation.

Though, at least, roles of participants in the event have to be preserved by some means, such as the way presented in (Pantel et al., 2007).

According to the work of (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004; Torisawa, 2006), predicate phrase (simple sentence) is a reasonable unit because it approximately corresponds to the meaning of single event.

According to an empirical experiment in (Fujita et al., 2005), statistical language models do not contribute to calculating semantic equivalence, but to filtering out anomalies.

Several methods for paraphrasing Japanese predicate phrases have been proposed (Kondo et al., 1999; Kondo et al., 2001; Kaji et al., 2002; Fujita et al., 2005).

Fujita et al.(2005) employed a semantic representation of verb to realize the alignment of the role of participants governed by the source and target verbs.

The fourth espouses the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1968): given two words are likely to be equivalent if distributions of their surrounding words are similar (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Weeds et al., 2005).
