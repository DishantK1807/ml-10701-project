INTRODUCTION Word associations have been studied for some time in the fields of psycholinguistics (by testing human subjects on words), linguistics (where meaning is often based on how words co-occur with each other), and more recently, by researchers in natural language processing (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle and Rooth, 1990; Dagan, 1990; McDonald et al., 1990; Wilks et al., 1990) using statistical measures to identify sets of associated words for use in various natural language processing tasks.
