Our method is similar to (Hindle, 1990), (Lin, 1998), and (Gasperin, 2001) in the use of dependency relationships as the word features.
P90-1034 P98-2127
The words we want to aggregate for text analysis are not rigorous synonyms, but the “role” is the same, so we have to consider the syntactic relation based on the assumptions that words with the same role tend to modify or be modified by similar words (Hindle, 1990; Strzalkowski, 1992).

Wu (Wu, 2003) shows one approach to collect synonymous collocation by using translation information.

Window-based techniques consider an arbitrary number of words around the given 2 This shallow syntactic parser is called CCAT based on the TEXTRACT architecture (Neff, 2003) developed at IBM Watson Research Center.

Another approach used the words’ distribution to cluster the words (Pereira, 1993), and Inoue (Inoue, 1991) also used the word distributional information in the Japanese-English word pairs to resolve the polysemous word problem.
