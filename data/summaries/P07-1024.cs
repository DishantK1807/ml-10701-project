an adjacency feature in Collins (1999), more explicit length features in McDonald et al.(2005) and Eisner and Smith (2005)) and thus learn to favor parses with shorter dependencies.

McDonald et al.(2005) report that even in Czech, commonly viewed as a non-projective language, fewer than 2% of dependencies violate the projectivity constraint.

This setting is reminiscent of the problem of optimizing feature weights for reranking of candidate machine translation outputs, and we employ an optimization technique similar to that used by Och (2003) for machine translation.
