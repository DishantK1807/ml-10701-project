In a previous attempt to define predicate-argument structure, Semeval, the effort was abandoned because so many constructs would require detailed attention and resolution, and because most information-extraction systems did not generate full predicate-argument structures (most likely because the task did not require it) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996).
