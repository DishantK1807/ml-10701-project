Attempts to reduce or incorporate variability in summarization evaluation will and should continue, e.g., by use of “factoids” (van Halteren and Teufel, 2003) or “summarization content units” (Passonneau and Nenkova, 2004) as smaller units for generating model summaries.

SEE allowed the judges to step through predefined units of the model summary (elementary discourse units/EDUs) (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) and for each unit of that summary, mark the sentences in the peer summary that expressed [all(4), most(3), some(2), hardly any(1) or none(0)] of the content in the current model summary unit.

This large difference in scores is coming solely from the model difference since judgment is being made by the same person (although some self-inconsistency is involved (Lin and Hovy, 2002)).
