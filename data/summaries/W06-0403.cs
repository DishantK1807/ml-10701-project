Several extensions of CDG have then been proposed (Heinecke et al., 1998; Duchier, 1999; Foth et al., 2004).
P98-1086
Menzel and colleagues (Heinecke et al., 1998; Foth et al., 2004) developed a weighted (or “graded”) version of CDG.

Maruyama’s Constraint Dependency Grammar (CDG) (Maruyama, 1990) is the first formalism to introduce the parsing process as a CSP solver.
P90-1005
With the eXtended Dependency Grammar (XDG) (Debusmann et al., 2004) the notion of dependency tree is further extended to “multi-dimensional” dependency graph, where each dimension (e.g.

Although a constraint-oriented (CO) paradigm such as Property Grammars (Blache, 2001) theoretically does not rely on any preferred relations, we observe that the parsing strategies implemented so far (Morawietz and Blache, 2002; Balfourier et al., 2002; Dahl and Blache, 2004; VanRullen, 2005) do not account for such a feature of the formalism.

Meanwhile, though different parsing strategies have been proposed for PG (Morawietz and Blache, 2002; Balfourier et al., 2002; Dahl and Blache, 2004; VanRullen, 2005), none of these strategies implements the possibility afforded by the theory to rely on any type of constraint in order to license a (possibly ill-formed) constituent.
