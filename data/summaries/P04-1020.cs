Interestingly, existing machine learning approaches to coreference resolution have performed reasonably well without anaphoricity determination (e.g., Soon et al.(2001), Ng and Cardie (2002b), Strube and MÂ¨uller (2003), Yang et al.(2003)). Nevertheless, there is empirical evidence that resolution systems might further be improved with anaphoricity information.

One common approach involves the design of heuristic rules to identify specific types of (non-)anaphoric NPs such as pleonastic pronouns (e.g., Paice and Husk (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994), Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), Denber (1998)) and definite descriptions (e.g., Vieira and Poesio (2000)).

Interestingly, most existing work employs constraintbased, locally-optimized methods (e.g., Mitkov et al.(2002) and Ng and Cardie (2002a)), leaving the remaining three possibilities largely unexplored.

Locally-Optimized Approach In this approach, the anaphoricity model is simply a classifier that is trained and optimized independently of the coreference system (e.g., Evans (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002a)).

Results using RIPPER and MaxEnt as the underlying learners are shown in rows 1 and 2 of Table 2 where performance is reported in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure using the model-theoretic MUC scoring program (Vilain et al., 1995).

More recently, the problem has been tackled using unsupervised (e.g., Bean and Riloff (1999)) and supervised (e.g., Evans (2001), Ng and Cardie (2002a)) approaches.

(In our experiments, we use maximum entropy classification (MaxEnt) (Berger et al., 1996) to train this probability model).

For instance, our coreference system mistakenly identifies an antecedent for many non-anaphoric common nouns in the absence of anaphoricity information (Ng and Cardie, 2002a).

Space limitations preclude a description of these features; see Ng and Cardie (2002a) for details.
C02-1139 P02-1014
In all of our experiments, we use our learning-based coreference system (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).
