While we have observed reasonable results with both G 2 and Fisher's exact test, we have not yet discussed how these results compare to the results that can be obtained with a technique commonly used in corpus linguistics based on the mutual information (MI) measure (Church and Hanks 1990): I(x,y) --log 2 P(x,y) (4) P(x)P(y) In (4), y is the seed term and x a potential target word.

In Smadja's collocation algorithm Xtract, the lowest-frequency words are effectively discarded as well (Smadja 1993).

org/pubs/citations/ j ournals/toms/1986-12-2/p154-meht a/ Mutual Information Given the definition of Mutual Information (Church and Hanks 1990), I(x,y) = log 2 P(x,y) P(x)P(y)" we consider the distribution of a window word according to the contingency table (a) in Table 4.

Dunning (1993) has called attention to the log-likelihood ratio, G 2, as appropriate for the analysis of such contingency tables, especially when such contingency tables concern very low frequency words.

Church and Hanks (1990) use mutual information to identify collocations, a method they claim is reasonably effective for words with a frequency of not less than five.
