The pioneering work in this area was that of Hindle and Rooth (1993).

From a semantic point of view, we need to determine whether the or in chronic diseases or disabilities really means or or is used as an and (Agarwal and Boggess, 1992).

(Collins’ parser (Collins, 1997) always predicts a flat NP for such configurations).

Banko and Brill (2001) show that even using a very simple algorithm, the results continue to improve log-linearly with more training data, even out to a billion words.

Kurohashi and Nagao (1992) work on the same problem for Japanese.

Following Kurohashi and Nagao (1992), Resnik makes decisions based on similarity of form (i.e., number agreement: P=53%, R=90.6%), similarity of meaning (P=66%, R=71.2%) and conceptual association Example Predicts P(%) R(%) (buy) and sell orders NO ellipsis 33.33 1.40 buy (and sell orders) NO ellipsis 70.00 4.67 buy: and sell orders NO ellipsis 0.00 0.00 buy; and sell orders NO ellipsis 66.67 2.80 buy.

Work Coordination ambiguity is under-explored, despite being one of the three major sources of structural ambiguity (together with prepositional phrase attachment and noun compound bracketing), and belonging to the class of ambiguities for which the number of analyses is the number of binary trees over the corresponding nodes (Church and Patil, 1982), and despite the fact that conjunctions are among the most frequent words.

Goldberg (1999) resolves the attachment of ambiguous coordinate phrases of the kind n1 p n2 c n3, e.g., box/n1 of/p chocolates/n2 and/c roses/n3.
P99-1081
In a related strand of work, Lapata and Keller (2004) show that computing n-gram statistics over very large corpora yields results that are competitive with if not better than the best supervised and knowledge-based approaches on a wide range of NLP tasks.

vised approach on this collection (Pantel and Lin, 2000).

Web frequencies were reliable enough and did not need smoothing for (i), but for (ii), smoothing using the technique described in Hindle and Rooth (1993) led to better recall.

More recently, Banko and Brill (2001) have advocated for the creative use of very large text collections as an alternative to sophisticated algorithms and hand-built resources.

Pattern (5) is motivated by the observation that if n1 is a pronoun, this suggests a verb attachment (Hindle and Rooth, 1993).

Brill and Resnik (1994) used the supervised transformation-based learning method and lexical and conceptual classes derived from WordNet, achieving 82% precision on 500 randomly selected examples.
C94-2195
Following Ratnaparkhi (1998), we predict a noun attachment if the preposition is of (a very reliable heuristic).
P98-2177
Agarwal and Boggess (1992) focus on the identification of the conjuncts of coordinate conjunctions.
P92-1003
In recent work (Nakov and Hearst, 2005) we showed that a variation of the techniques, when applied to the problem of noun compound bracketing, produces higher accuracy than Lapata and Keller (2004) and the best supervised results.
N04-1016 W05-0603
Pantel and Lin (2000) describe an unsupervised method that uses a collocation database, a thesaurus, a dependency parser, and a large corpus (125M words), achieving 84.3% precision on the Ratnaparkhi test set.
P00-1014
For the evaluation, we used the test part (3,097 examples) of the benchmark dataset by Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994). We used all 3,097 test examples in order to make our results directly comparable.

A test for statistical significance reveals that our results are as strong as those of the leading unsuper3Ratnaparkhi (1998) notes that the test set contains errors, but does not correct them.
P98-2177
Stetina and Makoto (1997) use a supervised method with a decision tree and WordNet classes to achieve 88.1% precision on the same test set.

Using an adaptation of the algorithm proposed by Ratnaparkhi (1998) for PP-attachment, she achieves P=72% (baseline P=64%), R=100.00%.
P98-2177
In this paper we describe two techniques – surface features and paraphrases – that push the ideas of Banko and Brill (2001) and Lapata and Keller (2004) farther, enabling the use of statistics gathered from very large corpora in an unsupervised manner.
N04-1016 P01-1005
More recently, Ratnaparkhi (1998) developed an unsupervised method that collects statistics from text annotated with part-of-speech tags and morphological base forms.

Ratnaparkhi et al.(1994) created a benchmark dataset of 27,937 quadruples (v,n1,p,n2), extracted from the Wall Street Journal.

Collins and Brooks (1995) used a supervised back-off model to achieve 84.5% precision on the Ratnaparkhi test set.
