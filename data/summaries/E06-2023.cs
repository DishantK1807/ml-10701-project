The method proposed at [Creutz 2002; 2004] is a derivation of MDL algorithm which we use as the basis of our approach.

[Goldsmith 2001] concentrates on stem+suffixlanguages, in particular Indo-European languages, and produces output that would match as closely as possible with the analysis given by a human morphologist.

The utilization of morphemes as basic representational units in a statistical language model instead of words seems a promising course [Creutz, 2004].

[Schone and Jurafsky 2000] presents an unsupervised model in which knowledge-free distributional cues are combined orthography-based with information automatically extracted from semantic word cooccurrence patterns in the input corpus.

[Monson 2004] presents a framework for unsupervised induction of natural language morphology, wherein candidate suffixes are grouped into candidate inflection classes, which are then placed in a lattice structure.

[Baroni, et al.2002] proposes an algorithm that takes an unannotated corpus as its input, and a ranked list of probable returning related pairs as its output.
