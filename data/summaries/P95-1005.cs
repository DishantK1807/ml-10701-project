We challenge an assumption underlying the best known theories of discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Scha and Polanyi 1988; Polanyi 1988; Mann and Thompson 1986), namely that discourse has a recursive, tree-like structure.
C88-2120 J86-3001
We develop our theory of discourse structure in the spirit of (Grosz and Sidner 1986) which has played an influential role in the analysis of discourse entity saliency and in the development of dialogue processing systems.
J86-3001
Grosz and Sider (1986), and more recently Lochbaum (1994), do not formally constrain their intentional structure to a strict tree structure, but they effectively impose this limitation in cases where an anaphoric link must be made between an expression inside of the current discourse segment and an entity evoked in a different 1Attentional State is the representation which is used for computing which discourse entities are most salient.
J86-3001
From a theoretical standpoint, we will demonstrate that theories which postulate a strict tree structure of discourse (henceforth, Tree Structure Theory, or TST) on either the intentional level or the attentional level (Grosz and Sidner 1986) are not totally adequate for covering spontaneous dialogues, particularly negotiation dialogues which are composed of multiple threads.
