They are used in information retrieval and question answering (Kiyota et al., 2002; Dragomia et al., 2001) to bridge the expression gap between the query space and the document space.

In addition, some studies investigate the extraction of synonymous words and/or patterns from bilingual corpora (Barzilay and Mckeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002).

Equation (2) is rewritten as: )|()|()|( )|()|()|()|( 2211 21 ce colecolcolcolcol rrpcepcep crpcepcepcep = = (3) It is equal to a word translation model if we take the relation type in the collocations as an element like a word, which is similar to Model 1 in (Brown et al., 1993).

Translation Probability Estimation Many methods are used to estimate word translation probabilities from unparallel or parallel bilingual corpora (Koehn and Knight, 2000; Brown et al., 1993).

However, a number of studies investigate the extraction of synonymous words from monolingual corpora (Carolyn et al., 1992; Grefenstatte, 1994; Lin, 1998; Gasperin et al., 2001).

The similarity of the words is calculated with the same method as described in (Lin, 1998), which is rewritten in Equation (13).

with Methods using Bilingual Corpora Barzilay and Mckeown (2001), and Shimohata and Sumita (2002) used a bilingual corpus to extract synonymous expressions.
