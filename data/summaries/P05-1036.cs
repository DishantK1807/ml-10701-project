The main difference between their model and ours is that instead of using the rather ad-hoc K&M language model, we substitute the syntax-based language model described in (Charniak, 2001).
P01-1017
We use a program to label syntactic arguments with the roles they are playing (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000), and the rules for complement/adjunct distinction given by (Collins, 1997) to never allow deletion of the complement.
A00-2031 P97-1003
Others have performed the sentence compression task using syntactic approaches to this problem (Mani et al., 1999) (Zajic et al., 2004), but we focus exclusively on the K&M formulation.
P99-1072
The K&M model creates a packed parse forest of all possible compressions that are grammatical with respect to the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).
