This framework, where the “semantic load” is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to lexical categories not typically thought to bear semantic content, is essentially the model advocated by Pustejovsky (1991a), among many others.

There is a general consensus among theoretical linguists that the proper representation of verbal argument structure is event structure—representations grounded in a theory of events that decompose semantic roles in terms of primitive predicates representing concepts such as causality and inchoativity (Dowty, 1979; Jackendoff, 1983; Pustejovsky, 1991b; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 1998).

This approach has its roots in Fillmore’s Case Grammar (1968), and serves as the foundation for two current large-scale semantic annotation projects: FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002).

Due to advances in statistical syntactic parsing techniques (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2001), attention has recently shifted towards the harder question of analyzing the meaning of natural language sentences.
