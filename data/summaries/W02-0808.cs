We chose nouns that occur a minimum of 10 times in the corpus, have no undetermined translations and at least five different translations in the six nonEnglish languages, and have the log likelihood score of at least 18; that is: LL(T T, T S ) = Â = 2 1 ij n* j * j*i ij n log ≥ 18 where n ij stands for the number of times T T and T S have been seen together in aligned sentences, n i* and n *j stand for the number occurrences of T T and T S, respectively, and n ** represents the total 4 We computed raw percentages only; common measures of annotator agreement such as the Kappa statistic (Carletta, 1996) proved to be inappropriate for our two-category (“yesno”) classification scheme.

Resnik and Yarowsky (1997) suggest that for the purposes of WSD, the different senses of a word could be determined by considering only sense distinctions that are lexicalized cross-linguistically.

Several studies have used parallel texts for WSD (e.g., Gale et al., 1993; Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994) as well as to define semantic properties of and relations among lexemes (Dyvik, 1998).

percentages are similar to those reported in earlier work; for example, Ng et al.(1999) achieved a raw percentage score of 58% agreement among annotators tagging nouns with WordNet 1.6 senses.
