On the other hand, Cao et al.(2002) used the Web to examine if the arbitrary combination of translations of a noun phrase was statistically important.

Extraction The Chi-square Method: A number of statistical measures have been proposed for estimating term association based on co-occurrence analysis, including mutual information, DICE coefficient, chi-square test, and log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999).

Melamed (2000) proposed statistical translation models to improve the techniques of word alignment by taking advantage of preexisting knowledge, which was more effective than a knowledge-free model.

A lot of effort has been spent on constructing translation lexicons from domain-specific corpora in an automatic way (Melamed, 2000; Smadja et al., 1996; Kupiec, 1993).

Fung et al.(1998) also proposed a similar approach that used a vector-space model and took a bilingual lexicon (called seed words) as a feature set to estimate the similarity between a word and its translation candidates.

To reduce such errors and enhance the reliability of the estimation, a competitive linking algorithm, which is extended from Melamed’s work (Melamed, 2000), is developed to determine the most probable translations.

Rapp (1999) utilized non-parallel corpora based on the assumption that the contexts of a term should be similar to the contexts of its translation in any language pairs.

Compilation of translation lexicons is a crucial process for machine translation (MT) (Brown et al., 1990) and cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems (Nie et al., 1999).

Borin (2000) used various sources to improve the alignment of word translation and proposed the pivot alignment, which combined direct translation and indirect translation via a third language.

Resnik (1999) addressed the issue of language identification for finding Web pages in the languages of interest.

A typical case is the indirect association problem (Melamed, 2000), as shown in Figure 2 in which we want to translate the term s1 (s=s1).

Smadja et al.(1996) proposed a statistical association measure of the Dice coefficient to deal with the problem of collocation translation.

Kupiec (1993) attempted to find noun phrase correspondences in parallel corpora using part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase recognition methods.

Most of them (Kilgarriff et al., 2003) tried to automatically collect parallel texts of different language versions (e.g.

The Context-Vector Method: The basic idea of this method is that the term s’s translation equivalents may share common contextual terms with s in the search-result pages, similar to Rapp (1999).

Web-based translation: Collecting parallel texts of different language versions from the Web has recently received much attention (Kilgarriff et al., 2003).
