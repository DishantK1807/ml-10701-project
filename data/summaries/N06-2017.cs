In our experiments we made use of the four metrics employed in Karamanis et al.(2004): • The baseline metric M.NOCB which simply prefers the ordering with the fewest NOCBs.

This methodology is very similar to the way Barzilay and Lapata (2005) evaluate automatically another model of coherence called the entity grid using a larger collection of 200 articles from the North American News Corpus (NEWS) and 200 accident narratives from the National Transportation Safety Board database (ACCS).

Karamanis et al.(2004) introduce a measure called the classi cation rate which estimates this penalty as the weighted sum of the percentage of alternative orderings that score equally to or better than the GSO.4 When comparing several metrics with each other, the one with the lowest classi cation rate is the most appropriate for sentence ordering.

• Transitions (Brennan et al., 1987) and NOCBs, that is, cases in which two subsequent CF lists do not have any referent in common.

Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) has been an in uential framework for modelling entity coherence in computational linguistics in the last two decades.

c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Evaluating Centering for Sentence Ordering in Two New Domains Nikiforos Karamanis Natural Language and Information Processing Group Computer Laboratory University of Cambridge Nikiforos.Karamanis@cl.cam.ac.uk Abstract This paper builds on recent research investigating sentence ordering in text production by evaluating the Centering-based metrics of coherence employed by Karamanis et al.(2004) using the data of Barzilay and Lapata (2005).

The members of the CF list are ranked according to their grammatical role (Brennan et al., 1987) and their position in the grid.3 The derived sequence of CF lists can then be used to compute other important Centering concepts: • The CB, i.e. the referent that links the current CF list with the previous one such as microsoft in (b).

Karamanis et al.(2004) were the rst to evaluate Centering-based metrics of coherence for ordering clauses in a subset of the GNOME corpus (Poesio et al., 2004) consisting of 20 artefact descriptions.

The same data and similar methods were used by Barzilay and Lee (2004) to compare their probabilistic approach for ordering sentences with that of Lapata (2003).
