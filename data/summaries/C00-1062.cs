\Â¥e also \]lave gtll exl)lanation for another observation of Wedekind (1995).
E95-1007
Our proof depends on the assmnl~tion that the input \],' is flllly specified so that the set of i)ossible instantiations ix finite, l)ymetman (1991), van Noord (1993), and Wedekind (1999) have shown that it ix ill generM undecidable whether or not there are any strings associated with an f-structure that has units ill addition to those in the input.
J99-2006
Our proof dei)ends on the fact that the int)ut F--and hence the range of q5-is fully specified; Dymetman (1991), van Noord (1993), and Wedekind (1.999) have shown that the general probleln of generating froln an underspecified input is unsolvable.
