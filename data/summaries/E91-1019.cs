domain (Catach 1984; Danlos et al.1986; Koskenniemi 1983; Laporte 1988; Ritchle et al.1987, Tufts 1989; V6ronls 1988) are based on the availability of local rules whose combination, either through direct interpretation or by being compiled, form the target transducer.

It may be appropriate, for example in morphology, to use an auxiliary lexicon (Ritchle et al.1987; Ritchie 1989) which allows to discard certain translation results.

(Reape and Thompson 1988) also describes an algorithm for computing the resulting automaton.

Now, it has been shown elsewhere (Reape and Thompson 1988) that the transducer that would result is also describable in the formalism of finite state automata and that its number of states has a upper bound which is the square of the number of states in the base automaton.

Indeed, this method, which was successfully applied to morphologically rich natural languages (Koskenniemi 1983), Is based upon a two-level rule formalism for which there exist a way to compile them into the language of finite state automata (FSA) (Ritchie 1989).
