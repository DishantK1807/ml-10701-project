<context>age Specific Issues In this section we describe a specific issue with Verbs that was brought up during the annotation and its resolution that required modification of the earlier version of IL-POSTS (Baskaran, 2008) In Bangla, a combination of a non-finite followed by a finite verb can have several different morphosyntactic functions. For example, “ভ ে র ে ভ েে ে ” [mere phello] „kill+non-finite throw+finite‟ c</context>

CLAWS2 tagset (Sartoni, 1987) marked an important change in the structure of POS tagsets from a flat structure with unitary tags to a hierarchical structure that allowed for decomposable tags.

<context>ets (including UPenn, Brown, C5 and C7) and the existing IL tagsets (IIIT-H, AU-KBC) fall under this type. The categories in a hierarchical, on the other hand, are structured relative to one another (Hardie, 2004). This implies that instead of having a large number of independent categories, a hierarchical tagset contains a small number of categories at the top level, each of which has a number of sub-categor</context>

The publication of EAGLES recommendations for morphosyntactic annotation of corpora (Leech and Wilson, 1996) was an earliest attempt to develop a common tagset guideline for several European languages. The objective of EAGLES1 was to standardise the tagsets used in different projects and/or different langu</context>
<context>nd Wilson (1999) put forth a strong argument for the need to standardize POS tagset for reusability of annotated corpora and interoperability across corpora in different languages. EAGLES guidelines (Leech and Wilson, 1996) were a result of such an initiative to create standards that are common across languages that share morphosyntactic features. Several POS tagsets have been designed by a number of research groups wo</context>

Design Methodology The design methodology of IL-POSTS is based on the EAGLES guidelines (Leech and Wilson, 1996). At the initial stages we analysed the suitability of adapting EAGLES guidelines for ILs with minor modifications as needed. This was primarily done to see whether a framework defined for a differen</context>
