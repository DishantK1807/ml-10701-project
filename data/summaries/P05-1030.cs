However, in contrast to PGH, the overall approach is a different one: instead of explaining causes of CRs within a theoretic-semantic model (as the three different readings of Ginzburg and Cooper (2001) do), they infer the interpretation of the CR from the context.

S is proposing activity α L is considering proposal α Intention S is signalling that p L is recognizing that p Signal S is presenting signal σ L is identifying signal σ Channel S is executing behavior β L is attending to behavior β Table 1: Four levels of grounding Schlangen, 2004).

As noted by (Rodriguez and Schlangen, 2004), PGH provide no feature to describe the extent to which an RF repeats the problematic utterance.

and Schlangen (R&S) Rodriguez and Schlangen (2004) devised a multidimensional classification scheme where form and 1Alternative questions would be interpreted as asking a polar question with an exclusive reading.

They are partial declaratives with rising boundary tone, that either reformulate (7.1%) the problematic utterance, repeat 4Declarative questions cover “all cases of non-interrogative word-order, i.e., both declarative sentences and fragments” (Rodriguez and Schlangen, 2004).

Section 4 draws general conclusions for generating CRs by comparing our results to those of (Purver et al., 2003) and (Rodriguez and Schlangen, 2004).

Section 3 describes the results we obtained by applying the classification scheme of Rodriguez and Schlangen (2004) to the Communicator Corpus (Bennett and Rudnicky, 2002).

CRs may take the three different readings as defined by Ginzburg and Cooper (2001), as well as a fourth reading which indicates a correction.
