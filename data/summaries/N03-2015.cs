For identifying the boundary between roots and suffixes, the idea of hubs is essentially the same as Goldsmith’s (2001) signatures or the variations between Gaussier’s (1999) p-similarity words.

Schone & Jurafsky, 2000) present a method for determining whether singed can be split into sing and ed based on whether singed and sing appear in the same contexts.

That technique is also used as the first step in Goldsmith’s (2001) search for signatures.

Work Most previous work in unsupervised learning of morphology has focused on learning the division between roots and suffixes (e.g., Sproat, 1992; Gaussier, 1999; Déjean, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001).

Goldsmith (2001) presents a well-developed and robust version of this class and has made his system, Linguistica, freely available (Goldsmith, 2002).

Many researchers, including Schone and Jurafsky (2000), Harris (1958), and Déjean (1998), suggest looking for nodes with high branching (out-degree) or a large number of continuations.
