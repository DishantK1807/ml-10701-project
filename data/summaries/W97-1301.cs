The implementation work has been supported by an analysis of definite description use in corpora of written language (Poesio and Vieira, 1997).

Vieira and Teufel (1997) analyzed the corpus to identify the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved using WordNet, those for which we could use heuristics, and those that couldn't be interpreted at the moment.

DDs and WordNet We implemented a WordNet interface that reports a possible semantic link between two nouns when one 4One problem with bridging references is that they are often related to more than one antecedent in the discourse (Poesio and Vieira, 1997).

A mechanism for focus tracking (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) or a clustering algorithm should be applied first in order to minimise the costs.

Our previous heuristics for treatment of premodifiers in anaphoric resolution handled the first two examples correctly (Vieira and Poesio, 1997): as they present different pre-modifiers we did not treat them as anaphoric in the first version of our system.
P97-1072
We tested, in particular, whether WordNet encoded a semantic link between the 38 syn/hyp/mer relations in our corpus (just described) plus other 32 relations extracted from a second corpus study (Poesio and Vieira, 1997).
P97-1072
A first prototype with these capabilities (Vieira and Poesio, 1997) achieved an overall recall of 56% and precision of 84% when tested on our corpus.
