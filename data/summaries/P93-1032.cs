PREVIOUS WORK While work has been done on various sorts of collocation information that can be obtained from text corpora, the only research that I am aware of that has dealt directly with the problem of the automatic acquisition of subcategorization frames is a series of papers by Brent (Brent and Berwick 1991, Brent 1991, Brent 1992).

Brent and Betwick (1991) took the approach of trying to generate very high precision data.

Nevertheless, this size already compares favorably with the size of some production MT systems (for example, the English dictionary for Siemens' METAL system lists about 2500 verbs (Adriaens and de Braekeleer 1992)).

The last two points do not argue against the use of existing dictionaries, but show that the incomplete information that they provide needs to be supplemented with further knowledge that is best collected automatically) The desire to combine hand-coded and automatically learned knowledge 1A point made by Church and Hanks (1989).

For disambiguating whether a PP is subcategorized by a verb in the V NP PP environment, Hindle and Rooth (1991) used a t-score to determine whether the PP has a stronger association with the verb or the preceding NP.
P91-1030
Brent (1991) used a procedure for identifying verbs that was still very accurate, but which resulted in extremely low yields (it garnered as little as 3% of the information gained by his subcategorization learner running on tagged text, which itself ignored a huge percentage of the information potentially available).

Rather one must collect cooccurrence statistics, and use significance testing, a mutual information measure or some other form of statistic to try and judge whether a particular verb subcategorizes for in or just sometimes the stochastic tagger (Kupiec 1992), and a presumably higher error rate on Brent's technique for detecting verbs, rThis inextensibility is also discussed by Hearst (1992).
C92-2082
In Brent's earlier work (Brent 1991), the error rates reported were for learning from tagged text.
