To improve classification accuracy, a variety of learning techniques are developed, including regression models (Yang and Chute, 1992), nearest neighbour classification (Yang and Liu, 1999), Bayesian approaches (Lewis and Ringuetee, 1994; McCallum et al., 1998), decision trees (Lewis and Ringuetee 1994), neural networks (Wiener et al.,1995) and support vector machines (Dumais and Chen, 2000).
