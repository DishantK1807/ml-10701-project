1348 where o~ is a weight on n, ci are the cost functions, which are weighted by wl, and .Af is a Z score normalization function (Walker et al., 1997; Cohen, 1995).

Previous work in natural language generation has proposed heuristics to determine an agent's choice of dialogue strategy, based on factors such as discourse focus, medium, style, and the content of previous explanations (McKeown, 1985; Moore and Paris, 1989; Maybury, 1991; Hovy, 1993).

The AVM matrix supports calculating Task Success objectively by using the Kappa statistic to compare the information in the AVM that the users filled in with an AVM key such as that in Table 1 (Walker et al., 1997).

Successful completion of a scenario requires that all attributevalues must be exchanged (Walker et al., 1997).
P97-1035
However there are numerous dialogue strategies that an agent might use, e.g. to gather information, handle errors, or manage the dialogue interaction (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Hovy, 1993; McKeown, 1985; Moore and Paris, 1989).

The performance function is derived through multivariate linear regression with User Satisfaction as the dependent variable and all the other measures as independent variables (Walker et al., 1997).

for Learning to Optimize Dialogue Strategy Selection Our method for learning to optimize dialogue strategy selection combines the application of PARADISE to empirical data (Walker et al., 1997), with algorithms for learning optimal strategy choices.
P97-1035
The empirical component uses the PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 1997) to identify the important performance factors and to provide the performance function needed by the learning algorithm.

Previous work has also proposed that an agent's choice of dialogue strategy can be treated as a stochastic optimization problem (Walker, 1993; Biermann and Long, 1996; Levin and Pieraccini, 1997).

We draw on the recently proposed PARADISE evaluation framework (Walker et al., 1997) to identify the important performance factors and to provide a performance function for calculating the utility of the final state of a dialogue.
P97-1035
We use the PARADISE framework (Walker et al., 1997) to derive an empirically motivated performance function, that combines both subjective user preferences and objective system performance measures into a single function.
