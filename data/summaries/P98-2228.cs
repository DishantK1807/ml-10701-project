However, it is fair to compare our work against other approaches which have attempted to disambiguate all content words in a text against some standard lexical resource, such as (Cowie et al., 1992), (Harley and Glennon, 1997), (McRoy, 1992), (Veronis and Ide, 1990) and (Mahesh et al., 1997).

Before the filters or partial taggers are applied the text is tokenised, lemmatised, split into sentences and part-of-speech tagged using the Brill part-ofspeech tagger (Brill, 1992).

SENSUS (Knight and Luk, 1994) is a largescale ontology designed for machine-translation and was produced by merging the ontological hierarchies of WordNet and LDOCE (Bruce and Guthrie, 1992).

First, researchers are divided between a general method (that attempts to apply WSD to all the content words of texts, the option taken in this paper) and one that is applied only to a small trial selection of texts words (for example (Schiitze, 1992) (Yarowsky, 1995)).
P95-1026
We chose this strategy since there is good evidence (Gale et al., 1992) that nouns are best disambiguated by broad contextual considerations, while other parts of speech are resolved by more local factors.
H92-1045
Decision lists have already been successfully applied to lexical ambiguity resolution by (Yarowsky, 1995) where they perfromed well.
P95-1026
The semantic classes in LDOCE are not provided with a hierarchy, but, Bruce and Guthrie (Bruce and Guthrie, 1992) manually identified hierarchical relations between the semantic classes, constructing them into a hierarchy which we use to resolve the restrictions.
C92-4189
In this work, we shall adopt the methodology first explicitly noted in connection with WSD by (McRoy, 1992), and more recently (Ng and Lee, 1996), namely that of bringing together a number of partial sources of information about a phenomenon and combining them in a principled manner.
J92-1001 P96-1006
(Mahesh et al., 1997) (Harley and Glennon, 1997)) have pursued the general option on the grounds that it is the real task and should be tackled directly, but with rather lower success rates.
W97-0212
Definitions (Cowie et al., 1992) used simulated annealing to optimise the choice of senses for a text, based upon their textual definition in a dictionary.

The translation contains only 36,869 words tagged with LDOCE senses, although this is a reasonable size for an evaluation corpus given this type of task (it is several orders of magnitude larger than those used by (Cowie et al., 1992) 1400 (Harley and Glennon, 1997) (Mahesh et al., 1997)).
