A number of automatic sentence alignment techniques have been proposed (Kay and RÃ¶scheisen, 1993; Gale and Church, 1991; Brown et al., 1991; Debili and Samouda, 1992; Papageorgiou et al., 1994; Gaussier, 1995; Melamed, 1996; Fluhr et al., 2000).

The method proposed in (Debili and Sammouda, 1992) is based on the preliminary alignment of words using a conventional bilingual lexicon and the method described in (Papageorgiou et al., 1994) added grammatical labeling based on the assumption that the same parts of speech tend to be employed in the translation.

If the simple form computed by the clitic stemmer does not exist in the general dictionary, re-write rules are applied (Darwish, 2002).

In (Gale and Church, 1991) and (Brown et al., 1991), the authors start from the fact that the length of a source text sentence is highly correlated with the length of its target text translation: short sentences tend to have short translations, and long sentences tend to have long translations.

The trigram and bigram matrices are generated from a manually annotated training corpus (Grefenstette et al., 2005).
