Similarly, in question-answering (QA) evaluations, gold-standard answers use manually created nuggets and compare them against system-produced answers broken down into n-gram pieces, as shown in POURPRE (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005) and NUGGETEER (Marton and Radul, 2006).

In the PYRAMID scheme for manual evaluation of summaries (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004), machine-generated summaries were compared with human-written ones at the nugget level.

Previous manual nugget annotation has used one annotator as the primary nugget creator and another annotator as an inspector (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004).

A serious problem in manual nugget creation is the inconsistency in human decisions (Lin and Hovy, 2003).

Created Nuggets During the recent two Document Understanding Confereces (DUC-05 and DUC-06) (NIST, 2002â€“ 2007), the PYRAMID framework (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) was used for manual summary evaluations.
