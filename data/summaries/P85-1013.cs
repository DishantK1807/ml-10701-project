Type trees are a generalization of the type lists used by Dahl (1981), which are lists of the form TI:T2:T3:..., where T1 is a supertype of T2, T2 is a supertype of TS, ..., and the tail of the list may be a variable.

The first pass is a purely syntactic component using an extrapositJon grammar (Pereira, 1981) and producing syntactic analyses in righ~ost normal form.

These were inspired partially by RG's (Hirschman and Puder, 1982), by MSG's {Dahl and McCord, 1983), and by Attribute Grammars (Knuth, 1968).
