Multi-Topic Multi-Document Summarization UTIYAMA Masao Communications Research Laboratory 588-2, Iwaoka, Nishi-ku, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2492, Japan mutiyama@erl.go.jp HASIDA K6iti Electrotechnical Laboratory 1-1-4, Umezono, Tukuba, Ibaraki 305-8568, Japan hasida@etl.go.jp Abstract Summarization of multiple documents featuring multiple topics is discussed.
The example trea.ted here consists of fifty articles about the Peru hostage incident tbr \])ecember 1996 through April 1997.
They include a.
lot of topics such as opening, negotiation, ending, and so on.
The method proposed in this paper is based on spreading activation over documents syntactically and semantically annotated with GI)A (Global l)ocument Annotation) tags.
The method extracts important documents aald important parts therein, and creates a network consisting of important entities and relations among them.
It also identifies cross-document coreferences to replace expressions with more concrete ones.
The method is essentially multi~ lingua\] due to the language-independence of the GDA tagset.
This tagset can provide a standard fornm.t tbr the study on the transfbrmation and/or generation stage of summarization process, among other natural language processing tasks.
1 Introduction
A large ('.vent consists of a, number of smaller events.
These component events are usually related trot such relations may not be strong enough to define larger topics.
For example, a war may consist of opening, battles, negotiations, and so on.
These relatively independent events are considered to be topics by themselves and would accordingly be reported in multiple news re'titles.
Summarization of such a large event, or multiple documents about multiple topics, is the concern of this paper.
Summarization of multiple documents containing nmltiple topics is an unexplored research issue.
Some previous studies on summarization (McKeown and Radev, 1995; Barzilay et al., 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999) deal with multiple docmnents about a single topic, but not about multiple topics 1.
In order to smnmarize lnultiple docmne, nts with multiple topics, one needs a general, semantics-oriented method for evaluating importance.
Summarization of a single document may largely exploit the doculnent structure.
As an extreme example, the first paragraph of a newspaper article often serves as a smmnary of the entire article.
On the other hand, summa.rization of multiple, documents in general must be more based on their semantic structures, because the, re is no overall consistent document structure across them.
Selection of multiple important topics (not keywords) tbr nmltiple-topic summarization has not; yet been really addressed in the previous literatm:e.
The present paper proposes a method, based on spreading a.ctivation, for extracting important topics and important documents.
Another method proposed which is usefifl for grasping the overview of nlultiple documents is visualization of important entities mentioned and relationships among them.
Visualization of relationships among keywords has been studied in the context of information retrieval (Niwa et al., 1997; Sanderson and Croft, \] 999), but to the authors' knowledge the present study is the first to address such visualization in the context of summm'ization.
Of conrse a.
concise summary of the entire set of multiple doculnents can be obtained by recovering sentences from important entities and their relationships ~s demonstrated in section 3.3.
The present study assumes documents annotated with GDA (Global Document Annota1Maybury (1999) discusses smnmarlzation of multiple topics, but in his study the smmnaries are made ffonl an event database lint not fl'om documents.
892 tion) Lags (Itasida, 1997; Nagao and llasida, 1!)98).
Since the GI)A tagset is designed to be inclel)endent of any particular natural language, the proposed method is essent, ially multilingual.
Another merit of using annotate, d documents is that we ca.n separate the a,nalysis phase from the whole process of summarization so that we ca,n locus on the latter, generation t)hase of summa.rization process.
Annotated documents can also be useflfl for a common input format for the study of summarization, among other natural language processing tasks.
2 The
GDA Tagset GI)A is a project to make on-line documents ntachinc-ullderstanda.ble on the basis of a linguistic ta.gset, while developing and si)reading technologies of content-based presentation, retrieval, question-answering, smnma.rization, translation, among othe, rs, with much higher quality than before.
GI)A thus proposes an integrated global plattbrm for e,h',ctronic content authoring, t)resental;ion, a,nd reuse.
The GI)A tagset 2 is an XM1, (eXtensible Markup l,anguage) insta,nce which allows ma.chines to automatically infex the semantic and pra.gma.tic structures uncle, flying the raw (locuments.
Under the current sta.te of the art, GI)Atagging is senfiautomatic and calls for manual correction by human mmotators; othe, rwise annotation would ma,ke no sense.
"l~h(,, cost involved here pays, because annota,ted documents are generic information contents from which to rend(',r diverse types of 1)resenta.tions, poi;entially involving summariza.tion, narra,tion, visualization, translation, information retriewfl, information extra.ction, and so forth.
The present p~,per concerns summarization only, trot the merit of GI)A-tagging is not a,t all restricted to smmnarization, and that is why it is considered reasonable to assume Gl)A-tagged input here.
2.1. Syntactic structure An example of a.
Ol)A-tagged sentence is shown in Figure 1.
<su> means sentential unit.
<np>, <v>, and <adp> stand for noun t)hrase, verb, and adnominal or adverbial phrase.
<su> and the tags whose name end with 'p' (such as <adp> and <vp>) a,re called phrnsal ta.qs.
In a sentence, an (;lement (a text Sl)an 2http ://www.
etl. go.
j p/etl/nl/gDk/tagset, html <su> <np>Time</np> <v>flies</v> <adp> like <np>an arrow</np> </adp> </su> Figure 1: A Gl)A-tagged sentence.
from a begin tag to the corresponding end tag) is usually a syntactic constituent.
The elements enclosed in phrasal tags are called ph,~asal elements, which cannot be the head of larger elements.
So in Figure 1.
'flies' is specified to be the hea.d of the <su> element and qike' the head of the <adp> element.
2.2 Coreferences
and Anaphora Each element ma.y have an identifier as the va.lue for l;he id attrit)ute,.
Corefe, rences, including identity ana.t)hora, are annotated by the eq attribute, as follows: <np id="j0">John</np> beats <adp eq="j0">his</adp> dog.
When the shared sc, nm.ntic content is not the rctb, renl; lint the typ(', (kind, se, t, etc).
of the retb, rents, the eq.ab attribute is used like the following: You bought a <np id="cl">car</np>.
3 bought <np eq.
ab="cl">one</np>, too.
A zero anaphora is encoded as follows: Tom visited <np id="ml">Mary</np>.
He had <v iob="ml">brought</v> a present.
iob="ml" means that the indirect object of brough, t is elemenl~ whose id value is ml, that is, Mary.
Other relations, such as sub and sup, can also be encoded, sub represents subset, t)art, or element.
An example follows: She has <np id="bl">many books</np>.
<namep sub =''b i "> c c AI i ce ~ s 893 Adventures in Wonderland' '</namep> is her favorite.
sup is the inverse of sub, i.e., ineluder of any sort, which is superset a.s to subset, whole as to part, or set as to element.
Syntactic structures and corefc, rences are essential for the summarization method described in section 3.
l?urther details such as semantics, coordination, scoping, illocutionary act, and so on, are omitted here.
3 Multi-Document Summarization 3.1 Spreading activation A set of GDA-tagged documents is regarded as a network in which nodes roughly correspond to GI)A elements and links represent the syntactic and semantic relations among them.
This network is the tree of GI)A elements plus crossreference (via eq, eq.ab, sub, sup, and so on) links among them.
Cross-reference \]inks nlay encompass different documents.
Figure 2 shows a schematic, graphical representation of the network.

Spreading activation is carried out in this network to assess the importance of the elements.
Spreading activation has been applied to summarization of single GDA-tagged documents (Hasida et al., 1987; Naga.o and Hasida, 1998).
The main conjecture of the present study is that the merit of spreading activation in that it evaluates importances of semantic entities is greater in summarization of multiple documents with multiple topics, because smnmarization techniques using docnment structures do not; apply here, as mentioned em:lier.
To fit the semantic interpretation, activations spread under the condition that coreferent elements should have the same activation vahm.
The algorithm a is shown in Figure 3.
Iiere the external input c(i) to node i represents a priori importance of i, which is set on an empirical basis; for instance, an entity 4 referred to in the title of an article tend to be hnportant, and thus c(i) should be relatively large for the corresponding node i.
Tile weight w(i, j) of another kind of link Dora node i to node j may also be set empMcally, but it is fixed to a unitbrm value in tile present work.
Let E(i) be tile equivalence class of node i, that is the set of nodes which are coreferent with i (linked with i via eq relationships).
Condition E E\],,,(k,0)_< 1 ~eU(i).iCE(i) should be satisfied in order for the spreading activation to converge.
This condition is satisfied if we treat each equivalence class of nodes as a virtual node while setting the weights of other types of links to be 1/5, where D is the maximum degree of equivalence classes: O=max ~ ~ @'i i ~eE(,i) .iCE(.i) where 5&~ is \] if there is a link between node k and node j, otherwise it is 0.
The score score(i) of node i is calculated by summing the activation wdues of all the nodes m~dcr node i in the syntactic tree strueture: .~.'o,'~'.(i) =a(i)+ ~ .~co,'4j ) (l) jCch(i) where a(i) is the activation vahle of node i and oh(i) is the set of child nodes of node i.
oh(i) is empty if node i is a leaf node, or a word.
This score is regarded as the importance of node i.
3.2 Extraction
of important documents and sentences Extraction of ilnportant documents is simple once the scores of the nodes in the network are obtained.
Sorting the document nodes according to their scores and extracting higher-rm~ked ones is sufticient for the purpose.
aAnother spreading activation algorithm is discussed by Mani aim Bloedorn (1999).
The comparison is a future work.
awe use tim terms 'entity'~ 'node', aim 'clenmnt' interclmngeably.
894 Variables: N: munlier of nodes.
D: nmxinnnn oul;-degree of equivalence classes, c(i): external input I;o node i.
w(i, j): weight of the link from node i to node j: 0 if not eonncel;ed, 1 if connected via eq, 1/D ot;herwise.
a(i): actival;ion value of node i.
The initial value is O.
a(i) is the sum of all a.(j,i).
a(±, j): acl;ivaLion value of l, he link from node i 1;o node j.
The inil;ia\] value is 0.
Algoril;hm: repeat { for(i=O; i<N; i++){ av = c(i) ; for(j=O; j<N; j++){ a(j,i) = w(j,i)*(a(j) a(i,j)) av += a(j,i) } a(i) = av; } } until convergence.

An experiment ha,s been conducted to test the effeetiwmess of the proposed aJgorithm.
The exa.mple set contains fifty Japanese articles about the Peru hostage incident which continued over four months fl'om I)ecember 1996 to April \] 997.
They include a lot of topics such a.s opening, negotiation, settlement, mid so on.
The GI)Atagging of these articles has involved automatic morphological ana.lysis by JUMAN (Kurohashi mid Na.ga.o, 1998), automatic syntactic ana.lysis by KNP (Kurohashi, 1998), and ma.nual annotation encompassing morphology, syntax, coreference, and anaphora..
The types of a.naphora, identified here are ma.inly pla.in coreference and zero ana.phora.
Cross-document coreferenees among entities ha.ve been a.utomatieaJly identifled by exa,et string mt~tching.
5 They
oonta,ined erl'OlTS but those el'l;ors %7e17o llOt corl'eCl;(',d for the experiment.
Cross-document coreferenees found were 'l'eru'(49), 'Japa.n'(39), 'Peru President' (15), 'members of Tupac Amaru'(9), ...
and so on, where the mmfi~ors indicate the numbers of documents which contain these expressions.
The externa.1 inputs to nodes have been defined a.ccording to the corresponding nodes: c(i) = 10 if node i's antecedent domina.tes senfences (e.g., a.
node eoreferring with a.
pa.ra.graph).
This sets a, preference for nodes which summa.rize preceding sentences, c(i) = 5 if node i is in the title of an article, beemlse a.
title is usually importa.nt.
Otherwise c(i) = 1.
These crude t)a,raJneter va.hles have been set by the authors on the basis of the investigation of summa.riza.tions of va.rious documents.
Two importa,nt topics, the opening (first a.l;tack by %lpac Ama.ru) a.nd the settlement (a.ttack by the Peruvia.u government comma.n(los), have been extracted fl'om the four highest rmiked articles, even though temporal informa.tion has not been incort)or~tted in the aJgorithm.
Tile opening aa'ticle, is the first a.rticle of the sample document set.
However, the settlement a ri, ich; is the sixth \]a.st one.
So mere extra.ction of the last m'tic, le would miss the settlement.

897 5 Conclusion Summarization of multiple documents about nmltiple topics has been discussed in this papet'.
The method proposed here uses spreading activation over documents syntactically and semanticMly annotated with GDA tags.
It is capable of: • extraction of the opening and settlement articles from fifty articles about a hostage incident, • creation of an entity-relation graph of important relations among important entities, • extraction and pruning of important sentences, gnd • substitution of expressions with more concrete ones using cross-document coreferences.
The inethod is essentially multilingual because it is based on GDA tags gild the GDA tagset is designed to address nmltilingual coverage.
Since this tagset can en,bed various linguistic intbrination into documents, it could be a standard tbrmat for the study of the transformation and/or generdtion stage of doculnent summarization, among other natural language processing tasks.
