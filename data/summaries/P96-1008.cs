This adaptation, related to that of (Stolcke 1995), involves reformulating the Earley algorithm to work with probabilistic recursive transition networks rather than with deterministic production rules.

Instead, these probabilities are estimated by statistical decision trees similar 58 to those used in the Spatter parser (Magerman 1995).

To evaluate our approach, we trained an experimental system using data from the Air Travel Information (ATIS) domain (Bates et al.1990; Price 1990).

As in (Magerman 1995), mixture weights are determined by deleted interpolation on a separate block of training data.

1. Introduction A recent trend in natural language processing has been toward a greater emphasis on statistical approaches, beginning with the success of statistical part-of-speech tagging programs (Church 1988), and continuing with other work using statistical part-of-speech tagging programs, such as BBN PLUM (Weischedel et al.1993) and NYU Proteus (Grishman and Sterling 1993).
A88-1019
More recently, statistical methods have been applied to domain-specific semantic parsing (Miller et al.1994), and to the more difficult problem of wide-coverage syntactic parsing (Magerman 1995).
