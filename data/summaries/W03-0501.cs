The BBN parser has been used successfully for the task of information extraction in the SIFT system (Miller et al., 2000).
A00-2030
This approach has been explored in (Zajic et al., 2002) and (Banko et al., 2000).

Work Other researchers have investigated the topic of automatic generation of abstracts, but the focus has been different, e.g., sentence extraction (Edmundson, 1969; Johnson et al, 1993; Kupiec et al., 1995; Mann et al., 1992; Teufel and Moens, 1997; Zechner, 1995), processing of structured templates (Paice and Jones, 1993), sentence compression (Hori et al., 2002; Knight and Marcu, 2001; Grefenstette, 1998, Luhn, 1958), and generation of abstracts from multiple sources (Radev and McKeown, 1998).
