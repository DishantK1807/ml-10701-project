However, recent work has suggested that dialogue strategy can be designed using tile formalism of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and the algorithms of RL (Biermann and Long, 1996; Levin et al., 2000; Walker et nl., 1998; Singh et al., 1999).

This paper applies reintbrcement learning (RL) to automatically learn design choices that optimize system pertbrnmnee for a choseLL pertbrmance measure (Levin et al., 2000; Walker et al., 1998).

Walker et al.(1998)'s methodology is similar to that used here, in testing RL with an imt)lelnented system with human users.

As fllture work, we wish to understand the aforementioned results on the subjective reward measures, explore the potential difference between optimizing tbr expert users and novices, automate the choice of state space for dialogue systems, ilwestigate the use of a learned reward function (Walker et al., 1998), and explore the use of more informative non-terminal rewards.

We made obvious dialogue strategy choices in advance, and used learIfing only to optimize the difficult choices (Walker et al., 1998).
