NOMAD builds on previous work on conceptual analysis (Riesbeck and Schank 1976, Birnbaum and Selfridge 1979), and on error detection and correction during conceptual analysis (Granger 1977, 1980, 1982a).

Many of the approaches to understanding illformed input focus on syntactic errors separately from semantic errors (for example, Hayes and Mouradian 1981 and Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981).

The approach taken by Hayes and Carbonell (1981) is closer to that described in this paper, in that they do build meaning representations.

Some of the standard problems of scriptand plan-based understanders have been satisfactorily addressed in NOMAD, most notably, the handling of unknown words (via the FOUL-UP mechanism); and the script-selection problem, that is, knowing which scripts to apply monitoring when they go wrong (via the mechanisms of supplanting incorrect inferences (Granger 1980), and producing a set of alternate interpretations of a text (Granger 1981a, 198282a, 1982c).

In the event that the user does not confirm NOMAD's initial interpretation, a number of alternative interpretations are produced (see Granger 1981a, 1982c) until one is confirmed, or the process fails.
