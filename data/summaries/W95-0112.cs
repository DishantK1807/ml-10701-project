Furthermore, training corpora for information extraction are typically annotated with domain-specific tags, in contrast to general-purpose annotations such as part-of-speech tags or noun-phrase bracketing (e.g., the Brown Corpus \[Francis and Kucera, 1982\] and the Penn Treebank \[Marcus et al., 1993\]).

General purpose text annotations, such as part-of-speech tags and noun-phrase bracketing, are costly to obtain but have wide applicability and have been used successfully to develop statistical NLP systems (e.g., \[Church, 1989; Weischedel et al., 1993\]).
