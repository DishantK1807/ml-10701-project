The present paper will focus on another approach to Boolean descriptions, which takes the Incremental Algorithm as its point of departure (van Deemter 2001).

Using Satellites sets for the construction of descriptions can be particularly useful when properly generalized to Boolean descriptions, but shortening the resulting descriptions in a computationally efficient way is difficult (van Deemter and Halld ´orsson 2001).

Logically superfluous properties can, for example, be motivated by “overloading” if they serve communicative purposes other than identification (Pollack 1991; Dale and Reiter 1995, Section 2.4; Stone and Webber 1998; Jordan 1999).

50 van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions An interesting class of cases is explored in Paraboni (2000), which focuses on descriptions of document parts.

A nondistinguishing description may take the form either of a definite description (as in John’s son, when John has several sons) or of an indefinite description (as in one of John’s sons; Horacek 1997; Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).

Also, we focus on “one shot” descriptions, disregarding cases where an object is described through its relations with other objects (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2001).

In this paper, we will deal with “first mention” descriptions only (unlike Dale 1992, Chapter 5; Mittal et al.1998; Kibble 1999), assuming that the information used for generating the description is limited to a KB containing complete information about which properties are true of each object.

For example, they do not involve relational descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Horacek 1997; Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg 2001) or properties that are vague or context dependent (van Deemter 2000).

Head nouns can also be selected during linguistic realization or by interleaving of content determination and realization (e.g., Horacek 1997; Stone and Webber 1998; Krahmer and Theune 1999).

To begin with, the algorithm D&R Plural finds intersections P 1 \ \P n of atomic properties P 1,:::, P n whose extension equals a given target set S (van Deemter 2000).

Conversely, a complex algorithm can be safe to use if the domain is small (or if key calculations can be performed offline; e.g., Bateman 1999).

38 van Deemter Generating Referring Expressions The Incremental Algorithm produces a set L of properties P 1,:::, P n such that their logical conjunction forms a “distinguishing description” (Dale 1989) of the target object r.

Making informed decisions about such questions, with proper attention to their combined effects, is a difficult task that is perhaps best tackled using the graph-theoretical approach outlined by Krahmer, van Erk, and Verleg (2001).
