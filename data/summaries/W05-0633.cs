node mapping of semantic arguments and named entities Following Gildea & Jurafsky (2002), (i) labels matching more than one constituent due to nonbranching nodes are taken as labels of higher constituents, (ii) in cases of labels with no corresponding parse constituent, these are assigned to the partial match given by the constituent spanning the shortest portion of the sentence beginning at the label’s span left boundary and lying entirely within it.
