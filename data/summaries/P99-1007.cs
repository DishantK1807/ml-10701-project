Further afield, (Niehren et al., 1997) shows that context unification supports a purely equational treatment of the interaction between ellipsis and quantification whereas (Shieber et al., 1996) presents a very extensive HOU-based treatment of the interaction between scope and ellipsis.
P97-1053
There are a number of proposals (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997; Priist et al., 1994; Asher, 1993; Asher et al., 1997) adopting a similar approach to parallelism and semantics of which the most worked out is undoubtly (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997).
P97-1051
(I'll kiss you if you don't want me to kiss you) Because the HOU-analysis reconstructs the semantics common to source and target rather than (solely) the semantics of VP-ellipses, it can capture the full range of sloppy/strict ambiguity illustrated above (and as (Gardent, 1997) shows some of the additional examples listed in (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997)).
P97-1051
(Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) presents a general theory of parallelism and shows that it provides both a fine-grained analysis of the interaction between VP-ellipsis and pronominal anaphora and a general account of sloppy identity.
P97-1051
As (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997; Hardt, 1996) have shown however, sloppy identity is not necessarily linked to VP-ellipsis.
