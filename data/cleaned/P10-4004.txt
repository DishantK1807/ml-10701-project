Abstract 
GernEdiT (short for: GermaNet Editing Tol) 
ofers a graphical interface for the lexicogra-
phers and developers of GermaNet to aces 
and modify the underlying GermaNet re-
source. GermaNet is a lexical-semantic word-
net that is modeled after the Princeton Word-
Net for English. The traditional lexicographic 
development of GermaNet was eror prone 
and time-consuming, mainly due to a complex 
underlying data format and no oportunity of 
automatic consistency checks. GernEdiT re-
places the earlier development by a more user-
friendly tol, which facilitates automatic 
checking of internal consistency and corect-
nes of the linguistic resource. This paper pre-
sents al these core functionalities of GernEdiT 
along with details about its usage and usabil-
ity. 
1 Introduction

The main purpose of the GermaNet Editing Tol 
GernEdiT tol is to suport lexicographers in 
acesing, modifying, and extending the Ger-
maNet data (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 202; Hen-
rich and Hinrichs, 2010) in an easy and adaptive 
way and to aid in the navigation through the 
GermaNet word clas hierarchies, so as to find 
the apropriate place in the hierarchy for new 
synsets (short for: synonymy set) and lexical 
units. GernEdiT replaces the traditional Ger-
maNet development based on lexicographer files 
(Felbaum, 198) by a more user-friendly visual 
tol that suports versioning and colaborative 
anotation by several lexicographers working in 
paralel. 
Furthermore, GernEdiT facilitates internal 
consistency of the GermaNet data such as apro-
priate linking of lexical units with synsets, 
conectednes of the synset graph, and automatic 
closure among relations and their inverse coun-
terparts. 
Al these functionalities along with the main 
aspects of GernEdiT’s usage and usability are 
presented in this paper. 
2 The
Structure of GermaNet 
GermaNet is a lexical-semantic wordnet that is 
modeled after the Princeton WordNet for English 
(Felbaum, 198). It covers the thre word cate-
gories of adjectives, nouns, and verbs and parti-
tions the lexical space into a set of concepts that 
are interlinked by semantic relations. A semantic 
concept is modeled by a synset. A synset is a set 
of words (caled lexical units) where al the 
words are taken to have (almost) the same mean-
ing. Thus a synset is a set-representation of the 
semantic relation of synonymy, which means 
that it consists of a list of lexical units. 
There are two types of semantic relations in 
GermaNet: conceptual and lexical relations. 
Conceptual relations hold betwen two semantic 
concepts, i.e. synsets. They include relations 
such as hyperonymy, part-whole relations, en-
tailment, or causation. GermaNet is hierarchi-
caly structured in terms of the hyperonymy rela-
tion. Lexical relations hold betwen two individ-
ual lexical units. Antonymy, a pair of oposites, 
is an example of a lexical relation. 
3 The
GermaNet Editing Tool 
The GermaNet Editing Tol GernEdiT provides 
a graphical user interface, implemented as a Java 
Swing aplication, which primarily alows main-
taining the GermaNet data in a user-friendly 
way. The editor represents an interface to a rela-
tional database, where al GermaNet data is 
stored from now on.

3.1 Motivation

The traditional lexicographic development of 
GermaNet was eror prone and time-consuming, 
mainly due to a complex underlying data format 
and no oportunity of automatic consistency 
checks. This is exactly why GernEdiT was de-
veloped: It suports lexicographers who ned to 
aces, modify, and extend GermaNet data by 
providing these functions through simple buton-
clicks, searches, and form editing. There are sev-
eral ways to search data and browse through the 
GermaNet graph. These functionalities alow 
lexicographers, among other things, to find the 
apropriate place in the hierarchy for the inser-
tion of new synsets and lexical units. Last but not 
least, GernEdiT facilitates internal consistency 
and corectnes of the linguistic resource and 
suports versioning and colaborative anotation 
of GermaNet by several lexicographers working 
in paralel. 
3.2 The
Main User Interface 
Figure 1 ilustrates the main user panel of Gern-
EdiT. It shows a Search panel above, two panels 
for Synsets and Lexical Units in the midle, and 
four tabs below: a Conceptual Relations Editor, a 
Graph with Hyperonyms and Hyponyms, a Lexi-
20
 
Figure 2: Filtered list of lexical units. 
 
cal Relations Editor, and an Examples and 
Frames tab. 
In Figure 1, a search for synsets consisting of 
lexical units with the word Nus (German noun 
for: nut) has ben executed. Acordingly, the 
Synsets panel displays the thre resulting synsets 
that match the search item. The Synset Id is the 
unique database ID that unambiguously identi-
fies a synset, and which can also be used to 
search for exactly that synset. Word Category 
specifies whether a synset is an adjective (adj), a 
noun (nomen), or a verb (verben), whereas Word 
Clas clasifies the synsets into semantic fields. 
The word clas of the selected synset in Figure 1 
is Nahrung (German noun for: fod). The Para-
phrase column contains a description of a synset, 
e.g., for the selected synset the paraphrase is: der 
esbare Kern einer Nus (German phrase for: the 
edible kernel of a nut). The column Al Orth 
Forms simply lists al orthographical variants of 
al its lexical units. 
Which lexical units are listed in the Lexical 
Units panel depends on the selected synset in the 
Synsets panel. Here, Lex Unit Id and Synset Id 
again reflect the coresponding unique database 
IDs. Orth Form (short for: orthographic form) 
represents the corect speling of a word acord-
ing to the rules of the speling reform Neue 
Deutsche Rechtschreibung (Rat für deutsche 
Rechtschreibung, 206), a recently adopted 
speling reform. In our example, the main ortho-
graphic form is Nus. Orth Var may contain an 
alternative speling that is admisible acording 
to the Neue Deutsche Rechtschreibung.
1
 Old 
Orth Form represents the main orthographic 
form prior to the Neue Deutsche Recht-
schreibung. This means that Nuß was the corect 
speling instead of Nus before the German spell-
ing reform. Old Orth Var contains any acepted 
variant prior to the Neue Deutsche Recht-
schreibung. The Old Orth Var field is filed only 
if it is no longer alowed in the new orthography. 
The Bolean values Named Entity, Artificial, 
and Style Marking expres further properties of a 
lexical unit, whether the lexical unit is a named 
entity, an artificial concept node, or a stylistic 
variant. 
For both the lexical units and the synsets, there 
are two butons Use as From and Use as To, 
which help to ad new relations (se the explana-
tion of Figure 3 in section 3.6 below which ex-
plains the creation of new relations). 
3.3 Search
Functionalities 
It is posible to search for words or synset data-
base IDs via the search panel (se Figure 1 at the 
top). The check box Ignore Case ofers the pos-
sibility of searching without distinguishing be-
twen uper and lower case.

 An example of this kind is the German word Delfin (Ger-
man noun for: dolphin). Apart from the main form Delfin, 
there is an orthographic variant Delphin. 
21
 
Figure 3. Conceptual Relations Editor tab. 
 
Via the file menu, lists of al synsets or lexical 
units with their properties can be acesed. To 
these lists, very detailed filters can be aplied: 
e.g., filtering the lexical units or synsets by parts 
of their orthographical forms. Figure 2 shows a 
list of lexical units to which a detailed filter has 
ben aplied: verbs have ben chosen (se the 
chosen tab) whose orthographical forms start 
with an a(se starts with check box and core-
sponding text field) and end with the sufix -ten 
(se ends with check box and coresponding text 
field). Only verbs that have a frame that contains 
NN are chosen (se Frame contains check box 
and coresponding text field). Furthermore, the 
resulting filtered list is sorted in descending or-
der by their examples (se the litle triangle in 
the Examples header of the result table). The 
number in the brackets behind the word category 
in the tab title indicates the count of the filtered 
lexical units (in this example 193 verbs pas the 
filter). 
3.4 Visualization
of the Graph Hierarchy 
There is the posibility to display a graph with al 
hyperonyms and hyponyms of a selected synset. 
This is shown in the botom half of Figure 1 in 
the tab Graph with Hyperonyms and Hyponyms. 
The graph in Figure 1 visualizes a part of the hi-
erarchical structure of GermaNet centered 
around the synset containing Nus and displays 
the hyperonyms and hyponyms of this synset up 
to a certain parameterized depth (in this case 
depth 2 has ben chosen). The Hyperonym Depth 
choser alows unfolding the graph to the top up 
to the preselected depth. As it is not posible to 
visualize the whole GermaNet contents at once, 
the graph can be sen as a window to GermaNet. 
A click on any synset node within the graph, 
navigates to that synset. This functionality sup-
ports lexicographers especialy in finding the 
apropriate place in the hierarchy for the inser-
tion of new synsets. 
3.5 Modifications
of Existing Items 
If the lexicographers’ task is to modify existing 
synsets or lexical units, this is done by selecting 
a synset or lexical unit displayed in the Synsets 
and the Lexical Units panels shown in Figure 1. 
The properties of such selected items can be ed-
ited by a click in the coresponding table cel. 
For example by clicking in the cel Orth Form 
the speling of a lexical unit can be corected in 
case of an earlier typo was made. 
If lexicographers want to edit examples, 
frames, conceptual, or lexical relations this is 
done by chosing the apropriate tab indicated at 
the botom of Figure 1. By clicking one of these 
tabs, the coresponding panel apears below 
these tabs. In Figure 1 the panel for Graph with 
Hyperonyms and Hyponyms is displayed. 
It is posible to edit the examples and frames 
asociated with a lexical unit via the Examples 
and Frames tab. Frames specify the syntactic 
valence of a lexical unit. Each frame can have an 
asociated example that indicates a posible us-
age of the lexical unit for that particular frame. 
The tab Examples and Frames is thus particu-
larly geared towards the editing of verb entries. 
By clicking on the tab al examples and frames 
of a lexical unit are listed and can then be modi-
fied by chosing the apropriate editing butons. 
For more information about these editing func-
tions se Henrich and Hinrichs (2010). 
22

3.6 Editing
of Relations 
If lexicographers want to ad new conceptual or 
lexical relations to a synset or a lexical unit this 
is done by clicking on the Conceptual Relations 
Editor or the Lexical Relations Editor shown in 
Figure 1. 
Figure 3 shows the panel that apears if the 
Conceptual Relations Editor has ben chosen for 
the synset containing Nus. To create a new rela-
tion, the lexicographer neds to use the butons 
Use as From and Use as To shown in Figure 1. 
This wil insert the ID of the selected synsets 
from the Synsets panel in the coresponding 
From or To field in Figure 3. The buton Delete 
ConRel alows deletion of a conceptual relation, 
if al consistency checks are pased. 
The Lexical Relations Editor tab suports edit-
ing al lexical relations. It is not displayed sepa-
rately for reasons of space, but it is analogue to 
the Conceptual Relations Editor tab for editing 
conceptual relations. 
3.7 Ading
Synsets and Lexical Units 
The butons Ad New Hyponym and Ad New 
LexUnit in the Synsets panel (se Figure 1) can 
be used to insert a new synset or lexical unit at 
the selected place in the GermaNet graph, and 
the butons Delete Synset and Delete LexUnit 
remove the selected entry, respectively. 
The Synset Editor in Figure 4 (on the left) 
shows the window which apears after a click on 
Ad New Hyponym. When clicking on the buton 
Create Synset, the Lexical Unit Editor (shown in 
Figure 4, right) pops up. This workflow forces 
the paralel creation of a lexical unit while creat-
ing a synset. 
3.8 Consistency
Checks 
GernEdiT facilitates internal consistency of the 
GermaNet data. This is achieved by the 
workflow-oriented design of the editor. It is not 
posible to create a synset without creating a 
lexical unit in paralel (as described in section 
3.7). Furthermore, it is not posible to insert a 
new synset without specifying the place in the 
GermaNet hierarchy where the new synset 
should be aded. This is achieved by the buton 
Ad New Hyponym (se Figure 1) which forces 
the user to identify the apropriate hyperonym 
for the new synset to be aded. Furthermore, it is 
not posible to insert a lexical unit without speci-
fying the coresponding synset. On deletion of a 
synset, al coresponding data such as conceptual 
relations, lexical units with their lexical relations, 
frames, and examples, are deleted automaticaly. 
Consistency checks also take efect for the ta-
ble cel editing in the Synsets and Lexical Units 
panels of the main user interface (se Figure 1), 
e.g., the main orthographic form of a lexical unit 
may never be empty. 
Al butons in GernEdiT are enabled only if 
the coresponding functionalities met the con-
sistency requirements, e.g., if a synset consists 
only of one lexical unit, it is not posible to de-
lete that lexical unit and thus the buton Delete 
LexUnit is disabled. Also, if the deletion of a 
synset or a relation would violate the complete 
conectednes of the GermaNet graph, it is not 
posible to delete that synset. 
3.9 Further
Functionalities 
There are further functionalities available 
through the file menu. Besides retrieving the up-
to-date statistics of GermaNet, an editing history 
makes it posible to list al modifications on the 
GermaNet data, with the information about who 
made the change and how the modified item 
loked before. 
GernEdiT suports various export functionali-
ties. For example, it is posible to export al 
GermaNet contents into XML files, which are 
used as an exchange format of GermaNet, or to 
23
export a list of al verbs with their coresponding 
frames and examples. 
4 Tool
Evaluation 
In order to ases the usefulnes of GernEdiT, we 
conducted in depth interviews with the Germa-
Net lexicographers and with the senior researcher 
who overses al lexicographic development. At 
the time of the interview al of these researchers 
had worked with the tol for about eight months. 
The present section sumarizes the fedback 
about GernEdiT that was obtained in this way. 
The initial learning curve for geting familiar 
with GernEdiT is considerably lower compared 
to the learning curve required for the traditional 
development based on lexicographer files. 
Moreover, the GermaNet development with 
GernEdiT is both more eficient and acurate 
compared to the traditional development along 
the folowing dimensions: 
1. The menu-driven and graphics-based 
navigation through the GermaNet graph is 
much easier compared to finding the cor-
rect entry point in the purely text-based 
format of lexicographer files. 
2. Lexicographers no longer ned to learn the 
complex specification syntax of the lexi-
cographer files. Thereby, syntax erors in 
the specification language – a frequent 
source of erors prior to development with 
GernEdiT – are entirely eliminated. 
3. GernEdiT facilitates automatic checking 
of internal consistency and corectnes of 
the GermaNet data such as apropriate 
linking of lexical units with synsets, con-
nectednes of the synset graph, and auto-
matic closure among relations and their 
inverse counterparts. 
4. It is now even posible to perform further 
queries, which were not posible before, 
e.g., listing al hyponyms of a synset. 
5. Especialy for the senior researcher who is 
responsible for cordinating the GermaNet 
lexicographers, it is now much easier to 
trace back changes and to verify who was 
responsible for them. 
6. The colaborative anotation by several 
lexicographers working in paralel is now 
easily posible and does not cause any 
management overhead as before. 
In sum, the lexicographers of GermaNet gave 
very positive fedback about the use of Gern-
EdiT and also made smaler sugestions for im-
proving its user-friendlines further. This under-
scores the utility of GernEdiT from a practical 
point of view. 
5 Conclusion
and Future Work 
In this paper we have described the functionality 
of GernEdiT. The extremely positive fedback of 
the GermaNet lexicographers underscores the 
practical benefits gained by using the GernEdiT 
tol in practice. 
At the moment, GernEdiT is customized for 
maintaining the GermaNet data. In future work, 
we plan to adapt the tol so that it can be used 
with wordnets for other languages as wel. This 
would mean that the wordnet data for a given 
language would have to be stored in a relational 
database and that the tol itself can handle the 
language specific data structures of the wordnet 
in question.
