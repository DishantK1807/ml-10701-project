For the task of acquiring verb subcategorisation frames, we adapt to the speci cities of the Spanish language well-known techniques that have been developed for English, and our results compare favourably to the sate of the art results obtained for English (Korhonen, 2002b).

In order to collect the frequency distributions of Spanish subcategorisation frames, we adapt a methodology that has been developed for English to the speci cities of the Spanish language ((Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993), (Korhonen, 2002b)).

We lter out the spurious patterns with a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), a method proposed by (Korhonen, 2002b) for this task.

For this reason, various methods for automatically classifying verbs using machine learning techniques have been attempted ((Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003), (Schulte im Walde, 2003)).

For this reason, a new approach could be envisaged for this task, in the direction of the work by (Weeds and Weir, 2003), by building rankings of similarity for each verb.

Manually built semantic classi cations of English verbs have been used for different applications such as machine translation (Dorr, 1997), verb subcategorisation acquisition (Korhonen, 2002a) or parsing (Schneider, 2003).

The F measure value of 66% reported on the third line of table 1, obtained on the large corpus with preposition groups, compares favourably to the results reported on (Korhonen, 2002b) for a similar experiment on English subcategorization frames, in which an F measure of 65.2 is achieved.

Nevertheless, our results are comparable to a subset of experiments reported in (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003), where they perform similar clustering experiments on English verbs based on a general description of verbs, obtaining average Adjusted Rand measures of 0.04 and 0.07. 4 Conclusions and Future Work We have presented a series of experiments that use an unsupervised learning method to classify Spanish verbs into semantic classes based on subcategorisation information.

Our choice of the parameter settings is motivated by the work of (Stevenson and Joanis, 2003).
