For example, Ngram language model is considered to be effective in writing evaluation (Burstein et al., 1998; CorstonOliver et al., 2001).

The phrasal Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) technique is employed to identify and correct writing errors (Brockett et al., 2006).

Worse still, it is hard to write rules for some grammatical errors, for example, detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage (Nagata et al., 2006).

For example, E-rater (Burstein et al., 1998), developed by the ETS, and Intelligent Essay Assessor (Foltz et al., 1999).

Syntactic Score (SC) Some erroneous sentences often contain words and concepts that are locally correct but cannot form coherent sentences (Liu and Gildea, 2005).
W05-0904
Second, it can be applied to control the quality of parallel bilingual sentences mined from the Web, which are critical sources for a wide range of applications, such as statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) and cross-lingual information retrieval (Nie et al., 1999).

Instead of asking experts to write hand-crafted rules, statistical approaches (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000; Izumi et al., 2003; Brockett et al., 2006; Nagata et al., 2006) build statistical models to identify sentences containing errors.

In this paper, we compare our technique with the grammar checker of Microsoft Word03 and the ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) method used by ETS.

Moreover, these approaches, e.g., (Izumi et al., 2003; Brockett et al., 2006) usually need errors to be specified and tagged in the training sentences, which requires expert help to be recruited and is time consuming and labor intensive.

We realize that the grammar checker of Word is a general tool and the performance of ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) can be improved if larger training data is used.

This is inspired by the work (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001) showing that function word density can be effective in distinguishing between human references and machine outputs.

Our method outperforms Microsoft Word03 and ALEK (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) from Educational Testing Service (ETS) in some cases.

Function Word Density (FWD) We consider the density of function words (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001), i.e. the ratio of function words to content words.
P01-1020
In addition, we compared our technique with two other methods of checking errors, Microsoft Word03 and ALEK method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).

To measure the coherence of sentences, we use a statistical parser Toolkit (Collins, 1997) to assign each sentence a parserâ€™s score that is the related log probability of parsing.
P97-1003
An unsupervised method (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000) is employed to detect grammatical errors by inferring negative evidence from TOEFL administrated by ETS.
A00-2019
The work in (Nagata et al., 2006) focuses on a type of error, namely mass vs.
P06-1031
The method (Izumi et al., 2003) aims to detect omission-type and replacement-type errors and transformation-based leaning is employed in (Shi and Zhou, 2005) to learn rules to detect errors for speech recognition outputs.
H05-1006 P03-2026
Classification models are employed in (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001; Gamon et al., 2005) 82 to evaluate the well-formedness of machine translation outputs.
