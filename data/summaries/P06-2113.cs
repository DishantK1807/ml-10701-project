and Perceptron Learning Perceptron training for conditional models (Collins, 2002) is an approximation to the SGD algorithm, using feature counts from the Viterbi label sequence in lieu of expected feature counts.

The HMM/CFG composite model was evaluated in the ATIS domain (Price, 1990).
H90-1020
In the ATIS evaluation (Price, 1990), this model achieves the same level of understanding accuracy (5.3% error rate on standard ATIS evaluation) as the best system (5.5% error rate), which is a semantic parsing system based on a manually developed grammar.
H90-1020
In both perceptron and CRF training, we average the parameters over training iterations (Collins, 2002).
