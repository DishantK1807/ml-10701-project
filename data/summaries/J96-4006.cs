It may be possible, however, and highly interesting, to integrate the results of a purely inductive method, such as the conceptual clustering system CIAULA (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c, 1996a), and a hand-encoded, domain-general classification, such as, for example, WordNet.

Hence, in principle, WordNet and CIAULA adopt the same relational 561 Computational Linguistics Volume 22, Number 4 Let C be a cluster automatically derived by CIAULA (Basili et al.1996a). A cluster is simply a set of verbs modeled by means of a graded membership function, i.e., the local membership of verbs, #(v, C) (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c).

The input observations (instances) for our concept-formation algorithm are verb observations in sentences, represented by their generalized thematic structures, acquired semiautomatically from corpora by ARIOSTO_LEX (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993a, 1993b, 1996b).
