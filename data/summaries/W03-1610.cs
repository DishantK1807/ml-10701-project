In order to improve the performance of synonym extraction, Curran (2002) used an ensemble method to combine the results of different methods using a monolingual corpus.

It is different from the method in (Barzilay and Mckeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002), which can only extract the synonyms in the bilingual corpus.

Although Curran (2002) showed that the ensemble extractors outperformed the individual extractors, it still cannot overcome the deficiency of the methods using the monolingual corpus.

We use it instead of point-wise mutual information in Lin (1998) because the latter tends to overestimate the association between two parts with low frequencies.

In information retrieval and question answering, the synonymous words are employed to bridge the expressions gaps between the query space and the document space (Mandala et al., 1999; Radev et al., 2001; Kiyota et al., 2002).

For example, (Curran, 2002) proved that the ensembles of individual extractors using different contexts in the monolingual corpus improve the performance of synonym extraction.

The most frequently used resource for synonym extraction is large monolingual corpora (Hindle, 1990; Crouch and Yang, 1992; Grefenstatte, 1994; Park and Choi, 1997; Gasperin et al., 2001 and Lin, 1998).

In automatic text summarization, synonymous words are employed to identify repetitive information in order to avoid redundant contents in a summary (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).

Barzilay and Mckeown (2001), and Shimohata and Sumita (2002) used bilingual corpora to extract synonyms.
