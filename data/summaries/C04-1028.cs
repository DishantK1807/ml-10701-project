The literature presents various proposals for how information structure can be captured in categorial grammar (Steedman, 2000a; Hoffman, 1995; Kruijff, 2001).

Furthermore, the ability for dimensions to interact through shared indices brings several advantages: (1) “parallel derivations” (Hoffman, 1995) are unnecessary; (2) non-isomorphic, functional structures across different dimensions can be employed; and (3) there is no longer a need to load all the necessary information into syntactic categories (as with Kruijff (2001)).

These rules support the following incremental derivation for Marcel proved completeness: (1) Marcel proved completeness np (s\np)/np np >Ts/(s\np) >Bs/np >s This derivation does not display the effect of using modalities in CCG; see Baldridge (2002) and Baldridge and Kruijff (2003) for detailed linguistic justification for this modalized formulation of CCG.

We use CCG’s multi-modal extension (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2003), which enriches the inventory of slash types.

The approach is inspired on the one hand by earlier work by Steedman (2000a) and Hoffman (1995), and on the other by the signs found in constraint-based approaches to grammar.

The nominal r stands for the discourse referent, which has informativity i with respect to the current point in the discourse d (Kruijff, 2003).

Construction Baldridge and Kruijff (2002) show how HLDS representations can be built via CCG derivations.

Phonemic representation: word sequences, composition of sequences is through concatenation Prosody: sequences of tunes from the inventory of (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990), composition through concatenation Syntactic category: well-formed categories, combinatory rules (see §2) Information structure: hybrid logic formulas of the form @d[in]r, with r a discourse referent that has informativity in (theme θ, or rheme ρ) relative to the current point in the discourse d (Kruijff, 2003).
