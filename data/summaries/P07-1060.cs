On the other hand, our model makes two extensions to the Micro Alignment step in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003).
W03-1004
This model is both a simpli cation of and an extension to the one advocated in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003).
W03-1004
(Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003) shows that the simple cosine similarity score can be effective when used in conjunction with paragraph clustering.
W03-1004
At the level of short passages or sentences, (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999) goes beyond N-gram, taking advantage of WordNet synonyms, as well as ordering and distance between shared words.
W99-0625
In contrast, deviation from the source order is limited to ips between two sentences in (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), an assumption that is not valid in the Synoptics6.
W03-1004
Following the framework of global linear models in (Collins, 2002), we cast this task as learning a mapping F from input verses x ∈ X to a text-reuse hypothesis y ∈ Y ∪ {epsilon1}.
W02-1001
Past research has addressed a variety of text-reuse applications, including: journalists turning a news agency text into a newspaper story (Clough et al., 2002); editors adapting an encyclopedia entry to an abridged version (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003); and plagiarizers disguising their sources by removing surface similarities (Uzuner et al., 2005).
