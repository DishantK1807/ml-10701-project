work on Sentiment Analysis Some prior studies on sentiment analysis focused on the document-level classification of sentiment (Turney, 2002; Pang et al., 2002) where a document is assumed to have only a single sentiment, thus these studies are not applicable to our goal.

Automatic acquisition of sentiment expressions have also been studied (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), but limited to adjectives, and only one sentiment could be assigned to each word.

This means that the approach for SA should be switched from the rather shallow analysis techniques used for text mining (Hearst, 1999; Nasukawa and Nagano, 2001), where some errors can be treated as noise, into deep analysis techniques such as those used for machine translation (MT) where all of the syntactic and semantic phenomena must be handled.

Many techniques which have been studied for the purpose of machine translation, such as word sense disambiguation (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Yarowsky, 1995), anaphora resolution (Mitamura et al., 2002), and automatic pattern extraction from corpora (Watanabe et al., 2003), can accelerate the further enhancement of sentiment analysis, or other NLP tasks.

We implemented an accurate sentiment analyzer by making use of an existing transfer-based machine translation engine (Watanabe, 1992), replacing the translation patterns and bilingual lexicons with sentiment patterns and a sentiment polarity lexicon.
