In the following sections, we will use Ï‡2 statistics to measure the the mutual translation likelihood (Church and Hanks, 1990).

Core of the Integrated Phrase Segmentation and Alignment The competitive linking algorithm (CLA) (Melamed, 1997) is a greedy word alignment algorithm.
P97-1063
In this paper, we describe the key idea behind this model and connect it with the competitive linking algorithm (Melamed, 1997) which was developed for word-to-word alignment.
P97-1063
In recent years, various phrase translation approaches (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Och et al., 1999; Koehn et al., 2003) have been shown to outperform word-to-word translation models (Brown et al., 1993).
