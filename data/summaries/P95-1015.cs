Kozima (1993) had 16 subjects segment a simplified short story, developed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion, and qualitatively compared the results.

Hearst (1994) presented two implemented segmentation algorithms based on term repetition, and compared the boundaries produced to the boundaries marked by at least 3 of 7 subjects, using information retrieval metrics.

Cue1 is assigned 'true' if the first lexical item in PI+I is a member of the set of cue words summarized in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993).

Tuning To improve performance, we analyzed the two types of IR errors made by the original NP algorithm (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) on the training data.

Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results.

2. 4The NP algorithm can assign multiple boundaries within one prosodic phrase if the phrase contains multiple clauses; these very rare cases are normalized (Passonneau and Litman, 1993).
P93-1020
As reported in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we first investigated whether units of global structure consisting of sequences of utterances could be reliably identified by naive subjects.
P93-1020
In previous work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units.

Hearst (1994) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of expository texts, to indicate topic changes.

For example, phrases beginning discourse segments were correlated with preceding pause duration in (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; ttirschberg and Grosz, 1992).

Reynar (1994) proposed an algorithm based on lexical cohesion in conjunction with a graphical technique, and used information retrieval metrics to evaluate the algorithm's performance in locating boundaries between concatenated news articles.

In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations.

The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner's (1986) tri-partite discourse model consists of multi-utterance segments whose hierarchical relations are isomorphic with intentional structure.

Several studies have used expert coders to locally and globally structure spoken discourse according to the model of Grosz and Sidnet (1986), including (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Stifleman, 1995).
H92-1089 J86-3001
To quantify their findings, these studies use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Moset and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Isard and Carletta, 1995).

Together, (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995) comprise an ongoing study using three corpora: professionally read AP news stories, spontaneous narrative, and read and spontaneous versions of task-oriented monologues.

Initial phrase position was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993); a potential correlation between discourse signaling uses of cue words and adjacency patterns between cue words was also suggested.

Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target goal for the performance of our algorithms (Gale et al., 1992).
P92-1032
As noted in (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), the NP features largely reflect Passonneau's hypotheses that adjacent utterances are more likely to contain expressions that corefer, or that are inferentially linked, if they occur within the same segment; and that a definite pronoun is more likely than a full NP to refer to an entity that was mentioned in the current segment, if not in the previous utterance.
P93-1020
Resuits included an absence of correlation of segmental structure with centering (Grosz et al., 1983; Kameyama, 1986), and poor correlation with the contrast between full noun phrases and pronouns.
