Statistical systems l;hal; do not incorporate linguistic analysis (Brown el: al., 1993) typically choose the most likely translation based on a statistical mode.l, i.e.., translation probability determines the translation.

These transtbr rules are pairs of corresponding rooted substructures, where a substructure (Matsumoto et al., 1993) is a connected set of arcs and nodes.

Apart from corpus size, there are two main difference between the two experiments: (1) the experimentl corpus was aligned completely by hand, whereas the Experiment 2 corpus was aligned automatically using the system described ill (Meyers et al., 1998a); and (2) the parsers were tuned to the experimentl sentences, but not the Experiment 2 sentences (that did not overlap with experinmntl).

This situation mirrors the t)roblem of choosing productions in a nondeterministic parser, in this paI)er, we descril)e a system for choosing transfer rules, based on statistical chart parsing (Bol)row, 1990; Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998).

In our Machine %'anslation system, transfer rules are generated automatically from parsed parallel text along the lines of (Matsulnoto el; al,, 1993; Meyers et al., 1996; Meyers et al., 1998b).

A probabilistic figure of merit (Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998) is devised for ranking edges.

A lot of our recent MT research has bo.en tbcused on solving this sparse data prol)lem through our develoi)ment of a sentence alignment progrmn (Meyers et al., 1998a).

Best-first probabilistic chart parsers (Bobrow, 1990; Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Caraballo and Charniak, 1997; Charniak et al., 1998) strive to find the best parse, without exhaustively trying all possible productions.

With respect to chart parsing, (Charniak et al., 1998) report that their parser can achieve good results while producing about three times tile mininmm number of edges required to produce the final parse.
