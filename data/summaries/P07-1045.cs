Experiments in both (Shriberg et al., 2000) and (Kim et al., 2004) find no conclusive winner among early fusion, additive late fusion, and multiplicative late fusion.

The verbal features that we have included are a representative sample from the literature (e.g., (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999)).
W99-0611
features We employ a set of verbal features that is similar to the features used by state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems that operate on text (e.g., (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999)).

Evaluation metric Coreference resolution is often performed in two phases: a binary classification phase, in which the likelihood of coreference for each pair of noun phrases is assessed; and a partitioning phase, in which the clusters of mutually-coreferring NPs are formed, maximizing some global criterion (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999).

Coreference resolution on text datasets is wellstudied (e.g., (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999)).
