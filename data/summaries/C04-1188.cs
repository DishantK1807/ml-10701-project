Hearst (1992) explored the use of lexical patterns for extracting hyponym relations, with patterns such as “such as.” Berland and Charniak (1999) extract “part-of” relations.

E.g., Ravichandran et al.(2003) collect surface patterns automatically in an unsupervised fashion using a collection of trivia question and answer pairs as seeds.

The use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based QA received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier QA Tracks at TREC showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002).

Mann (2002) describes a method for extracting instances from text by means of part-of-speech patterns involving proper nouns.

and Corpus To get a clear picture of the impact of using different information extraction methods for the offline construction of knowledge bases, similarly to (Fleischman et al., 2003), we focused only on questions about persons, taken from the TREC8 through TREC 2003 question sets.

The row labelled Precision shows the precision of the extracted information (i.e., how many entries are correct, according to a human annotator) estimated by random sampling and manual evaluation of 1% of the data for each table, similar to (Fleischman et al., 2003).
P03-1001
This confirms the results of Fleischman et al.(2003): shallow methods may benefit significantly from the post-processing.
P03-1001
The precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (Fleischman et al., 2003).
P03-1001
Fleischman et al.(2003) focus on the precision of the information extracted using simple partof-speech patterns.
P03-1001
The recall problem is usually addressed by increasing the amount of text data for extraction (taking larger collections (Fleischman et al., 2003)) or by developing more surface patterns (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2002).

(Fleischman et al., 2003; Jijkoun et al., 2003).
P03-1001
In our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and, probably, more accurate filtering methods (Fleischman et al., 2003) on the QA results.
P03-1001
The usual recall and precision metrics (e.g., how many of the interesting bits of information were detected, and how many of the found bits were actually correct) require either a test corpus previously annotated with the required information, or manual evaluation (Fleischman et al., 2003).
