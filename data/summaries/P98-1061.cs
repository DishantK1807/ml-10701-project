We then give a formal account of the optimisation process and a possible parsing algorithm that makes use of it 1. 2 Automaton-based parsing Conventional LTAG parsers (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985; Schabes and Joshi, 1988; VijayShanker and Weir, 1993) maintain a parse table, a set of items corresponding to complete and partial constituents.
