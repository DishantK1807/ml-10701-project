Each boundary, which is a minimum of the cohesion graph, was weighted by the sum of the differences between its value and the values of the two maxima around it, as in (Hearst, 1997).
J97-1003
Kozima (1993) exploits a lexical network built from a machine readable dictionary (MRD).
P93-1041
Hearst (1997) and Nomoto and Nitta (1994) detect this coherence through patterns of lexical cooccurrence.
C94-2187 J97-1003
As in (Hearst, 1997), boundaries found by the method are weighted and sorted in decreasing order.
J97-1003
Hearst. 1997.

Morris and Hirst (1991) and Kozima (1993) find topic boundaries in the texts by using lexical cohesion.
J91-1002 P93-1041
Morris and Hirst (1991) extract this knowledge from a thesaurus.
J91-1002
The cohesion between words has been evaluated with the mutual information measure, as in (Church and Hanks, 1990).
J90-1003
A first qualitative evaluation of the method has been done with about 20 texts but without a formal protocol as in (Hearst, 1997).
