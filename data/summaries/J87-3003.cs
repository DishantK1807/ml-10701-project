These efforts are described in detail in Chodorow, et al.(1985). They begin with Head Finding.

Filtering. Filtering, described in Chodorow, et a1.(1985), is a method for expanding a set of words each of which has a given property.
P85-1037
It has become clear that the construction of computer systems that process natural language requires the creation of large computerized lexicons with extensive and accurate syntactic and semantic information about words (see Byrd(1986a), Ingria(1986)).
P86-1019
Head finding, also described in Chodorow, et a1.(1985) and in Calzolari(1984a), is a method for automatically discovering the hypernym (or genus term) for a word by analyzing its dictionary definition.
P84-1036 P84-1095 P85-1037
Work reported in Alshawi(1985), Calzolari (1983,1984a,b), Lesk(1986), Michiels(1982), etc., describe various attempts to decipher and extract information in machine-readable versions of published dictionaries (henceforth: MRDs).

These are also familiar Query-by-Example concepts and are described in a relational context in IBM(1978), and in the context of LDBs in Neff, et a1.(1988).

DAM. The Dictionary Access Method (Byrd, et al.(1986b)) provides random and sequential access to dictionary entries associated with words which serve as search keys.
P86-1019
Individual tools and their use in that project have been described elsewhere (Chodorow, et a1.(1985), Byrd and Chodorow(1985), Byrd, et al.(1986b), Chodorow and Ravin(1987), Neff and Byrd(1987)).
P85-1034 P85-1037 P86-1019
Markowitz et al.(1986) present linguistic motivations for extracting an "active" and "stative" feature for verbs, and suggest methods for using MRD's as sources for finding active/stative information for verbs.
