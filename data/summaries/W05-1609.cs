We interpret these representations on a model of the visual scene, capturing proximal and projective spatial relations between objects [Kelleher and Kruijff, 2005b].

We process the acoustic signal using Sphinx4 [Walker et al., 2004] with a domain-specific, English language model, and then parse the recognized string using the OpenCCG parser for combinatory categorial grammar [Baldridge, 2002].

[Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002; White and Baldridge, 2003] show how HLDS representations can be built compositionally with CCG using unification, and compare HLDS to other semantic formalisms like Minimal Recursion Semantics [Copestake et al., 1997].
P02-1041
Our approach places us squarely in the full generation camp, but there is a continuum: Using the approach to including canned text as proposed in [Foster and White, 2004], we can freely position the actual planner between full generation and pre-baked generation.

We adopt their idea of an utterance as a description, generated from a communicative goal, and also use an “ontologically promiscuous” formalism for representing meaning [Hobbs, 1985].

2.1 Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS; [Kruijff, 2001; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002]) is an “ontologically promiscuous” [Hobbs, 1985] framework for representing the propositional content (or meaning) of an expression as an ontologically richly sorted, relational structure.

§2.1. Second, we can organize the computational CCG lexicon as a collection of (monotonic) inheritance hierarchies [Baldridge, 2002].

For training the planner we discuss in this paper, we are not only interested in ensuring that we obtain a logical form that is appropriate given the communicative goal to be expressed (or, in a more structured way, comparable to the rhetorical structures considered in [Stent et al., 2004]); the logical form also needs to be appropriate given ’the’ context.

The resulting approach is related to [Stone and Doran, 1997; Cassell et al., 2000].
P97-1026 W00-1423
We establish a common ground for interpretation across modalities by relating each layer to a set of ontologies that model categories on which the events, states, and entities at that layer can be interpreted, following recent work in information fusion [Wache et al., 2001] and dialogue systems [Gurevych et al., 2003].
W03-0903
The logical forms we operate on are all specified in a single formalism, namely Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS), meaning we have a representational continuum between discourse-level and utterance-level representations [Kruijff, 2001; Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002], and can guide utterance planning through content decisions made at higher levels.
