(Neumann et al., 1997)) by replacing the original bidirectional shallow buttom-up parsing module with the DC-PARSER.

Details concerning the representation and compilation of the used finite state machinery can be found in (Neumann et al., 1997) 4In this paper we can give only a brief overview of the current coverage of the individual steps.

The FRAGMENT RECOGNIZER uses finite state grammars in order to extract nominal and prepositional phrases, where the named entities recognized by the preprocessor are integrated into appropriate places (unplausibte phrases are rejected by agreement checking; see (Neumann et al., 1997) for more 243 details)).

The majority of existing IE systems are applied to English text, but there are now a number of systems which process other languages as well (e.g., German (Neumann et al., 1997), Italian (Ciravegna et al., 1999) or Japanese (Sekine and Nobata, 1998)).

All rules are compiled into a single finite-state transducer according to the approach described in (Roche and Schabes, 1995).

The new shallow text processor is a direct successor of the one used in the SMES-system, an IE-core system for real world German text processing (Neumann et al., 1997).
