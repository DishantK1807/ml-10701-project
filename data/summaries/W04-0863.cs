The component models were also used in other Senseval-3 tasks: Semantic Role Labeling (Ngai et al., 2004) and the lexical sample tasks for Chinese and English, as well as the Multilingual task (Carpuat et al., 2004).

The feature engineering (and construction of three other component models which are described in (Wicentowski et al., 2004)) was performed at Swarthmore College, while the Hong Kong team constructed two component models based on wellknown machine learning algorithms.
