ˇCmejrek et al.(2003), while not focusing on the use of morphology, give results indicating that lemmatization of the Czech input improves BLEU score relative to baseline.

In addition, Niessen and Ney (2004) decompose German words into a hierarchical representation using lemmas and morphological tags, and use a MaxEnt model to combine the different levels of representation in the translation model.

Our translation models were trained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), which we modi1Although we did not use it for the experiments in this paper, the PCEDT corpus does contain lemma information for the English data.

Based on previous results (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999; ˇCmejrek et al., 2003), we expected that this transformation would lead to an improvement in translation quality due to reduction of data sparseness.

Another project utilizing morphological analysis for statistical machine translation is described by Lee (2004).

Niessen and Ney (2000; 2004) report work on German-English translation, where they investigate various types of morphosyntactic restructuring, including merging German verbs with their detached prefixes, annotating a handful of frequent ambiguous German words with POS tags, combining idiomatic multi-word expressions into single words, and undoing question in676 version and do-insertion in both German and English.
