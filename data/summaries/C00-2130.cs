Our system attempts to recognize these syntactic patterus; in addition, it considers as unfamiliar some definites occurring in 4This list was developed by hand; more recently, Bean and Riloff (1999) proposed methods for autolnatically extracting fl'om a corpus such special predicates, i.e., heads that correlate well with discourse novelty.

Recognizing the hierarchical structure of segments in a text is, howevm; still pretty umch an open problem, kS it involves reasoning about intentions; 2 better results have been achieved on the simpler task of 'chtlnking' the text into approximate segments, generally by means of lexical density measures (Hearst, 1997) In fact, the lnethods Io limit the lifespan of discourse entity we considered for our system were even simplel: One type of heuristics we looked at are window-based techniques, i.e., considering as potential antecedents only the discourse entities within fixed-size windows of previous sentences, allowing however for some discourse entities to take a longer life span: we call this method LOOSE SEGMENTATION.

In previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we reported the results of corpus annotation experiments in which the subjects were asked to classify lhe uses of delinite descriptions in Wall Stree Journal articles according to a scheme derived from work by Hawkins (1978) and Prince (1981 ) and including three classes: I)III'~CT ANAPltORA, I)ISCOURSENEW, and I~RIDGING DESCIII'TION (Clark, 1977).

The final configuration of the system was arrived at on the basis of an extensive ewfluation of the hemislics using Ihe corpus annotated in our previous work (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).

In our corpus study (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) we found that our subjects did better at ideutifying discourse-new descriptions all together (K=.68) than they did at distinguish 'unfamiliar' from 'larger situation' (Hawkins, 1978) cases (K = .63).

The final order of application was also arrived at on the basis of an extensive evaluation (Vieira, 1998), and is based on the l'ollowing strategy: 6 5A more recent version o1' the system using the named entity recognition software developed by ItCRC for the MUC-7 competition (Mikheev el al., 1999) is discussed in (Isbikawa, 1998).

902 Furthermore, the relation between bridging descriptions and their anchors may be arbitrarily complex (Clark, 1977; Sidnm; 1979; Prince, 1981; Strand, 1996) and our own results indicate that the stone description may relate to different anchors in a text, which makes it difficult to decide what the intended anchor and the intended link are (Poesio and Vieira, 1998).

Overview At the moment, the only systems engaged in semantic interpretation whose performance can be evaluated on l'aMy unrestricted text such as the Wall Street Journal articles are based on a shallowprocessing approach, i.e., that do not rely on extensive amounts of hand-coded commonsense knowledge (Carter, 1987; Appelt, 1995; Humphreys et al., 1998).
