Thus, conventional methods had to introduce some kinds of restrictions such as the limitation of the kind of chains or the length of chains to be extracted (Smadja 1993, Shinnou and Isahara 1995).

There are many method proposed to extract rigid expressions from corpora such as a method of focusing on the binding strength of two words (Church and Hanks 1990); the distance between words (Smadja and Makeown 1990); and the number of combined words and frequency of appearance (Kita 1993, 1994).

Recently, a new method which can calculate arbitrary number of n-gram statistics for very large corpora has been proposed (Nagao and Mori 1994).
