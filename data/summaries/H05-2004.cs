Its architecture is based on the top system in the 2005 CoNLL shared task (Koomen et al., 2005), modified to process raw text using lower level processors but maintaining 6 good real time performance.

Its performance is 77.88 and 65.87 F1-score on WSJ and Brown test sets (Carreras and M`arquez, 2005) while the original system achieves 77.11 and 65.6 on the same test sets without the combination of multiple parser outputs and 79.44 and 67.75 with the combination.

Details of them can be found in (Koomen et al., 2005).

In addition, our system exploits a heuristic modified from that introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004) to filter out very unlikely constituents.

Next, sentences are analyzed by a state-of-the-art syntactic parser (Charniak, 2000) the output of which provides useful information for the main SRL module.
