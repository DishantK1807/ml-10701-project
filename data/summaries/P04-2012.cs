For example, Goldsmith (2001) does not separate these two types of search.
J01-2001
Monson et al.(2004) investigate a series of heuristic search algorithms.
W04-0107
Goldsmith (2001), by searching over a space of morphology models limited to substitution of suffixes, ties morphology yet closer to orthography.
J01-2001
The search algorithms discussed in Monson et al.(2004) focus on searching the c-suffix set inclusion relations and only utilize morpheme boundary links as a constraint.

Next along the spectrum of orthographic similarity bias is the work of Schone and Jurafsky (2000; 2001), who first acquire a list of potential morphological variants using an orthographic similarity technique due to Gaussier (1999) in which pairs of words with the same initial string are identified.
N01-1024 W00-0712 W99-0904
Yarowsky et al.(2001), who acquire a morphological analyzer for a language by projecting the morphological analysis of a second language onto the first through a clever application of statistical machine translation style word alignment probabilities, place no constraints on the orthographic shape of related word forms.
H01-1035
Monson et al.(2004) uses the framework discussed in this paper and presents results using an intuitive baseline search strategy.
