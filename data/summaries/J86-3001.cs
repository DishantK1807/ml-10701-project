The focusing process associates a focus space with each discourse segment; this space contains those entities that are salient either because they have been mentioned explicitly in the segment or because they became salient in the process of producing or comprehending the utterances in the segmfnt (as in the original work on focusing: Grosz 1978a).

One such mechanism is centering (which we previously called immediate focusing; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983; Sidner 1979).

The theory described in this paper differs from Polanyi and Scha's (1984; and other more radically different proposals as well; e.g., Linde and Goguen 1978, Cohen 1983, Reich192 Computational Linguistics, Volume 12, Number 3, July-September 1986 Barbara J.

Grosz (1978a) demonstrated that the notions of focusing and task structure are necessary for understanding and producing task-oriented dialogue.

We can now also clarify some misinterpretations of focus-space diagrams and task structure in our earlier work (Grosz 1978a, 1981, 1974).

Sidner Attention, Intentions, and the Structure of Discourse The theory is a further development and integration of two lines of research: work on focusing in discourse (Grosz 1978a, 1978b, 1981) and more recent work on intention recognition in discourse (Sidner and Israel 1981; Sidner 1983; 1985; Allen 1983, Litman 1985; Pollack 1986).
