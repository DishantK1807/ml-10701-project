HLT-03 best is Ralign.EF.1 (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).
W03-0301
The evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and F-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the Alignment Error Rate (AER), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable.

HLT-03 best is XRCE.Nolem (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

It is important because a wordaligned corpus is typically used as a first step in order to identify phrases or templates in phrase-based Machine Translation (Och et al., 1999), (Tillmann and Xia, 2003), (Koehn et al., 2003, sec.

On limited resources, Ralign.EF.1 (Simard and Langlais, 2003) produced the best F-score, as well as the best AER when NULL alignments were taken into account, while XRCE.Nolem.EF.3 (Dejean et al., 2003) produced the best AER when NULL alignments were discounted.

1). Although the first three are particular cases where N=1 and/or M=1, the distinction is relevant, because most word-based translation models (eg IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)) can typically not accommodate general M-N alignments.

HLT-03 best F is Ralign.EF.1 and best AER is XRCE.Nolem.EF.3 (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

and Using Parallel Texts (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

We also compared the performance on the 447 test sentences to 1/ the intersection of the alignments produced by the top IBM4 alignments in either directions, and 2/ the best systems from (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

We use the data provided for the French-English shared task of the 2003 HLTNAACL Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).

3), or for projecting linguistic annotation across languages (Yarowsky et al., 2001).

The data is from the Canadian Hansard, and reference alignments were originally produced by Franz Och and Hermann Ney (Och and Ney, 2000).
C00-2163
The ’HLT-03 best’ is our earlier work (Dejean et al., 2003), simply based on IBM4 alignment using an additional lexicon extracted from the corpus.

Note that our use of cepts differs slightly from that of (Brown et al., 1993, sec.3), inasmuch cepts may not overlap, according to our definition.

Obtaining a word-aligned corpus usually involves training a word-based translation models (Brown et al., 1993) in each directions and combining the resulting alignments.
