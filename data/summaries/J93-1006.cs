our texts, one character in English on average gives rise to somewhat more than 1.2 characters in German, and the correlation between the lengths (in characters) of aligned paragraphs in the two languages was with 0.952 lower than the 0.991 that are mentioned in Gale and Church (1991), which supports our impression that the Scientific American texts we used are hard texts to align, but it is not clear to what extent this would deteriorate the results.

Perhaps the best-known example of this approach is to be found in Sato and Nagao (1990).

The analytic formula relies on word-frequency data derived from a large corpus instead of on a stochastic model for word frequency distribution (such as Zipf's law, which states that the frequency with which words occur in a text is indirectly proportional to the number of words with this frequency; for a recent discussion of more accurate models, see also Baayen \[1991\]).

discussion could also be cast in an information theoretic framework using the notion of "mutual information" (Fano 1961), estimating the variance of the degree of match in order to find a frequency-threshold (see Church and Hanks 1990).

Gale and Church (1991) note that their method performed considerably better when lengths of sentences were measured in number of characters instead of in number of words.

5. Related Work Since we addressed the text translation alignment problem in 1988, a number of researchers, among them Gale and Church (1991) and Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991), have worked on the problem.

Another example is the completely automatic, statistical approach to translation taken by the research group at IBM (Brown et al.1990), which takes a large corpus of text with aligned translations as its point of departure.

The method of Brown, Lai, and Mercer (1991) is based on a hidden Markov model for the generation of aligned pairs of corpora, whose parameters are estimated from a large text.
P91-1022
In Section 5 we discuss other approaches to the alignment problem that were subsequently undertaken by other researchers (Gale and Church 1991; Brown, Lai, and Mercer 1991).
