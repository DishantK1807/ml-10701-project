1 Additionally, (Passonneau & Litman 1993) concede the difficulty of eliciting hierarchical intentional structure with any degree of consistency from their human judges.

Morris and Hirst's pioneering work on computing discourse structure from lexical relations (Morris & Hirst 1991), (Morris 1988) is a precursor to the work reported on here.

(1993). The use of discourse cues for detection of segment boundaries and other discourse purposes has been extensively researched, although predominantly on spoken text (see Hirschberg & Litman (1993) for a summary of six research groups' treatments of 64 cue words).

ogy that occurred in all of them reappears in this one location (in the spirit of a Grosz ~; Sidner (1986) "pop" operation).
J86-3001
As another possible alternative Kozima (1993) has suggested using a (computationally expensive) semantic similarity metric to find similarity among terms within a small window of text (5 to 7 words).
P93-1041
Since the Morris & Hirst (1991) algorithm attempts to discover attentional/intentional structure, their goals are different than those of TextTiling.
J91-1002
Passonneau & Litman (1993) discuss at length considerations about evaluating segmentation algorithms according to reader judgment information.

For example, disambiguation algorithms that train on arbitrary-size text windows, e.g., Yarowsky (1992) and Gale et ai.

The chains are used to structure texts according to the attentional/intentional theory of discourse structure (Grosz & Sidner 1986), and the extent of the chains correspond to the extent of a segment.
J86-3001
The second method, an extension of Morris & Hirst's (1991) approach, keeps track of active chains of repeated terms, where membership in a chain is determined by location in the text.
J91-1002
In Passonneau & Litman's (1993) data, if 4 or more out of 7 judges mark a boundary, the segmentation is found to be significant using a variation of the Q-test (Cochran 1950).

Following the advice of Gale et al.(1992a), I compare the Mgorithm against both upper and lower bounds.
