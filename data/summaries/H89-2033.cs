Due to the very low error rate with the Word-Pair grammar, we will use the statistical class grammar (Derr, 1989) for most of our testing as it will be easier to measure improvements using this more difficult and more realistic grammar.

However, the N-Best algorithm, (Chow, 1989) which is described elsewhere in these proceedings can be used to solve this problem.

In fact, three research sites (Paul, 1989; Lee, 1989; Murveit, 1989) reported modeling triphone context across word boundaries at the February 1989 meeting.
