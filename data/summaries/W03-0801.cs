TEXTRACT is ‘populated’ by a number of plugins, providing functionalities for: • tokenization; • document structure analysis, from tags and white space; • lexicon interface, complete with efficient lookup and full morphology; • importation of lexical and vocabulary analyses from a non-TEXTRACT process via XML markup; • analysis of out-of-vocabulary words (Park, 2002); • abbreviation finding and expansion (Park and Byrd, 2001); • named entity identification and classification (person names, organizations, places, and so forth) (Ravin and Wacholder, 1997); • technical term identification, in technical prose (Justeson and Katz, 1995); • vocabulary determination and glossary extraction, in specialized domains (Park et al., 2002); • vocabulary aggregation, with reduction to canonical form, within and across documents; • part-of-speech tagging (with different taggers) for determining syntactic categories in context; • shallow syntactic parsing, for identifying phrasal and clausal constructs and semantic relations (Boguraev, 2000); • salience calculations, both of interand intradocument salience; • analysis of topic shifts within a document (Boguraev and Neff, 2000a); • document clustering, cluster organization, and cluster labeling; • single document summarization, configurable to deploy different algorithmic schemes (sentence extraction, topical highlights, lexical cohesion) (Boguraev and Neff, 2000a, 2000b); • multi-document summarization, using iterative residual rescaling (Ando et al., 2000); • pattern matching, deploying finite state technology specially designed to operate over document content abstractions (as opposed to a character stream alone).

A number of applications utilizing TFST include a shallow parser (Boguraev, 2000), a front end to a glossary identification tool (Park et al., 2002), a parser for temporal expressions, a named entity recognition device, and a tool for extracting hypernym relations.

In Cunningham, et al.(1997), GATE is described as “a software infrastructure on top of which heterogeneous NLP processing modules may be evaluated and refined individually or may be combined into larger application systems.” Thus, both Talent and GATE address the needs of researchers and developers, on the one hand, and of application builders, on the other.

In a move towards a fully declarative representation of linguistic information, where an annotation maximally shares an underlying set of linguistic properties, a rational re-design of TEXTRACT (Ferrucci and Lally, 2003) is adopting a hierarchical system of feature-based annotation types; it has been demonstrated that even systems supporting strict single inheritance only are powerful enough for a variety of linguistic processing applications (Shieber, 1986), largely through their wellunderstood mathematical properties (Carpenter, 1992).

Cunningham, et al.(1997) emphasize that CREOLE modules, which can encapsulate both algorithmic and data resources, are mainly created by wrapping preexisting code to meet the GDM APIs.

These include named relation extraction (Byrd and Ravin, 1999), custom dictionary building (Park, et al., 2001), indexing for question answering (Prager et al., 2000), cross-document coreference (Ravin and Kazi, 1999), and statistical collection analysis for document summarization or lexical navigation (Cooper and Byrd, 1997).

By exposing access to the common analysis substrate and the document object, and by exploiting a mechanism for declaring, and interpreting, dependencies among individual plugins, the interface further offers functionality similar to that of GATE (Cunningham, 2002).
