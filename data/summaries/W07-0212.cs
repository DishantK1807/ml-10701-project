Appendix A: Derivation of the Probability of RWE We take a noisy channel approach, which is a common technique in NLP (for example (Brown et al., 1993)), including spellchecking (Kernighan et al., 1990).

It is interesting to note that although most of the naturally and socially occurring networks exhibit a power-law degree distribution (see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003; i Cancho and Sol´e, 2004; Choudhury et al., 2006) and references therein), SpellNets feature exponential degree distribution.

Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spellcheckers incorporate context information and the current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns (Biemann, 2006).

In recent times, complex networks have been successfully employed to model and explain the structure and organization of several natural and social phenomena, such as the foodweb, protien interaction, formation of language inventories (Choudhury et al., 2006), syntactic structure of languages (i Cancho and Sol´e, 2004), WWW, social collaboration, scientific citations and many more (see (Albert and Barab´asi, 2002; Newman, 2003) and references therein).
