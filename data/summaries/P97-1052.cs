More recently, (Genabith and Crouch, 1996) presented a method for providing a direct and underspecified interpretation of f-structures by interpreting them as quasi-logical forms (QLFs) (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992).

\[\[Aq~ is defined in terms of a supervaluation construction over {CO q ....., CO q} (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992) resulting in the three-valued: \[Aq\] = 1 ifffor all co~ E ~)q(Aq), \[COq\] ~.

Previous approaches to providing semantic components for LFGs concentrated on providing schemas for relating (or translating) fstructures (in)to sets of disambiguated semantic representations which are then interpreted model theoretically (Halvorsen, 1983; Halvorsen and Kaplan, 1988; Fenstad et al., 1987; Wedekind and Kaplan, 1993; Dalrymple et al., 1996).

This is specified lexically by IT : r The semantics is defined in terms of disambiguations & It takes its cue from the definition of the consequence relation; in the most recent version (Reyle, 1995) with correlated disambiguations 8t V61( r~, D M') resulting in a conjunctive interpretation of a goal UDRS.

In this companion paper we show that f-structures are just as easily interpretable as UDRSs (Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995): coach(x) layer(y) I pick(x,y) I We do this in terms of a translation function r from f-structures to UDRSs.

UDRT (Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995) allows partial specifications of scope relations.

contrast to other proof systems the UDRS proof systems (Reyle, 1993; Reyle, 1995; Kbnig and Reyle, 1996) operate directly on underspecified representations avoiding (whenever possible) the need to consider disambiguated cases.
