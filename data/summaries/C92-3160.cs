of Implementation A first prototype of the system described above has been developed in C under UNIX within the ESPRIT I1 project 2315 "Translator's Workbench" (TWB) as one of several orthogonal modules checking basic as well as higher levels (like grammar and style; see (Thurmair, 1990) and (Winkelmann, 1990)) of various languages.

Although in comparison with English, French, Italian, and Spanish, German seems to be unique as concerns co-occurrence restrictions ff)r upper/lower case st)ellings in a large number of cases, there are at least, as indicated in (Gross, 1986), the thousands of compounds or frozen words in each of these languages which are clearly within reach fflr tile methods discussed.

Folk)wing Gross (Gross, 1986) and Zimlnermann (Zimmermanll, 1987), we prt/posc to further extend standard spelling correction systems onto the level of frozen phrases by simply lnaking thenl capable of treating more than a single word at a time.

European languages contain thousands (if what Mauriee Gross calls "frozen" or "compound words" (G ross, 1986).
C86-1001
On the basis of work done by Zellig Harris (Harris, 1970) and Maurice Gross (Gross, 1986) we have identified this level as that of so-called "frozen phrases", and we have proposed and implemented an automatic pmofi'eading system that covers a significant amount of the frozen phrases of German.

Yet, as Gross (Gross, 1986) indicates, at least tile entirely and nearly entirely tl-OZell Rirms can be recognized and compared with the hel l) of simple string operations.
