SENT~ fair Although there has been some previous work on the sentence alignment, e.g., (Brown, Lai, and Mercer, 1991), (Kay and Rtscheisen, 1988), (Catizone et al., to appear), the alignment task remains a significant obstacle preventing many potential users from reaping many of the benefits of bilingual corpora, because the proposed solutions are often unavailable, unreliable, and/or computationally prohibitive.

Aligning sentences is just a first step toward constructing a probabilistic dictionary (Table 3) for use in aligning words in machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), or for constructing a bilingual concordance (Table 4) for use in lexicography (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990).

We used the same procedure which is used in (Church, 1988).

It might seem that words are a more natural linguistic unit than characters 183 (Brown, Lai and Mercer, 1991).

1. Introduction Researchers in both machine lranslation (e.g., Brown et al, 1990) and bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990) have recently become interested in studying bilingual corpora, bodies of text such as the Canadian I-lansards (parliamentary debates) which are available in multiple languages (such as French and English).
