We first try to give a more precise definition of what an anytinm algorithm is.
We arque that parsing algorithms have to be classified as contract algorithms as opposed to (truly) it> terruptible algorithms.
With the restriction that the transaction being active at the time an inl,errupt, is issued has to be COml)leted before the interrupt cart be executed, it is possible to provide a parser with linritcd anytime t)ehavior, which is in fact t)dng realized in our re.search l)rototype.
1 Introduction
The idea of '%nylime algorithms", which has been around in the tieht of plmming for some time 1, has recently been suggested for application in natural language and speech l)rocessing (NL/SP) 2.
An anytime algorithm is an algorit.hm "whose quality of results (legrades graceflflly a~s computation time decreases" (\[Russell attd Zilt)erstein 1991\], p.
212). In the following we will first give a more specilic definition of which properties allow an algorithm to be implemented and used as an anytime algorithm.
We then apply this knowledge to a specitic aspect of NL/SP, namely parsing algorithms in a speech understanding system.
In the Appendix we present the A I)C protocol which supports anytime computations.
We will discuss these matters in the framework of the Verbmobil joint research project a, where we are working on the implementation of an incremental chart parser 4.
The conception of this I)arser has been derived from earlier work by the llrst author 5.

2 Ai,ytime Algorithms \[1)etm and Boddy 1988\] give the fi)llowing characteri~ zation of anytime algorithms: 1.

they lend themselves to preemptive scheduling techniques (i.e., they cart bc suspended and resumed with negligible overhead), they can be terminated at any time and will return SOl\[le answer~ and the attswers reI, urned iml)rove in some weltbehaved maturer as a function of time.
Unforl,unately this characterization does not make a clear distinction between the intplementation of an algorithm and tile algorithm as such.
Point (1) is true of a great many Mgorithms implemented on preenq)tive operatirLg systems.
Poin~ (2) can be made true for any algorithm by adding all explicit Result slot, that is I)reset by a wdue.
denoting a w)id result.
I,et us call the implementation of an anyl;inm algorithm an anytime producer.
Accordingly we ttanle the entity interested in the result of such an anytime computation the anytime consumer.
Figurc 1 shows two such processes in a tightly coupled synchronization loop.
Figure 2 shows the same communicating processes decoupled by the introduction of the Result slot.
Note that synrhronisation is much cheaper in terms of perceived complexity R)r the programrne.r and runtime synehronisation overhead (just the time to cheek and eventually traverse the mutual exclusion barrier).
In such an architecture producer and consumer work under a regime that allows the consmner to interrupt the producer at any lime and dentand a result.
The risk that the consumer incurs by such flexibility is a eertMn non-zero probability that this result is void ~ or mtchanged since the last result retrievah 6The faihn'e to provide an answer within a given anmunt of time nlay ill itself I)e an interesting and meaningflal result for the ally Linle consumet'.

Point (3) is surely a much too strong restriction, since it is not always possible to define what exactly an improvement is for any given algorithm.
In NL/SP, where we are often dealing with scored hypotheses, it is difficult, if not impossible, to devise algorithms that supply answers that improve monotonically as a flmction of invested computational resources (time or processing units in a parallel architecture).
We propose the following characterization of anytime algorithms: An algorithm is fit to be used as an anytime producer if its implementation yields a program that has a Result Production Granularity (RPG) that is cmnpatible with the time constraints of the consumer.
The notion of RPG is based on the following observation: Computations being performed on fnite state machines do not proceed directly from goal state to goal state.
Instead they go through arbitrarily large sequences of states that yield no extractable or intelligible data to an outside observer.
To interrupt a producer on any of these intermediate states is fruitless, since the result obtained could at best, according to the observation made on point (2) above, be the result that was available in the last goal state of the producer.
From the point of view of the consumer the transitions from goal state to goal state in the producer are atomic transactions.
The average length of these transactions in the algorithm correspond to average time intervals in the implementation, so that we can speak of a granularity with which results are produced.
The time constraints under which the eonsumer is operating then give the final verdict if the implemeutation of an algorithm is usable as an anytime producer.
Let us illustrate this by an example: In a real-time NL/SP-system tim upper bound for the RPG will I, ypieally be in the range of 10 lOOms.
That is, a producer implemented with such an RPG ofl>rs the consumer the chance to trade a 500ms delay for 5 to 50 fllrther potential solutions.
Note that goal states can also be associated with intermediate results in the producer algorithm.
Conceptually there really is not much of a difference between a result and an intermediate result,, but in highly optimized implementations there might be the need to explicitly export such intermediate results, due to data representation incompatibilities or simply because the data might be overwritten by other (non-result) data.
Section 4 gives an example of how the RPG of an implementation can be reduced by identifying intermediate goal states that yield information which is of interest to the consumer.
3 Breadth
and Depth of Analysis In the following we will ask whether and how the idea of anytime producers can be applied within the active chart parsing algorithm scheme with feature unification.
Although the analogy to decision making in planning where the idea of anytime algorithms has been developed seems to be rather shallow, we can, for the operation of the parser, distinguish between depth and breadth of analysis 7.
We define depth of analysis as the concept refering to the growing size of information content in a feature structure over a given set of non-competing word hypotheses in a certain time segment during its computation.
Larger depth corresponds to a more detailed linguistic description of the same objects.
In contrast, we understand by breadth of analysis the consideration of linguistic descriptions resulting from the analysis of growing sets of word hypotheses, either from growing segments of the utterance to be parsed or from a larger number of competing word hypotheses in a given time segment.
q'o regard breadth of analysis as a measure in the context of the anytime algorithm concept is in a sense r not to |)e confused with depth-first or breadth-first search.
998 trivial: Considering only one l)arse, the more processing time the parser is given the larger the analyzed segment of the input utterance will be.
In general, larger breadth corresponds to more information about competing word hypotheses in an (half-) open time interval as opposed to more information about a given word sequence.
So, obviously, breadth of analysis does not correspond to what is intended by the concel)t of anytime algorithms, whereas depth of analysis meets the inliention.
If an utterance is syntactically ambiguous, we (:an compute more parses the more processing time the parser is given.
Therefore, tohis case is apart, icular instance of depth of analysis, beeaase the same word sequence is considered, and not of breadth of analysis given the definition above.
In this case one would like to get the best analysis in terms of the quality scores of its constituents first, and other readings late,', ordered by score.
If the parser works incrementally, what happens to be the case for the Verbmobil/15 parser s, the intended effect car, be achieved by the adjustment of a strategy parameter namely to report the analysis of a grammatical fragment of the input utterance as soon as it is found.
At least one distinction might be useful for the Verbmobil/\[5 parser.
In our parser a category check is performed on two chart edges for eIficiency reasons, and only if this check is successflfi, the unificatkm of the associated feature structures is performed, llence, an interrupt would be admissible after,,he category check.
In this case we emphasize a factorization of the set; of constraints in two distinct subsets: phrasal constraints which are processed by the act.iw~ chart parsing algorithm schema (with l)olynomial complexity), and functional constraints which are solved by the unification algorithm (with exponential complexity).
'rhe interface between both types of constraints is a crucial place for the introduction of control in the parsing process in general 9 Since we use a constraint-hased grammar formalism, whose central operation is the unification of feature structures, it does not make sense to admit inter rupts at any time.
Instead, the operation of the parser consists of a sequence of transactions.
At the most coarse grained level, a transaction would be an application of the flmdamental rule of active chart t)arsing, i.e. a series of operations which ends when a new edge is introduced into the chart, including the computation of the feature structure associated with it.
Of course this argument holds when an application of the fundamental rule results in another application of it on subunits due to the reeursive structure of the grammar ruleQ °.
Certainly one might ask whether a smaller grain size makes sense, i.e. the construclion of a feature structure should itself he interruptible.
In this case one could think of the possibility of au interrupt.
Sand for Gul,t' as well 9 cf.
\[Maxwell and Kaplan 1994\] l°This h,'ts been implemented in the interrupt system of (lul,l) \[Ggrz 1988\].
after one feature in one of the two feature structures to be unified has been l)roeessed.
We think that this possibility shouhl be rejected, since feature structures usually contain eoreli'.rences.
If we consider a partial feature structure as in an intermediate step in the unitication of two feature structures in the situation where just one feature has been processed, this structure might not be a realistic partial description of the part of speech under consideration, but simply inadequate as long as not all embedded eoreferences have been established.
It seems obvious that the grain size cannot be meaningfully decreased below the processing of one feature.
Therefore we decided that transactions must be defined in terms of computations of whole feature structures.
Nevertheless, a possibility for interrupting the computation of a feature structure could be considered in case the set of featnre, s is divided in ~wo classes: features which are obligatory and features which are optional.
Members of the last group are candidates for constraint relaxation which seems to be relevant with respect to robustness at least in the case of speech parsing.
We have just started to work on the constraint relaxation problem, but there is no doubt that this is an important issue for further research.
Nevertheless, at the time being we doubt whether the above mentione.d problem with coreferences couht be avoided in this case.
A further opportunity for interrupts comes up in cases where the processing of alternatives in unifying disjm)ctiw~' feature structures is delayed.
In this case, unilication with one of the disjuncts can be considered as a transaction.
Another chance R)r the implementation of anytime behavior in parsing arises if we consider the grammar from a linguistic perspective ~ oppose.d to the purely formal view taken above.
Since semantic construction is done by our grammar as well, the functional constraints contain a distinct subset for the purpose of semantic construction.
In a separate b, vestigation \[Fischer 1994\] implemented a version of A-I)t;I ~ \[l)inkal 1993\] within the.
same feature unification fo> realism which buihts semantic structures within the framework of Discourse Representation Theory.
It has been shown that the process of DRS construction can be split in two types of transactions, one which can be performed incrementally basically the construction of event representations without temporal information -and another one which cannot be concluded before the end of an utterance has been reached supplying temporal information.
Since the first kind of transactions represents meaningfnl partial semantic analyses those can be supplied immediately on demand under au anytime regime.
The possibility to process interrupts with the restriction that the currently active transaction has to be complete.d in advance has been built into the Verhmobil/15 parser, using the APC protocol (of.
Appendix). It therefore exhibits a limited anytime behavior.
999 4 Feature Unification as an Anytime Algorithm?
Up to now, in our discussion of an appropriate grain size for the unification of feature structures we consid: ered two cases: the unification of two whole feature structures or the unification of parts of two feature structures on the level of disjuncts or individual features..In all of these cases unitication is considered as a single step, neglecting its real cost, i.e. time constraints would only affect the number of unification steps, but not the execution of a particular unification operation.
Alternatively, one might consider the unification algorithm itself as an anytime algorithm with a property which one might call "shallow unification".
A shallow unification process would quickly come up with a first, incomplete and only partially correct solution which then, given more computation time, would have to be refined and possibly revised.
It seems that this property cannot be achieved by a modification of existing unification algorithms, but would require a radically different approach.
A prerequisite for that would be a sort of quality measure 11 tbr different partial feature structures describing a given linguistic object which is distinct from the subsumption relation.
To our knowledge, the definition of such a measure is an open re: search question.
5 Conclusion
According to \[Russell and Zilberst, ein 1991\] parsing algorithms with feature unification have to be classified as contract algorithms as opposed to (truly) interruptible algorithms: They must be given a particular time allocation in advance, because interrupted at any time shorter than the contract time they will not yield useflll results.
At least the transaction which is active at the time an interrupt occurs has to be completed before the interrupt can be executed.
With this restriction, it is possible to provide a parser with linqited anytime behavior, which is in fact being realized in the current version of the Verbmobil/15 parser.

Let Producer be the flmction that implements the producer algorithm.
In a purely sequential procedural call/return implementation this function would have a control structure similar to: (defml Producer ()...
(Initialize) (let ((Result nil)) (~hile (not (GoodEnough?
Result)) (ImproveResult)) Result)) 1000 The RP(\] of Producer is at least that of the function ImproveResult.
It is finer if ImproveResult is itself made of loops that produce intermediate results that are ext)ortable to consumers.
q'he consumer is ilnplemented as the function Consumer, that at some point calls the l)roducer: (defun Consumer ()...
(Producer )...
We now translate Producer and Consumer into parallel processes,sing the APC protocol, which is directly implemented by functions that act as interfaces to the underlying communication/synchronization system.
All functions implementing the protocol have the prefix APC: (In our imphunenta|ion all of them are in the Conmlon~l,isp package anyt |me-producer-consumer).
(defun AnytimeProducer ()...
(Initialize) (let ((Result nil)) (while (not (GoodEnough?
Result)) (ImproveResult) ;; Make Result available to consumers (APC:SetResult!
Result) ;; Check for messages/instructions ;; from Consumer (APC:CheckStatus) Result)) In a paralM implements||or, it is not sullicient for the consumer to simt)ly call the producer.
The pro° ducer has to be spawT~ed or forked as a separate process: (defun AnytimeConsumer ()... • Create a new process (let ((P-AnytimeProducer-1 (AI'g:StartProcess (AnytimeProducer ))))...
(let ((Result (hPC:GetResult P-hnytimeProducer-1))) (while (not (ConsumerGoodEnough?
Result)) ; I)o something else, like going to sleep ; to give tile producer some more time (setf Result, (APe :GetResnlt P-AnytimeProducer-1) ) ) ) (APe :hbortProcess P-AnytimeProducer-:l) ) The APC Pr()/;()('()l APC:StartProcess F starts a new process in which the procedure F is executed.
This function is also responsibh; for tile creation of the protected Result slot.
APe : StartProcess returns the id of the new process.
No~e that an arbitrm:y number of producers may be started by a consnlner.
A prodtlcer may o\[' course also start other producers.
APC:AbortProcess Proc aborts the process Prec.
APC:SetResult! R sets the value of the Result slot to R.
APC:GetResult P • retrieves the current value of the Result slot from process P.
Remember that APC:SetResult ! and APC:GetResult avoid read/write conflicts by a locking mechanism that implements mutual exclusion.
APC : gesetProcess Proc I restarts the process Proc with new input I.
APC:CheckStatus \[Proc\] check if any inessages or instructions have arrived from Proc.
Often parallel soft;ware environments offer only very crude process scheduling and control primitives.
The user may have to implement sortie of them by himself.
APC:ResetProeess, for example, is (lit" ticult to formulate in a general way.
Reset can also involve, ltla.intenance or eleannp work, which is clearly beyond any process-oriented imph'.mentation of Reset.
'l'he idea is that these user implemented control procedures are hooked into hPC:CheckStatus \[Proc\].
'lk) a|,tain a linegrained control relationship between consunter and t)roducer, the user simply inserts APC : CheckStatus at key-positions in the code.
The AP(; protocol has been implemented aud tested under a coarse grained paralM Common l,ist) System running on a four processor SUNSPARC MP-670.
UNIX IPC 1~ shared memory and sen|spheres are used to implement the h)w-level communica.tion and synchronisation facilities.
We are currently porting the system to Solaris 2.3, with PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine, see \[l)ongarra, Geist, Manchek and Snndaram 1993\]) as the basic communicatkm facility.
IWM would allow us to mow~ our parallel system h'om tile current high communication and low memory bandwidth im plementation on a shared memory machine, to a low communication/high memory bandwidth implementation tutoring on a cluster of workstations.
