anaphora Coreference has been defined by (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) as the relation holding between linguistic expressions that refer to the same extralinguistic entity.
J00-4005
As resolving direct anaphoric descriptions (the ones where anaphor and antecedent have the same head noun) is a much simpler problem with high performance rates as shown in previous results (Vieira et al., 2000; Bean and Riloff, 1999), these heuristics should be applied first in a system that resolves definite descriptions.
P99-1048
Previous work on anaphoric resolution of English texts has used acquired lexical knowledge in different ways, examples are (Poesio et al., 2002; Schulte im Walde, 1997; Bunescu, 2003).

Our classes of analyses were based on the analyses of English texts presented in (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), with the difference that we divided the Bridging class of their analyses into two different classes, separating coreferent (Indirect Anaphora) and noncoreferent (Other Anaphora) cases.
J98-2001
work An evaluation of the use of WordNet for treating bridging descriptions is presented in (Poesio et al., 1997).
W97-1301
In our work we concentrated on coreference relations, these can be related to synonymy, hypernymy, and proper name sub-classes evaluated in (Poesio et al., 1997).
W97-1301
The technique presented in (Schulte im Walde, 1997) based on lexical acquisition from the British National Corpus was evaluated against the same cases in (Poesio et al., 1997).
