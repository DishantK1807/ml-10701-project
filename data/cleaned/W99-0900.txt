3:13	While it is worthwhile to utilize annotated data when it is available, one might argue that the future success of learning for natural language systems cannot depend on a paradigm requiring that large, annotated data sets be created for each new problem or application.
4:13	The costs of annotation are prohibitively time and expertise intensive, and the resulting corpora may be too susceptible to restriction to a particular domain, application, or genre.
5:13	Thus, long-term progress in NLP is likely to be dependent on the use of unsupervised and weakly supervised learning techniques, which do not require large annotated data sets.
6:13	The Workshop on Unsupervised Learning in Natural Language Processing, held on June 21st, 1999 at the University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland, USA, was organized around the goals of discussing, promoting, and presenting new research results (positive and negative) in the use of such methods in NLP.
7:13	The workshop was sponsored by the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), and endorsed by SIGNLL, the ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning.
8:13	This volume contains the nine papers out of twenty-one submissions that were accepted for presentation at the workshop.
9:13	The program also includes two invited talks, by Michael Brent (Johns Hopkins University) and Lillian Lee (Cornell University).
10:13	The workshop will conclude with a panel session on unsupervised learning in NLP with the following participants: Eric Brill (Johns Hopkins University), John Lafferty (Carnegie-Mellon University), Andrew McCallum (CarnegieMellon University and Just Research), and Janyce Wiebe (New Mexico State University).
11:13	We would like to thank all authors who showed their interest by submitting papers to the workshop.
12:13	We would also like to thank those members of the program committee and others who contributed to the reviewing process: Steve Abney (AT&T Laboratories), Eric Brill (Johns Hopkins University), Rebecca Bruce (University of North Carolina at Asheville), Eugene Charniak (Brown University), Michael Collins (AT&T Laboratories), Marie desJardins (SRI International), Moises Goldszmidt (SRI International), John Lafferty (Carnegie-Mellon University), Lillian Lee (Cornell University), Chris Manning (University of Sydney), Ray Mooney (University of Texas, Austin), Srini Narayanan (ICSI, Berkeley), Fernando Pereira (AT&T Laboratories), David Powers (Flinders University of South Australia), Adwait Ratnaparkhi (IBM Research), Dan Roth (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), Richard Sproat (AT&T Laboratories), Janyce Wiebe (New Mexico State University), and David Yarowsky (Johns Hopkins University).
