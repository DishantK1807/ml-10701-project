A similar grammar can derive the crossed serial dependencies of Swiss German, which according to Shieber (1985a) no context-free grammar can derive.
P85-1018
Generalized phrase structure grammar avoids the problem because it has only the formal power of context-free grammar (Gazdar et al.1985), but according to Shieber (1985a) this is not adequate for describing human language.

Like near\]ty all parsers using term unification, it is a special case of Earley deduction (Pereira and Warren 1985).

To guarantee that the table was finite, they restricted the depth of terms occurring in the tableâ€¢ Shieber (1985b) offered a more selective approach--his program predicts only those features chosen by the user as most useful for prediction.

Pereira (1985) describes a more sophisticated version of structure-sharing.

Therefore it is useful to have a parser that does not require us to find a context-free backbone, but works directly on a unification grammar (Shieber 1985b).
P85-1018
All unification in this paper is unification of terms, as in Robinson 1965--not graphs or other structures, as in much recent work (Shieber 1985b).

We also hope to add feature disjunction to our grammar (see Kasper 1987; Kasper and Rounds 1986).

The reader should compare this table with the one in Shieber 1985.
P85-1018
However, as Shieber (1985b) observed, this class of grammars excludes many linguistically interesting grammars that do not use atomic category symbols.
