Therefore, in a subsequent experiment we clustered the head of PPs in the collision sets using a set of high-level semantic tags (for a discussion STwo esl's occurring exactly as the average (1.9 in LD) are in perfect correlation when their MI is equal to 13.8. on semantic tagging see (Basili et al, 1992, 1993b) 6.

This incremental process can be iterated to the point that the system 1 It is not just a matter of time, but also of required linguistic skills (see for example (Marcus et al, 1993)).

In general the training set is the parsed Wall Street Journal (Marcus et al, 1993), with few exceptions, and the size of the training samples is around 10-20,000 test cases.

In (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) hereafter H&R, lexicalized rules are derived according to the probability of noun-preposition or verb-preposition bigrams for ambiguous structures like verb-noun-preposition-noun sequences.

To conduct the experiment, we used a shallow syntactic analyzer (SSA) (Basili et al, 1994) to extract word associations from two very different corpora in Italian (a scientific corpus of environmental abstracts, called ENEA, and a legal corpus on taxation norms, called LD) 2 Given a corpus, SSA produces an extensive database of elementary syntactic links (esl).
