One advantage of automatically generated thesauruses (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002) over large-scale manually created thesauruses such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is that they might be tailored to a particular genre or domain.

For a given word, we compute the overlap between neighbour sets using a comparison technique adapted from Lin (1998).

Previous work on this problem (Caraballo, 1999; Lin et al., 2003) involves identifying speci c phrasal patterns within text e.g., \Xs and other Ys" is used as evidence that X is a hyponym of Y.

However, it is not at all obvious that one universally best measure exists for all applications (Weeds and Weir, 2003).

simja+mi is a variant (Lin, 1998) in which the features of a word are those contexts for which the pointwise mutual information (MI) between the word and the context is positive, where MI can be calculated using I(c;w) = log P(cjw)P(c). The related Dice Coe cient (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992) is omitted here since it has been shown (van Rijsbergen, 1979) that Dice and Jaccard’s Coe cients are monotonic in each other.

Table 5 shows the results of using di erent similarity measures with the simplexscore test and data of McCarthy et al.(2003). We now see signi cant correlation between compositionality judgements and distributional similarity of the phrasal verb and its head constituent.

Baldwin et al.(2003) explore empirical models of compositionality for noun-noun compounds and verb-particle constructions.

Lin’s Measure (Lin, 1998) is based on his information-theoretic similarity theorem, which states, \the similarity between A and B is measured by the ratio between the amount of information needed to state the commonality of A and B and the information needed to fully describe what A and B are." The nal three measures are settings in the additive MI-based Co-occurrence Retrieval Model (AMCRM) (Weeds and Weir, 2003; Weeds, 2003).

McCarthy et al.(2003) also investigate several tests for compositionality including one (simplexscore) based on the observation that compositional collocations tend to be similar in meaning to their constituent parts.

Similarity-based smoothing (Brown et al., 1992; Dagan et al., 1999) is an intuitively appealing approach to this problem where probabilities of unseen co-occurrences are estimated from probabilities of seen co-occurrences of distributionally similar events.

Previous work on the evaluation of distributional similarity methods tends to either compare sets of distributionally similar words to a manually created semantic resource (Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002) or be oriented towards a particular task such as language modelling (Dagan et al., 1999; Lee, 1999).

For example, \strong tea" is a type of \tea" and \to 2Other tests for compositionality investigated by McCarthy et al.(2003) do much better.

The Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measure (Rao, 1983) and the -skew divergence measure (Lee, 1999) are based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence measure.
