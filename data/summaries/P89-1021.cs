Comparatives add significant expressive power to an interface (Ballard 1988), and it is therefore important that reliable techniques be developed to resolve the lexical ambiguities that occur in CEs.

same comments apply to A-context specifications which can be declared in PHLIQA1 $This is an extension to the rules used in ATOZ (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988) which do not Allow functions M arguments and therefore never need this kind of context checking.

We use a multi-level semantic processor (see (Bates and Bobrow 1983), (Bronnenberg, Bunt, Landsbergen, Scha, Schoenmakers, and van Utteren 1980), (Grosz, Haas, Hendrix, Hobbs, Martin, Moore, Robinson, and Rosenschein 1982), (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983) and (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988) for descriptions of similar systems).

The aggregation function is not explicltly reflected in our system until the database level 7Trans rules are nearly identical to the lexical translation rules used in the ATOZ system (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988).

Two exceptions are the recent papers of Ballard (1988) and Rayner and Banks (1988).

(Bronnenberg, Bunt, Landsbergen, Scha, Schoenmakers, and van Utteren 1980) and (Ryan, Root, and Olawsky 1988)) with a Mapping Selector that communicates with the user and returns the results to the rule-based translator.

At each level queries are represented by logic-based formulas (see (Olawsky 1989) for examples) with generalized quantifiers ((Barwise and Cooper 1981), (Moore 1981) and (Pereira 1983)) using predicates defined for that level.
P81-1028
Rayner and Banks (1988) describe a logic programming approach to obtaining a parse and an initial logical formula for sentences containing a fairly broad range of CEs.
