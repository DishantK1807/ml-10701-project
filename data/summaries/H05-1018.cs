A similar technique was used in (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003a) to speed up the calculation of inner products.

For the SRL task, Moschitti (2004) applied the tree kernel (Kc) to tree fragments that are heuristically extracted to reflect the role of interest.

Culotta and Sorensen (2004) proposed a tree kernel for dependency trees.

Our target application is node relation labeling, which includes NLP tasks such as semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Moschitti, 2004; Hacioglu et al., 2004).

FREQT-based algorithms have recently been used in methods that treat subtrees as features (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003b).

For relation extraction, Culotta and Sorensen (2004) proposed a tree kernel that operates on only the smallest tree fragment including two entities for which a relation is assigned.

Several studies claim that learning using tree kernels and other convolution kernels tends to overfit and propose selecting or restricting features (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Suzuki et al., 2004; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004).

Sometimes, the classification becomes faster as a result (Suzuki et al., 2004; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004).

Shen et al.(2003) proposed a tree kernel for LTAG derivation trees to focus only on linguistically meaningful structures.
