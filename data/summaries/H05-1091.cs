In the case of the tree kernels from (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), the authors reduce each relation example to the smallest subtree in the parse or dependency tree that includes both entities.

In order to obtain CCG derivations for all sentences in the ACE corpus, we used the CCG parser introduced in (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002)3.

Results A recent approach to extracting relations is described in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).

Recent research (Roth and Yih, 2004) indicates that integrating entity recognition with relation extraction in a global model that captures the mutual influences between the two tasks can lead to significant improvements in accuracy.
W04-2401
The shortest-path dependency kernels outperform the dependency kernel from (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) in both scenarios, with a more significant difference for SP-CFG.

The amount of syntactic knowledge used in IE systems varies from partof-speech only (Ray and Craven, 2001) to chunking (Ray and Craven, 2001) to shallow parse trees (Zelenko et al., 2003) to dependency trees derived from full parse trees (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004).

We also show the results presented in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) for their best performing kernel K4 (a sum between a bag-of-words kernel and their dependency kernel) under both scenarios.

In (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) the authors propose doing relation extraction in two steps: first, one binary SVM is trained for relation detection, which means that all positive relation instances are combined into one class.
P04-1054
The same tree kernel is slightly generalized in (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004) and used in conjunction with dependency trees.
P04-1054
In this paper we tried extracting both types of dependencies using a CCG parser, however another approach is to recover deep dependencies from syntactic parses, as in (Campbell, 2004; Levy and Manning, 2004).

In our experiments, we used the full parse output from Collinsâ€™ parser (Collins, 1997), in which every non-terminal node is already annotated with head information.
