of Chinese Speech Repairs Heeman and Allen (1994) divide English speech repairs into three types: fresh start, modification repair and abridged repair.
P94-1041
Heeman and Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and corrects modification and abridged repairs.

Bear, et al.(1992) firstly try to parse the input sentence and then invoke a repair processing when the parsing fails• For repair processing, a simple pattern matcher finds the candidates based on the lexical cues at the first stage.
P92-1008
That is, it tries to detect and correct speech repairs automatically using text alone• Hindle (1983) adds rules to a deterministic parser to tackle the problem of correcting speech repairs.
P83-1019
) Heeman and Allen (1994) describe that 25% of turns contain at least one speech repair in their corpus.
P94-1041
In other words, it is necessary to segment Chinese sentence before tagging and parsing (Chen and Liu, 1992; Sproat, et al., 1994; Chen and Lee, 1996).

Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993a; 1993b) investigate the detection of the interruption point of speech repairs based on this line.
