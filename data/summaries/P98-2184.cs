The probabilistic relation between verbs and their arguments plays an important role in modern statistical parsers and supertaggers (Charniak 1995, Collins 1996/1997, Joshi and Srinivas 1994, Kim, Srinivas, and Trueswell 1997, Stolcke et al.1997), and in psychological theories of language processing (Clifton et al.1984, Ferfeira & McClure 1997, Gamsey et al.1997, Jurafsky 1996, MacDonald 1994, Mitchell & Holmes 1985, Tanenhaus et al.1990, Trueswell et al.1993). These probabilities are computed in very different ways by the two sets of researchers.

Our eventual goal is to develop a set of regular expressions that work on fiat tagged corpora instead of TreeBank parsed structures to allow us to gather information from larger corpora than have been done by the TreeBank project (see Manning 1993 and Gahl 1998).

1984), written discourse (Brown and WSJ from Penn Treebank Marcus et al.1993), and conversational data (Switchboard Godfrey et al.1992). We found that the subcategorization frequencies in each of these sources are different.

This can be done automatically with unparsed corpora (Briscoe and Carroll 1997, Manning 1993, Ushioda et al.1993), from parsed corpora such as Marcus et al.'s (1993) Treebank (Merlo 1994, Framis 1994) or manually as was done for COMLEX (Macleod and Grishman 1994).

This work is presently being carried out by us and others (Baker, Fillmore, & Lowe 1998).

These could be used to bootstrap each other relying on the heuristic that only one sense is used within any discourse (Gale, Church, & Yarowsky 1992).
