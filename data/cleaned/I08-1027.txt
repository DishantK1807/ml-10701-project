Abstract
Automatic estimation of word significance
oriented for speech-based Information Re-
trieval (IR) is addressed. Since the sig-
nificance of words differs in IR, automatic
speech recognition (ASR) performance has
been evaluated based on weighted word er-
ror rate (WWER), which gives a weight
on errors from the viewpoint of IR, instead
of word error rate (WER), which treats all
words uniformly. A decoding strategy that
minimizes WWER based on a Minimum
Bayes-Risk framework has been shown, and
the reduction of errors on both ASR and IR
has been reported. In this paper, we propose
an automatic estimation method for word
significance (weights) based on its influence
on IR. Specifically, weights are estimated so
that evaluation measures of ASR and IR are
equivalent. We apply the proposed method
to a speech-based information retrieval sys-
tem, which is a typical IR system, and show
that the method works well.
1 Introduction
Based on the progress of spoken language process-
ing, the main target of speech processing has shifted
from speech recognition to speech understanding.
Since speech-based information retrieval (IR) must
extract user intention from speech queries, it is thus
a typical speech understanding task. IR typically
searches for appropriate documents such as news-
paper articles or Web pages using statistical match-
ing for a given query. To define the similarity be-
tween a query and documents, the word vector space
model or “bag-of-words” model is widely adopted,
and such statistics as the TF-IDF measure are intro-
duced to consider the significance of words in the
matching. Therefore, when using automatic speech
recognition (ASR) as a front-end of such IR systems,
the significance of the words should be considered in
ASR; words that greatly affect IR performance must
be detected with higher priority.
Based on such a background, ASR evaluation
should be done from the viewpoint of the quality
of mis-recognized words instead of quantity. From
this point of view, word error rate (WER), which is
the most widely used evaluation measure of ASR
accuracy, is not an appropriate evaluation measure
when we want to use ASR systems for IR because
all words are treated identically in WER. Instead
of WER, weighted WER (WWER), which consid-
ers the significance of words from a viewpoint of
IR, has been proposed as an evaluation measure for
ASR. Nanjo et.al showed that the ASR based on
the Minimum Bayes-Risk framework could reduce
WWER and the WWER reduction was effective for
key-sentence indexing and IR (H.Nanjo et al., 2005).
To exploit ASR which minimizes WWER for IR,
we should appropriately define weights of words.
Ideal weights would give a WWER equivalent to
IR performance degradation when a corresponding
ASR result is used as a query for the IR system. Af-
ter obtaining such weights, we can predict IR degra-
dation by simply evaluating ASR accuracy, and thus,
minimum WWER decoding (ASR) will be the most
effective for IR.
204
For well-defined IRs such as relational database
retrieval (E.Levin et al., 2000), significant words
(=keywords) are obvious. On the contrary, de-
termining significant words for more general IR
task (T.Misu et al., 2004) (C.Hori et al., 2003) is not
easy. Moreover, even if significant words are given,
the weight of each word is not clear. To properly
and easily integrate the ASR system into an IR sys-
tem, the weights of words should be determined au-
tomatically. Conventionally, they are determined by
an experienced system designer. Actually, in con-
ventional studies of minimum WWER decoding for
key-sentence indexing (H.Nanjo and T.Kawahara,
2005) and IR (H.Nanjo et al., 2005), weights were
defined based on TF-IDF values used in back-end
indexing or IR systems. These values reflect word
significance for IR, but are used without having been
proven suitable for IR-oriented ASR. In this paper,
we propose an automatic estimation method of word
weights based on the influences on IR.
2 Evaluation
Measure of ASR for IR
2.1 Weighted
Word Error Rate (WWER)
The conventional ASR evaluation measure, namely,
word error rate (WER), is defined as Equation (1).
WER =
I + D + S
N
(1)
Here, N is the number of words in the correct tran-
script, I is the number of incorrectly inserted words,
D is the number of deletion errors, and S is the num-
ber of substitution errors. For each utterance, DP
matching of the ASR result and the correct transcript
is performed to identify the correct words and calcu-
late WER.
Apparently in WER, all words are treated uni-
formly or with the same weight. However, there
must be a difference in the weight of errors, since
several keywords have more impact on IR or the
understanding of the speech than trivial functional
words. Based on the background, WER is gener-
alize and weighted WER (WWER), in which each
word has a different weight that reflects its influence

sult. seg

and v

is the weight of segment seg
j
. For seg-
ment seg
j, the total weight of the correct words and
the recognized words are calculated, and then the
larger one is used as v
seg
j
. In this work, we use
alignment for WER to identify the correct words and
calculate WWER. Thus, WWER equals WER if all
word weights are set to 1. In Fig. 1, an example of a
WWER calculation is shown.
WWER calculated based on ideal word weights
represents IR performance degradation when the
ASR result is used as a query for IR. Thus, we must
perform ASR to minimize WWER for speech-based
IR.
2.2 Minimum
Bayes-Risk Decoding
Next, a decoding strategy to minimize WWER based
on the Minimum Bayes-Risk framework (V.Goel et
al., 1998) is described.
In Bayesian decision theory, ASR is described
with a decision rule δ(X): X →
ˆ
W. Using a real-
valued loss function l(W, δ(X)) = l(W, W
prime
), the
205
decision rule minimizing Bayes-risk is given as fol-
lows. It is equivalent to the orthodox ASR (maxi-
mum likelihood ASR) when a 0/1 loss function is
used.

The minimization of WWER is realized us-
ing WWER as a loss function (H.Nanjo and
T.Kawahara, 2005) (H.Nanjo et al., 2005).
3 Estimation
of Word Weights
A word weight should be defined based on its in-
fluence on IR. Specifically, weights are estimated
so that WWER will be equivalent to an IR perfor-
mance degradation. For an evaluation measure of IR
performance degradation, IR score degradation ratio
(IRDR), which is described in detail in Section 4.2,
is introduced in this work. The estimation of weights
is performed as follows.
1. Query pairs of a spoken-query recognition re-
sult and its correct transcript are set as training
data. For each query pair m, do procedures 2
to 5.
2. Perform IR with a correct transcript and calcu-
late IR score R
m
.
3. Perform IR with a spoken-query ASR result
and calculate IR score H
m
.
4. Calculate IR score degradation ratio
(IRDR

).
5. Calculate WWER

.
6. Estimate word weights so that WWER
m
and
IRDR
m
are equivalent for all queries.
Practically, procedure 6 is defined to minimize the
mean square error between both evaluation mea-
sures (WWER and IRDR) as follows.

In this work, we adopt the steepest decent method
to determine the weights that give minimal F(x).
Initially, all weights are set to 1, and then each word
weight (x

(9) until the mean square error between WWER and
IRDR is converged.

4 Weight
Estimation on Orthodox IR
4.1 WEB
Page Retrieval
In this paper, weight estimation is evaluated with
an orthodox IR system that searches for appropri-
ate documents using statistical matching for a given
query. The similarity between a query and docu-
ments is defined by the inner product of the feature
vectors of the query and the specific document. In
this work, a feature vector that consists of TF-IDF
values is used. The TF-IDF value is calculated for
each word t and document (query) i as follows.
TF-IDF(t, i)=
tf
t,i
DL
i
avglen
+ tf
t,i
· log
N
df
t
(10)
Here, term frequency tf
t,i
represents the occur-
rence counts of word t in a specific document i, and
document frequency df
t
represents the total number
206
of documents that contain word t. A word that oc-
curs frequently in a specific document and rarely oc-
curs in other documents has a large TF-IDF value.
We normalize TF values using length of the docu-
ment (DL
i
) and average document lengths over all
documents (avglen) because longer document have
more words and TF values tend to be larger.
For evaluation data, web retrieval task “NTCIR-3
WEB task”, which is distributed by NTCIR (NTC, ),
is used. The data include web pages to be searched,
queries, and answer sets. For speech-based informa-
tion retrieval, 470 query utterances by 10 speakers
are also included.
4.2 Evaluation
Measure of IR
For an evaluation measure of IR, discount cumula-
tive gain (DCG) is used, and described below.
DCG(i)=

Here, d
i
represents i-th retrieval result (docu-
ment). H, A, and B represent a degree of relevance;
H is labeled to documents that are highly relevant to
the query. A and B are labeled to documents that are
relevant and partially relevant to the query, respec-
tively. “h”, “a”, “b”, and “c” are the gains, and in this
work, (h, a, b, c)=(3, 2, 1, 0) is adopted. When re-
trieved documents include many relevant documents
that are ranked higher, the DCG score increases.
In this work, word weights are estimated so that
WWER and IR performance degradation will be
equivalent. For an evaluation measure of IR perfor-
mance degradation, we define IR score degradation
ratio (IRDR) as below.
IRDR =1−
H
R
(12)
R represents a DCG score calculated with IR results
by text query, and H represents a DCG score given
by the ASR result of the spoken query. IRDR repre-
sents the ratio of DCG score degradation affected by
ASR errors.
4.3 Automatic
speech recognition system
In this paper, ASR system is set up with follow-
ing acoustic model, language model and a decoder
Julius rev.3.4.2(A.Lee et al., 2001). As for acous-
tic model, gender independent monophone model
(129 states, 16 mixtures) trained with JNAS corpus
are used. Speech analysis is performed every 10
msec. and a 25 dimensional parameter is computed
(12 MFCC + 12ΔMFCC + ΔPower). For language
model, a word trigram model with the vocabulary of
60K words trained with WEB text is used.
Generally, trigram model is used as acoustic
model in order to improve the recognition accuracy.
However, monophone model is used in this paper,
since the proposed estimation method needs recog-
nition error (and IRDR).
4.4 Results
4.4.1 Correlation
between Conventional ASR
and IR Evaluation Measures
We analyzed the correlations of conventional
ASR evaluation measures with IRDR by selecting
appropriate test data as follows. First, ASR is per-
formed for 470 spoken queries of an NTCIR-3 web
task. Then, queries are eliminated whose ASR re-
sults do not contain recognition errors and queries
with which no IR results are retrieved. Finally, we
selected 107 pairs of query transcripts and their ASR
results as test data.
For all 107 pairs, we calculated WER and IRDR
using corresponding ASR result. Figure 2 shows the
correlations between WER and IRDR. Correlation
coefficient between both is 0.119. WER is not cor-
related with IRDR. Since our IR system only uses
the statistics of nouns, WER is not an appropriate
evaluation measure for IR. Conventionally, for such
tasks, keyword recognition has been performed, and
keyword error rate (KER) has been used as an evalu-
ation measure. KER is calculated by setting all key-
word weights to 1 and all weights of the other words
to 0 in WWER calculation. Figure 3 shows the cor-
relations between KER and IRDR. Although IRDR
is more correlated with KER than WER, KER is not
significantly correlated with IRDR (correlation co-
efficient: 0.224). Thus, KER is not a suitable eval-
uation measure of ASR for IR. This fact shows that
each keyword has a different influence on IR and

ence on IR.
4.4.2 Correlation
between WWER and IR
Evaluation Measure
In ASR for IR, since some words are significant,
each word should have a different weight. Thus, we
assume that each keyword has a positive weight, and
non-keywords have zero weight. WWER calculated
with these assumptions is then defined as weighted
keyword error rate (WKER).
Using the same test data (107 queries), keyword
weights were estimated with the proposed estima-
tion method. The correlation between IRDR and
WKER calculated with the estimated word weights
is shown in Figure 4. A high correlation between
IRDR and WKER is confirmed (correlation coeffi-
cient: 0.969). The result shows that the proposed
method works well and proves that giving a differ-
ent weight to each word is significant.
The proposed method enables us to extend text-
based IR systems to speech-based IR systems with
typical text queries for the IR system, ASR results
of the queries, and answer sets for each query. ASR
results are not necessary since they can be substi-
tuted with simulated texts that can be automatically
generated by replacing some words with others. On
the contrary, text queries and answer sets are indis-
pensable and must be prepared. It costs too much
to make answer sets manually since we should con-
sider whether each answer is relevant to the query.
For these reasons, it is difficult to apply the method
to a large-scale speech-based IR system. An esti-
mation method without hand-labeled answer sets is
strongly required.
An estimation method without hand-labeled an-
swer sets, namely, the unsupervised estimation of
word weights, is also tested. Unsupervised estima-
tion is performed as described in Section 3. In un-
supervised estimation, the IR result (document set)
with a correct transcript is regarded as an answer set,
namely, a presumed answer set, and it is used for
IRDR calculation instead of a hand-labeled answer
set.
The result (correlation between IRDR and
WKER) is shown in Figure 5. Without hand-
labeled answer sets, we obtained high correlation
(0.712 of correlation coefficient) between IRDR and
WKER. The result shows that the proposed estima-
tion method is effective and widely applicable to IR
systems since it requires only typical text queries for
IR. With the WWER given by the estimated weights,
IR performance degradation can be confidently pre-
dicted. It is confirmed that the ASR approach to
minimize such WWER, which is realized with de-
coding based on a Minimum Bayes-Risk frame-
work (H.Nanjo and T.Kawahara, 2005)(H.Nanjo et
al., 2005), is effective for IR.
4.5 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the problem of word
weight estimation. Although we obtained high cor-
relation between IRDR and KWER, the estimation
may encounter the over-fitting problem when we use
small estimation data. When we want to design a
speech-based IR system, a sufficient size of typi-
cal queries is often prepared, and thus, our proposed
method can estimate appropriate weights for typical
significant words. Moreover, this problem will be

Figure 5: Correlation between ratio of IR score

avoided using a large amount of dummy data (pair of

this work, although obtained correlation coefficient
of 0.712 in unsupervised estimation, it is desirable
to obtain much higher correlation. There are much
room to improve unsupervised estimation method.
In addition, since typical queries for IR system
will change according to the users, current topic,
and so on, word weights should be updated accord-
ingly. It is reasonable approach to update word
weights with small training data which has been in-
put to the system currently. For such update sys-
tem, our estimation method, which may encounter
the over-fitting problem to the small training data,
may work as like as cache model (P.Clarkson and
A.J.Robinson, 1997), which gives higher language
model probability to currently observed words.
5 Conclusion
We described the automatic estimation of word sig-
nificance for IR-oriented ASR. The proposed esti-
mation method only requires typical queries for the
IR, and estimates weights of words so that WWER,
which is an evaluation measure for ASR, will be
equivalent to IRDR, which represents a degree of IR
degradation when an ASR result is used as a query
for IR. The proposed estimation method was evalu-
ated on a web page retrieval task. WWER based on
estimated weights is highly correlated with IRDR.
It is confirmed that the proposed method is effective
and we can predict IR performance confidently with
such WWER, which shows the effectiveness of our
proposed ASR approach minimizing such WWER
for IR.
