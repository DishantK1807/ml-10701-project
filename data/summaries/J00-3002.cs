An approach (also based on regulation of the succession of rule application) to the associated problem of spurious ambiguity is given in Hepple and Morrill (1989) but again, to our knowledge, there is no predictive relation between incremental combinatory processing and the kind of processing phenomena cited in the introduction.

Surveys and articles on the topic include Lamarche and Retor¢ (1996), de Groote and Retor¢ (1996), and Morrill (1999).

For example, composition as above has the following alternative derivation: (15) A=~A B~B \L A,A\B ~ B C ~ C A,A\B, B\C =~ C A\B,B\C =~ A\C \R \C One approach to this problem consists in defining, within the Cut-free atomic-id space, normal form derivations in which the succession of rule application is regulated (K6nig 1989, Hepple 1990, Hendriks 1993).
