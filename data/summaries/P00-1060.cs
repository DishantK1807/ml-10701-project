In the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Brown, 1991] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1991] [Magerman, 1992] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996].

Many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [Black, 1992] [Briscoe, 1993] [Charniak, 1997] [Collins, 1996] [Collins, 1997] [Magerman, 1995] [Eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively.
