This paper describes a new program, charalign, that aligns texts at the character level rather than at the sentence/paragraph level, based on the cognate approach proposed by Simard et al.1. Introduction Parallel texts have recently received considerable attention in machine translation (e.g., Brown et al, 1990), bilingual lexicography (e.g., Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990), and terminology research for human translators (e.g., Isabelle, 1992).
