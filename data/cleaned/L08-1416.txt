<context>peline. Pipelines of processors are widely used in building NLP applications, mainly due to their simplicity and flexibility. GATE is one well-known text processing framework following this approach (Cunningham et al., 2002). Although GATE is a well established and widely used system, it is relatively complex to use. This is also due the choice of using XML stand-off annotation as interchange format between processors. </context>

Joachims (1998), one of the advantages of SVMs is that dimensionality reduction is usually not needed, as they are robust to overfitting and s</context>
