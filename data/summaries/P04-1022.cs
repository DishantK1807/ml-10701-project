(Cao and Li, 2002) acquire noun phrase translations by making use of web data.

As for collocation translation, Smadja et al.(1996) implement a system to extract collocation translations from a parallel EnglishFrench corpus.
J96-1001
Some studies have been done for acquiring collocation translations using parallel corpora (Smadja et al, 1996; Kupiec, 1993; Echizen-ya et al., 2003).

In addition, (Dagan and Itai, 1994) and (Li, 2002) propose using two monolingual corpora for word sense disambiguation.

The former extracts collocations within a fixed window (Church and Hanks 1990; Smadja, 1993).
J90-1003 J93-1007
Melamed (1997) and Lin (1999) have done some research on noncompositional phrases discovery.
P99-1041 W97-0311
(Rapp, 1999) and (Koehn and Knight, 2002) extract new word translations from non-parallel corpus.

baseline experiment, Model A selects the highestfrequency translation for each word in triple; Model B selects translation with the maximal target triple probability, as proposed in (Dagan 1994); Model C selects translation using both language model and translation model, but the translation probability is simulated by a similarity score which is estimated from monolingual corpus using mutual information measure (Zhou et al., 2001).

In addition to collocation translation, there is also some related work in acquiring phrase or term translations from parallel corpus (Kupiec, 1993; Yamamoto and Matsumoto 2000).

These range from twoword to multi-word, with or without syntactic structure (Smadja 1993; Lin, 1998; Pearce, 2001; Seretan et al.2003). In this paper, a collocation refers to a recurrent word pair linked with a certain syntactic relation.
J93-1007
Most previous research in translation knowledge acquisition is based on parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003
Some research has been done to expand translation dictionary using a non-parallel corpus (Rapp, 1999; Keohn and Knight, 2002).
P99-1067
(Fung, 1998) uses an IR approach to induce new word translations from comparable corpora.
P98-1069
(Wu and Zhou, 2003) also make full use of large scale monolingual corpora and limited bilingual corpora for synonymous collocation extraction.
