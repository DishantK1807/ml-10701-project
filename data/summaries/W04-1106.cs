Obviously this causes a great difficulty to an automatic task, especially to the example-based models which rely on the similarity measurement of the modifier morphemes to disambiguate the head senses (Chen and Chen, 1998, 2000).

According to Wilks and Stevenson (1997), a task assigning broad sense tags like HUMAN, ANIMATE in WordNet is referred to as semantic tagging, different from sense tagging, which assigns more particular sense tags.

A second problem encountered in compound semantic classification is that there are considerable out-of-coverage morphemes, which are not listed in the lexicon, as remarked in (Chen and Chen, 2000).

As generally acknowledged, sense tagging is to assign a certain sense to a word in a certain context by using a semantic lexicon (Yarowsky, 1992, Wilks and Stevenson, 1997).

According to Chen and Chen (2000), the three most dominant types of Chinese unknown words are: compound nouns (about 51%), compound verbs (about 34%), and proper names (about 15%).

In fact, a similar distinction can also be made for semantic classification according to the target level of the semantic classes in the taxonomy tree: a task aiming at the top-level classes can be called shallow semantic classification (like Lua, 1997), while a task aiming at the bottom-level classes can be called a deep semantic classification1 (like Chen and Chen, 2000).
C00-1026 W00-1202
The measure of word similarity can be divided into two major approaches: taxonomy-based lexical approach (Resnik 1995, Lin 1998a, Chen and Chen 1998) and context-based syntactic approach (Lin 1998b,Chen and You 2002), which is not the concern in this context-free model.

Determining the class of the head is therefore determining the class of the target compound (Lua, 1997, Chen and Chen, 2000).
C00-1026 W00-1202
According to the data in (Chen and Lin, 2000), about 5.51% of unknown words is encountered in their sense-tagging task of Chinese corpus.

Moreover, as some researches propose, synonyms can be used to construct the semantic space for a given word (Ploux and Victorri, 1998, Ploux and Ji, 2003).
