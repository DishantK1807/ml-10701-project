This shallow approach parallels work in question answering (Srihari and Li 2000; Soubbotin and Soubbotin 2002; Moldovan et al 1999).

Likelihood ratios are particularly useful when comparing common and rare events (Dunning 1993; Plaunt and Norgard 1998), making them natural here given the rareness of most question categories and the frequency of contributions.

Though inter-rater reliability using the kappa statistic (Carletta 1996) may be calculated for each group, the distribution of categories in the contribution group was highly skewed and warrants further discussion.

A bootstrapping approach using machine learning is a possible alternative that will be explored in the future (Abney 2002).

For that reason, the classifier uses a minimum of resources, including part of speech tagging (Brill 1995; Sekine and Grishman 1995) and cascaded finite state transducers defining the categories.
