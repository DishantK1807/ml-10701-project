Data The empirical investigations described here and below use the data set of (Collins and Singer, 1999).

Current work has been spurred by two papers, (Yarowsky, 1995) and (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).
P95-1026
Then the initial precision is 1(Yarowsky, 1995), citing (Yarowsky, 1994), actually uses a superficially different score that is, however, a monotone transform of precision, hence equivalent to precision, since it is used only for sorting.
P94-1013 P95-1026
(Collins and Singer, 1999) add a special final round to boost recall, yielding 91.2/80.0/85.2 for the Yarowsky algorithm and 91.3/80.1/85.3 for their version of the original co-training algorithm.
