The category othermet covers unconventional metonymies, as (1), and is only used if none of the other categories fits (Markert and Nissim, 2002b).

This is in line with results in (Gildea and Palmer, 2002), who compare the effect of manual and automatic parsing on semantic predicateargument recognition.
P02-1031
Most other traditional approaches rely on handcrafted knowledge bases or lexica and use violations of hand-modelled selectional restrictions (plus sometimes syntactic violations) for metonymy recognition (Pustejovsky, 1995; Hobbs et al., 1993; Fass, 1997; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Stallard, 1993).

In contrast to previous approaches (Fass, 1997; Hobbs et al., 1993; Copestake and Briscoe, 1995; Pustejovsky, 1995; Verspoor, 1996; Markert and Hahn, 2002; Harabagiu, 1998; Stallard, 1993), we use a corpus reliably annotated for metonymy for evaluation, moving the field towards more objective 11 (Markert and Hahn, 2002) and (Harabagiu, 1998) enhance this with anaphoric information.

The annotation can be considered reliable (Krippendorff, 1980) with 95% agreement and a kappa (Carletta, 1996) of.88.

(1) Ask seat 19 whetherhewantstoswap The importance of resolving metonymies has been shown for a variety of NLP tasks, e.g., machine translation (Kamei and Wakao, 1992), question answering (Stallard, 1993) and anaphora resolution (Harabagiu, 1998; Markert and Hahn, 2002).

In the annotation, we further specify the different groups of people referred to, whenever possible (Markert and Nissim, 2002b).

An empirical comparison between our approach in (Markert and Nissim, 2002a) 12 and an SRs violation approach showed that our approach performed better.

(Briscoe and Copestake, 1999) propose using frequency information besides syntactic/semantic restrictions, but use only a priori sense frequencies without contextual features.

6 6 In (Markert and Nissim, 2002a), we also considered local and topical cooccurrences as contextual features.

All features encountered in the training data are ranked in the DL (best evidence first) according to the following loglikelihood ratio (Yarowsky, 1995): Log Pr(reading i jfeature k ) P j6=i Pr(reading j jfeature k ) We estimated probabilities via maximum likelihood, adopting a simple smoothing method (Martinez and Agirre, 2000): 0.1 is added to both the denominator and numerator.

These generalisations over context and collocates are also applicable to standard WSD and can supplement those achieved e.g., by subcategorisation frames (Martinez et al., 2002).
