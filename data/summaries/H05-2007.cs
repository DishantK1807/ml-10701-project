MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and in order to discover more general patterns, we map the tag set down after tagging, e.g.

We have used this method to analyze the output of two different statistical machine translation models (Chiang et al., 2005).

Over the last few years, several automatic metrics for machine translation (MT) evaluation have been introduced, largely to reduce the human cost of iterative system evaluation during the development cycle (Papineni et al., 2002; Melamed et al., 2003).

We can incorporate each model into the system in turn, and rank the results on a test corpus using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).

3. Compute the correspondence between each hypothesis sentence and each of its corresponding reference sentences using an approximation to maximum matching (Melamed et al., 2003).

2 Part-of-Speech Sequence Recall In developing a new analysis method, we are motivated in part by recent studies suggesting that word reorderings follow general patterns with respect to syntax, although there remains a high degree of flexibility (Fox, 2002; Hwa et al., 2002).
