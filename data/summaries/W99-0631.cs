BNC corpus using the shallow parser developed by Briscoe and Carroll (1997).

Although this approach can give inaccurate estimates, the counts given to the incorrect senses will disperse randomly throughout the hierarchy as noise, and by accumulating counts up the hierarchy we will tend to gather counts from the correct senses of related words (Yarowsky, 1992; Resnik, 1993).
C92-2070
The association norm (and similar measures such as the mutual information score) have been criticised (Dunning, 1993) because these scores can be greatly over-estimated when frequency counts are low.

3The example used here is adapted from McCarthy (1997).
W97-0808
Abney and Light (1998) have attempted to obtain selectional preferences using the Expectation Maximization algorithm by encoding WordNet as a hidden Markov model and using a modified form of the forward-backward algorithm to estimate the parameters.
J98-2002
The techniques in Resnik (1993), Li and Abe (1998) and Ribas (1995) simply distribute the count equally among the alternative senses of a noun.

Input Data and Semantic Hierarchy The input data used to estimate frequencies and probabilities over the semantic hierarchy has been obtained from the shallow parser described in Briscoe and Carroll (1997).
A97-1052
We use the log-likelihood X ~ statistic, rather than the Pearson's X 2 statistic, as this is thought to be more appropriate when the counts in the contingency table are low (Dunning, 1993).
J93-1003
Recent treatments of selectional restrictions have been probabilistic in nature (Resnik, 1993), (Li and Abe, 1998), (Ribas, 1995), (McCarthy, 1997), and estimation of the relevant probabilities has required corpus-based counts of the number of times word senses, or concepts, appear in the different argument positions of verbs.
