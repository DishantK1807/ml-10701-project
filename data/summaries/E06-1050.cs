Many methods exist for clustering, e.g., (Brown et al., 1990; Cutting et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Karypis et al., 1999).

For example, (Hermjakob, 2001) used 276 rules for 122 answer types.

In a similar experiment, Li & Roth (2002) train a question classifier based on a modified version of SNoW using a richer set of answer types than Ittycheriah et al.The LCC system (Harabagiu et al., 2003) combines fixed types with a novel loop-back strategy.

Many previous approaches to answer typing, e.g., (Ittycheriah et al., 2001; Li and Roth, 2002; Krishnan et al., 2005), employ a predefined set of answer types and use supervised learning or manually constructed rules to classify a question according to expected answer type.

Many systems construct the classification rules manually (Cui et al., 2004; Greenwood, 2004; Hermjakob, 2001).

algorithm (Pantel and Lin, 2002) on a 10 GB English text corpus to obtain 3607 clusters.

Similar to Lin and Pantel (2001), we define the contexts of a word to be the undirected paths in dependency trees involving that word at either the beginning or the end.

Ittycheriah, et al.(2001) describe a maximum entropy based question classification scheme to classify each question as having one of the MUC answer types.

This basic idea has been exploited by many proposals for distributional similarity and clustering, e.g., (Church and Hanks, 1989; Lin, 1998; Pereira et al., 1993).

We parsed the AQUAINT corpus (3GB) with Minipar (Lin, 2001) and collected the frequency counts of words appearing in various contexts.
