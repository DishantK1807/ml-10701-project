Table 3 compares the three types of kernel for Perceptron, where for the semiquadratic kernel we used the co-occurrences of characters in context window as those used in (Xue and Shen, 2003), namely {c−2c−1, c−1c0, c0c1, c1c2, c−1c1}.

PAUMhas been successfully used for document classification and information extraction (Li et al., 2005).

Carreras et al.(2003)). However, quadratic kernel was usually implemented in dual form for Perceptron and it took very long time for training.

This kind of strategy has been widely used in the applications of machine learning to named entity recognition and has also 154 been used in Chinese word segmentation (Xue andShen, 2003).
