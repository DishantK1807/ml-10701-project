Our new algorithm (section 6) is most important for previously unminimizable, practically needed division semirings: real (e.g., for probabilities), expectation (for learning (Eisner, 2002)), and additive with negative weights (for conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001)).
P02-1001
Expectation semirings (Eisner, 2002) are used to handle bookkeeping when training the parameters of a probabilistic transducer.
P02-1001
Celebrated algorithms by Mohri (1997; 2000) have recently made it possible to minimize deterministic automata whose weights (outputs) are log-probabilities or strings.

Over the tropical semiring, our linear-time pushing algorithm is simpler than (Mohri, 1997), and faster by a 20It is also permissible to trim the input automaton at the start, or right after computing λ (note that λ(Fq) = 0 iff we should trim q).
J97-2003
Equivalence is efficiently tested by pushing the (deterministic) automata to canonicalize their arc labels and then testing unweighted equivalence (Mohri, 1997).
J97-2003
Useful cases of such division semirings include the real semiring (R,+,×), the tropical semiring extended with negative numbers (R∪{∞},min,+), and expectation semirings (Eisner, 2002).
