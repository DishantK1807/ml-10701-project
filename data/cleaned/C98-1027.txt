Abstract 
A logical recasting ol' Binding Theory is perIbmaed as an efilmncing step for the purpose (>fits l'ull and lean 
declarative lmplementation. A new insight on sentential anaphoric processes is presented whmh may 
suegestively be captured by fhe slogan binding co'hglitions are the e\[/ect of phase qtumtificatio, on the 
uniw'rs'e ofdiscourkb r@,ients. 
Introduction 
.Duq to. its central role in natural lan-uage and .its mtm,mmg properties, relerence and an@\]'-~or resolutton 
has been a central topic for NLP research. Given the intensive attentkm devoted to this subject, .it can 
however be said that sentential anaphor processing has been quite overlooked, when conmared to the amount 
of research effort put in tackling non sentential anaphoric dependencies. This tends to be so because 
there seems to be a more or less implicit assumption that no substantial difference exists between the two 
ocesses 1. hile this may be arguably ttue for the heuristics 
involved in picking out a given antecedent lronl a list of suitable candidates, a more subtle point asks itself 
to be made when we locus on the syntactic conditions which sentential anal~horic relations comply with but 
from which non senfential ones are exempt. In theoretical linguistics these grammatical conditions 
arc grouped under the heading of Binding Theory. in computational linguistics however, though there haye 
been a few lmpers directly concerned with tim iinplementation of tiffs theory, mainstream resemch 
ten?.ts to disregard its conceptual, granmmtical or practical modu'larity. When it comes to define the 
algorithm for settin~ up the list of suitable candidates fi'~3m which the antecedent shoukl be chosen binding

most often put on ~a par with any other kind of conditions, naorphological semantic, pragmatic, etc.. 
which hold 1'o1 anaphoric relations at botll sententia\[ and non sentential level. 
The interesting point to be made in this connection is that, if the modularity of grammatical knowledge is to 
be ensured in a sound reference resoh, tion system, more attention should be paid to previous attempts of 
im/)lementing Binding Theory. it would then become evident that this theory, in its current formulation, 
appears as a piece of fornmlised ~rammatical knowledge which however escapes a fuIl and lean 
declarative implementation. I In fact, implementation efforts concerning Binding

beinf: completed, (i) imlexation: assign radices to NPs; (ii) filteri,g: store the indexed tree if the mdexation 
respects binding principles, reject otherwise; (iii) recursion: repeat (i) with a new assignment until all 
possible asslgmnents are exhausted. Fhis sort of resislance to dechuative encompassine is 
also aplmrent when one considexs how Binding Th&)ry is MnHled in gralnnmtical theories developed on top of 
constraint based formalisms and lmrticularl,¢ concerned with computational implementat"fility, lil~'e LFG or 
HPSG. As to HPSG, it has passed quite unnoticed that its ,Binding Theory is the oJlly piece, of th.e grammar 
liniital'i~m of the formalism' might have been 'l:eached and that ItPSG Binding Theory is still waitin~ to be 
accommodated into tlPSG grammars. As to the I,FG formulation of Binding Theory, it 
requires the integration of inside-out equatmns a special purpose &tension to the eeneral dechuative 
formalism. And even though initiaF scepticisnl about their tractability was d~ssipated by Kaplan and 
Maxwell .(88), the recent survey of Backofen et al. (96) reports that I1O implemented fornmlism, and no 
implemented gramnmr, is known to handle LFG Bindin ~ The(n'y. 
11> tiffs ~:onnection the central aim of the research to be l~resented here is to render possible a lean declarative 
mplementation of Bindimz Theory in constraint based fofinalisms without res6rtine to specific complex 
nmchanisms. This involves tw~o steps. First, as a sort of enhancing step back a new account of Bindine 
Theory is set up. Second, by the exhibition of al-i example, the new shape of the theory is shown to 
SUl~port full declarative implementatioffin basic HPSG formalism. Due to space constraints, this patter is 
mostly concerned wiih the first while tHe'latter recmves just a rough sketch in last section, being 
develope~l in future papers. 
1 l'rcliminarics 
1.1 The
Square of Opposition 
Recent cross linguistic research, e.e. Xue, Pollard trod 
r ( t Sag (94) and Br~flco and Marmla (07), Ires shown that 
the binding ability, of long-distance reflexives is not reducible to recurswe concatenation of short distance 
relations as it has been assumed in GB accounts, but that it s ruled by a fourth binding principle: 
(1) l'rinciple Z 
An o-comniallded anaphoric protloun must be o-bottnd. 
181 
(2) Z: B: xisbound~ ' '7 'c°mpatible x ls locally free 
contradictory l implies I contradictory 
4/\4 
C: contrary A: x is free x is locally bound 
This new perspective on long-distance reflexives had an important nnpact in the whole shape of Binding 
Theory. Branco and Marra\[h noted still that the four principles can be an'anged in a classical Aristotelian 
square of oppositions, as in (2). This suggests that the Binding Theory may have an unsuspected underlying 
quantificational structure. The present paper aims at showing that there is such structure and at determining 
its basic lines. 
1.2 Phase
Quantification 
Barwise and Cooper (81) seminal work gave rise to a fruitful research tradition where Generalised Quantifier 
Theory has been applied to the analysis ot" natural language quantification. These authors suggested that a 
universal charaeterisation of NL nominal quantification could be formally given by means of ,formal prop,,erties 
defined in that theory. The property to live on was postulated as being the most prominent one, 
admittedly constituting the common specific nature of all nominal quantifiers. 
Later, Loebner (87) suggested a criterion to ascertain the quantificatmnal nature of natural language 
expressions in general. That is the property that, for a one place second order operator Q expressecl by a given 
exRression, there be a corresponding dual operator 
Th\]s'duality based perspective on the essence of natural I~,~, ~,~ lan.ua,.e quantit'icatmn permitted to extend 
quffnti0cation well beyond the classic eases of nominal quantification supported by the determiners all, some, 
most, man~,, etc., nmnely by covering also the realms of tempor,'ihtv and rmsslbiIity. Moreover, items like 
still/ ah-eady, and others (enough~too, scaling adjectives, many~few, etc.) though they do not len~ 
themselv.es to b6 straightforwardly analysed in terms of set .quantification, they can also be arranged in a square 
of duality. The formalization of the semantics of these aspectualitems by Loebner led to the enlarging of the 
notion of quantification through the introduction of the new concept of phase quantification. 
He noted that still and already express duals and that they a~;e corners,of a square of duality. Let P be "she is 
asleep and -P 'she is awake', durative propositions which are the arguments of the semantic operators 
corresponding to aTready and still. Then: 
(3) She is already asleep iff 
it is not the case that she is still awake. 
ALREADY P iff STILL ~P 
Further similar tests can be made in order to show that these aspectual items enter the following square of 
duality: 
(4) inner still negation not yet ,.. i\] 
negatmn dual negation 
no longer inner already negation 
In order to get a formalization of (4), Loebner noted that alread~ should be taken as conveying the 
informatioff that there is a phase of not-P which has started before a given rel~rence time tO and might be 
followed by at most one phase P which reaches till tO. This can be displayed in a time axis by means of the 
diagram in (5). 
(5) tO tO 
• ";'.'Jr;."; .'"::.'":"~ 
P -P -p P 
still P not yet P 
to to ,,,,__.... :.. ~ ;'.'.',..'...,-'-', , .............. ,,,,,~ 
' ' • " ." • ' .' • ' .', IIIBIIWIIIIm 
P ~P ~p P 
no longer P already P 
Similar diagrams for the meaning of the other aspectual phase quantifiers of this square of duality mc 
easily intergretable, hmer negation results in exchanging the positive and the negative semitghases, 
while outer negation concerns the decision whether the parameter tO falls into the first or the second 
semiphase. Phase quantifiers in general (already, scaling a.djectives, 
etc.) were thus characterised as requiring two ingredients: (i) a property P, which defines a positive 
phase in a sequence of two opposite phases; (ii) a parameter point. The four types of quantifiers just 
~liffer in presupposing that mtl'mr the positive or the negative semipliase comes first and in stating that the 
parameter point falls into the first or into the second semiphase. 
Next Loebner showed that the semantics of phase quantifiers sketched in the diagrams above can be 
lormalised in such a way that ~ a square of duality formed b~. the generalised ouantifiers XX.some'(D,Xy 
XX.every (D,X) turns out to'be subjacent to the square of duality of already~still. In order to do it, he just 
needed the auxiliary, notion of startin~ point of the relevant semiphase. This is rendered as'fhe infimum of 
the set of the closest predecessors of the parameter point pt which form an uninterrupted linear secluence 
with property P, or ~P (termed GSI(R,pt) by Loebner): 
(6) GSI(R,pt) =df inf{x I x<pt & R(x) & 
Vy(x<y<pt & R(y) ~ 'V'z(x<z<y -~R(z)))} 
The semantics of the lout phase quantifiers above can then be rendered in the following way, making pt=tO 
for the parameter point and R=P or R=-P: 
(7) still: ),,P.every'()x x.(GSI(P,a)<x<t0),P) 
already: ~,P.some'(~,x.(GSI(-P,a)<x_<t0),P) 
not yet: ),P.no'(),x.(GSI(~P, a) < x < t0),P) 
nolonger: 5,P.not every'(~.x.(GSI(P,a)<x<t0),P) 
2 The
Logic of Binding 
Faking, Loebners wew on quantlflcatmn, our goal m this section is to make apparent the quantificational 
structure of binding by showing that on a par with the square of opposition of (2) binding principles form a 
square of dtialitv. We are going thus to argue that binding principles are but~the=reflex of th'~ phase 
quantificational nature of con'esponding nominal expressions: reflexives, pronouns, lon~-distance 
reflexives and R-expressions'will be shown l"6 express phase quantifiers acting on the grammatical 
obliqueness axis.

2.1 Phase
quantilication ingredients 
In order to show that the above rot'rated nominals express phase quantifiers the relevant comppnents 
involved in phase quantification should |50 identltied. The relevant scale here is not the continuous linear 
order of nloments of lime, as for stilllab'eady, hut a discrete partial order made of discourse referents (cf. 
DRT) arranged according to the relative obliqueness of grammatical functions. Note that in multiclausal 
constructions there is the corresponding subordination of different chmsal obliqueness hmrarchles (for the sake 
(51' conmarahility with diagrams (5) involving time arrow, Hasse dtaognnns for obliqueness are displayed 
with a turn of 90 right): 
(8) Kim said l.ee saw Max.

The sequence of two Ol)l)osite semiohases is defined by a property P. Contrarily to what happens 
with aheadv, where operator (quantifier) and operarid (durativc tiruposition} arc rendered by different 
expressions m binding phase cluantihcation tim operand 1' is a so conlrdmted by the nonfinal 
expressing the operator, i.e. expressing the binding 
phase quantifier. For a eiven nominal N P is determined by tile relative 
positi('~ of N 'n tic "scale". F(u a discomse reterenl r 
corresponding to N, semiDhase P is a linear stretch containine ofily elements that arc less than or e ual to 
r in the ~bliquencss order, that is discourse re~erents cortes ~ondinto non|inals o-commanding N 
Moreover, if semlphasc t is presupposed to precede semiphase ~P, P is st,ch thai the last successor m it is 
local wrt to r; and if semiDhase -P is presupposed to precedes sennphase P, P is such that the first 
predecessor in it is local wrt to r. in both cases the closest t' nei~hbour of sclniphase -P has to be local 
wrt r, where flw notion of locality has the usual sense given in the definition of binding principles: 
(10) P(x) iffdef x ~< r & Vy\[(-P(y)& 
(x--<y or y-<x)) -->x is local wrt rl 
As to the l)arameter l)oint, in binding phase quantification, it is the discourse referent a ",~hich is 
tile antecedent of r. 
2.2 Binding
l)hase quantiliers 
We can now fornlalise phase quantil:ication subiacent to nominals. Let us start with an anaphoric 
expression N like himselfi 
(ll)Kim said Lee thinks Maxi hit himself/. 
*Kim said l~eei thinks Max hit himsell'i. 
QA: XP.s°mc'(Xx'(GSI(-P,a)<x<~a),p) 
--,P )~a P 
\[~ -c0-oZ---o~ 
1 k 1 r 
N can thus be interpreted as presupposing that a semip.hase -P precedes a semiphase P and requiring 
that the paranmter point occurs in the latter, that is, the antecedent a is to be found in semiphase P among 
the discourse referents corresponding fo the local ocommanders of r, the disc referent corresponding to NL 
This is captured by the definition of the phase quantifier QA. Satisfaction of QA(P) obtains iff 
between the bottom of the unmtemlpted linem" sequence ~P most close to the parameter 
polnffantecedent a and a inclusive there is at least one discourse referent in P. Given-P.P, this amounts to 
requiring that a be in P, and that a be a local o
commander of r. 3 Next, it is then easy to see how the phase 
¢luantificational force of a l)ronominal expressmn N s\]lould be formalised: 
(12) *Kim said Lee thinks Max/hit him/. 
Kim said Lee/thinks Max hit him/. 
QB:XP.no'(Xx.(GSI(M ), a) < x _< a),P) 
-._ _;L ............ ....... 
x 1 k 1 :m r , (XIi~ 
Here tile parameter point a occurs in semiphase ~1 ), which amounts to the antecedent being picked outside 
the set of local o-commanders. OB(P) ts satisfied iff no discourse referent between the bottom of the 
tmintermpted linear sequence -P more close to the parameter |soint/ antecedent a and a inch|sive is in P. 
Given ~P.P, this amounts to requirin~ that a be in semiphase -q', and that a he not a h)ca'\[ o-connnander 
oft. Like in diagram of (1 1), ~P is taken here its the 
complcment set of P. All discourse referents which me not local o-commanders of r are in it, either o
commanding r or not. Notice that set ~P includes also discourse referents Xl...x n introduced by previous 
sentences or the extra-lin.euistic context, which in constructions similar to (F2)b. accounts for possible 
deictic readings of the pronoun. Below, when studying R-expressions, wc will see why. the possible nGi 
lmearity of the obliqueness or~ler will led us to consider that ~P is slightly more complex than just 
the complement set of 15. Comin,, now to long-distance reflexives, ruled 
~" ' ' iT " ' by tile lourth blnd|n~ prmmple in (I), we ,get the 
folh)wing formalisation: 
(13)\[O amigo de Kim\]i disse que ele prdprioi acha ClUe Lee vm Max. (Portuguese) 
I Kim's friend \]i said LDRi dlinks Lee sltw Max. 
*\[O amigo de Kimi\] disse que cle prdprioi acha qt,e l,ee viu Max. 
\[Kiln'si friend\] sltkl LDRi thinks l,ee saw Max. 
Qz:)~P.every'(Xx.(GSl(P, a)<x_<a),P)

3For tile sake of shnplicity, lt~l'~2ClllCl|\[ I'cqlAIFt2H\]CII|S bQ.tWCeI| N 
and its antecedent arc ovcrh)oked here. 
183 
Here, like for short-distance reflexives in (11), a is required to occur in P though the p.resupposition now 
is that semiphase P is followed by semiphase -P. Taking. into account the definition of P in (10), the 
antecedent of N is thus required to be an o-commander ~ocal or not) of N. The semantics of pha.se quantit!er 
.QZ is such that, for Qz(P) to be satisfied, 0etween the tmttom of tlae uninterrupted linear sequence P more 
close to the parameter point/antecec'tent a and a inclusive every ..discourse referent is in P. This 
amounts to requmng that a be in semiphase P, and that a be an o-commander of r. 
Finally R-expressions call to be formalised as the fourth phase quantifier of (7): 
(14) \[Kim'si friend\] said Kimi thinks Lee saw Max. 
*\[Kim's friend\]/said Kim/thinks Lee saw Max. 
Qc:XP.not every'(Xx.(GSI(P,a)<x< a),P) 
P -P 
1 m 
. \] 
O \[ xn k 
a | 
The parameter point a is required to occur in -P, which means that a cannot be an o-commander (local or not) 
of r. This renders the same condition as expressed by Principle C, that R-expressions be free, though it also 
encodes an uncommon assumption about the referential autonomy of R-expressions. Here, like for 
other more obvious dependent reference nominals, the interpretation of R-expressions is taken as being 
dependent on the interpretation of other expressions or on the salience of.discourse referents made available by 
the commumcatlve context. Taking an extreme example in order to support the plausibility of this 
view and awkwardly abbreviate a deep philosophical discussion, one should notice that even a proper name 
is not a unique label of a ~iven individual, once knowing who is the person called John (out oI those 
we know that are named John) depends on the context. Note that like in previous diagrams, ~P is taken in 
(14) just as the complement set of P. However, OC asks finally for a serious ponderation of this and-a 
more accurate definition of -P tbr phase quantification in non linear orders, where it is possible that not all 
elements are comparable. For Qc(P) to be satisfied, between the bottom of P 
and the parameter point/ antecedent a inclusive not every discourse referent is in P. Since we have here the 
presupposition P.-P, andviven P is an uninterrupted linear sequence, this woulffamount to requiring ttiat a 
be in -P. It is worth noting then that if we keep -P simply as 
the complement set of P, the interpretation of Rexpressions is however not adequately predicted by 
Qc(P). 
(15) John said Kimj thinks Lee saw Max.

Let D be ix: GSI(P,a)<x_<. a}, t.he domain of QC. "I'akin~: (15)b., it is easy to check tlmt in constructions 
like (\[5)a., D is always empty. In fact, it is not the case that GSI(P,a)_<a as a=x \[is not comparable to any 
element of P, and afortiori it is not comparable to the bottom.of P. Consequently, every(D,P) is trivially 
true wllatever discourse referent xn we take as antecedent for r, and not every'(D,P) is trivially false. 
The interpretation of (15)a. sketched in (15)b. would thus be incorrectly ruled out. 
What these considerations seem then to suggest is that, when phase quantification operates on non linear 
orders, negation of the operand P is slightly, more complex tSan simple Boolean negation renderinz the 
or ' ~ , complement set. We arc thus tau~,fit that negatmn ot P 
involves also the lifting of the complement set o~ P, P_l_, with _1_ equal to r, the top of P, when P.-P . It 
is easy to check with diagram (15)c. that this specilication of ~P makes it possible to satisfy Qc(P) 
in exactly the correct constructions.

Binding Square of Duality

3 Consequences

This new conception of binding seems to have important consequences not only-in terins of the 
understandintz of de~ndent relerence mechanisms captured by Binding Theory but also in terms of our 
conception of generalised quantification in natural language, of lhe twofold semantic capacity, of nominal 
expressmns, referential and quantificational, and maybe even of the nature of grammar devices. Here we cannot 
do but to limit ourselves to hint how a few central issues ustmlly associated to binding are handled under 
this new viewpoint, before we proceed to briefly consider its consequences for the implementation of 
Binding Theory in constraint based grammars. 
3.1 Further
insights into binding... 
Parameterization It is well known that though binding principles are assumed to hold universally m 
all languages, final "grammatical geometry" 0ctwcen 
184 
nominals and their antecedents may be different from 
language to language. Daliymple (93) pointed out that this is due to language 
soecffic conditmns impinging (i) on the eligibihty of the antecedent (whether it is a Subicct or not) and(ii) 
the range of the local domain (whether it IS finite, tensed, etc.). As to (i), Branco and Marrala (97) showed 
that it is a consequence of a lexical property of the 
oredicates, whose oblklueness hierarchy nmy be either linear or non linear. A~s to OiL this variation may Lv 
accommodated in the definitmn 5)f property P in (10), in particular in the definition of local wrt to r', to tie 
provide for each particular language. Both solutions are 
perfectly conlluent with the UG standpoint that binding variations across language are the result of 
\]~ ararneterlzatlt)n. ,exieal cads 4 It is also well known that although 
the four bi'fidl~g l~rinciples are claimed to be universal there arc languages which have not all tile 
corresponding fonr ty 9e of nominals. For instance, English is not known ~o have long-distance retlexives. 
The answer tor this becomes now quite simole: like 
what happens in otber squares of duality, it is "possible that not every corner of the square ts lexmalized. 
Loebner (87) discusses at length the issue. In English, for instance, it is noted that the square of duality 
concernimz deontic possibility inw)lving right happens to have only two lexicalized corners, right and 
duty,. Exemption and logoohoricity Also v~orth 
considering here is the bordcrline case where the maximum shrink of selniphase P occurs, i.e. when P 
is the singleton whose sole clenlent is r, the discourse referent ¢vhose interpretation is to bc anchored by 
finding an antecedent for it. Given the definition of binding phase, quantifiers~ the 
maximum shrink of P into a singleton affects significantly only the quantiliers where the parameter 
Doinl/antecedent a is to be found in P, namely QA and QZ. In these cases, for a to he in P an~l" the 
qufintification to be satisfied, a can only be r, r being 
thus its own antecedent. Consequently, although the quantification is satisfied a "meaningful" anchoring of 
the discourse referent r is still to be accomplished smce by the sole effect of quantification satisfaction r is just 
anchored to itself. Adlniltedly an overarching interpretability requirement imposes that the 
significant anchorin~ of nominals be consutnmated. which induces in present case an exceptional 
loeoohoric effect: for the anaphor (short or longdis~ahce) to bc interpreted, and given that satisfaction 
of its binding constraint is ensured, it should thus !".'ee!y . find an antecedent outside any specific 
restrtctton. This constitutes thus an exphmation for the excmotion 
restrictions in the definitions of Principles A and Z and so called logophoric effects associated to exempt 
anaphors. RestrLctions which appeared until now to be mere stipnlations receive in tins approach a principled 
j ustification. 
3.2 .... for a lean implementation 
The new corleeption of Binding Theory presented in this paper is currently being intcgratecr in an HPSG 
grammar imolemented in ProFIT 1.54. Space limits restrict us here to a very. brief rationale of that 
implementation, which will be fully presented in 
future papers. The interestin,, 3oint to note in tiffs connection is that 
the new msl~at into binding phenomena ehmted by the discoverv~of their qua!ltihcation.al nature see,.ns to 
constitute a breakthrough lor the dgstdqratt\[nt of gtvlng Binding Theory a lean declarattve, tmplen)entatlqn. 
Adooting a prmciDle based scmantles m line w~tll Fran'k and Reyle (95), the central goal is not anymore

it is cmpixically not necessary, \[or the sake of uniformity,

be assumed. 
to filter coindexations between NPs in post-processing but rather to identify the relcwmt sets ol discourse 
referents against which satisfation of the binding phase quantificatmn expressed by NPs is checked. 
In practical terms that involves first collecting discourse referents into set values of soecific features, 
requiring a minor extension to "HPSG feature declaration. Second, given the possible non local 
nature of the elements of a given set, in order to awhd termination pr9blems ' solne mechanism of delaying 
constraint satisfaction Ires to be ensured. 
Conclusions 
The research reported here present a cogent argtnnent for the quantificational nature of sentential dependent 
reference relations among nominals. This radically new conception ot' binding appears as a decisive step 
towards a full lean declarative enconlpassing of Binding Theory in constraint based ,,~ratnnmrs. It may 
have a'lso opened new intriguing ~lirections for the research on natural langtm.ge generalised quantification, 
on the apparent twolold semantic capacity of nominals, referential and quantificational, or on the 
nature of gralrnnar devices.
