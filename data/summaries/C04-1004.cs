In recent years, HMMs have enjoyed great success in many tagging applications, most notably part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Church 1988; Weischedel et al 1993; Merialdo 1994) and named entity recognition (Bikel et al 1999; Zhou et al 2002).

Experimentation The corpus used in shallow parsing is extracted from the PENN TreeBank (Marcus et al.1993) of 1 million words (25 sections) by a program provided by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University.

Moreover, there have been also efforts to extend the use of HMMs to word sense disambiguation (Segond et al 1997) and shallow/full parsing (Brants et al 1997; Skut et al 1998; Zhou et al 2000).

Zhou et al (2000) systematically derived the exact same model as in Punyakanok and Roth (2000) and used back-off modeling to esimate the probability of a state given the observation sequence (Backoff-DHMM thereafter) while Punyakanok and Roth (2000) used the SNoW classifier to estimate it(SNoW-DHMM thereafter).

This paper follows our previous work in Zhou et al (2000) and proposes an alternative nonprojection-based DHMM with long state dependence (LSD-DHMM), which separates the dependence of a state on the previous states and the observation sequence.

kNN Ensemble In the literature, an ensemble has been widely used in the classification problem to combine several classifiers (Breiman 1996; Hamamoto 1997; Dietterich 1998; Zhou Z.H. et al 2002; Kim et al 2003).

The basic idea of using the structural tags to represent the “hidden” states is similar to Skut et al (1998) and Zhou et al (2000).
