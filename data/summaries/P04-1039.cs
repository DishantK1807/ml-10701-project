Mihalcea, on the other hand, bases the bootstrapping approach on a generation algorithm, GenCor (Mihalcea&Moldovan, 1999).

We use the sense annotated data produced by Diab’s unsupervised system SALAAM (Diab&Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003).

At first blush, one is inclined to hypothesize that, the combination of low perplexity associated with a large number of senses — as an indication of high skew in the distribution — is a good indicator of high PR, but reviewing the data, this hypothesis is dispelled by day which has 16 senses and a sense perplexity of a48 a42a45a38, yet yields a low PR score of a41a43a42a41a1a56 . 5.4 Semantic Translation Entropy Semantic translation entropy (STE) (Melamed, 1997) is a special characteristic of the SALAAMtagged training data, since the source of evidence for SALAAM tagging is multilingual translations.

Two more recent investigations are by Yarowsky, (Yarowsky, 1995), and later, Mihalcea, (Mihalcea, 2002).

For instance, SALAAM has been used to bootstrap the WSD process for Arabic as illustrated in (Diab, 2004).
