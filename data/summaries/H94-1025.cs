To support extensibility to new languages, the MT ontology should be language-neutral, if not language-independent\[Hovy and Nirenburg, 1992\].

1. Semantic distance measurement To reduce the number of open words, the example match is being improved by using a more sophisticated algorithm for the semantic distance measured in the ontology\[Resnik, 1993; Knight, 1993\].

To enhance the semantic processing in MT systems, many system include conceptual networks called ontologies or semantic taxonomies \[Bateman, 1990; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Hovy and Knight, 1993; Klavans et al., 1990; Klavans et al., 1991; Knight, 1993\].

3.1. Equivalent-word Match The equivalent-word match algorithm is based on the algorithm developed by K.Knight for merging LDOCE and WordNet\[Knight, 1993\] and Knight's bilingual match algorithm\[Knight, 1994\].

The ontology is being semi-automatically constructed from the lexical database WordNet\[Miller, 1990\] and the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE)\[Knight, 1993\].

Making the best use of such resources leads to higher quality translation with lower development cost\[Hovy and Knight, 1993; Knight, 1994; Hovy and Nirenburg, 1992\].
