One such formalism is lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Schabes, Abeill~, and Joshi, 1988; Abeillfi et al., 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992), which provides a number of attractive properties at the cost of decreased efficiency, O(n6)-time in the worst case (VijayShanker, 1987; Schabes, 1991; Lang, 1990; VijayShanker and Weir, 1993b).

This result breaks new ground, because heretofore every method of lexicalizing CFCs required contextsensitive operations (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).
P92-1022
One can convert a CFC into an LTAG that preserves the original trees (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).
P92-1022
Recently there has been a gain in interest in the so-called 'mildly' context-sensitive formalisms (Vijay-Shanker, 1987; Weir, 1988; Joshi, VijayShanker, and Weir, 1991; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993a) that generate only a small superset of context-free languages.
J93-4002
Formally, a grammar is said 'lexicalized' (Schabes, Abeill~., and Joshi, 1988) if it consists of:,, a finite set of elementary structures of finite size, each of which c, ontains an overt (i.e., non-empty) lexical item.

The procedure could easily be modified to account for other constraints on the way derivation should proceed such as those suggested for LTAGs (Schabes and Shieber, 1992).
