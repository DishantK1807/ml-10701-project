Similarly to Schabes and Joshi (1988), we extend the notion of dotted rules to trees.

276 conflicts between multiple choices are solved by pseudoparallelism (Lang, 1974, Tomita, 1987).

Similar to the work of Lang (1974) and Tomita (1987) extending LR parsers for arbitrary CFGs, the LR parsers for TAGs can be extended to solve by pseudo-parallelism the conflicts of moves.
