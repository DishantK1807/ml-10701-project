Miller and Fox (1994) compare the performance of parsers using three different types of grammars, and show that a probabilistic contextfree grammar using inside probability (unnormalized) as a figure of merit outperforms both a context-free grammar and a context-dependent grammar.
H94-1051
Kochman and Kupin (1991) propose a figure of merit closely related to our prefix estimate.
H91-1045
Magerman and Weir (1992) use a similar model with a different parsing algorithm.
P92-1006
Bobrow (1990) and Chitrao and Grishman (1990) introduced statistical agenda-based parsing techniques.
H90-1053
Magerman and Marcus (1991) use the geometric mean to compute a figure of merit that is independent of constituent length.
