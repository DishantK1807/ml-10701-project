We used Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (Lin, 1991) as distance measure for semi-supervised clustering and ELP, since plain LP with JS divergence achieves better performance than that with cosine similarity on SENSEVAL-3 data (Niu et al., 2005).

We used three types of features to capture the information in all the contextual sentences of target words in SENSEVAL-3 data for all the four algorithms: part-of-speech of neighboring words with position information, words in topical context without position information (after removing stop words), and local collocations (as same as the feature set used in (Lee and Ng, 2002) except that we did not use syntactic relations).

Many corpus based methods have been proposed to deal with the sense disambiguation problem when given de nition for each possible sense of a target word or a tagged corpus with the instances of each possible sense, e.g., supervised sense disambiguation (Leacock et al., 1998), and semi-supervised sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995).
