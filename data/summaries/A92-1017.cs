as well as "by the impossibility of inserting material that is a priori plausible" (*at {coming, present, cold, dark} night) (Gross, 1986).

Following Gross and Zimmermann (Gross, 1986; Zimmermann, 1987), we propose to further extend standard spelling correction systems onto the level of compound words by making them context-sensitive as well as capable of treating more than a single word at a time.

Although in comparison with, e.g., English, French, Italian, and Spanish, German seems to be unique as concerns the relevance of the context for upper/lower case spellings in a large number of cases, there are at least, as indicated in (Gross, 1986), the thousands of compounds or frozen words in each of these languages which are clearly within reach for the methods discussed.

of Implementation A first prototype of the system described above has been developed in C under UNIX within the ESPRIT II project 2315 "Translator's Workbench" (TWB) as one of several separate modules checking basic as well as higher levels of various languages Ilike grammar and style; see (Thurmair, 1990) and (Winkelmann, 1990)\].
C90-1018 C90-2063
Restricting the system that way makes our approach to context-sensitiveness different from the one considered in (Rimon and Herz, 1991), where context sensitive spelling verification is proposed to be done with the help of "local constraints automata (LCAs)" which process contextual constraints on the level of lexical or syntactic categories rather than on the basic level of strings.

Yet, at least for the entirely and nearly entirely frozen forms, simple string matching operations will do (Gross, 1986).

It thus could complement the two-level checker discussed in (Vosse, 1992) by correcting especially those errors in idiomatic expressions, like "te alle tijden" -> "te allen tijde", which cannot be detected on word or sentence level; compare (Vosse, 1992).

As indicated by Maurice Gross in his COLING 86 lccturc (Gross, 1986), European languages contain thousands of what he calls "frozen" or "compound words".
