An example of the former is Berkeley’s FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998), which produces rich semantic frames, annotating a set of examples for each predicator (including verbs, nouns and adjectives), and describing the network of relations among the semantic frames.

PropBank II annota59 tion (eventuality ID’s, coarse-grained sense tags, nominal coreference and selected discourse connectives) is being applied to a small (100K) parallel Chinese/English corpus (Babko-Malaya et al., 2004).

Building on results in grouping fine-grained WordNet senses into more coarse-grained senses that led to improved inter-annotator agreement (ITA) and system performance (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2006), we have developed a process for rapid sense inventory creation and annotation that includes critical links between the grouped word senses and the Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005; see Section 5 below).

The 1M word Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal corpus has been successfully annotated with semantic argument structures for verbs and is now available via the Penn Linguistic Data Consortium as PropBank I (Palmer et al., 2005).

and Future Work PropBank I (Palmer et al., 2005), developed at UPenn, captures predicate argument structure for verbs; NomBank provides predicate argument structure for nominalizations and other noun predicates (Meyers et al., 2004).

The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is annotated with information to make predicate-argument structure easy to decode, including function tags and markers of “empty” categories that represent displaced constituents.

The best current algorithm for semantic role labeling for PropBank style annotation (Pradhan et al., 2005) achieves an F-measure of 81.0 using an SVM.

The OntoNotes terms are represented in the 110,000-node Omega ontology (Philpot et al., 2005), under continued construction and extension at ISI.

Training on this new data, Chen and Palmer (2005) report 86.3% accuracy for verbs using a smoothed maximum entropy model and rich linguistic features, which is 10% higher than their earlier, stateof-the art performance on ungrouped, fine-grained senses.

To expedite later stages of annotation, we have developed a parsing system (Gabbard et al., 2006) that recovers both of these latter annotations, the first we know of.
