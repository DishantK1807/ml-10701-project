6 6 Summary and Conclusion A modification to the algorithm of \[Hobbs and Shieber 1987\] based on a hint from standard logical theory has led to a simpler algorithm, and one which makes no illegitimate appeal to tile syntax of logical form.

\[Pereira 1989\] calls this 'The Free; Variable Constraint' and complains of an appeal to logical syntax.
P89-1019
\[Hobbs and Shieber 1987\] presented an algorithm to generate quantifier scopings from a representation of "predicate-argument relations and the relations of grammatical subordination" (pg 49).

A Quantifier Scoping Algorithm without A Free Variable Constraint Inn L ew in Department o.\[ Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh 80 South Bridge Edinburgh EH1 1HN emaih il@aipna.ed.ac.uk Abstract Three recent demands on quantifier scoping algorithms have been that they should be explicitly stated, they should be sound and complete with respect to the input sentence \[Hobbs and Shieber 1987\] and they should not employ a 'Free Variable Constraint' \[Pereira 1989\].

I present a modified version of \[Hobbs and Shieber 1987\], which simplifies its operation, and can be considered sound and complete, depending on what interpretations of English sentences are deemed possible.
