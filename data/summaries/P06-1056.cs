Li and Li (2004) have shown that word translation and bilingual bootstrapping is a good combination for disambiguation.

Unlike Yarowsky (1995), we use automatic collection of seeds.

Determining the sense of an ambiguous word, using bootstrapping and texts from a different language was done by Yarowsky (1995), Hearst (1991), Diab (2002), and Li and Li (2004).

Diab (2002) has shown that unsupervised WSD systems that use parallel corpora can achieve results that are close to the results of a supervised approach.
P02-1033
Hewson (1993), Lowe and Mazadon (1994) used systematic sound correspondences to determine protoprojections for identifying cognate sets.
J94-3004
Yarowsky (1995) has used a few seeds and untagged sentences in a bootstrapping algorithm based on decision lists.

One of the most active researchers in identifying cognates between pairs of languages is Kondrak (2001; 2004).
