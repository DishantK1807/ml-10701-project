The agreement was statistically significant (Kappa = 0.65.0 > 0.01 for Japanese and Kappa = 0.748,0 > 0.01 for English (Carletta, 1996; Siegel-and Castellan, 1988)).

Studies of instruction manuals (RTsner and Stede, 1992; Delin et al., 1994: Delin et al., 1996) suggest that there are variations with respect to the way high-level communicative goals are realized across languages.

Unfortunately, the research of Delin et al.(1994) and Bateman and Rondhuis (1997) cannot be applied yet to unrestricted domains.

To this end, one could use both topdown (How, 1993; Moore and Paris, 1993) and bottom-up (Marcu, t997; Mellish et al., 1998) text planning algorithms.

Marcu et al.(2000) present and evaluate a discourse-tree rewriting algorithm that exploits machine learning methods in order to map Japanese discourse trees into discourse trees that resemble English-specific renderings.

We developed a discourse annotation protocol for,Japanese and English along the lines followed by Marcu et al.(1999). We used Marcu's discourse annotation tool (1999) in order to manually construct the discourse structure of all Japanese and English texts it, the corpus.

text plan representations that are more abstract than discourse trees Delin et al.(1994) have shown that although tile rhetorical renderings in Figure 1 are non-isomorphic.

(Delin et al.(1994) have shown how Generation and Enablenlent relations are realized rhetorically in various languages using relations such as PURPOSE, 'SEQUENCE, CONDITION, and MEANS).

For example, Delin et al.(1994) noticed that sentences (1), (2), and (3), which were taken from a trilingual instruction manual for a step-aerobics machine, yield nonisomorphic Rhetorical Structure (Mann and Thompson, 1988) analyses in English, French, and German respectively (see Figure 1).

The natural language generation community has emphasized for a number of years the strengths of multilingual generation (MGEN) systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; RTsner and Stede, 1992; Reiter and Mellish, 1993; Goldberg et al., 1994; Paris et al., 1995; Power and Scott, 1998).

The results in Section 3 strongly suggest that if one is to build text plans in the context of a JapaneseEnglish multilingual generation system, a languageindependent text planning module whose output is mapped straightforwardly into sentence plans (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Goldberg et al., 1994) will not do.
