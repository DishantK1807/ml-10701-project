<context>t ne is often used as a clitic, such as in Example 4 (a non-partitive occurrence). This can be the case with any of the three uses described above.2 1All examples are from the “la Repubblica Corpus” (Baroni et al., 2004), a corpus of about 380M tokens of Italian newswire data. The ne is bold-faced, the antecedent is underlined, and the predicate is in italics. 2Clitics are not considered in this study, but will be i</context>
<context>emes The development of the annotation guidelines was based on the existing theoretical work (in particular (Renzi et al., 2001)) and on the direct analysis of 150 occurrences of ne in newswire data (Baroni et al., 2004). In our scheme we introduce three main annotation categories: ne, antecedent, and predicate. Anaphoric uses of ne can fall in one of four classes: partitive, non-partitive, vague, and cataphoric.

The data is already marked up with part-of-speech, lemma, and sentence boundary information. We split this set in two and used 150 samples to develop the annotation guidelines (see Section 2. above</context>

The annotation was performed using a customised version of GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002).
