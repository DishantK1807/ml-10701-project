The overall scheme of the work at CRL on Inachine readable dictionaries is described in Wilks et al.(1988, 1989, 1990).

299-304. Chicago, IL Markowitz, Judith, Thomas Ahlswede, and Martha Evens (1986).
P86-1018
Unlike Nakamura & Nagao (1988), we propose that "member of'' definitions should not be grouped with the "set of", "group of" definitions.
C88-2098
Chodorow et ~d., (1985) automate the genus finding process for nouns and verbs in Webster's Seventh (W7, 1967).
P85-1037
Nakamura, Jun-ichi, and Makoto Nagao (1988).
C88-2098
Nakamura 8: Nagao (1988) automatically constructed a utxonomy, but did not distinguish the senses of nouns and hence cannot allow inheritance of properties along the links of the implied network created by the taxonomy.
C88-2098
Chodorow et al., (1985) refer to a subset of these as "empty heads".
P85-1037
Nakamura & Nagao (1988) identify 41 different function nouns and replace the IS-A link in their taxonomy with various other links in these cases (except in the "kind of", "type of", etc., definitions).
C88-2098
Nakamura & Nagao (1988) call them Function Nouns.
C88-2098
Chodorow et al.(1985) examined a phenomenon that they described as follows: "If the word found belongs to a small class of "empty heads" (words like one, any, kind, class, manner, family, race, group, complex, etc).
P85-1037
Nakamura & Nagao (1988), identify these non-sumdard definitions syntactically as: {det.} {adj.}* <Function Noun> of <Key Noun> {adj.
C88-2098
In general, our view is that the disturbeA heads should be grouped in the sense of Nakamura & Nagao (1988), and that additional links (like HAS MEMBER, IS PART OF, etc).
