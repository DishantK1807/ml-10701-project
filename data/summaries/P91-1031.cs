\[Shieber et al.1990, Gerdemarm and Hinrichs 1990\] The strategies do not allow the grammar writer to attach control information to the constraints in the grammar.

They play an even greater role in the processing of Constraint Logic Grammars (CLG) \[Balari et al.1990\]. The delaying scheme is a more sophisticated 243 method for the ordering of conjuncts.

The family of grammar models that are based on such formalisms include Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) \[Gazdar et al.1985\], Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) \[Bresnan 1982\], Functional Unification Grammar (bUG) \[Kay 1984\], Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (I-IPSG) \[Pollard and Sag 1988\], and Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) \[Karttunen 1986, Uszkoreit 1986, Zeevat et al.1987\]. Research for this paper was carried out in parts at DFKI in the project DIsco which is funded by the German Ministry for Research and Technology under Grant-No.: 1TW 9002.

Thus for any automatic counting scheme some constant shuffling and reshuffling of the conjunct order needs to be applied until the order stabilizes (see also \[Kogure 1990\]).

This observation is the basis for a reordering method proposed by Kogure \[1990\].
