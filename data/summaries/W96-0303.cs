Resnik 1995), could lead to an estimate of frequencies for word senses in general, with rule-derived senses simply being a special case.

We can model this aspect of language use as a conditional probability that a word form will be associated to a specific lexical entry: freq(lexical-entry with word-form) Prob(lexical-entry \[ word-form)-freq(word-form) This proposal is not novel and is the analogue of proposals to associate probabilities with initial trees in a Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (Resnik, 1992; Schabes, 1992).

Black et al., 1993; Schabes, 1992; Resnik, 1992), but the difficulty of acquisition means that the validity of utilizing lexical probabilities of the type assumed here has not yet been demonstrated on a large scale.

sense or grammatical realization) is often highly skewed; Church (1988) points out that a model of part-of-speech assignment in context will be 90% accurate (for English) if it simply chooses the lexically most frequent part-of-speech for a given word.

In an experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system (Alvey NL Tools, ANLT) Briscoe and Carroll (1993) observed that half of the parse failures were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the lexicon.

Briscoe and Carroll, 1995; Manning, 1993) could eventually be exploited to give frequency information.

The ANLT lexicon was derived semi-automatically from a machine readable dictionary (LDOCE), and although the COMLEX syntax dictionary (Grishman et al., 1994), which was derived with much greater amounts of human effort, has a slightly better performance, the difference is not great.

For example, Bouma & van Noord (1994) and Johnson & Dorre (1995) propose techniques for delayed evaluation of lexical rules so that they apply 'on demand' at parse time.
