I I . 48 1 General Discussion 1.1 Consultative Production Systems A consultation proqram plays the mle of an expert consultant in some domain, ~ivin~ advice or answers to non-experts with ~roblems in the domain.
Users will often want to know how the svstea arrived at its results durinq a particular consultation.
This Daper explalns how the implementation of such a proqram as a ~rod~ction system can fac~lltate program-generated ex~lanations.
A production system [2] consists of three basic components.
a set of production rules, a data base which is both used and updated bv these rules, and a rule interpreter.
A production rule often is in the form of a situation-action rule.
it describes a situation and a set of actions to be taken if tbis situation is found to exist.
The rule intermeter deternines the order In which rules will be tried, checks to see if the situations exist, and undertakes the required actions.
It also determines how manv of the potentially useful rules wjll be used.
only the flrst (where orderinq may be predetermined or comouted dynamically), all possible rules, or enough rules to satisfy some criterion that the interpreter uses.
In some production systems, rules are always trled in a predetermined order.
In others, the order in which rules are tried varies with different consultations, since a rule will be tried as soon as the rule interpreter determines that it may be useful.
In such svsteas, the common alternatives are data-directed rule invocation, in which a rule is considered "usefulff if its situation part matches the data base, and qoaldirected rule invocation, in which a rule is if its action part will help the system reach its current goal.
Many systems use a combination of soaland data-directed rule invocation.
A consultative production system need not be a psycholoqical model, imitating a human s reasoning process.
The imporbant point is that the System and a human expert use the same (or similar) knowledqe about the domain to arrive at the same answer to a given problem.
The svstem's rules and data base can be viewed as a knowledge base containinq the domainspeclfic knowledge of an expert as well as facts about a particular broblem.
When a rule is used, its actlons make changes to the data base which are the sy5tem's decisions or deductions.
Thus, a rule can be thouqht of as a plece of judgmental knowledqe, using the judqment and knowledge of au expert to make deductions.
The process of trying rules and taking actlons can be thouqht of as llreasonsngw, and explanations consist of showing how rules used information provided by the user to make various intermediate de~uctions and finally to arrive at the answer.
If the information contained in these rules is sufficient to show why an action was taken (without aettinq into programming details), an explanation can conslst of printing each rule that was used (or an Engllsh equivalent of what the rule means,) EXPLANATION ' CAPABILITY PRODUCTION RULES Judqmental Knowled~e about domain General Factual Knowledge of domain Figure 1.
A Production-Based Consultation System with Explanation Capability The three coniponents of a production system (a RULE INTERPRETER, a set of PRODUCTION RULES, and a DATA BASE 1 are augmented by an EXPLANATION CAP4BILITY.
The data base is made up of general facts about the system's domain of expertise, facts that the user enters about a specific problem, and deductions made about the problem by the system's rules.
These deductions form the basis of the syst en's consultative advice.
The explanation capability makes use of the system's knowled_qe base to qive the user explanations.
This knowledae base is made UD of static domain-specif ic knowledge ( both factual and jud mental) and dynamf,~ knowledge specific to a particular problem' 1.2 Performance Characteristics of an Explanation Capability The purpose of an explanation ca~abilitv (KC) is to qive the user access to as much of the system s knowledge as posbible.
Ideally, it should be easy for a user to get a complete, understandable answer to anv sort of question about the system's knowledge and pera at ion -both in general, and with reference to a particular consultation.
This llplies three major goals in the development of an explanation capability.
1) To ensure that the EC can handle questions about all relevant aspects of the system'$ knowledge and actions.
It should be capable of giving a few baslo types of explanations, for example.
How it made a certain decision How it used a piece of information What decision ~t made about aome subproblem Why it didn t use a certain plece of information Why it failed to ma!ce a certain decision Why it required a certain piece of infornatlon Why it didn t require a certain ~iece of information How it will find out a certain plece of Information [while tRe consultatinn is in oroqress] What the system is currently doing?
[while the consultation is in ~roaress] The mecific set of explanation types which are chosen as basics, however, will depend on the particular system.
2) To enable the user to get an explanation which answers the question completely and comprehensively.
3) To make the EC easy to use.
A novice should be able to use the EC without first spending a large amount of time lehrninq how to request explanations.
We will distinguish two slighfly different functions for an EC and divide it into two components.
the reasoning-status checker (RSC) to be used during the consultation, and the general question answerqr (GQA) to be used during the consultation or after the system has ~rinted its results.
A reasoning-status checker will answer questions asked durinq-a consultation about the status of the systsb s reasoning process, A few simple commands are often sufficient to handle the questions that the RSC is expected to answen A genera question-answer will answer questions about the current state of the syqtem s knowledge base, including both static domain khdwledge and facts accumulated duainq the consultation.
A GQA will often need the ability to recognize a wide range of question types about many aspects of the system's knowledge.
For this reason, it might be difficult to define a few simple commands which would be easy to learn and still cover all the possible questions that might be asked.
Consequently, naturallanguage processlnq in this component may be im~ortant to an explanation system s acce~tability.
In an interactwe consultatlor!, the svstem periodically requests information about the problem.
This offers the user an opportunity to request explanations while the consultation is in proaress.
In noninteractive oonsultatlons, the user has no opportundtv to interact hith the system untll after lt has printed ~ts conclusions.
Unless there 1s some mechanism allowing a user to interrupt the reasoning process and ask questions, the explanation capability for such a system will be limited to questions about the system's final knowledge state.
It will have no reasoning-status checker, and its general.
question-answerer will only be accessible at the termination of the consultatian . 1.3 Knowledge Requirements of an Explanation Capability An EC must know what is in the system's knowledge base, and how it is organized.
In order to give explanations of the svstem's current (or previous) actions, an EC also needs to understand how the system s rule interpreter works.
when ruces w~ll be tried how they can fall, what causes the interpreter to try one rule but not another etc.
This qeneral "schemaw for how or why certain rules are used, toqether with a comprehensive record of the specific actions taken during a particular consultation, can be used a$ a basis fbr explaining the results of that cansultation.
A reasoning-status checker will need d record of what the system has done so far in order to explain how it arr4ved at the current ste~.
General knowledge bf how the rule interpreter works is necessary in order to explain where the current step wlll lead.
The abllity to understand individual rules Also may be necessary to the extent that the content of a rule may explain why it was necessary to use this rule, or may affect which futupe rules will be trled.
A general question-answerer will need more ~nfomatlon about the system since the scope of its explanations is much broader.
its task is to answer general questions about Lhe system's knowledge base.
To do this, it must know how the system stores knowledge about its area of expertise (the static kdowledge with which it starts each consultation) and how it stores facts gathered during a particular consultation (its dynamlc knowledge).
These two types of information will allow a GQA to answer guestions about the substance and extent of the ~roduction system's current knowledge.
If an explanation capability also is ta provide information about how the system arrived at the facts that are currently in its dynamic knowledge base, the GQA will need all the information that a reasoninpstatus checker uses.
a detailed record of the consultation, an understand in^ of the rule snterpreter, and the ability to understand rules.
These three types of knowledge could be supplemented with a limited amount of qeneral information about such thinqs as elementary losic, set theory, and arithmetic comparisons.
This would allow the GQA to answer more complicated questions about why the system's knowledge base IS inb its current state, and to answer questions involving pelationshi~s between different facts in the knowledge base.
The nature of the consult'ation domain as well as what primarv purpose the explanation capability is to serve wlll influence the range of questions that an EC should handle.
In some systems, a slm~le retrieval of facts may suffice, while others may need to give detailed description 01 the product ion system's ltdeclsionfl Drocess and to make a number of deductions from facts that it has.

Knolwledge Requirements of an Explanation Capability Access to the consultation system's knowledge base is a prerequisite for performance of the explanation capabilltv.
Other types of knowledqe may be added to the system to enable the EC to answer a wider range of questlona, L 1.4 Program Deaign Considerations The last two sections described what an explanation capability is, butlininq what tasks it should perfom, and what it requires in order to per1 om these tasks, In thisl section, we discuss design considerations for the parent production system that will enable its EC to meet the requirements that were outlined in the previous section.
This discussion is not meant to define the vcorrectw way of representing or organizing knowledge, but rather to mention certain factors which should be taken into account when declding what representation or orqanization will be best for a given product Ion system.
1.4.1 Question
Types The first step ~s to decide what basic types of questions the system should be able to answer.
This will have a direct Influence on how the EC is im~lemented.
It is important, however to make the rnitial desl~n flexible enough to accomodate possible future additions to the set of basics.
If the basic forms are diverse enough, some level of naturallanguaqe understanding may be necessary.
The degree of sophlstlcation of the natural-languacze processor will depend won what kind of ~erformance is.
expected of the EC 1.4.2 Organization of Knowledge The format and organigation of various components of the production system's knowledge base will affect the deslgn of an EC.
Individual ~ieces of static and dynamic knowledge presumably will be organized m some fashion which makes them accessible during the consultation.
A GOA facility could make use of such organization to help In finding the information needed bo answer a question.
The less organized the knowledge base the more difficult wxlf, be the task of the EC, as more complicated routines must be used in order to find the desired ~nformation.
During the cQurse of the consultation, the system should keep a record of its actlons for use by both Co~nponents of the explanation capability.
Where the ordering of events is important (e.~;.
when the action of one rule establishes the situation necessary for a subsequent rule to yuuceed), the record should be structured in a madner which reflects the ordering of events as well as the reasons whv each event occurred.
1.4.3 Knowledge
of What Rules Mean The explanation capability will need to understand some of the semantics of indlvldual production rules.
Thls requirement could be met by having the svstem's knowledge base include a description of what each Pule means, encoded in some form which would be of use to the EC.
If the format of the system's rules is highly stylized and well-defined, however, it might be possible instead to implement a mechanism for 'Iread~ng" the rules.
the language in which the rules themselves are written could be defined.
A high-level description of the individual components of this language, telling what each component means, could be used to enable the EC to read and understand rules.
If the rule set consists of a large nuaber of rules, and these rules are composed entirely of a relatively small number of primitive elements, this second approach has the advantage that less information needs ts be stored -a description of each of the orimit~ve components, as opposed to a description of each rule.
When new rules are added to the system, the first approach requires that descriptions of these rules must be added.
With the second approach, provided that the new rules are made up of the standard rule components, no additional descriptite information would be needed by the explanation capabilitv.
1.4.4 Knowledge
of the Rule Interpreter Enabling an EC to understand how t,he rule interpreter works is analoqous to enabling lt to understand rules It must be able to "read" the interpreter or else it must have access to some stored description of how the interpreter works.
?here is a thirkl approach for understandlnq the rule interpreter, one whlch would not be feasible for understand in,^ a larse number of rules.
Knowledge of how the interpreter works could be built into the EC -the information would not be stated explicitly, but would be used implicitly by the programmer In writing the actual code for the explsnation capability.
The EC can be thousht of as a number of ms~ec1a1ist3ff, each capable of glving a single type of explanation.
There could he one specialist for each of the baslc questlon tv~es that the systen can answer.
Each of the specialists needs only a small amount of ~nfomation about the rule interpreter whlch could be built Into ~ts ltexplalnln~n procrea.
1.4.5 Other
Domain-Independent Knowledge The final type of knowledge that some general quest~on-answering facilities wlll need is lnformatlon allowinq deductions to be vade froa facts In the knowledge base.
The re~resentation and extent oC thls knowledge will depend upon the types of questions that the system is to answer If logic is needetl onlv to dete~mine the answers to questions of a certain tvpe for example, the necesaarv deductions could be built into the specialist for answerinq that type of question.
On the other hand, in aowe explanation capibilities, the GQA will be expanded to do more than simply qive explanations of the system s actions or to query its data base -it will be expected to answer a wide range of questions involvlnq various kinds sf inferences about the knowled~e base.
Such a CQA will need to check for equality or set membership, make arithqetic compariSons, or make logical deductions.
In general most information of this type can be embodied In a new kind of specialist which is an expert at some sort of logical deduction or comparison.
Representation of this sort of qeneral knowled~e will become important as the GO4 becomes not sinlply an explanation tool, but also a deduct ive one.
2 An
Example -MYCIN 2.1 Overview MYCIN [5,6,7] is an example of a production-based consultation system with a well-developed explanation capability.
A production run is an infectious disease therapy consultation in which MYCIN is the infectious dlseaae expert, and the user is a doctor who wants advice about the treatment of a patient.
Knowledge that is gathered during the consultation is organized into attribute-object-value triples.
In response to questions during the consultation, the user enters information about the existence of several objects, called contexts.
the patient, infections that the patient has, organisms which may be causing these infections, cultures that were taken, and drugs that were qiven, The task of the consultation system is to determine the values of various attributes (called clinical ~arameters) of these contexts.
For example, AGE is a clinical parameter of the patient; IDENTITY is a clinical parameter of an oreanism, with STRFPTOCOCCUS as a possible value; SITE is a parameter of a culture, with BLOOD as a possible value.
A clinical parameter's value may be determined by asking the user, or by using decision rules.
The parameter is said to be rvtracedw when the syBtem has done all it can to find out the parameter's value.
Tracinq a parameter involves asking the user for a value (where applicable) and trying rules for determining the value of that parameter.
Rules are tried until the value is known with certainty or there are no rules left to use.
Each decision rule has a situatiorl part called its PREMISE.
This con9ists of predicates, conditions that are tested to determine whether the indicated situation exists.
If .the conditions in a rule's PREMISE are true, its ACTION will be evaluated, giving new (or updated) values to some parameter(s) . Before a aondrtion in a rule's PREMISE can be tested, the parameters that it mentions must be traced.
For example, before rule 209 (below) can succeed, the system must know the site of the culture, the portal of entry of the organism, and whether the patient is a compromised host.
If any of the clauses in the PREMISE is false, or if the system is unable to find out the value of one of these parameters, the rule will fail.
----111 (PREMISE) If: 1) T@e site of the culture is blood, and 2) The portal of entry of the organism is GI, and 3) The patient is a compromised host (ACTION) Then: It 1s definlte (1 -0) that bacteroides is an organism for which therapy should cover Associated with each attribute-object-value triple is a certainty factor -a number between -1 and 1 inclusive which indicates how stronqly the system belleves that the attribute of the object has the indicated value.
The user nay modify the answer to any question with a certainty factor, and all rules make conclusions which specify a degree of oertainty as well as attribute, object, and value.
Each context is named uniquely, allowing the system to refer to CULTURE-2, meaning the second culture, or ORGANISM-3, meaning the third organism.
Moreover, the contexts are orqanized into a tree known as the context tree, which defines relationships among them.
For example, an organism is the direct descendent of' the culture from whicl~ it was isolated.
In the portion of a tree shown in FQure 3 ORGANISM-3 hangs under CULTUR'E-2 indicatinq that STREPTOCOCCUS was isolated from the BLOOD culture.
I NFECTION-2 I INFECTION: PNEUMONIA WHENINFFCT: 2/6/76 CULTURE-2 CU LTURE-3 I SITE: BLOOD SITE: SPUTUM ORGAN ISM-3 IDENTITY: STREPTOCOCCUS Figure 3.
Portion of a Context Tree Showing Some Contexts, Clinical Parameters, and Values The rule interpreter (MYCIV'S control structure, described in detail in ['TI) choases the pules which should be used in the particular consultation, interprets these rules, and creates a record of ~ts actions for use by the explanation system.
Rules are invoked to find out values of parameters in a given context.
A rule is applied to the lowest context in the context tree whose parameters are mentioned by the rule.
The rule can use (or conclude about) parameters of this context, or of anv context which 1s its ancestor In the tree.
For example, if RULE209 were apolied to ORGANISM-3 (see Figure 3) it would need the SITE of the culture from which the STREPTOCOCCUS was isolated.
The tree indicates that this is CULTURE-2, Rather than being a sequential cycle throuqh the rule set, wher-e each rule is tried in some predetepmined order, the flow of control is qoaldirected.
This means that only rules which conclllde about the current goal (to find out the value of a given parameter) are examined.
The PREMISE of one of these rules may need to use some ~arameter whose value is unknown, This sets up a subgoal, namely to deterqine the value of this parameter so that the rule can be used.
MYCIN's goal-direcrted approach means that the system (and not the user) takes the initiative during a consultation.
The user will be asked about onLy those parameters Qhich way be relevant to the particular patient's case.
2.2 OrganizatYon
of Knowledge in MYCXN In order to give explanations of a consultation system's decisions, an explanation capability must have access to the system's knowledge base.
More informative emlanations can be given if the EC also has knowledae of how the syfitem works, a record of the consultation, and possibly some domain-independent knowledae.
This section discusses how MYCIN meets these requirements.
The system's knowledee base consf sts of static medical knowledge plus dynamic knowled3e about a specific consultation.
Static knowledqe is further classified as factual and judgmental.
Factual knowled~e consists of facts which are medically valid inde~endent of the ~ayticular case.
Judgemental knowledge consists of product ion rules representing deduct ions which might be made, conditional an what is already known about the case.
The format of production rules and of dynamic knowledge has already been described.
2.2.3 Organization
of Factual Knowledge As discussed in Section 2.1, all knowledge which is gathered durinq the consultation is organized into attribute-object-value triples.
For consistency, many facts in the static knowledqe base also have this format.
This includes objects such as bacteria and antibiotics, and attributes such as the staininrg characteristics of a bacterium or the recommended dosage of an antibiotic : ATTRIBUTE OBJECT VALUE ------.I----------GRAM E .COLI GRAMNEG DOSE GENTAMICIN 1.7 mq kg q8h IV (or IM) The remainder of the factual knowledge consists of lists and tables: pieces of aedical knowledge, organized m such a way that they can be used to augment the producbion rules.
For example, one such piece of knowledqe is the list of the possible culture sites which are normallv nonsterile, NONSTERILESITES : ( CERVIX CUTANEOUS-ULCER LOCHIA NOSE SKIN STOOL THROAT URETHRA VAGINA) The likely pathogens associated with the different culture sites are organized in a table, with different entries for the different sites, PATH-FLORA -------..-THROAT : (STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE STREPTOCOCCUSGROUP-A NEISSERI A-MENINGITIDIS ) URINE: (E.COLI PSEUDOMONAS ENTEROCOCCUS PROTEUS KLEBSIELLA ENTEROBACTER) SKIN : (STAPHYLOCOCCUS-COAG-POS STREPTOCOCCUSGROUP-A STAPHYLOCOCCUS-COAG-NEG) CERVIX: ( STREPTOCOCCUS CLOST RIDIUM-GANGRENE NEISSERIA-GONORRHA STREPTOCOCCUSGROUP-A ) Production rules can make use of this tabularized information: RULE058 --"-I-If: 1) The site of the culture is one of: those sites that are normally nonsterile, and 2) This organism and at least one of the likely pathogens associated with the site of the culture agree wi'th respect to the following properties: gram morph air Then: There is strongly sugaestive evidence (.9) that each of these pathogens is the identitv of the organism Note that the information in the table could have been 0r~anized as attribute-object-value triples (where the object would be a culture site).
If this had been done, however, the above rule could not have been written.
To accomplish the same purpose (without a change in the control structure), the svstem would have needed several rules -a separate one for each entry in the table.
Structurinq certain facts into lists an.d tables er~ables individual production rules to exDress general theories which allow a number of specific deduct ions to be made.
2.2.2 Procedural
Knowledge Each of MYCIN'S approximately 400 rules is composed of a small number of conceptual primitives.
A total of 60 such primitives make up the language in which rules &re written, This design facilitated the implementation of a mechanisp for translating rules into Enqliah (described in detail in 171).
Each primitivs functions has a translation template with blanks to be filled in with translations of the function's arquments.
A larrr;e part of MYCIN'S exolanation capabilitv depends on this ability to translate rules into a form that the user can understand.
Having a small number of rule components also facilitates the examination of rules to see which might be apnlicable to the explanation at hand.
MYCIN'S knowledge of production rules, therefore, takes the form of a general mechanlsrn for "readinq" rules, On the other hand, no attempt has been made to read the code of the rule interpreter.
Procedural knowledge about the interpreter is embodied in nspecialistsu, epch capable of answerinq a single type of question.
Each specialist knows how the relevant part of the control structure works and what pieces of knowledge it uses.
In order to understand rules, the system's various specialists use a small amount of knowledge about rules in general, tosether with descriptions or templates of each of the rule components.
As an example, the following rule is composed of the units SAND, SAME, and CONCLUDE.
RULE009 ------PREMISE: (SAND (SAME CNTXT GRAM GRAMNEG) (SAME CNTXT MORPH COCCUS)) ACTION : ( CONCLUDE CNTXT IDQNTITY NEISSERIA TALLY 800) [Translation: If: 1) The gram stain of the or~anism is qrarnneg, and 2) The morphology of the organism is coccus Then: There is strongly suggestive (-8) that the identity of the orqanism is Neisseria] [When the rule is used, the LISP atom CNTXT is bound to some object, the context to which the rule is ap~lied (see Section 2.111 The template for CONCLUDE is shown below.
This describes each of the arguments to the function: first, an object (context); second, an attribute (clinical parameter); third, a value for this parameter; fourth, the tally or degree of certainty of the P,REMISE; and last, the certainty factor -a measure of how strong our belief in this conclusion would be, assuming bhat the PREMISE of the rule is definitely true.
CONCLUDE I------TEMPLATE: (CNTXT FARM VALU TALLY CF) To illustrate how this is used, consider an explanation that involves finding all rules which could cbnclude that the identity of an organism is Neisseria.
The appropriate swe.cialist would start with those rules which the avstem uses to conclude values for the parameter IDENTITY.
Using templates of the varlous ACTION functions which appear in each of these rules, the specialist picks out onLy those (like RULE009) which have NEISSERIA in their VALJ slot.
ThQ also illustrates the sort of knowledqe that can be built into a specialist . The specialist knew that the control structure uses stored lists telling which rules can be used to determine the value of each parameter.
Furthermore, ~t knew that lt was necessary to look only at the rules' ACTIONS because it 1s the ACTION that concludes facts, while the PREMISE uses facts.
2.2.3 The
History Tree Many of the explanation capability's specialists need a record of the consultation.
This record 1s built during the consultation, and is organized into a tree structure called the history tree which reflects MYCIN'S goal-directed approach.
Each node in the tree represents a goal and contains Information about how the system tried to accomplish this goal: bv asking the user or by trying rules.
Associated with each rule is a record of whether the rule succeeded, and if not, why it failed.
If trying some rule causes the system to trace a new parameter, thereby setting up a subgoal, the node for this subgoal is the offspring of the node containins the rule which caused the tracing.
Figure 4 illustrates how part of ii history tree miwht look, In this example, R1JLE003 caused tracing of the parlameter CATEGORY which is used in the PREYISE of this rule, Figure 4.
Portion of a History Tree [RULEOO~ is shown above, see Figure 5 for RULE003 and RULE0373 goal: IRENTITY of ORGMISM-1 ask: question 7 rules: RULE009 (failed, clause 1) ...
RULE003 (succeeded) ...
2.2.4 Other
Doma in-Independent Knowledge i MYCIN'S question-answering ability is limited to describing the system's actions, and explaining what facts the system knows.
Some of the specialists for answering questions about the consultation make use of loqic J goal: GRAM of ORGANISM-1 ask: question 11 in arriving at their answers.
In particular, to explain why a decision goal: CATEGORY of ORGANISM-1 rules: RULE037 (succeeded) ...
wasn 't ade, the appropriate specialist uses the logical conclusion that the answer consists of ex~laining what prevented the system from using each of [no rules] the rules that would have made that decision.
I w Y goal : HOSPITAL-ACQIJIRED of ORGANISM-1 ask: questlon 15 [no rules] i b If deductions or comparisons are needed to answer questions of a specific type, then the necessary logic is built into the appropriate specialist.
There is no general representation of knowledge about logic, arithmetic, or set theory that the explanation capability can use to make inferences from different facts in its knowledge base.
To find out whether ORGANISMI and ORGANISM-2 have the same identity, for example, it is necessary for the user to ask separately for the identity of each organism, then bo compare the answers to these questions.
2.3 Scope
of MYC~N'S Explanation Capability The ourpose of the explanation system is to enable a user to see how MCIN makes decisions, both in general and with reference to a particular consultation.
To make this facility as useful as possible, we have trled to antidpate a11 types of questions whlch a user rnlpht ask, and to make every part of the system's khowledge base and reaqoning process accessible through clear explanations, The entire explanation facility consists of a number of components or wspecialistsm each capable of giving a single type of explanation.
These components are grouped into three sets: one for explaining what the system is doing at a given time, one for answering questions about the system's static knowledge base, and one for answering quest ions about the dynamic knowledge base.
The fir& set forms MYCIN 's reasoning-status checker ; the second and third together make up the system s general question-answer.
2.3.1 MYCIN
'a Reasoning-St atus Cheaker Whenever MYCIN asks a question, the user is allowed to interrogate the status of MYCIN'S reanoninq chain bv asking WHY this piece of information is important.
As explained in sections 2.
1 and 2.2, the system asks a question in order to find out about its curpent goal.
Conslder the portion of a history tree shown in Figure 4.
HOSPITAL-ACQUTRED is one subgoal, CATEGORY 13 another at the next level up, atid RULE037 links them, The ffreasonff for adkinq whether the infection was hospital-acquired, then, is based on an attempt to use this rule to determxne the hi~her subgoal.
The answer to WHY at this pant is simply a display of the goals and the rules linkin8 them.
We have given considerable attention to rnakin~ this as lucid a display as possible.
First, since mwhvrf has several other interpretations, and no more extensive natural languase processinq is used in this component of MYCIN'S EC, the question is expanded to indicate the sense in which it will be answered.
The higher goal is then presented, followed bv the rule.
The clauses in the PREMISE of the rule are divided into those already esf.ablished and those yet to be determined.
Finally, since rules may have multiple conelusions about different clinical parameters, the relevant conclusion is presented first and all others fbllow.
As Fiaure 5 illustrates, further sections of the reasoning chain can be examined by repeating the WHY command.
For any of the subgoals mentioned in answer to a WHY, the user may ask HOW this qoal was (or will be) achieved.

Sample Questions about MYCIN'S Static Knowledge Perhaps the more important art of the question-answering svstem is its abllity to answer questions about a articular consultation.
While some users may be interested In checklng the extent of MYCIN'S static knowledge, most questions will ask for a justification of, or for the rationale behind, particular decisf on3 which were made during the consultation.
Outlined in Flgure 7 are the types of questions about dynamlc knowledqe which can b* handled at present.
A few examples of each type are given.
<Cntxt> indicates some context which was discussed in the ~nnsultatlon; <parm> is some clinical parameter of this context; <rule> is one of the system's decision rules.

Figure 7.
Sample Questions about a Consultation Before a question can be answered, it must be classif$ed a3 belonginq to one,of these groups.
As Figure 7 illustrates, each question type includes a variety of ways in which the question can be worded, some specifying the parameter's value, some phrased in the negative, and so forth.
MYCIN'S natural-language Drocessor must classify the questions, then determine what cllnLcal parameters, etc.
the question references.
2,4 Understanding The Question The main emphasis in the development of the MYCIV system has been the creation of a production system which can provide sound diaqnoatic and therapeutic advice in the field of infectious disease.
The explanation sfatem was included in the system's original desiqn in order to make the consultation program's decisions acceptable, justifiable, and instructive.
Since the question-answerina facility was not the primary focus of the research, it is not designed to be a sophisticated natural-lanquage understander.
Rather, it uses crude techniqyes, relying strongly on the very specific vocabulary of the domain, to ll~nderstand~~ whst information is being requested.
The analysis of a question is broken into three phases: the first creates a list of terminal or root words; the second determines what type of question is beinq asked (see the classification of questions in Section 2.3); and the last determines what particular parameters, lists, etc.
are relevant to the question.
In the first and last steps, the system dictionary is important, The dictionary Contains approximately 1400 words that are commonly used in the domain of infectious disease.
It ificludes all words that are acceptable values for a parameter, common synonyms of these words, and words used elsewhere by the system in describing the parameter (e.q., when translating a rule into English or requesting the value of the parameter).
2.4.1 Reducing
the Question to Terminal Words Each word in the dictionary has a synonym pointer to its terminal word (terminal words point to themselbes).
For the purpose of analyzing the question, a non-terminal word is considered to be equivalent to its ( terminal) aynonym.
Terminal words may have properties indicating: 1) that this word is an acceptable value for some clinical parameter(s) 2) that this word always implicates a certain clinical parameter, system list, or table (e.g.
the word "identitvll always implicates the parameter IDENTITY, which means the identity of an organism) 3) that this word might Xmplicate a certain parameter, system list, or table (e.3.
the word tlpositiven might implicate the parameter NUMPOS, which means the number of positive cultures in a series) 4) that this word is part of a phrase which can be thought of as a sinqle word (examples of such phrases are "transtracheal aspirationw, Ithow longw, and llnot sterilev1.
Table 1.
Properties of' Terminal Words The first three properties are actually inverse pointers which are generated automatically from properties of -the clinical parameters, Specifically, a word receives the "acceptable valuew pointer to a paramster (property (1) above) ilp it appears in the parameter's list of acceptable values -a list which is used during the consultation to check the user's response to 3 request for the parameter's value.
Also, each clinical oarameter, list, and table has an associated list of key words that are commonly used when talking about this parameter, list, or table.
These words are divided according to hoM sure we can be that a doctor is referring to this parameter list, or table when the articular word is used in a question.
It is from this list that terminal words nimplicationn pointers (~Papertiea 2 and 3 in Table 1 ) are generated.
During the first phase of parsing, each word in the original text is replaced by its terminal word.
For words not found in the dictionary, the system uses Winograd's root-extraction aleorithm 181 to see if the word's lexical root is in the dictionary (ems., the root of tfdecisionw is "deciden).
If so, the word is replaced by the terminal word for its root.
Words st111 unrewgnized aFter root extraction are left unchanqed.
The resulting list of terminal and unrecognized words is then passed to a function which recognizes phrases.
Usinq propertv 4 (see Table 1) of the terminal words in this list, the function identifies a phrase and replaces it with a single synonymous terminal word (whose dictionary properties may be important in determining the meaning of the question).
2.4.2 Classifying
the Question The next step is to classify the question so that the proqram can tell which specialist should answer it.
Since all auestions about the consultation must be about some specific context, the system requires that the name of the context (e.g., ORGANISM-1) be stated explicitly.
This ~ives an easy way to separate qeneral questions about the knowledqe base from questions about a particular consultation.
Further classification is done through a pattern matchinp; approach siailar to that used by Colby [I 1.
The list of words created by the first phase is tested against a number of patterns (about 50 at present).
Each pattern has a list of actions to be taken if the pattern is matched.
These actions set flags which indicate what type of question was aaked.
In the case of questions about judqental knowledge (called rule-retrieval questions), pattern matching also divides the question into the part referring to the rule's PREMISE and the part referring to its ACTION.
For example, in "How do you decide that an organism is streptococcus?~, there is no PREMISE part, and the ACTION part is "an organism is streptococcus~; in "Do you ever use the site of the culture to determine an organism's identity?", the PREMISE part is "the site of the culturew and the ACTION part is "an organism's identityn.
2.4.3 Determining
What Pieces of Knowledge are Relevant The classification of a question guides its further analysis, Each question type has an associated template with blanks to be filled in from the question, The different blanks and the techniques for filling them in are listed in Table 2.
With the question correctly classified, the general question-ans*erer can tell which soecialist should answer it.
Fillin5 in all blanks in the template gives the s~ecialist all the information needed to find the answer, 1) <cntxt> The context must be mentioned by name.
2) <rule> Either a rule's name (RULE047) will be mentioned, or the word "rulen will appear, toqether wiLh the rule 'a number ( 47).
3) <value> One of the terminal words in the question has a diationary property indicating that it is a legal value for the parameter (property 1, Table 1 -e,q.
THRDAT is a legal value for the parameter SITE).
4) <parm> All of the words in the list are examined to see if they implicate any clinical parameters, Strong implicatians come from words with properties showinrf that the word is an acceptable value of the parameter, or that the word always implicates that parameter (properties 1 and 2, Table 1).
Weak implications come from words with nroperties showing that: they might implicate the parameter (property 3, Table 1).
The system uses an empirical scoring mechanism for picking out only the most likely parameters.
Associated with certain parameters are words or patterns which must appear in the question in order for the parameter to be implicated.
This scheme allows the system to distinguish related parameters which may be implicated by the same key words in the first pass.
For example, the word nPMNvf implicates parameters CSFPOLY (the percent of PMNs in the CSF) and PMN (the percent of PMNs in the complete blood count).
These are distinguished by reauirinq that the word "CSFn be present in a question in order for CSFPOLY to be implic.at ed . 5 <list> System lists are indicated in a manner slmilar to parameters, except that scoring is not done.
Lists, like parameters,,may have associated patterns which must be present in the question.
Furthermore, lists h~ve properties telling which other system lists are their subsets.
If a question implicates both a list and a subset of that list, the more general (larger) list is discarded.
As an example, the question "Which drugs are aminoglyco~ides?~~ implicates two lists: The list of all drugs and the list of drugs which are aminoglycosides.
The system only considers the more specific list of aminoglycosides when answering the question.
6) <table> Tables are indicated in a manner similar to lists except that an entry in the table must also be resent in the question.
For exam~le, the word norganismw may indicate two tables: one containing a classification of organisms, and the other containing normal flora of various portals.
The question "What organisms are considered to b'e subtypes of Pseudornona~?~' will correctlv implicate the former table, and "What are the organisms likely to be found in the throat?ft will implicate the latter, because FSEUDOMONAS is in the first table and THROAT is in the second.

Sample of MYCIN'S Analysis of a Question [User input follows the double asterisks.
1 [ 1 1 The quest ion is reduced to a list of terminal words.
C21 Pattern matchinq classifies the question as a rule-retrieval question, and divides it into a premise part and an aetfon part [3] Dictionary oroperties of the temnfna1 words are used to determine which parameters (and their values) are relevant to each part of the question.
These vocabulary clues are listed in the form (<parm> (<values>) weight) where weight is used by the scoring mechanism to determin which parameters should be eliminated from consideration, [ 41 After selecting only the most strongly indicated parameters, the final translation tells what rules can answer the question: there are no restrictions on the PREMISE, and the ACTION must contain the parameter CONTAMINANT (with any value).
[5] The answer con8fsts of findinp; all rules which meet these restrictions, and printing those that the user wants to see.
2.5 Answering
the Question Corresponding to each question type, there are a number of' possible answer templates.
For example, for questions of the fom ttHow do you know the value of <parm> of <cntxt>?", two of the answer templates are: I used <rule> to conclude that <parm> of <cntxt> is <value>, This gave a cumulative c.f. of (certainty factor), The last question asked before the conclusion was made was (question number>.
In answer to question (question number) you said that <parm> of <cntxt> is <value> The specialist for answering,questions of a given tvpe will need to check the history tree or the system s knowledge base in order to determine which of the answer templates is appropriate for a particular question, Some blanks in the answer template will be filled in by the same items that filled blanks in the question tern~late.
The remainder are filled by the specialist with information which will answer the question.
In the above example, the slots <parrn>, <cntxt>, and possiblv <value> would be filled in from the question, and the other slots would be fllled from the historv tree.
2.5.1 Questions
about MYCIN'S Static Knowledge General questions about MYCIN's factual knowledqe are the easiest to answer.
The specialist that provides answers to such questions must look up the desired information in the system's static knowledge base.
Generally, an answer consists of simply displaying this information.
As Figure 9 illustrates, the most processing that is ever done is to check the retrieved information against some item in the question (for eauality of set membership).
** IS BLOOD A STERILE SITE?
Yes. Blood is one of those sites that are normally sterile.
** WHAT ARE THE NONSTERLLE SITES?
Those sites that are normally nonsterile are: CERVIX, CUTANEOUS-ULCER, LOCHIA, NOSE, SKIN, STOOL, THROAT, URETHRA, VAGINA, ** WHAT ORGANISMS ARE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN THE THROAT?
The 1 ikely ath hog ens associated with throat are : STREPT0C)OCCUSPNEUMONIAE, STREPTOCOCCUS-GROUP-A, NFISSERIA-YGYINGITIDIS.
** IS BACTEROIDES AEROBIC?
No, the aerobicity of bacteroides is anaerobic.
* * WHAT DOSAGE OF STREPTOMYCIN DO YOU GENERALLY RECOMMEND?
The suggested dosage and route of streptomycin is 7,5 ma/kq q12h IM (or IV).
** ROW DO YOU TREAT MENINGOCOCCAL BACTEREMIA?
For treatment of NEISSERIA-MENINGITIDIS in PRIMARY-BACTEREMIA Select therapy from among the following drugs (ranked according lo relative efficacy, assuming uniform sensitivity) : PENICILLIN (091 AMPICILLIN ( -9) dose: 30 mg/kg q6h SULFISOXAZOLE ( -8) dose: 60 rnq/kg IV then 15 ms/kg q4h IV for 48 days then 15 mq/kq q4h PO CHLORAMPHENICOL (.7) ERYTHROMYCIN (.5) TETRACYCLINE (84) Duration of therapy: 14 days Figure 9.
Questiorrs about Factual Knowledge The specialist thzt answers questions about j~dqUIenta1 knowledge is slightly !nore complicated.
Answering these questions (Flqure 10) involves built-in knowledge about the rule set, plus the ability to tlreadll the rules.
By the time the question has been analyzed, the mecialist knows exactly which parameters must appear in the PREMISE, and which must apDear in the ACTION of any rule which answers the question.
Values may be specified for any of the parameters.
To answer the question, the rule-retrieval specialist must first find every rule whose PREMISE and ACTION satisfy these constraints.
To do this, it needs to know that there are two special lists associated with each parameter: one contain in^ every rule that uses the parameter in its PREMISE, and the other containinq every rule that concludes about the parameter in its ACTION.
Using these lists for the various parameters mentioned in the quest ion, the specialist can find those rules that might answer the question.
If no values were soecified, the job is done and the relevant rules can be displayed without further anslvsis; otherwise, it is necessary to read each of the rules in the list and to eliminate those which do not mention the correct values for the ~arameter, The rule-retrieval specialist also makes use of a piece of MYCIN'S knowledge which was not discussed earlier.
The system contains models of its own knowledge (called rule models) which are used primarily during acquisition of new medical knowledge from an expert [4].
These models, however, can be put to many uses -one is to explain aeneral patterns in decision making.
The rule models are abstract descriptions of a subsets of rules and are generated automatically by readinq the rules.
For examole, the model for IDENT-IS-PSEUDOMONAS tells what features are common to the majority of rules which conclude that the identity of an oraanism is pseudomonas . If a model exists describing the rules about which the question is asking, the rule-retrieval soecialist incorporates this model's information into its answer (Figure 11).
Thus the question-answering facility is able to give some information about strategies for achieving some of the svstem's goals, as well as the individual rules which use the strateqies.
** WHY DO YOU ASK WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS A FEVFR OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN?
The rules listed below use: whether the patient has a true fever of unknown ori~in RuLE180 n.l-.1--If: 1 ) The site of the culture is blood and 2J The number of cultures in the series including the culture is qreater than or equal to 1, and 3) The number of culturea in this series which were positive for the orqanism is less than or equal to 1, and 4) The patient has a true fever of unknown origin, and 5) "ardiac-surgery is a relevant item from the history of the patient Then: There is suggestive evidence ( '6) that the infection is infective-endocardit is ** WHAT DOES GIJ MANIPULATION TELL YOU ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF AN ORGANISM?

-Rule-Retrieval Questions ** HOW DO YOU DECIDE THAT AN ORGANISM MIGHT BE PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSAQ Rules which conclude that the identity of the organism is pseudomonas-aeruginosa generally use one or more of the following pieaes of information: the sfte of the culture the Gram stain of the organism the morphology of the oreanism Furthermore, the following relationships hold: The gram stain of the orsanism, and the morphology of the organism tend to appedr together in these rules.

Question Which Uses Rule Models 2.5.2 Consultation-Specific Questions One of the simplest quest ions about a spec if ic consultation inquires about the value of a particular parameter (Figure 12).
The specialist which answers these questions must know how to retrieve this information, In soae cases it will also be necessary to make comparrsons to see whether a value specified in the auestion is one of the values which was deduced for that parameter.
** TO WHAT CLASS DOES ORGANISM-1 BELONG?
The category of ORGANISM-1 is enterobacteriaceae ( '9) #* IS ORGANISM-1 A STREPTOCOCCUS?
No. The identitv of ORGANISM-1 is e.coli 1.74) bacteroides (.7) klebaiella-pneumoniae (.4) ~seudomonas-aeruginosa (.22) enterobacter (.21) proteus-non-mirabilis (.19) serratia (.O3) salmonella (.02) Flgure 12.
Questions about a parameter's Value Answerinq other tllrpes of consultation-specific questions involves the use of knowledge about the control strbcture, including: 1) how the system acquires information 2) why the system tries to find out about parameters 3) how information is used once it is acquired 4) what causes a rule to be tried 5) what causes a rule to fail, The specialist for answering questions like !!How do vou know the value of <parm> of <cntxt>?w, knows that the value of a narameter can come from two sources: it can be deduced by rules, or the user can tell us about it in response to a question.
The history tree (see Section 2.2) will show whlch (possibly both) of these sources provided the particular informatton mentioned in the question (Figure 13).
** HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT CULTURE-1 WAS FROM A STERILE SOURCE?
I used rule189 to conclude that this blood culture was taken from a sterile source.
This gave a cumulative c.f. of (1.0).
The last question asked before the conclusion was made was 7, ** DID YOU CONSIDER BACTEROIDES AS A POSSIBILITY FOR ORGANISM-I?
Yes. I used rule095 to conclude that the identity of ORGANISM-1 is bacteroides.
This gave a curdulative c.f. of (,7).
The last question asked before the conclusion was made was 20.
** HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ORGANISM-1 IS E.COLI?
The following rules made conclusions about whether the identity of ORGANISM-1 is e.coli cumulative certaimy last quest ion asked RULE Yes No before conclusion was made RULE021 (447) 20 RULE0 84 (455) 22 MI LEO 03 (a741 24 In answer to question 9 you said that the identity of ORGANISM-1 is e,coli (,3) Figure 13.
Question Regarding How a Conclusion Was Made If the question is phrased in the negative, it is neeessarv first to find all the ways the conclusion could have been made (this is a simple task of rule-retrieval), then to explain why it wasn't made in this consuLtation (Figure 14).
The mecialist for answerinq these questions must know what situations can prevent conclusions from beinq made.
The second question i~ Figure 14 illustrates how the answer+ to one question aisht cause another question to be asked.
** WHY DID YOU RULE OUT STREPTOCOCCUS AS A POSSIBILITY FOR ORGANISM-I ? The following rules could have b?en used to determine that the identity of ORGANISM4 is streptococcus : RULEO33.
However, none of these succeeded in the context of ORGANISM-1.
If you would like an explanation for why any of these rules failed, please enter their numbers: *# 33 Clause 2 of rule033 ["the morpholoqy of the orqanasm is coccusw] was already known to be false for ORGANISM-1, so the rule was never tried.
** WHY DON 'T YOU THINK THAT THE MORPHOLOGY OF ORGANISM-1 IS COCCUS?
It is definite that the morphology of ORGAVISY-1 is rod.
Knowing this with certainty rules out all other values for the the morphology of 0RQ.ANISM-1, includinq coccus.
Figure 14.
Questions Regarding Why a Conclusion wasn't Made The specialist for answerinq questions of the fom "How did vou use <parm> of <cntxt>?IV, needs to know not only how to find the svecific rules which might use a parameter, but also how a ~arameter can cause a rule to fail 2nd how one parameter can prevent another from being used.
The history tree can be checked to see which of the relevant rules used the oarameter, which failed because of the parameter, and which failed for some other reason, preventin@ the parameter from being used (Figure 15).
** HOW DID YOU USE THE AEROBICITY OF ORGANISM-17 The aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 was used in the following rules: RULE003, RULE005, RULE084.
The aembicity of ORGANISM-1 caused the following rules to fail: RULEO35, RULEO51, RULE052, RULEO'i3, RULE111c Thc aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 also would have been used in: RULE037, RULEOSO.
RULE058, RULE086, RULE110, RULE184, RULE203, RULE204, RULE205.
However, none of these succeeded In the context of ORGANISM-1.
If you would like an explanation For why any of these rules failed, please enter their numbers: ** 37 Rule037 was tried in the context of ORGANISM-1, but it failed due to clause 1 ["the categorv of the organism is not known"] . ** DID YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT PATIENT-1 IS NOT A COMPROMISED HOST?
The fact that Fred Jones is not a compromised host caused the following rules to fail: RULE085, RULE106.
The fact that ~rea Jones is not a compromised host also would have been, used in: RULE109.
Howeveri none of these succeeded in the context of PATIENT-1..

However, none of these succeed'ed in the context of ORGANISM-1.
If you would like an explanation for why any of these rules failed, please enter their numbers: ** 159 Rule159 was tried in the context of ORGANISM-1, but it failed due to clause 1 ["it is suspected that the identity of the organism is corynebacterium-non-diphtheriaew 1 ** IS ORGANISM-1 CORYNEBACTERI UM-NOW-DIPHTRERIAE?
No. The idedtity of ORGANISM-1 is e,coli (.74) bacteroides (.7) klebsiella-pneumoniae (.4) pseudomonas-aeruqinosa (22) enterobacter (.21) proteus-non-mirabilis (.I91 serratia (.03) salmonella f.02) ** PR 109 RULE 109 If: 1) The cuJture was taken from a sterile source, and 2) Xt is not known whether tb e orqanism is a contaminant, and 3) The patient is not 9 compromised host, and 4) The patient was febrila due to the infection, and 5) The results of the cbc from the time ~eriod of the culture are available, and 6) A The white count from the CBC is qreater than 10.5, or B The percent of pmn's in the cbc at the time the culture was obtained is qreater than 78, or C The percent of wbc's which were bands in the CBC at the time the, culture was obtained is qreater than 10 Then: There is strongly suggestive evidence (.a) that the orqanism is not a contaminant Figure 16.
Questions Regarding Why a Parameter wasn't Traced In questicns asking about the application of a rule to a context there are three poss*~bilities: the rule told us somethinq about the context; the rule failed when applier! to that context; or the rule was never tried in that context, The historv tree tells which of these ia the case, Furthermore, if a rule succeeded, there is a record of all the conclusions it made, and if it I"3ileb, the reason for failure is recorded.
9s Fiqure 17 illugtrates, rules are only applicable in certain contexts.
If the rule could not apply to the context mentioned in the question, but mi~ht be relevant when applied to soae other context [which is an ancestor or descendent in the context tree], then the question is answered as if it had mentioned the relevant context.
There are interactions among the different types of questions which weren't mentioned earlier for the sake of clarity.
Sometiaes a question ray indicate an incorrect assumption about the sate of MYCIN'S knowledge.
For examole a question could ask "Whv don't you think that ORGANISM-1 is E.coli"? when, in fact, the system has concluded that the organism is E.coli.
To answer this question, the explanation system would explain how it did make such a decision, despite the ~hrasinq of the question.
Similarlv, when asked how the system used (or concluded about) some mrameter that was never traced, the system explains why it didn 't need to find out about the parameter, reflardless of how the question was bhrased.
** DID RULE 116 TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT INFECTION-I?
~ulell6 would be relevant to the primary-bacteremia when applied t: ORGANISM-1 Clause 5 of rulel 16 ["the infection is meninqitisn] was already known to be false for ORGANISM-I, so the rule was never tried.
** HOW WAS RULE.
178 HELPFUL WHEN YOU WERE CONSIDERING ORGANISM-13 ~ule178 would be relevant to ORGARISM-1 when applied to: CULTURE-I I never had reason to try to apply rule178 to this blood culture.
X would have needed to use rule178 in order to find out whether this blood culture was taken from a sterile source.
However, I was already certain that this blood culture was t&ken from a qterile source, ** WHAT DID RULE 295 TELL YOU ABOUT ORGANISM-I?
I used rule295 to conclude that the identity of ORGANISM-1 $3 hemophilus-influenzae.
This gave a cumulative c.f. of (25).
The last question asked before the conclusion was made was 36.
+* WHY DIDN'T YOU USE.RULE112 TO FIND OUT ABOUT ORGANISM-I?
RULE1 12 was not executed because it would have caused circular reasoning when applied to ORGANISM-?.
Would you like ta see the chain of rules and parameters which makes up this circle?
** YES 1 wanted to know about the identity of ORGANISM-1 -because I try to find out the identitv of the organism for all current organisms of the patient.
To find out about the identlty of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use ruleO21.
Before I could use rule021, I needed to know about a prior orqanism with possibly the same identity as ORGANISM-1 . To find out about a prior organism with possibly the same identity as ORGANISM-1, I trred to use rule005.
Before I could use rule005, I needed to know about the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1 . To firid out about the aerobicity of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use rule031.
Before I could use rule031, I needed to know about the category of ORGANISM-1.
To find out about the category of ORGANISM-1, I tried to use rulel 12.
Before I could use rulel 12, I needed to know about the identity of ORGANISM-1 . But this is the unknown parameter I sought originally.

Question Regarding the Application of a Rule 3 Conclusions Consultation system8 which give expert advice in some domain form one class of artificial intelligence programs which can provide useful solutions to real-world ppoblems.
The utility of such a system, however, depends on its acceptability to human users.
One feature which can Increase a system's acceptability is a mechanism whereby the system can explain or justify its advice.
The development bf an explanation mechanism for a consultation system is very much related to the problems of representing knowledge and of making use of different sources of knowledge, Since the production system formalism provides a unified way to represent modular pieces of knowledae, the task of designing an explanation capabilitv is simplified for production-based consultation systems, The example of MYCIN shows how this can be done and illustrates further that a svsterll desiqned for a single domain with a small, technical vocabulary can give comprehensive answers to a wide range of quegtions without sophisticated natural-language processing.

10 November, 1976 NASHINGTON DEVELOPMENTS SUPREME COURT DENIES CBCT PETSTIONS; COMPTROLLER CURRENCY TO ISSUE NEW CBCT &GULATIONS Consolidated petitions from two Chicago banks and the Comptroller of the Currency seeking review of Pedeyal Appeals Court rulings which equate customer-bank conlmunications terminals (CBCTs) with bank branches, and thus forbid CBCTs in nonbranching states, were denied by the Supreme Court last month ttwithout dissent or explanation ".
Banks ' response.
The petitioning banks, Gontinental Natiofial Brink and Trust Co.
of Chicago and the First National Bank of Chicago, this month deactivated their combined total of seven CBCTs . The terminals' three uses permit deposits to be made, funds to be transferred, or funds to be borrowed; each of the5e functions, various appea-1s courts have held, constitute branch banking under the National Bank IMcFadden) Act.
New CBCT regutatiom.
The Currency Comptrollerts Attorney Edward Jiran told AFIPS P~ehington Report in October that the Comptroller will issue new regulations for nat%onal bank CBCTs this month.
Rules may be written to liberalize minimum capitalization requirements for terminals shared by more than one financial institution, according to the Comptroller s Electronic Banking Systems Division Chief Claude A.
Raworth. Pawortb told AFIPS that the new regulations will permit banks Itto use the [EFTS] technology without heavy capitalization requirements; [otherwise, 1.
some thinly capitalized [banks] would have problems ".
Thus, according to the Currency Comptroller official, the regulations would encourage sharing EFTS facilities with smaller banks.
NCEFT'and ZegisZatim acti~ties.
Prior to the Supreme Court action denying the CBCT petitions, National Commission on Electronic Funds Transfer (NCEFJ') Executive Director John B.
Benton told this writer in Washington that the braaching issue should be resolved in the U.S.
Congress, Benton added that "it's going to be some time before 1egi.slation is passed in CongressIt on whether CBCPs are branches.
Last month, the NCEFT convened hqar~ngs osl both brahching and corlsumer issues.
The Senate Subcommittee on Financial ~hsstitutions, chaired by Sen.
Thomas dr McIntyre ID-N .H ))., wi 11 hold hearings on the branching question in December.
CBCT court action.
Fedgral courts in various jurisdictions have bean almost unanimous in their interpretation of the McFad&n Act disallowing off-premises CBCTs.
Last August, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, ruling in a Colorado case, upheld a lower district court judgment that receipt of deposits by CBCTs vialates the McFadden Act.
The U.
S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in a separate case, last July upheld a district court ruling in Missouri that the First National Bank in St.
Louis must remove CBCTs at two St.
Louis County locations.
The district court said that any one of the three major services provided by CBCTs constituted branch banking, which is limited in Missouri.
In the cases of the two petitioning Chicago banks, decided by the Federal Court of Appeals in Illinois last May, all functions performed by CBCTs were deemed to constitute branch banking, which is forbidden in 11,Jinoi.s.
However, a Federal District Court in Oklahoma approved all three uses of CBCTs, finding terminals "only processors,Iv and as such legal.
An appeal of the case was mooted when the.
state legislature authorized legislation aaactioning the use of CBCTs.
GOVERNhIENT OPERATIONS COMMITTliE CRITICIZESNONCOMPETITIVljG PROCUREMENTS Following hekrings last June (Washinqton Re~mt, 8/76), the House Cornittee on Government Operations stated in October that "the low level of fully competitive ADP promrements, coupled with the apparent lack of effective utilization of ADP resources will, if allowed to continue, ultimately result in seriously jeopardizing the effectiveness of the Brooks Act [P.L.
89-3061, at a cost of millions of dollars annually to the taxpayers".
Reexam.inution of 'true -ct of computere ' suggee.ted.
In a report, titled Administration of P.
L. 89-306, Procwernnt of ADP Re8omes By ths FedemZ Covement (II,), the Committee said: "If'the full benefits of the'Act are to be achieved, GSA, OMB, NBS, and the user agencies must join together in a commitment tb fully support and adhere to the provisions of the Act".
The report suggested a reexamination sf "the true impact of computers on government operations".
It raised the question of whether "acquisition of ADP resources is necessary to carry on an essential program, or whether such acquisition will foster non-essential activity because the computer is available".
ADP ~t.
. . receive attenth of top management.
The Committee concluded that ADP Itcam no longer be viewed as a mere tool, but must now be treated in the same way as other major programs and, as such, receive top attention of top management".
The report attributed the basic causes of noncompetitive procurements to a lack of: (1) adequate justifications for ADP acquisition; (2) long-range planning; (3) standards ; (4) high level languages ; (5) utilization ~euiews; and (6) use of functional specifications.
OMB directs GSA to use vfbwtiomZ ADP specifiwtions*.
Responding directly to the Committee report and other criticisms, OMB Dlrector James T.
L letter last month to GSA Administrator Jack ECkerd, wrote that "[t $a o preclude in a the adverse effects of unduly restrictive specifications, agsncies shall, to the maximum practical exrent, express their ADP requirements in terms of functional performance specifications rather than equipment specifications . " Lynn added: "GSA should strive for expeditious review of agency submission to avoid delays in the procurement process.
Agencies should cooperate with GSA to expedite these reviews.
An undue length of time for the normal ADP procurement process may be considered a disagreement by GSA with the request of the agency, and may be appealed to the Office of Management and Budget.
fvConsistent with the poliw expressed herein, any such appeal will be handled expeditiously, but the burden will be upon the agency to demonstrate the need to specify the particular make or model of equipment or its functional equivalent when such specification is at issue," he said.
The GSA has 60 days fiOctober 6, the date of thb letter, to comply with the directive.
HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS SUBCOWITTGE CHAIRMAN RECOMMENDS OVERHAUL OF 1934 COM~UNICATIONS ACT A "basement to-at t icl' overhaul of the 1834 Federa2 Commmications Act, the statute which provides the basis for regulation of the nation's telecomunications systems, was proposed to the next Congress last month by Rep.
Lionel Va Deerlin (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Communications Subcommittee.
The Submcomittee has just completed three day* of hearings on the proposed Cone~wr Comnications Refon Act of 19F6 (Waehh-gton Report, lo/ 76) . Joined by Rep.
Lou Erey.@-Fla.), Van Deerlin said the original Act is outdated.
According to the trade press, issues to be considered by the Subcommittee include : whether the FCC has established fair coppetiti:~.: ground rules; whether business telephone services really subsidize residential services; and what the implications of changing FCC policies are toward competition.
NEW TAX ACT REPEALS PART OF 1974 PRIVACY ACT ON STATE USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY MIEriBER President Ford last month signed into law the Tm Reform Act of 1076, recently passed by Congress (va~hinqtofl Repopt, 9/ 76 ), which includes an amendment pemktting state governments to demand and retain an individual's Social Security Number [SSN) to aid in searches for parents not supporting their children.
The amendment repeals part of the Acivacy Act of 1974.
In addition, state and local governments can now use the SSN as an identifier for tax administrative programs, for drivers ' licenses, and for motor vehicle registration.
However, government officials who disclose the nmber without authorization are subject to a fine o!f up to $1,000 or imprisonment of up to one year.

11, NO* 11 December, 1976 WASH1NC;IYIN DEVELOPMENTS FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS, FHLBB APPEAL RULING PROHIBITING DP SERVICE OFFERINGS BY BANKS Federal Home Loan Banks in Cincinnati, New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Des Moines have joined Washington's Federal Home Loan Rank Board (FHLBB) to appeal a September ruling by a Federal District Court Judge in Cincinnati that Federal Home Loan Banks can not provide computer services to savings and loan associations.
Five of the 12 regional Home Loan Banks, which are or at one time have been suppliers of data processing services, are involved in the Cincinnati appeal.
ADAPSO, United Data Procesahg obtain irr;junct;on.
The original case was brought against the FHLBB and a Cincinnati Home Loan Bank by the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO) and United Data Processing, Inc, In October, 1973.
The remaining four Home Loan Banks joined the suit as intervenors in November, 1973.
The district court ruling enjoined all five banks from offering data processing services beginning January 1, 1977.
A modified stay of the injunction has been obtained by the FHLBB pending the present appeal.
District court bZds that FehZ Rome Loan Banks aro not permitted to provide D In the original suit, ADAPSO argued that the Federal Home Loan Banks posed "a form of unfair competition1' to private enterprise because they are exempted from taxat ion.
William W.
Fletcher, president of Midwest Advanced Computer Services, inc., Warren, Mlcigan, and ADAPSO member, has been quoted as saying that hls firm can not compete with the Federal Home Loan Banks I "30 per cent lower" rates.
In addition, ADAPSO said that the PederaZ Rome Loan Bank Act of 2932 forbids banks from participating In nonbanking commercial activities such as those provided by computer service centers.
Federal District Judge Carl B.
Rubin, in his ruling last September, held that "the providing of data processing services to member institutions is not an express power granted to the Federal Home Loan Banks or Federal Hone Loan Bank Board1' by the FedsmZ Home Loan Bunk Act.
ADAPSO Executive Vice-President Jerome L.
Dreyer has criticized the FHLBB for encouraging its members to market data processing services to the same banks which the FHLBB regulates.
Further adverse court ruzings eouM proscribe future DP offerings by Home Loan Banks.
ADAPSO Attorney Herbert E.
Marks, who is handling the FHLBB case, told AFIPS Phshington Report that the New York Federal Home Loan Bank has ceased offering data processing services since the district court injunction was obtained.
Marks noted that further adverse rulings against the Home Loan Banks could proscribe future data processing offerings by the seven other Federal Home Loan Banks.
He also said that if the district court is upheld by the appeals court in Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board could appeal to the Supreme Court.
A spokeswoman for the FHLBB in Washington told AFIPS that the FHLBB had no comment on the case since it is in litigation.
She stated that the New York Federal Home Loan Bank ceased providing data processing services prior to the district court ruling, not after the injunction, as Marks contended.
NEW CBCT REGULATIONS MAY SANCTION OPERATION OF,NON-FEDERALLY REGUtATED EFTS TERMINALS Acting Comptroller of the Currency Robert Bloom last month announced new customer-bank comntunicat ions t erkninal (CBCT) regulations for national banks.
The new regulations allow national banks to apply for permission to establish CBCTs as branches in states where state-chartered banRs are permitted to establish branches.
Bloom's action follows the Supreme Court's refusal to consider consolidated petitions from two Chicago banks and the Comptroller of the Currency seeking review of Federal Appeals Court decisions which equate CBCTs with bank branches and forbid CBCTs in non-branching states (Washington R6pPt, 11/76].
The Comptroller has unsuccessfully argued in the courts that CBCTs are not branches, and are not forbidden in states which limit or disallow branching.
The trade press suggests that the new regulations may sanction the operation of non-federally regulated EFTS terminals by retailers, shopping mall operatorsf owners of apartment complexes, or operators of transportation terminals.
Thus, the effect of these regulations may be to extend the present list of EFTS ilprovidersff beyond financial institutions, i.e., to include what were formerly on13 EFTS users.
The Comptroller's new regulations state that capitalization required for a CBCT branch may now be shared among the participants, thus lowering the cost of operating a CBCT, and presumably making CBCTs available to smaller banks with less capital (see Washington Report, 11/76).
Also, in contrast to the $500 application fee for a traditional branch, the application fee for a CBCT branch is $200.
In the section of the Acting Comptroller's statement, said to sanction operation of non-federally regulated EFTS terminal^, Bloom held that "any CBCT which is not established by a national bank . . . is not a branch of a national bani, and not subject to the provisions oftf the applicable section of the federal bank regulation, the McFadden Act, which the courts have held forbids CBCTs in nonbranching states . WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENTS TO PRESIDENT'S COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY The White House has announced appointments to the President's Committee on Science and-Technology [PCST), which will conduct a two-year review of science and technology as it relates to the Federal government.

Opening the conference, FCC Chairman Richard E.
Wiley stated his view that a computer is a comunications device, not a data processing device, when it is used in a traditional communications service.
However, Wiley also noted that the use of computer technology may result in an enhanced service, offering more than traditional communications.
He predicted that Similar technological forces will develop in several areas of communications service.
Wiley said: "1 firmly believe that, in this grbat free enterprise society of ours, government regulations must not be permitted to stand in the way of thchnological development.
If the new technology creates administrative difficulties for the government, it is the regulations that must be conformed and not the technology".
According to the FCC chairman, "We will see more instances in the future where, as here, the technology is developing in a manner that blurs traditional interfaces.
In cases of this sort, the policymakers mu8t have direct access to technical experts and decisions must be based upon an understanding of the technology.
Wiley also said, "It is our belief that AFIPS is a particularly appropriate entity to present this conference fur the Commission, in view of the Federation's sponsorship of the National Computer Conference, and the Joint Comput el' Conferences prior to that.
Moreover, it is also our view that AFIPS is a basically impartial organization in relation to our policy concerns,bringing to us the objective views of a group of highly qualified experts .'I Computer communieutions aceaunts for 20 per cent of a22 acpenditmes in computgr fietd.
In the conference Is first presentation on "Computer Communications ; An Introduct $on and Overview," Lynn Hopewell (chairman, IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Computer Communications ; and senior member, executive staff, Coihputer Sciences Corp.] said that computer communications systems had first been used in control I i n g ~lcomplexfl operations of industry and government.
Hopewell added that the most common use of computer commun2cations is in data base applicat ions.
The speaker suggested that the computer communications industry accounts for 20 per cent of all expenditures in the computer field, Examples of industrial areas affected by computer communications technology were listed as law enforcement, securities brokerage, insurance, reservations systems and banking.
Hopewell said that 75 per cent of the top 500 industry corporations are now using camputer communications.
Distributing samples of a microcomputer-on-a-chip, he noted technological changes that have produced a 1976 microcomputer CPU costing $20 in contrast to a 1960 IBM CPU costing $30,000.
Hopewell added that microprocessors which cost $20 today cost $100 only a year ago.
He indicated that such differentials represent only the beginning of extremely low cost computing.
Hopewell said that the proposed definitions employed in the new "Computer Inquiryff aid in qlclarifying the permitted uses of computers by common carriers, but in no way allow the proposed abandonment of the 'hybrid1 service concept He noted that the hybrid concept should be retained "because some service offerings have mixes .ob both computing and communications function^,^' not because of unclear definitions.
Since "hybrid services will become even more common in the future," Hopewell continued, elimination of the hybrid concept will "ineyitably suppress innovation because any services that have communication factions inextricably bound into them will be defined as subject to regulation".
The speaker concluded that he saw no "technological or economic reason for the regulation of the resale industry.?l Te~htu,Z~gy $8 'mov;ng td8 tntegmted &deband 8ehes.
' In his presentation on "Research Topics in Computer Conwnmicati~n," Vinton G.
Cerf summarized t ethnological factors influencing the development of computer comhunicat ions, : the availability of wideband transmission media; the use of computers to control the switching and allocation of transmission bandwidth; the trend towards all-digital telephone networks; and interconnection of computer cornmuhications networks.
Cerf said the "technology is leading away from separate, distinct narrowband services . . twoards integrated widenband services.
The potential social impact is pervasive; the possibilities for new wealth-creating activity, almost incalculable; and the need for regulatory adjustment, inevitableeft With the juxtaposition of computing and connnunication, he suggested the FCC could: reallocate the radio spectrum using computer-controlled demand access; mandate computer communication network interconnection through the enformcement of interconnection standards; and consider proposals by =plated carriers as well as others "to provide previously impossible combinat ions of information processing and traditional communication services.
'Boundary betueen corrmunicat~ng und computhg wit2 become mare bZurred.
' In his presentation on the MDimensions of t&e Need for Computer Communications," Alex Cupan, president, BNR, Inc., suggested that domestic users must seek to reduce the cost of network access for smaller users, especially in the ltsmaller urban centers .'!
FCC Interconnection Chief Louis Feldenr, in a question-and-answer period following Currants presentation, stressed the Itneed for computer powervf in rural areas.
In his formal presentation, Curran continued that the cost of intercontinental transmission must also be reduced.
According to the speaker, these measnres would help to insure that Ifthe common carrier networks can cope with the data communications traffic of commercial users.11 Curran stated that some of the office and home services associated with computer communications could require reintegration of voice and data capabilities.
He provided several current examples of personal computing including: Vieuduta, the embryonic electronic newspaper in the' United Kingdom; Icasthzg, instantaneous voting and data collectio~~ in Canada; MzCZgram, a precursor of electronic mail in the U.
S. and CAJ, computer-assisted instruction.
Curran also said that other services will require switching machines "capable of recognizing information [interest] specifications as valid addresses For example, swi thcing machines could recognize selective informat ion dissemination interest profiles as valid addresses, he noted.
Curran concluded : 'Thus, the boundary between communicating and computing will become more blurred.
There are economic arwents for suggesting that the boundary definitions be relaxed to encourage a new cycle of innovation FCC decisGm8 my ZMt the growth of carr%ers, not necessaAZy the g~oth of wegu&%t@d supptiero in data pmoeseSng.
In his presentation, titled frLimitations on the Growth of Computer-Communication service^,^^ Prof.
Donald A.
Dunn, Engineering Economic Systems Department, Stanford University, indicated that user learning costs will limit the rate at which new computer ~ommunication services can be introduced to markets serving non-computer professionals.
Dunn suggested that, in future regulatory decisions, integrated service packages (designed to minimize user learning and operation costs) might be used in lieu of individual component services as the unit of,service that is judged cohnnunications or data processing.
He added that regulatory limitations 'on the rate of return and regulatory policies on depreciation allowances can restrict technological change as well as limit the rate of introduction of new equipment by carriers.
According to the speaker, the earliext ftComputer Inquiry" rule, requiring data processing $entices to be provided by carriers through a separate affiliate, may limit the growth of carriers.
But he added that the rule does not affect the growth of the data processing industry since unregulated suppliers can respond to this market.
Dunn also noted that the resale and sharing decision, imposing regulation on resale carriers, would not necessarily inhibit the growth of the industry Itsince separate data processing affiliates will not be required of resale carriers that do not provide monopoly services".
He stated that the resale and sharing decision "removed some of the most serious limits to the growth of this industry by opeining the market for network services to essentially any firm willing to operate as a resale carrier".
Dunn concluded: "Pressures are likely to develop soon to regulate providers of information service packages that may offer computer message services to users that obtain network service from resale carriers.
Such regulation would inhibit the growth of the industry, and is not needed to protect the interests of users.

In their presentation on "The Future of Computer Communications ".
Vinton G.
Cerf and Alex Curran said that "we cannot offer a solution to the definition of a boundary between communicating and computing--in fact, technical considerations convince us that there is no natural boundary".
Cerf and Curran urged the FCC to support the development of ffcompetitive servicestt; to insure that a ''sufficient setf1 of standards is created to facilitate interconnection of 'prime servicesf1; create a climate in which both computing and carrier interests profit from the installation of "reliablefv facilities; and broaden the base for the acquisition of capital so as to eliminate a possible constraint on growth.

AFIPS PAN)% mMsEM COktbfENT ON USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AT REQUEST OF PRIVACY COPMISSION Members of the AFIPS panel on private sector usage of the Social Security Number (SSN), organized at the request of the Privacy Protection Study Commission (washington Report, 2/76), last October responded individua lly to a staff memo copcerning the use of the SSN, submitted to them by Privacy Commission Executive Director Caroler W.
Parsons. Daniel D.
McCracken, independent consultant, said he favors legislation ?'to prohibit unauthorized matchihg of records" through use of the SSN as a universal identifier . McCracken wrote Parsons, saying that lacking such legislation, "1 would argue for restrictions on the use of the SSN as a partial subsititue, and as a way to keep the more basic issue alive and visible".
McCracken, who is ACM vice-president, is responsible for passage of an ACM resolution opposing the use of the SSN as a universal identifier., Herbert S.
Bright, president, Computation Planning Inc., who also filed a response to the memo, said use of the SSN in licensing drivers opens SSN files to insurance companies as well as list compilers and 6ther vendors.
Bright added: "Continuing progress in cross-linking practice between insurance companies is increasing the justification for vigorous efforts by the Commission to examine such attacks on privacy and to place the facts before the public and the Congress ".
Bright is also a member of ACM.
Willard E.
Hick, auditor, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., Springfield, Massachusetts, responding to the memo, wrote that the Commissionts statement supporting continued use of the personal identifier tlshould emphasize need and not conaentrate on counteracting sugges*ions that have been made .I1 Hick questioned why the Conunission does not "address in more detail the reason universal identifiers are necessary on a positive rather than negative note".
He told AFIPS Washington Report that, to the best of his knowledge, there is no I1crosslinkingw between insurance companies.
Hick is a member of the Institute of Internal Auditors.

1 January, 19:7 WAS1 IINGTON DEVELOPMENTS FEDERAL DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD APPROVED BY COMMERCE DEPARTMENT A data encryption algorithm, designed to protect digital information, was approved in November ad a Federal .Information Processing Standard (FIPS) by the Department of Commerce.
The new standard will be described and promulgated in FIPS PUB 46.
The algorithm was first proposed by the Institute for Computer Science and Technology (ICST) of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS') in 1973.
The encrypt ion algorithm converts informat Ion into -an encoded [C.
e., encrypted) form which can be transmitted or stored, but which cannot be read without the appropriate key.
Thus, it can be used to protect inforfiation communicated between a terminal and a computer, as well as between computers; in addition, it can be used to protect information stored in off-line media.
Mandatory stundiud for Federa2 agewies.
As a FIPS, Federal agencies wlll be requ~red to use the encryption algorithm, whenever encryption of data is deemed necessary.
However, data subject to the ilu:iona2 Security Act of 1967 and the Atomic Enenergy Act of 1952 are exempted from the standard.
The encryption algorithm may also be used on a voluntary basis by organizations and individuals outside the Federal government.
Primary initial appJication in EFTS.
The new standard's primary application is, initially expected to be in Electronic Funds Transfer Systems [EFTS).
The algorithm can be employed in EFTS to discourage l1skinuning" of bank card information for the purpose of gaining access to automated teller machines (ATMs).
It can also be employed to prevent interception of compute1 messages authorizing transactions at the ATM.
Several non-standard encryption algorithms, including one developed by Diebold, Inc,, are already in use by some banks.
Strength ofaZgcwith estimated.
NBS said technical workshops have been held to measure the strength of the algorithm in terms of time and money that must be spent in finding the key.
In November, at the Dartmouth College Symposim on Man and the Computer, ICST Director Dr.
Ruth M.
Davis stated that, while go code is ~theordtically unbreakable," 2,500 years of computer tine on a general-purpose computer Ilslgnlficantly faster" than a CDC 7600 would be required to derive a key.
With respect to future technology, Dr.
Davis estimated that "working from matched sets of clear and clpher data, well over $300 millionH could be spent five years from now to find a key.
With technology available in 10 years, it could take $70 million to derive a key, she said.
IBM 'e cr~~orithm choeen; compan%es to manufauture devices $morporatl'ng c~ta?t.durd dthuut paying royuztiee.
ICST began soliciting encryption algorithms in 1973 and 1974.
IBM's proposed algorithm was chosen in 1975.
While IBM has patent rights in the standard, the company has .agreed to grant royalty-free licenses to other companies which wish to manufacture devices incorporating the algorithm.
The trade press notes that Motorola an& Rockwell ~nternational are planning to manufacture integrated cirduit chips which incorporate the encryption algorithm.
Stundcql -too be pubtished 2/I5/77; oonfepeme echeduted.
PIPS PUB 46 is.
expected-to be published February 15, 1977.
and to become effective Augrut 15, 1977.
Copies of the standard will be available after February 15 from the National Technical Informatibn Service (NTIS), DOC, 5285 Port Royal Roa& Springfield, Virginia 22161, or through the MIPS Washington Office.
NBS will hold I conference on February 15, 1977, at its Gaithersburg, Maryland, facil~tiss to discuss !'IPS PUB 46 in relation to other security measures, TERMINAL MANUFACTURERS, INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS CRITICIZE FCC APPROVAL OF DATASPEED 4014 Independent terminal manufacturers and industry associations Bast month criticized the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for its approval of tariff filrings on AT&Tts Dataspeed 4014 terminal device (Washington Report, 12/76).
me FCC's approval, announced in November, reverses a previous proposed decision by the Commission's Common Carrier Buresd.
which rejected the Dataspeed 40/4 tariff (Washington aeport, 4/76).
Under the new FCC ruszng, ATGT will be permitted to provide the Dataspeed 4014 service.
Primmy Issue.
pe debate centers on whether the terminal bffering constitutes a data communicat~ons service or a data processing service.
If it is a data conununications service, as held in the present donunission ruling, ATGT can provide the service.
However, if it is a data processing service, as the Chief of the C~mon Carrier Bureau stated last March, ATET cannot provide the service The FCC had held earlier in its original lvCompute]r Inquiry" that common carriers may pr(wi.de data processing services, but only through unregulated subsidiaries.
However, AT&T is even pre6luded.
Zrom this option by its agreemept in a 1956 consent decree (with the U.S.
Department of Justice) not to participate in unregulated industries.
Specific industry criticism.
The independent terminal manhfacturers and computer industry groups charged that the development of the Dataspeed 40/4 terminal is subsidized by profits from ATGT's regulated communications service offerings.
Thus, they contend that the device represents "unfairff competition by ATGT against unregulatedb industries.
Possible further aeth.
The FCC has stated that its latest ruling is contingent on the outcome of the Comrnissionts new 'IComputer Iuquiryvt (see Wash6zgtun Report, 8/76).
(Comments in this proceeding are now due April 11, 1977; replies are due May 25, 1977).
However, the trade press speculates that it is unlikely that the Dataspeed 40/4 offering, once tariffed, will be "detariffedat' The Computer and~Communications Industry Association [CCIA) has indicated its intention to file suit against the Commission in the U.S.
Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
CCIA seeks to enjoin implementation of the FCC's ruling, pending a full wurt review on the merits.
CCPA APPROVES PATENT FOR SOFTWARE PROGRAM SECOND TIME Some software programs are eligible for patents, according to the U.S.
Court of?
Customs and Patent Appeals (CCPA), which last November reversed %he U.S.
Patent Office for the second time on the issue of software patentability.
The CCPA decision involves the l'Regulatort' program (developed by Glen F.
Chatfield, president of Duquesne Systems, Incl), whfch adjusts the priorities op computer programs.
In two previous cases, the Supreme Court (prior to the latest Chatf5eZd decision)has reversed the CCPA, deciding in favor of the Patent Office on limited grounds and not addressing the question of software patentability.
In CottschaZk v.
Benson, the Court ruled four years ago 'that a program to convert binary-coded decimal was not a patentable llprocessh as defined in ttie U.S.
Code, In 'Dann, ComrnissZoner of Patenes ad Truemarks v.
Johnston, the Cmrt held last April (WashCngton Report, 5/76) that a computerized recordkeeping system, developed for banks by Thomas R.
Johnston, is ltotnrious to one reasonably skilled in [the applicable] art, and is therefore not patentable.
CCPA Chief Jud e Harold T.
Markey ruled in the ChatfisZd case that "no prior art was cited f by the Patent office] against the appealed claims, and, accordingly, [the] invention must be considered to have been new and unobvious".
The judge also held that' Chatfield's invention meets the U.S.
Code requirement for tlpro~e~~'l claims.
TELEPROCESSING SERVICE PROGW INITIATED BY GSA, TO HELP REDUCE $10 BILLION FEDERAL DATA PROCESSING BUDGET The General Services Administration (GSA) in November signed its first two teleprocessing services schedule contracts, permitting agencies to order services at government-wide volume discounts!, rather than make separate procurements at greater cost.
The contracts, effective December 1, provide for interactive and remote batch proc'essing services &timated at between $50 to $80 million over the next year.
Computer Network Cow.
and First Data Corp.
received the first two contracts.
The trade press suggeststhat the teleprocessing services program is the fi~st of several steps the Government is implementing to reduee its $10 billion in yearly expenditures on data processing.
For example, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB], Executive Office of the President,is encouraging greater use of outside service bureaus as well as third-party leasing firms.
In addition, each Federal agency has been directed by OMB to determine five operations now being performed on its own computers that could be performed on service bureau computers.
OMB is expected to continue ~ts moves to cut DP expenses through the transition t~ the Carter Administration.
@lNSUMER BENEFITS IF EFT TERMINALS ARE NOT CONSIQERED BRANCHES: NCEFT TELLS SENATq Members of the National Commission on Electronic Fund Transfers [NCEFT) last month told a Senate Subcornittee that the Arner1ea.n consumer "may suffer unnecessary inconveniences and may pay higher prices for payment services" if EFT terminals are governed by the saw, laws and regulations that apply to bank branches.
Such Federal laws equate EFT terminal's wiTh branches thus forbidding EFT terminals in non-brandring states.
[See Wash5ngton Repop** 12/76).
In testimony presented to the Subcommittee on Financial Iristitutions, chaired by Sen.
Thomas d.
McIntyre (D-N.H.), NCBFT Chairman William B.
Widnall and Executive Director John 0.
Benton agreed that "[tlhe greatest current impediment to putting into place the technology which can provide the benefits of EFT to the consumer is the uncertainty which exists about the legal environment within wllich EFT systems will operate in the future".
The chairman and executive director, joined by three NCEFT commissioners, said that a competitive imbalance is created when federally-chartered savings institutions have greater freedom in deploying EFT terminals than national bahks,which are governed by more restrictive legislation.
The NCEFT representatives+ added that business enterprises, such as retail chains, "should not be considered,, . regulated institutions or branches thereof," when they employ electronic terminals to communicate with depository institutions.
Last month, the NCEFT convened hearings on competition and sharing.
The Commi$sionfs interim report is due February 23.
RGD HAMPERED BY LACK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE ENTERPRISE: "Lack of teamwork between the Government and private enterprise is the number one bottleneck in the nation's pursuit of research and development," said Dr.
Simon Ramo, vice chairman of the board and chairman of TRW, Inc.
Speaking last November in Washington at the annual fall meeting of the National Academy of Engineering, Dr.
Ramo added, "Even the nation's most capable researchers spend much of their time defending their selection of projects and describing potential results, rather than in carrying on research.
We are persisting in this tendency even with growing indications that the U.S. is losing its leadership position as to the fraction of gross national product being devoted to basic research".
The TRW Executive, who is also chairman of the President *s Science and Technology Committee,expressed the hope that the new Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President, will contribute to the formation of llsoundlt national policy.
ASST. COMMERCE SECKETARY RECOMMENDS USPS COMPROMISE ON-PAGE CHARGES FOR NONPROFIT SCIENTIFIC, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNICAL JOURNALS AND PERIODICALS The U.S.
Postal Service (USPS) is ItwillSng to modify1' the USPS regulation requiring reading matter in all non-profit, second class publications to be marked ~ladvertisementv when contributors are required to pay page charges on their submissions, Dr.
Betsy Ancker-Johnson, the Department of Commercets Assistant Secretary for Science and Technology, last month said the USPS is llwilling to modify the regulation so long as contributions to publishing costs arenlt mandatary but vol~ntary.~' Convening a meeting last month of the Committee on Intellectual Property and Information, Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering and Technology, Dr.
AnclcerJohnson, committee chairman, indicated that this voluntary arrangement should be clarified in the publicationts masthead.
The regulation could affect the policy of AFIPS constituent societies which must publish a non-profit j ournal as one qualification for membership.
Page charges, paid by researchers, are viewed by journal publishers as one method of defraying the cost of reporting research.
In many cases, page charges are paid by funds obtained through research grants.
Charges may be voluntary,far example, with researchers who are not supported by grants.
Dr. Bernard Forscher, managing editor of the National Academy of Sciences' Prooasdhgs, suggested in an interview with AFlPS Washington Report, that page charges should be considered in research budgets.
Dr. Forscher compared publication of research findings with "staking a claim to a disc~very,~~ or "obtaining a deed".
Forty per cent of the production costs of the ProoeedjnSs are defrayed through page charges; the remaining 60 per cent is covered by sales of subscriptions as well as reprints and back issues, he said.
The meeting of the Committee on Intellectual Property andInformation was attended by rep~esentatives of IEEE, the National Science Foundation, the American Astronomical Society, as well as AFIPS and others.
A representative of the Federation of American Societies in Experimental Biology said that the scientific community,will not accept the compromise solution.
He indicated that unless page charges ire mandatory, they "won1 t work.
The biology society's representative recommended a special exemption from the regulation for scientific j ournails . The counsel for the National Academy of Sciences agreed that pa e charges cannot be voluntary.
He said "those who now pay must contlnue [to pay f or serious problems [will arise]".
He stated that scientific jouqal articles are Itas deserving of second-class [mailing privileges] as anything that goes through the mail, " There was, however, somq support for the USPS compromise.
One society representative suggested that attendance at the meeting, reflecting opposition to the voluntary page charges, was not representative of most professional societies views.
Ancker-Johnson stated that her committee could tlmonitorlf cases brought to its attention and act as "brokersv in situations in which voluntary payments, once agreed to, werenot made.
She confirmed that the compromise is about to be put in writing (#I by USPS counsel.
Ancker-Johnson suggested that further comments concerning the regulation and the proposed compromise be directed to her in Room 3862, DOC.

AFIPS PANEL MEMBERS COMMENT ON USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AT REQUEST OF . PRIVACY COMMISSION: ADDITIONAL RESPONSES DESCRIBED Last month.
AFIPS Washington Report described responses of some members of an AFIPS panel on private sector usage of the Social Security Number (SSN) to a position paper on this subject issued by the Privacy Protection Study Commission.
We now report several additional responses which have since been received from: Jeffrey V.
White, president, The Credit Bureau, Inc.
(CBI), Atlanta, Georgia; John J.
Stiqlemeier, director, Information Center on Education, New York State Emucation Department; Alden R.
Dalzell, director of Data Processing, Ohio University, Athens, Ohio; J.M.
Moore, section head, Exxon Corp., Florham Park, New Jersey; and William E.
Perry, director of EDP and Research, the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), Orlando, Florida.
Credit Bureau President White wrote: "Since one of CBI's primary obligations is to maintain the confidentiality of the informatibn in its data base, we would be opposed to any general prohibitions against the use of the Social Security Number in the private sector.
While CBI does not use this number as a universal identifier or as a sole factor in the identification or authentication process, it is an aid in maintaining confidentiality in a small number of cases.
Therefore, eliminating the use of the Social Security Number would have an adverse impact on our ability to serve the consumer and the credit granting community.
Bxxon Section Head Moore wrote: he presence of the SSN in the record constitutes unique identification and restricting its use as a formal record identifier would serve no useful purpose," Ohio University Data Processing Director Dalzell said: "I would question whether the individual's knowledge and consent should be s complete qualifier.
Ark individual may be informed that he need not supply information if he does not wish, and he may be informed of how it will be used, but that does not completely answer the question of whether the information should he gathered and used, even with his permission ".
New York State Education Department Director Stiglemeier wrote that the Commission's position paper constituted an "excellentn outline of the project boundaries and issues, but the paper's introduction omitted discussion of "goals.
infomation needs, and inte~relationships with other pro j ects . He called these omissions "criticalv1 to the success of the project.
IIA EDP/Research Director Perry cited example's of what he called vlsome preconceived findings and conclusion sf^ of theposition paper, described by the Commission as av@oblem and issue ~tatement.~~ He mentioned such Commission flfindingss" as "the use of the SSN for personal authentication does not appear in itself to constitute an unfair information practice," and Ifthe exchange of information without the knowledge or consent of an individual may constitute an unfair information practice.ll Perry also wrote that individuals who feel that divulging the SSN for personal authentication is dehumanizing "would probably object to the alternatives even moreaVr The kF1PS Washington Report is researched and written by ~Gnder hi.
