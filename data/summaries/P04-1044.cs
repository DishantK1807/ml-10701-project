to Previous Work (Litman et al., 2000) use acoustic-prosodic information extracted from speech waveforms, together with information derived from their speech recognizer, to automatically predict misrecognized turns in a corpus of train-timetable information dialogues.

However, recent research (Daelemans and Hoste, 2002; Marsi et al., 2003) has shown that machine learners often profit from parameter optimization (i.e.

(Litman et al., 2000)).

However, both (Litman et al., 2000) and (Walker et al., 2000) consider only single-best recognition results and thus use their classifiers as “filters” to decide whether the best recognition hypothesis for a user utterance is correct or not.

The dialogue system uses the Nuance 8.0 speech recognizer with language models compiled from a grammar (written using the Gemini system (Dowding et al., 1993)), which is also used for parsing and generation.

This is adopted from (Gabsdil, 2003), based on the fact that WER correlates with concept accuracy (CA, (Boros et al., 1996)).

Figure 2: Parameter optimization described by (Marsi et al., 2003) but is similar in the sense that it computes a best-performing parameter setting for each data fold.
