In order to deal with ASR errors two approaches have been proposed: • modeling explicitly the ASR errors, thanks to a development corpus and a set of confidence measures, in order to detect the possible errors of the 1-best word string hypothesis (with the type of errors) before extracting the NEs (Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001); • exploiting a search space bigger than the 1-best hypothesis alone, either by taking into account an n-best list (Zhai et al., 2004) or the whole word lattice (Saraclar and Sproat, 2004).

Indeed, several studies have shown that F-measure and WER are strongly correlated : 0.7 points of F-measure lost for each additional 1% of WER according to (Miller et al., 2000) on the experiments of 1998 NIST Hub-4 evaluations (Przybocki et al., 1999).

Theses grammars are represented by Finite State Machines (FSMs) (thanks to the AT&T GRM/FSM toolkit (Allauzen et al., 2003)).

To tackle this problem, different ideas have been proposed: modeling explicitly the ASR errors (Palmer and Ostendorf, 2001) or using the ASR system alternate hypotheses found in word lattices (Saraclar and Sproat, 2004).

The decrease in F-measure observed between the reference and the ASR transcripts is similar to the one obtained in other studies (Miller et al., 2000).

5.1 Text-based NER system: NERtext Among all the different methods that have been proposed for NER, one can find rule based models (Cunningham et al., 2002), Maximum Entropy models (Brothwick et al., 1998), Conditionnal Random Fields or probabilistic HMM-based models (Bikel et al., 1999).
