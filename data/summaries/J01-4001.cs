From simple co-occurrence rules (Dagan and Itai 1990) through training decision trees to identify anaphor-antecedent pairs (Aone and Bennett 1995) to genetic algorithms to optimize the resolution factors (Or~san, Evans, and Mitkov 2000), the successful performance of more and more modern approaches was made possible by the availability of suitable corpora.

Tetreault's contribution features comparative evaluation involving the author's own centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centering algorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naive algorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's Slist approach (Strube 1998).

Against the background of a growing interest in multilingual NLP, multilingual anaphora/coreference resolution has gained considerable momentum in recent years (Aone and McKee 1993; Azzam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998; Harabagiu and Maiorano 2000; Mitkov and Barbu 2000; Mitkov 1999; Mitkov and Stys 1997; Mitkov, Belguith, and Stys 1998).

Other milestones of recent research include the deployment of probabilistic and machine learning techniques (Aone and Bennett 1995; Kehler 1997; Ge, Hale, and Charniak 1998; Cardie and Wagstaff 1999; the continuing interest in centering, used either in original or in revised form (Abra~os and Lopes 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn and Strube 1997; Tetreault 1999); and proposals related to the evaluation methodology in anaphora resolution (Mitkov 1998a, 2001b).

Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited domain and linguistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and Brown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required considerable human input.

A number of proposals in the 1990s deliberately limited the extent to which they relied on domain and/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor operational environments (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991; Lappin and Leass 1994; Nasukawa 1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Williams, Harvey, and Preston 1996; Baldwin 1997; Mitkov 1996, 1998b).

The inclusion of the coreference task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6 and MUC-7) gave a considerable impetus to the development of coreference resolution algorithms and systems, such as those described in Baldwin et al.(1995), Gaizauskas and Humphreys (1996), and Kameyama (1997).
