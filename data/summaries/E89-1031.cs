Counting the number of elements in L3 is not enough in determining the possibility of synthesizing or not a pronoun: pragmatical considerations, focus (C.Sidner 1981, B.Grosz, 1982) and parallelism (L.Danlos, 1987a) are phenomena that must be taken into account.

Another one is the following constraint: If a personal pronoun synthesizes the subject of a sentential clause which must be reduced to an infinitive form when its subject is equal to the subject of the main clause, then this pronoun does not refer to the subject of the main clause, because if it did, the sentential clause would be reduced to an infinitive form (L.Danlos 1988):*Mary i wants that Maryileaves --> Maryiwants to leave.

The order in which the elements of a CI must be synthesized is determined by "non-local dependencies" and "cross dependencies" (L.Danlos & F.Namer 1988, L.Danlos 1988).
