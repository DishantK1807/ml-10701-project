For parameter estimation, we can use the Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS) algorithm (Berger et all., 1996), which assumes p to have the form: p(x, y) = where fi : X x Y ~ {0, 1} is the indicator function of the i-th feature, Ai the weight assigned to this feature, and Z a normalisation constant.

The use of a rich set of contextual features is also the basic idea of the approach taken by Hermjakob and Mooney (1997), who employ predicates capturing syntactic and semantic context in their parsing and machine translation system.

Its applications range from sentence boundary disambiguation (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) to part-of-speech tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1997) and machine translation (Berger et al., 1996).

Ratnaparkhi (1997) introduces several conteztual predicates which provide rich information about the syntactic context of nodes in a tree (basically, the structure and category of nodes dominated by or dominating the current phrase).

They are commonly estimated by deleted interpolation (Brown et hi., 1992).

As far as coverage is concerned, our parser can handle recursive structures, which is an advantage compared to simpler techniques such as that described by Church (1988).
A88-1019
An archetypal representative of this approach is the method described by Church (1988), who used corpus frequencies to determine the boundaries of simple non, recursive NPs.

For instance, Joshi and Srinivas (1994) encode partial structures in the Tree Adjoining Grammar framework and use tagging techniques to restrict a potentially very large amount of alternative structures.
