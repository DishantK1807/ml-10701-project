This strategy is commonly used in MT evaluation, because of BLEUâ€™s well-known problems with documents of small size (Papineni et al., 2002; Koehn, 2004).

Our scores fall within the range of previous researchers (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin and Och, 2004).

of Paraphrases on Machine Translation Evaluation The standard way to analyze the performance of an evaluation metric in machine translation is to compute the Pearson correlation between the automatic metric and human scores (Papineni et al., 2002; Koehn, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Stent et al., 2005).

Paraphrasing Techniques To investigate the effect of paraphrase quality on automatic evaluation, we consider two alternative paraphrasing resources: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Brown clustering (Brown et al., 1992).

Examples of such knowledge sources include stemming and TF-IDF weighting (Babych and Hartley, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).
P04-1079 W05-0909
Papineni et al.(2002) shows that expanding the number of references reduces the gap between automatic and human evaluation.
P02-1040
The Pearson correlation is calculated over these ten pairs (Papineni et al., 2002; Stent et al., 2005).

For example, Pang et al.(2003) expand a set of reference translations using syntactic alignment, and generate new reference sentences that could be used in automatic evaluation.

These techniques are widely used in NLP applications, including language modeling, information extraction, and dialogue processing (Haghighi et al., 2005; Sera n and Eugenio, 2004; Miller et al., 2004).

Work Automatic Paraphrasing and Entailment Our work is closely related to research in automatic paraphrasing, in particular, to sentence level paraphrasing (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Quirk et al., 2004).

2This can explain why previous attempts to use WordNet for generating sentence-level paraphrases (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004) were unsuccessful.

Methods for entailment 456 recognition extensively rely on lexico-semantic resources (Haghighi et al., 2005; Harabagiu et al., 2001), and we believe that our method for contextual substitution can be bene cial in that context.

Automatic Evaluation Measures A variety of automatic evaluation methods have been recently proposed in the machine translation community (NIST, 2002; Melamed et al., 2003; Papineni et al., 2002).

Since even synonyms cannot be substituted in any context (Edmonds and Hirst, 2002), this ltering step is necessary.
