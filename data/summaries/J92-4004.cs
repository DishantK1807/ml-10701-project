Thus when the identification of s2 and s4 takes place, s3 must dominate sl and again zero or more structures of the form of fl19 could fit between s3 and sl now (see Joshi and Vijay-Shanker \[1989\]) for a discussion of the treatment of long-distance dependency in TAG and LFG).

Ordering relations We use the ordering relationship, f-, as defined by Rounds and Kasper (1986) i.e., `41 ___ `42 iff there is a homomorphism mapping the states of Jt I to the states of -/~2 that preserves the transition and output functions.
P86-1038
Using quasi-trees, we are able to justify the definition of feature structurebased Tree Adjoining Grammars (FTAG) that was first given in Vijay-Shanker (1987) and VijayShanker and Joshi (1988).
C88-2147
This representation uses the logical formulation of feature structures as given by Kasper and Rounds (1986) and Johnson (1988) and is similar in approach to the logical formulation of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG) given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987).
P86-1038 P87-1013
To compare our representational scheme for FTAG with that for FUG given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987), we have used predicate symbols instead of type variables.
P87-1013
Work along this direction is being carried out (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes 1992).
C92-1034
The above description essentially captures the definition of the formalism presented by Harbusch (1990).
C90-2029
In fact, that s3 must dominate Sl must be derivable from any reasonable linguistic theory that is used to produce the elementary structures concerned (for otherwise a wrong sequence of words would be predicted)• One possible explanation of why s3 dominates Sl could be given by importing a device like the functional uncertainty machinery (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988) used in LFG• The treatment used in LFG, when imported here, would suggest that zero or more structures of the form given by fl19 would fit in the gap specified by the domination link between s3 and s4.
C88-1060
On the other hand, as was noted by Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck (1983), without explicitly stating so, we cannot make assertions about a pair of quasi-nodes that will indicate that they are the same.
P83-1020
In fact, we also show that the formalism defined in Harbusch (1990) (where only one feature structure is associated with every node) turns out to be similar to the use of FTAG with an additional decision to merge every pair of quasi-nodes by default.
C90-2029
Many of the figures in this paper have been drawn by XTAG (Schabes and Paroubek 1992), a workbench for Tree-Adjoining Grammars.
A92-1030
Among pairs of sets of n-tuples of automata, say 191,/92, we use the same ordering as that used by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987) and state that/91 G /92 iff/91 G /92.
P87-1013
The structures that terms denote are the finite state automata (actually equivalence classes containing such automata; for details, we refer to Moshier \[1988\] for a discussion about these structures) as defined by Kasper and Rounds (1986) and used in defining the satisfiability of formulae in their logic.
P86-1038
Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (1992) describe a proof system that can be used to perform the type of reasoning involved in constructing the structure o~23 as described above.
C92-1034 P92-1010
In the framework of Rounds and Manaster-Ramer (1987), an FUG (or any contextfree grammar with associated unification equations as in, say PATR-II) can be represented by means of a set of equations, using the formulae of Kasper-Rounds to represent feature structures.
P87-1013
In fact, Harbusch (1990) defined such a treatment of TAG where only one feature structure is associated with each node.
C90-2029
This interpretation of the objects manipulated by a TAG grammar as quasi-trees not only leads to our current definition of FTAG, but also explains the earlier definition (Vijay-Shanker 1987; VijayShanker and Joshi 1988).
C88-2147
In Section 4, we propose a logical formulation of FTAG grammars (along the lines of the logical formulation of Functional Unification Grammars given by Rounds and Manaster-Ramer \[1987\]) and then show how the denotation of a b-TAG grammar can be obtained.
P87-1013
It may be interesting to contrast this lack of information in ~5 (whether or not they refer to the same node) with the use of functional uncertainty in LFG (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988) to account for long-distance dependency.
C88-1060
In particular, these descriptions include the partial specification of domination, as in description theory or D-theory (Marcus, Hindle, and Fleck 1983), in addition to the specification of immediate domination.
