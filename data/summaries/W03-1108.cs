Moreover, non-aligned comparable corpora have been given a special interest in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexical resources enrichment (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Dejean et al., 2002; Diab and Finch, 2000; Fung, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Nakagawa, 2000; Peters and Picchi, 1995; Rapp, 1999; Shahzad and al., 1999; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996).

The merging process will keep common pairs of source term and target translation (s,t) which appear in SIMS!T as pairs of (s,t) but also in SIMT!S as pairs of (t,s), to result in combined similarity vectors SIMS$T for each pair (s,t).The product of similarity values of both similarity vectors SIMS!T for pairs (s,t) and SIMT!S for pairs (t,s) will result in similarity values in vectors SIMS$T . Therefore, similarity vectors of the two-stages translation model are expressed as follows: SIMS$T = f(s;t;simS$T (tjs)) j (s;t;simS!T (tjs)) 2 SIMS!T ^ (t;s;simT!S(sjt)) 2 SIMT!S ^ simS$T (tjs) = simS!T (tjs) simT!S(sjt)g 3 Linguistics-based Pruning Combining linguistic and statistical methods is becoming increasingly common in computational linguistics, especially as more corpora become available (Klanvans and Tzoukermann, 1996; Sadat et al., 2003).

First, word frequencies, context word frequencies in surrounding positions (here three-words window) are computed following a statistics-based metrics, the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).

Merge the first and second models to yield a two-stages translation model, based on bidirectional comparable corpora and represented by similarity SIMS$T . We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al., 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second translation models and propose a merging strategy for the two-stages translation model (Sadat et al., 2003).

Transliteration is the phonetic or spelling representation of one language using the alphabet of another language (Knight and Graehl, 1998).

2 Two-stages Comparable Corpora-based Approach Our proposed approach to bilingual terminology acquisition from comparable corpora (Sadat et al., 2003; Sadat et al., 2003) is based on the assumption of similar collocation, i.e., If two words are mutual translations, then their most frequent collocates are likely to be mutual translations as well.
