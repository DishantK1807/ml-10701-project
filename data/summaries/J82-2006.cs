Recent work on treating departures from grammaticality (Sondheimer and Weischedel 1980, Hayes and Mouradian 1980, McKeown 1980, Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981, Miller et al.1981) can be use in handling specialized language that deviates syntactically from the standard language.

Devices for designing more "friendly" systems, such as the work on graceful interaction (Kaplan 1978, Hayes and Reddy 1979, Weischedel and Sondheimer 1981) are relevant to the question of relating sublanguage-specific phenomena to those of the whole language.

Frame-like structures may also be employed to recognize and extract larger information components (e.g., Bobrow et al.1977, Schank et al.1980). A number of techniques are being developed for the specification and representation of semantic structures that can extend beyond the sentence unit.

A new technique for developing transportable systems for natural-language interfaces to databases (Hendrix and Lewis 1981) elicits from the user a language for querying the contents at the same time that information about the domain is being entered.
