De ⇔ 戴 (dai), La ⇔ 拉 (la), De La ⇔ 戴拉 (dai la), Van Der ⇔ 范德 (fan de), Du ⇔ 杜 (du), David ⇔ 大衛 (da wei), Khan ⇔ 汗 (han), Del ⇔ 戴 (dai), Le ⇔ 勒 (le), Van Den ⇔ 范登 (fan deng), Di ⇔ 迪 (di) It shows that personal names tend to be transliterated and the CNA personal name corpus is suitable for training the similarity scores among phonetic characters (Lin and Chen, 2002).

In the past, named entity extraction mainly focuses on general domains and is employed to various applications such as information retrieval (Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998), question-answering (Lin, et al., 2001), and so on.

Lin and Chen (2000) further classified the works into two directions – say, forward transliteration (Wan and Verspoor, 1998) and backward transliteration (Chen et al., 1998; Knight and Graehl, 1998), and proposed a phoneme-based model.

Lin and Chen (2002) employed a machine learning approach to determine phonetic similarity scores for machine transliteration.

The backward transliteration method proposed by Lin and Chen (2000, 2002) was followed to select the most similar English named entity and the related documents at the same time.

For example, corpus-based methods are employed to extract Chinese personal names, and rule-based methods are used to extract Chinese date/time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions (Chen and Lee, 1996; Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998).
