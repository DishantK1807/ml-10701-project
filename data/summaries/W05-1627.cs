[Bangalore and Rambow, 2000] describe a realizer that uses a word ngram model combined with a tree-based stochastic model trained on a version of the Penn treebank annotated in XTAG grammar format.
P00-1059
The metrics are derived from the Gnome corpus [Poesio et al., 2004].

[Ratnaparkhi, 2000] describes a sentence realizer that had been trained on a domain-specific corpus (in the air travel domain) augmented with semantic attributevalue pairs.
A00-2026
[Varges and Mellish, 2001] present an approach to sentence realization that employs an instance-based ranker trained on a semantically annotated subset of the Penn treebank II (‘Who’s News’ texts).

Both the work reported in [Stone, 2003] and in [Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004] can be seen as attempts to deal with the lack of domain model information in situations where only the surface forms of referring expressions are given.
P04-1052
[Siddharthan and Copestake, 2004] take a corpusbased perspective and essentially regard a text as a knowledge base from which descriptions of domain objects can be extracted.
P04-1052
[Karamanis et al., 2004] discuss centering-based metrics of coherence that could be used for choosing among competing text structures.
P04-1050
