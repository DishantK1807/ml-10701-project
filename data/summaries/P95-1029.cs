Also, whereas (Park, 1992) requires careful consideration of handling of determiners with coordination, here such sentences are handled just like any others.

See (Jowsey, 1990) and (Moore, 1989) for a thorough discussion.

This paper is meant to be viewed as furthering the exploration of the utility of higher-order logic programming for computational linguistics see, for example, (Miller & Nadathur, 1986), (Pareschi, 1989), and (Pereira, 1990).

Moore. 1989.
P89-1005
(Moore, 1989) suggests that the way to overcome this problem is to use explicit A-terms and encode /~-reduction to perform the needed reduction.

Park. 1992.
P92-1027
(Moore, 1989) in fact borrows the notation for Aabstraction from AProlog.
P89-1005
Alternatives that appear compatible with the present approach are quantitier movement (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987), type-ralsing at LF (Paxtee & Rooth, 1983), or the use of disambiguated quantifers in the derivation itself (Park, 1995).
J87-1005
213 (Park, 1992) proposes a solution within first-order unification that can handle not only sentence (la), but also more complex examples with determiners.
