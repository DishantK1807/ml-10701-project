on Switchboard Table 2 presents the results of similar experiments on the Switchboard corpus following the 165 train/dev/test partition of Charniak and Johnson (2001).

Section 3 applies metarules (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1983; McKelvie, 1998a; Core and Schubert, 1999) in recognizing these correspondences using standard context-free grammars.

gory et al., 2004; Lease et al., 2005; Kahn et al., 2005) as described further in Section 6.

The TAG-based model of Johnson and Charniak (2004) is a separate-processing approach that rep166 resents the state of the art in reparandum-finding.
P04-1005
In Gregory et al.(2004), over 100 real-valued acoustic and prosodic features were quantized into a heuristically selected set of discrete symbols, which were then treated as pseudo-punctuation in a PCFG, assuming that prosodic cues function like punctuation.

The strengths of these simple tree-based techniques should be combinable with sophisticated string-based (Johnson and Charniak, 2004; Liu, 2004; Zhang and Weng, 2005) approaches by applying the methods of Wieling et al.(2005) for constraining parses by externally-suggested brackets.
P04-1005 W05-1519
Such a method is analogous to Kahn et al.(2005) but in a generative framework.
H05-1030
The 1McKelvie’s metarule approach declaratively expresses Hindle’s (1983) Stack Editor and Category Copy Editor rules.
P83-1019
For instance, the Penn Treebank policy (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994) is to annotate the lowest node that is unfinished with an -UNF tag as in Figure 4(a).
H94-1020 J93-2004
This second step improves on Stolcke and Shriberg (1996) and Heeman and Allen (1999) and outperforms the specific grammar-based reparandum-finders tested in section 4.
J99-4003
This test set was tagged using MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) which was itself trained on Switchboard.
W96-0213
If edit hypotheses were augmented to mention particular tree nodes where the reparandum should be attached, such syntactic parallelism constraints could be exploited in the reranking framework of Johnson et al.(2004). The approach in section 3 is more closely related to that of Core and Schubert (1999) who also use metarules to allow a parser to switch from speaker to speaker as users interrupt one another.
P04-1005 P99-1053
In this separate-processing approach, reparanda are located through a variety of acoustic, lexical or string-based techniques, then excised before submission to a parser (Stolcke and Shriberg, 1996; Heeman and Allen, 1999; Spilker et al., 2000; Johnson and Charniak, 2004).
J99-4003 P04-1005
The resulting parse tree then has the reparandum re-attached in a standardized way (Charniak and Johnson, 2001).
N01-1016
The third experiment measures the benefit from syntactic indicators alone in Charniak’s lexicalized parser (Charniak, 2000).
