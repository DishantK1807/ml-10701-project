Several researchers have tackled the syntactic analysis (Lauer, 1995), (Pustejovsky et al., 1993), (Liberman and Church, 1992), usually using a variation of the idea of finding the subconstituents elsewhere in the corpus and using those to predict how the larger compounds are structured.

The most closely related use of a lexical hierarchy that we know of is that of Li & Abe (1998), which uses an information-theoretic measure to make a cut through the top levels of the noun portion of WordNet.

Vanderwende (1994) uses a sophisticated system to extract semantic information automatically from an on-line dictionary, and then manipulates a set of hand-written rules with handassigned weights to create an interpretation.

Barker & Szpakowicz (1998) describe noun compounds as triplets of information: the first constituent, the second constituent, and a marker that can indicate a number of syntactic clues.

For example, Buitelaar (1997) notes that the noun book is assigned to seven different senses, including fact and section, subdivision.

In previous work (Rosario and Hearst, 2001), we demonstrated the utility of using a lexical hierarchy for assigning relations to two-word noun compounds.
