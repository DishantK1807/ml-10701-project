First, the method explored here can be extended as an alterative way to support such MT subtasks as back transliteration (Knight and Graehl 1998) and noun phrase translation (Koehn and Knight 2003).

Nagata et al.(2001) described how to exploit proximity and redundancy to extract translation for a given term.

Hybrid transliteration models were described by AlOnaizan and Knight (2002), and Oh et al.(2005). 1002 Recently, some of the machine transliteration study has begun to consider the problem of extracting names and their transliterations from parallel corpora (Qu and Grefenstette 2004, Lin, Wu and Chang 2004; Lee and Chang 2003, Li and Grefenstette 2005).

Goto et al.(2003), and Li et al.(2004) proposed a grapheme-based transliteration model.

Cao and Li (2002) described a new method for base noun phrase translation by using Web data.

There are also services on the Web specifically targeting transliteration aimed at improving CLIR, including CHINET (Kwok et al.2005) and LiveTrans (Lu, Chien, and Lee 2004).

Knight and Graehl (1998) proposed a multilayer model and a generate-and-test approach to perform back transliteration from Japanese to English based on the model.
