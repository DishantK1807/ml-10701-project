However, a full syntactical approach \[Salton, 1988\] to this task has real problem with efficiency and coverage for unrestricted text.

These include the availability of efficient and high precision word segmentation methods for Chinese text \[Chang et al., 1991; Sproat and Shih, 1990; Wang et al., 1990\], the availability of statistical analysis of a Chinese corpus \[Liu et al., 1975\] and large-scale electronic Chinese dictionaries with partof-speech information \[Chang et al., 1988; BDC, 1992\], the corpus-based statistical part-of-speech tagger \[Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988; Beale, 1988\], as well as phrasal and clausal analyzers \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\] 2.

The algorithm is essentially the same as \[DeRose, 1988\].

As for English, there are at least three independently developed 1Af~ 149 taggers \[Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Beale 1988\].

Problem description As being pointed out in \[Salton, 1988\], back-of-book indexes may consist of more than one word that are derived from a noun phrase.

3.3. Finding Noun Phrases Instead of using a full-blown parser to find noun phrases, we first mark the noun phrases in the same text of about 4,000 words and compute the statistical characteristics of categoric patterns of noun phrase and then use the statistics in a stochastic algorithm for finding noun phrases in a manner similar to \[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\].

Extracting keywords from a noun phrase is somewhat heuristic unlike the rigorous approach of using the syntactical structure within the noun phrase in \[Salton, 1988\].

Later people came to realize that indexes are often multi-word terms and their generation might involve more elaborated syntactic analysis on phrasal or sentential level \[Salton, 1988; Dillon and McDonald, 1983\].
