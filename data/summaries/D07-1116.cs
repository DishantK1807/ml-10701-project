Sometimes, due to data sparseness and/or limitations in the machine learning paradigm used, we need to extract features from the available representation in a manner that profoundly changes the representation (as is done in bilexical parsing (Collins, 1997)).

We use the division into training and devtest corpora proposed by Zitouni et al.(2006), further dividing their devtest set into two equal parts to give us a development and a test set.

In fact, in a recent paper on diacritization, Habash and Rambow (2007) report that word error rate drops 9.4% absolute (to 5.5%) if the word-final diacritics (which include case) need not be predicted.

Similar drops have been observed by other researchers (Nelken and Shieber, 2005; Zitouni et al., 2006).

Thus, we can deduce that tagging-based approaches to case identification are limited in their usefulness, and if we need full diacritization for subsequent processing in a natural language processing (NLP) application (say, language modeling for automatic speech recognition (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004)), we need to perform more complex syntactic processing to restore case diacritics.
