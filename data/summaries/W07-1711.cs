In some recent experiments, Pedersen and Bruce (1997) have used proximity features (tags of close words and the presence or absence of close functions words 116 Schfttze Automatic Word Sense Discrimination and content words) with some promising results.

For example, Pedersen and Bruce (1997) cluster the occurrences of an ambiguous word by constructing a vector of terms occurring in the context of the target.

Agreement between coders (and between automatic methods and coders) has been measured in the summarization literature with quite a wide range of methods: Rath, Resnick, and Savage (1961) use Kendall's ; Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen (1995) (among many others) use percentage agreement; and Aone, Okurowski, and Gorlinsky (1997) (among others) use the notions of precision, recall, and F1 -score, which are commonly employed in the information retrieval community.

It is debatable whether structural features are more informative than associational features (Grefenstette 1992, 1996) or not (Schtitze and Pedersen 1997).

6. Evaluation 6.1 Introduction Traditionally, summarization systems have been evaluated in two major ways: (1) intrinsically, measuring the amount of the core information preserved from the original text (Kupiec, Pedersen, and Chen 1995; Teufel and Moens 1997), and (2) extrinsically, measuring how much the summary can benefit in accomplishing another task (e.g., finding a document relevant to a query or classifying a document into a topical category) (Mani et al.1998). In this work, we focus on intrinsic evaluation exclusively.

This limitation can be partly alleviated by either only considering adjacent models and limiting the length to 5-6 words, or using a forward or backward sequential search proposed by (Pedersen et al., 1997) for the problem of selecting models for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.
