Based on psycholinguistics studies (Dubey et al., 2005), our intuition isthat similarities concerning the surface, the content and the structure of textual units can be a way for authors to explicit their intention toconsider these units withthesamerhetorical importance.

Parallelism can be encountered in many specific discourse structures such as continuity in information structure (Kruijff-KorbayovÂ´a and Kruijff, 1996), frame structures (Charolles, 1997), VP ellipses (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997), headings (Summers, 1998), enumerations (Luc et al., 1999), etc.

This account is not limited to the semantic dimension as defined by (Hobbs and Kehler, 1997) who consider text fragments as parallel if the same predicate can be inferred from them with coreferential or similar pairs of arguments.
P97-1051
Due to some kind of priming (syntactic, phonetic, lexical, etc.), the comprehension and the production of a parallel utterance is made faster (Dubey et al., 2005).
