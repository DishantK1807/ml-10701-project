In the next section, we give a formal review of the standard treatment of lists of pointers as described in (Goldsmith, 2001); then we successively introduce polarized lists of pointers and the method of binary strings, and make a first, theoretical comparison of them.

The fundamental hypothesis underlying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework (Rissanen, 1989; de Marcken, 1996; Goldsmith, 2001) is that the selection of a model for explaining a set of data should aim at satisfying two constraints: on the one hand, it is desirable to select a model that can be described in a highly compact fashion; on the other hand, the selected model should make it possible to model the data well, which is interpreted as being able to describe the data in a maximally compact fashion.

Consider, for instance, the model of morphology described in Goldsmith (2001).
