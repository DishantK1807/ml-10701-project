For example, easily perceivable attributes and basic-level attributes values are preferred (Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Reiter and Dale, 1992).

While the overall planning mechanism follows the RST-based planning approach (How, 1988; Moore and Paris, 1989; Reithinger, 1991), the planning operators more resemble the schemata in schema-based planning (McKeown, 1985; Paris, 1988) since presentation patterns associated with specific proof patterns normally contain multiple RST-relations.

More recently, the shift of focus has been further investigated in the light of a structured flow of discourse (Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidnet, 1986; Dale, 1992).

Figure 1 shows the architecture of PROVERB(Huang, 1994a; HuangFiedler, 1997): the macroplanner produces a sequence of PCAs, the DRCC (Derive Reference Choices Component) module of the microplanner enriches the PCAs with reference choices.

Following (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) we further assume that every posting of a new task by the hierarchical planning mechanism creates new attentional spaces.

PROVERB combines both of these approaches in a uniform planning framework (Huang, 1994a).

Despite this difference, the choices to be made here have much in common with the choices of subsequent references discussed in more general frameworks (Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Dale, 1992): they depend on the availability of the object to be referred to in the context and are sensitive to the segmentation of a context into an attentional hierarchy.

Based on this observation, Sibun (Sibun, 1990) implemented a system for generating descriptions of objects with a strong domain structure, such as houses, chips, and families.

of the Macroplanner Most current text planners adopt a hierarchical planning approach (How, 1988; Moore and Paris, 1989; Dale, 1992; Reithinger, 1991).
