being able to take the V-O pairs 14 This section presents an abridged version of material reported on in Pustejovsky (1992).

Alshawi (1987), Boguraev et al.(1989), Vossen, Meijs, and den Broeder (1989), and the work described in Wilks et al.(1992) have made explicit some kinds of implicit information found in MRDs.
J87-3001
Techniques for identifying explicit information in machine-readable dictionaries have been developed by many researchers (Boguraev et al.1989; Slator 1988; Slator and Wilks 1987; Guthrie et al.1990) and are well understood.
C90-2007 C90-3025 J87-3002
It is these lexical structures that are then statistically tuned against the corpus, following the methods outlined in Anick and Pustejovsky (1990) and Pustejovsky (1992).
C90-2002 H92-1047
Finally, figure-ground nominals (Pustejovsky and Anick 1988) permit perspective shifts such as those in Examples 12 through 15.

TM We find that this type of metonymic extension for the subject is natural and indeed very frequent with reporting verbs Bergler (1991), such as announce, report, release, and claim, while it is in general not possible with other verbs selecting human subjects, e.g., the verbs of contemplation (such as contemplate, consider, and think).
E91-1038
There is a growing literature on corpus-based acquisition and tuning (Smadja 1991a; Zernik and Jacobs 1991; Brent 1991; as well as Grishman and Sterling 1992).

Later work by Veronis and Ide (1991), Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder (1990), and Wilks et aL (1992) provides us with a number of techniques for transfering information from MRDs to a representation language such as that described in the previous section.

Church and Hanks 1990; Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder 1990; Wilks et al.1993; Smadja 1991a, 1991b; Calzolari and Bindi 1990).
C90-3010 J90-1003 P91-1036
Previous work by Amsler (1980), Calzolari (1984), Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn (1985), Byrd et al.(1987), Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens (1986), and Nakamura and Nagao (1988) showed that taxonomic information and certain semantic relations can be extracted from MRDs using fairly simple techniques.

Using techniques described in Church and Hindle (1990), Church and Hanks (1990), and Hindle and Rooth (1991), Figure 4 shows some examples of the most frequent V-O pairs from the AP corpus.
J90-1003 P90-1034 P91-1030
In Pustejovsky (1991) it was argued that in such cases, the verb need not have multiple subcategorizations, but only one deep semantic type, in this case, an event.

Evans and Gazdar 1990; Copestake and Briscoe 1992; Russell et al.1992). In Pustejovsky (1991) it is suggested that there are two types of relational structures for lexical knowledge; a fixed inheritance similar to that of an is-a hierarchy (cf.
J91-4003 J92-3003
To test whether the intuitions supported by the above data could be confirmed in corpora, Bergler (1991) derived the statistical co-occurrence of insist with discourse polarity markers in the 7 million-word corpus of Wall Street Journal articles.

This process and the corpus tuning for both argument typing and subcategorization acquisition are described in Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky (1992) and Pustejovsky et al.(1992). In summary, based on a theory of lexical semantics, we have discussed how an MRD can be useful as a corpus for automatically seeding lexical structures.
H92-1047
As argued in Pustejovsky (1991) and Miller and Fellbaum (1991), such simple oppositional predicates form a central part of our lexicalization of concepts.
J91-4003
In a careful study of seven reporting verbs on a 250,000-word corpus of Time magazine articles from 1963, we found that the preference for different metonymic extensions varies considerably within this field (Bergler 1991).
E91-1038
We will assume, for this paper, the general framework of a generative lexicon as outlined in Pustejovsky (1991).
J91-4003
We have found, however, that collocational evidence can be employed to suggest which noun compounds reflect taxonomic relationships, using a strategy similar to that employed by Hindle (1990) for detecting synonyms.

(cf. Cowie, Guthrie, and Pustejovsky \[1992\] for details of this operation on LDOCE.): 11 cigarette(x) CONST = tobacco(y),shredded(y),paper(z) FOaMAL = roll(x) TELIC = smoke(T,w,x) AGENTIVE = artifact(x) In a related set of experiments performed while constructing a large lexical database for data extraction purposes, we seeded a lexicon with 6000 verbs from LDOCE.
H92-1047
Hindle (1990) reports interesting results of this kind based on literal collocations, where he parses the corpus (Hindle 1983) into predicate-argument structures and applies a mutual information measure (Fano 1961; Magerman and Marcus 1990) to weigh the association between the predicate and each of its arguments.
P83-1019 P90-1034
is reflected in the sublanguage work of Grishman, Hirschman, and Nhan (1986), whose automated discovery procedures are aimed at clustering nouns into categories like diagnosis and symptom.
