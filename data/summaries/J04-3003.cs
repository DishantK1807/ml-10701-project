Many such classifications of transitions have been proposed; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) distinguish among three types of transitions, depending on whether the backward-looking center of U i−1 is maintained or not in U i and on whether CB(U i ) is also the most highly ranked entity (CP) of U i : Center Continuation (CON): CB(U i ) = CB(U i−1 ), and CB(U i ) is the most highly ranked CF (CP) of U i (i.e., CP(U i ) = CB(U i )) Center Retaining (RET): CB(U i ) = CB(U i−1 ), but CP(U i ) negationslash= CB(U i ) Center Shifting (SHIFT): CB(U i−1 ) negationslash= CB(U i ) We will consider a few alternative classification schemes below, after discussing how these classifications are used to formulate one of the core claims of centering, Rule 2.

47 The discrepancy between pronominalization and CB-hood in our corpus is analyzed in more detail by Henschel, Cheng, and Poesio (2000), who propose an algorithm for pronominalization that takes into account factors such as the presence of distractors matching the CB’s agreement features that may lead to the decision not to pronominalize, as well as factors that may result in the pronominalization of a non-CB.

to Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998a), in the original version of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995), which appeared in 1986, Grosz et al.provided a more explicit definition of realization: An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U.
J86-3001 J95-2003
(Also, knowing the extent to which real texts conform to centering preferences is an important goal in its own right.) In previous corpus-based studies of centering (Walker 1989; Passonneau 1993; Byron and Stent 1998; Di Eugenio 1998; Kameyama 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999; Tetreault 2001), only a few instantiations of centering were compared.
J01-4003 J99-3001 P89-1031 P98-2241
We also saw that in languages such as Italian, Japanese, and Turkish, the preferred realizations of CBs are morphologically null elements (Kameyama 1986; Walker, Iida, Cote 1994; Turan 1998; Di Eugenio 1998).
J94-2003 P86-1031
Information structure has also been found not to be appropriate for languages including Greek, Hindi, and Turkish (Turan 1998; Prasad and Strube 2000; Miltsakaki 2002).

Replacing GFTHERELIN with the ranking function proposed by Strube and Hahn (1999) (henceforth, STRUBE-HAHN): rank hearer-old entities more highly than inferrables, and these higher than hearer-old entities—cannot and did not lead to different results for Strong C1, for the reasons already discussed for linear-order ranking.
J99-3001
Specifically, Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) claim that subjects are ranked more highly than objects, which are ranked more highly than other grammatical positions: SUBJ ≺ OBJ ≺ OTHERS (see also Kameyama 1986; Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell 1986).

319 Poesio et al.Centering: A Parametric Theory Nevertheless, most versions of the theory developed since Kameyama (1985, 1986) and Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) have assumed that grammatical function plays the main role in determining the order among forward-looking centers, at least for English.
J86-3001 P86-1031
Most researchers working on centering, including Grosz et al., assume that several factors play a role in determining the relative ranking of forwardlooking centers; in fact, Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998a) claim that the factors affecting ranking may not be the same in all languages.

Ideas from centering, and in particular Rule 2, are increasingly found useful in text planning (McKeown 1985; Kibble and Power 2000; Knott et al.2001; Karamanis 2003).

Kameyama proposed that the local focus be updated after every tensed clause, not after every sentence, and classified tensed clauses into (1) utterances that constitute a “permanent” update of the local focus, such as coordinated clauses and adjuncts, and (2) embedded utterances that result in temporary updates that are then “popped”, much as the information introduced into discourse by subordinated discourse segments is popped according to Grosz and Sidner (1986).
J86-3001
Vanilla Instantiation What we call the “vanilla instantiation” is not an instantiation actually proposed in the literature, but an attempt to come as close as possible to a “mainstream” instantiation of centering by blending proposals from Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) and Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) and incorporating additional suggestions from Kameyama (1998) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998a).
J95-2003 P87-1022
Unfortunately, discourse segments are difficult to identify reliably (Passonneau and Litman 1993), and Grosz and Sidner (1986) do not provide a specification of discourse intentions explicit enough that it can be used to identify the intentional structure of texts—which, according to Grosz and Sidner, determines their segmentation.
J86-3001
The version of Rule 2 presented in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) expresses preferences among sequences of transitions (e.g., CON-CON over SHIFT-SHIFT) rather than preferences for particular transitions.
J95-2003
Other classifications and versions of the rule do not correlate much better with the observed frequencies: For example, only 39% of entity-coherent transitions (139 out of 357), and 14% of the total, are cheap in the sense of Strube and Hahn (1999) (i.e., CP(U n−1 ) predicts CB(U n )).
J99-3001
Obviously, it can’t be done by directly annotating “utterances” or “CB” according to one way of fixing the parameters, as has been done in most previous studies of centering theory (Byron and Stent 1998; Di Eugenio 1998; Kameyama 1998; Passonneau 1993; Walker 1989).
P89-1031 P93-1010 P98-2241
However, previous attempts at marking anaphoric information, particularly in the context of the MUC initiative, suggested that while it’s fairly easy to achieve agreement on identity relations, marking up associative relations is quite hard; this was confirmed by studies such as Poesio and Vieira (1998).
J98-2001
However, a semicontrolled study by Suri and McCoy (1994) suggested that other types of clauses—specifically, adjunct clauses headed by after and before–are also “embedded,” not “permanent updates” as suggested by Kameyama; these results were subsequently confirmed by Cooreman and Sanford (1996).

In order to formalize their view, they propose a different classification scheme, based on the distinction between cheap and expensive transitions (Strube and Hahn 1999, page 332): • A transition pair is cheap if the CB of the current utterance is correctly predicted by the CP of the previous utterance, that is, if CB(U n )= CP(U n−1 ).

Although some of these schemes, like DRAMA, allow the marking of associative relations, none of them analyze which among such relations can be reliably annotated (Poesio, Bruneseaux, and Romary 1999; Poesio 2000).

The vanilla instantiation is based on the definition of CB from Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) and uses grammatical function for ranking, as proposed there and in Brennan, Friedman, Pollard (1987).

As with this instantiation only 35% of utterances are continuous—that is, CF(U n ) ∩ CF(U n−1 ) negationslash= ∅ (Kibble 2000; Karamanis 2001)—only the weak version of Constraint 1 is verified.
J01-4007 W00-1411
Slightly different ranking functions based on grammatical function were proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) (who made a further distinction between objects and indirect objects), by Walker, Iida, Cote (1994) for Japanese, and by Turan (1998) for Turkish.
J94-2003 P87-1022
Competing versions of the central definitions and claims of the theory have also been proposed: For example, different definitions of backward-looking center (CB) can be found in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1995) and Gordon, Grosz, and Gillion (1993).

These results can be further strengthened by making one last change to the parameters: adopting the ranking function proposed by Strube and Hahn (1999) instead of GFTHERELIN.

The semantic problems with these schemes include the inappropriate use of the term coreference to cover semantic relations such as that between an intensional entity like the temperature that may take different values at different time points and these values (as in the price of aluminum siding rose from $3.85 to $4.02) or between a quantifier and a variable the quantifier binds, in which neither may corefer (as in none of the meetings resulted in an agreement between its participants (van Deemter and Kibble 2000; Poesio 2004).

The claims about pronominalization made in centering have been applied to develop algorithms both for anaphora resolution (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Strube and Hahn 1999; Tetreault 2001) and for sentence planning (Dale 1992; Henschel, Cheng, and Poesio 2000); this work can be viewed as providing an evaluation of claims such as Rule 1.

A few preliminary observations can be found in Hitzeman and Poesio (1998).

One clear result of this work is that centering’s claims about pronominalization—at least, those expressed by the versions of Rule 1 proposed in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995, 1983)–are very robust.

50 The version of Rule 2 from Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995), formulated in terms of sequences and stating a preference for sequences of CON over sequences of RET over sequences of SHIFT (which we tested by counting the number of sequence pairs), suffers from the problem that even with the “best” instantiations, fewer than one-third of sequence pairs involve the same transition, and even fewer are sequences of the transitions considered by Grosz et al.Even in the instantiation which yields the best results for Rule 2 (BFP), IS with STRUBE-HAHN ranking, only 13% of sequence pairs are of the form CON-CON/RET-RET/SH-SH, and altogether only 28% of sequence pairs involve only transitions considered by Grosz et al.Keeping in mind that Rule 2 (GJW 95) applies only to a minority of sequence pairs, we do find that with IS and STRUBE-HAHN ranking, the number of CON-CON sequences (37) slightly exceeds the number of RETRET (35), which in turn exceeds the number of SH-SH (19, of which 16 are RSH-RSH).

314 Computational Linguistics Volume 30, Number 3 2.3 Main Claims In the words of Grosz et al., the most fundamental claim of centering is that “to the extent that discourse adheres to centering constraints, its coherence will increase and the inference load placed upon the hearer will decrease” (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995, page 210).
J95-2003
Within the centering literature, abandoning the claim that we call “CB uniqueness” has been suggested by Gundel (1998) and, more radically, in work such as Strube (1998), Gordon and Hendrick (1999), and Tetreault (2001) in which the whole notion of CB is abandoned.
J01-4003 J99-3001 P98-2204
This view contrasts both with Sidner’s (1979) hypothesis that utterances may have two “topics” and with theories such as Givon (1983), Alshawi (1987), Lappin and Leass (1994) and Arnold (1998), which view “topichood” as a matter of degree and therefore allow for an arbitrary number of topics.
J94-4002
Our instructions for identifying NP markables derive from those proposed in the MATE scheme for annotating anaphoric relations (Poesio, Bruneseaux, and Romary 1999), in turn derived from DRAMA (Passonneau 1997) and MUC-7 (Chinchor and Sundheim 1995).
W99-0309
According to Grosz and Sidner (1986), centering is meant to capture preferences only within discourse segments.
J86-3001
This feature of the theory has inspired a great deal of research attempting to specify centering’s parameters for different languages (Kameyama 1985; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Di Eugenio 1998; Turan 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999).
J94-2003 J99-3001
The proponents of centering have clearly stated that the aim of the theory is to identify preferences that make discourses easier to process; clearly, the best way to test such preferences is through behavioral experiments, and many aspects of the theory have in fact been tested this way (Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell 1986; Gordon, Grosz, and Gillion 1993; Brennan 1995).
J95-2003
Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) argued that these utterances should be classified as Center Continuations, the idea being that even the first utterance of a segment does have a CB, but this CB is initially underspecified and is determined only when the second utterance is processed.
J94-2003
There is quite a lot of psychological support for at least the part of this claim stating that entities realized as subjects are more salient than entities realized in other grammatical functions (Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell 1986; Gordon, Grosz, and Gillion 1993; Brennan 1995; Hudson-D’Zmura and Tanenhaus 1998).

Conversely, before taking the evidence for a slight advantage of STRUBE-HAHN ranking over grammatical-function ranking as conclusive, one needs to supplement our studies with psychological experiments reconciling these results with numerous results indicating the important role played by grammatical function, especially subjecthood (among others, Hudson, Tanenhaus, and Dell [1986]; Gordon, Grosz, and Gillion [1993]; Brennan [1995]).

As discussed in Section 2, Suri and McCoy (1994) suggested that afterand before-clauses behave more like embedding elements (i.e., like complements) than like coordinating ones, and Cooreman and Sanford (1996) found evidence supporting this treatment for when clauses, as well.

The previous corpus-based investigations of centering theory we are aware of (Walker 1989; Passonneau 1993, 1998; Byron and Stent 1998; Di Eugenio 1998; Hurewitz 1998; Kameyama 1998; Strube and Hahn 1999) were all carried out by a single annotator annotating her or his corpus according to her or his own subjective judgment.

(2004) argues—correctly, in our opinion—that in one of the best-known pronoun resolution algorithms based on centering, that proposed by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), Rule 1 is effectively used as a hard constraint, a problem fixed by Beaver’s own optimality-theoretic reformulation of the algorithm.
P87-1022
Other researchers argue instead that the inferential load is evaluated utterance by utterance (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994; Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998a).

In the extended technical report available on the Web site, we discuss the results with other segmentation heuristics, as well as further results with the tutorial dialogues subdomain of the GNOME corpus, independently annotated according to relational discourse analysis (Moser and Moore 1996), a technique inspired by Grosz and Sidner’s proposals, from which a Grosz and Sidner–like segmentation was extracted as proposed in Poesio and Di Eugenio (2001).

For more details, we refer the reader to classic references such as Grosz, Johsi, and Weinstein (1995) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998b) or the discussion of centering in Poesio and Stevenson (forthcoming).
J95-2003
For this reason, most previous corpus-based studies of centering either ignored segmentation or used heuristics such as those proposed by Walker (1989): Consider every paragraph as a separate discourse segment, except when its first sentence contains a pronoun in subject position or a pronoun whose agreement features are not 18 In previous work (Poesio and Vieira 1998) we came to the conclusion that kappa, while appropriate when the number of categories is fixed and relatively small, is problematic for anaphoric reference, when neither condition applies, and may result in inflated values of agreement.
J98-2001 P89-1031
We do find that 219 utterances, the majority (61.3%) of entity-coherent ones, are “salient” in the sense of Kibble (2001)—that is, their CB is the same as their CP.
J01-4007
Although in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983), the CB was characterized only in intuitive terms, most subsequent work has been based on the definition below (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), referred to as “Constraint 3” by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987): Constraint 3 CB(U i ), the backward-looking center of utterance U i, is the highestranked element of CF(U i−1 ) that is realized in U i. Notice that according to this definition, the computation of the CB depends exclusively on ranking and “previous utterance,” making these parameters crucially important for the framework.

An issue that has been raised in the centering literature (e.g., Walker 1993; Di Eugenio 1998; Byron and Stent 1998) is whether the CF list contains only entities realized as third-person noun phrases (NPs), or also the entities realized as firstand second-person NPs.
P98-2241
The researchers working on centering argue that while these concepts play a central role in any theory of discourse coherence and salience, their precise characterization is best left for subsequent research, indeed, that some of these concepts (e.g., ranking) might be defined in a different way for each language (Walker, Iida, and Cote 1994).
