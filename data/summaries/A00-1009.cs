Our work extends directions taken in systems such as Ariane (Vauquois and Boitet, 1985), FoG (Kittredge and Polgu6re, 1991), JOYCE (Rainbow and Korelsky, 1992), and LFS (Iordanskaja et al., 1992).

So far the framework has been used successfully for building a wide variety of applications in different domains and for different languages: NLG:  Realization of English DSyntSs via SSyntS level for the domains of meteorology (MeteoCogent; Kittredge and Lavoie, 1998) and object modeling (ModelExplainer; Lavoie et al., 1997).

Figure 2 illustrates a DSyntS from a meteorological application, MeteoCogent (Kittredge and Lavoie, 1998), represented using the standard graphical notation and also the RealPro ASCII notation used internally in the framework (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).

The formalism could be extended to handle intrasentential syntactic effects, but inter-sentential discourse phenomena probably require procedural rules in order to access lexemes in The framework represents a generalization of several predecessor NLG systems based on Meaning-Text Theory: FoG (Kittredge and Polgu~re, 1991), LFS (Iordanskaja et al., 1992), and JOYCE (Rambow and Korelsky, 1992).
