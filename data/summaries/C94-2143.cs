algorithms allowing data-structure sharing (DSS unification algorithms) are based on two approaches: the Boyer and Moore approach, which was originally developed for term unification in theorem-proving (Boyer & Moore, 1972) and was adopted by Pereira (1985); and the lazy copying suggested by Karttnnen ~nd Kay (1985).

an idea similar to Karttunen's, Tomabechi (1991) proposed a quasi-destructive unification that uses node structures with fields for keeping update information that survives only during the unification process.
P91-1041
Recent lazy copying unification algorithms are based on Wroblewski's or Tomabeehi's schema: Godden (1990) proposed a unification algorithm that uses active data structures, Kogure (1990) proposed a lazy incremental copy graph (LING) unification that uses dependency-directed eol)yiug, and Emeie (1991) proposed a lazy-incremental copying (LIC) unification that uses chronological dereference.

To distinguish structure sharing at the implementation level fl'om that at the logical lew'l (that is, coreference relations between feature-addresses), the lbrmer is called data-structure sharing and the latter is called feature-structure sharing (Tomabechi, 1992).

These algorithms are b0,sed on Wroblewski's algorithm, and Tomabechi (1992) has proposed a data-structure-sharing version of his quasi-destructive unification.

A more eNcient unification algorithm would avoid this redundant copying (copying structures that can be shared by the input and resultant graphs) (Kogure, 1990).

Unification algorithms developed so far, however, including those allowing structure sharing seem to 1For example, the TASL1NK natural language system uses 80% of the processing time for feature structure unification and other computations required by unification, i.e., feature structure pre-copying (Godden, 1990).
