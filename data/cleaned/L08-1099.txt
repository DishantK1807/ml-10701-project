<context>omehow related to human language. We have been working on a domain ontology called language service ontology that can serve as a common ground for describing elements of a composite language service (Hayashi et al., 2008). As access functionalities to a range of lexical resources, or lexicons, are considerably important in composing a useful composite language service, we need to have a proper sub-ontology for stipul</context>
<context>that in an open environment, should be ontology-based. Figure 1: Top-level of the Language Service Ontology Figure 1 3 illustrates the top-level of the language service ontology that was proposed in (Hayashi et al., 2008) with respect to the Language Grid infrastructure. Each box in the figure denotes a top-level class or concept in the ontology. As depicted in the figure, LanguageService is providedBy LanguageProces</context>
