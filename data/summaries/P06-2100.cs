They are typically free-word ordered, which causes xed-context systems to be hardly adequate for statistical approaches (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997).

The common choice for disambiguation rule learning in POS tagging task is usually machine learning techniques mainly focussing on decision tree based algorithms (Orphanos and Christodoulalds, 1999), neural networks (Schmid, 1994), etc.

Morphology-based POS tagging of some languages like Turkish (O azer and Kuruoz, 1994), Arabic (Guiassa, 2006), Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), Modern Greek (Orphanos et al., 1999) and Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) has been tried out using a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical learning.

For English there are many POS taggers, employing machine learning techniques like transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), markov model (Cutting et al.1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc.

Similar observation has been presented by Uchimoto et al.(2001) for Japanese language.
