(Worline 1956: 1) Rhetorically speaking, sentence (b) interrupts a sequence of events described in (a) (= DS1) to start DS2, a description, fit order to recognize this rhetorical relation between the two DSs, it is necessary to recognize that: (1) there is a shift of topic; (2) there is a shift in perceptual modality to visuai perception; (3) there is a shift in time scale,from the events of the cun'ent day to years or decades, associated with the lifetime of a windmill and the 'where they lived' clause; (4) there is shift in Sl~tial scale from a household to the entire prairie; (5) there is a shift from a foregrounded sequence of events to the "mopping-up" operation of filling in the background; the shift is signaled by aspectual changes (Hopper 1978; Nakhimovsky 1987b, 1988); and (6) the foregrounded sequence of events includes two telic processes (walking fi'om rite house to the windmill; fixing the broken part) whose beginnings or preconditions are explicitly mentioned but whose terminal points are still in the future relative to the Temporal Focus; this sets up expectations for the reader.

As argued in Nakhimovsky (1987b), some features of their model (a stack mechanism for attentional state, the prom~ inenee of pragmatic notions such as the speaker's intentions) make it more appropriate for conversation rather than na~cative~ Webber (1988) and Naidlimovsky (1988) suggest a model in which the distinction between the top and the rest of die stack is replaced by the distinction between a sh~nt~tel'm memory and the ESS.

Most such heuristics found in the iitera~ ture are syntactical in nature, relying, in almost Eliza-like fashion, on clue words and phrases (see references in Grosz & Sidner 1986: 177).
