Given a set of features and some training data, the M.E. estimation process produces a model, which is represented as follows (Berger et al., 1996; Ristad, 1997; Ristad, 1998): P(f|h)= producttext i α g i (h,f) i Z λ (h) (2) Z λ (h)= summationdisplay f productdisplay i α g i (h,f) i. (3) We define a model which estimates the likelihood that a given string is a morpheme and has the grammatical attribute i(1 ≤ i ≤ n)asa morpheme model.

One is to find unknown words from corpora and put them into a dictionary (e.g., (Mori and Nagao, 1996)), and the other is to estimate a model that can identify unknown words correctly (e.g., (Kashioka et al., 1997; Nagata, 1999)).
