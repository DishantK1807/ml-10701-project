The standard approach is to assign this responsibility to the parsing algorithm, whether the grammar is based on standard context-free formalisms (Roark, 2001), on generative syntactic theories based on a context-free backbone (Crocker, 1992), or on categorial approaches, like e.g.

In fact, in the case of Roark (2001), the method to reduce this problem has been to use underspeci cation in the right part of the cf rules.

The combinatorial explosion seen in the two experiments suggests the use of underspeci cation techniques before applying DVTAG in a realistic setting (see Roark (2001) for one method applied to Context Free Grammar).
