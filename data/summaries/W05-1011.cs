Context extraction begins with a Maximum Entropy POS tagger and chunker (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).

Curran and Moens (2002b) have demonstrated that dramatically increasing the quantity of text used to extract contexts significantly improves synonym quality.

These problems include collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), smoothing and estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir, 2001) and question answering (Pasca and Harabagiu, 2001).

Curran and Moens (2002a) propose an initial heuristic comparison to reduce the number of full O(m) vector comparisons.

Similarity measurements made against these low frequency terms are less reliable, as accuracy increases with the number of relations and their frequencies (Curran and Moens, 2002b).

The same 70 single-word nouns were used for the evaluation as in Curran and Moens (2002a).

For these experiments we use the JACCARD (1) measure and the TTEST (2) weight, as Curran and Moens (2002a) found them to have the best performance in their comparison of many distance measures.

The Grefenstette (1994) relation extractor produces context relations that are then lemmatised using the Minnen et al.(2000) morphological analyser.
