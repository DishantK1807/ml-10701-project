Those authors report that this is not space efficient if transformation learning is done by independently testing all possible transformations in the search space (as in (Brill, 1995)).

An ordered sequence of transformations can be learned by iteratively learning a single transformation and by processing the aligned corpus with the transformation just learned (Brill, 1995).
J95-4004
In (Brill, 1995) a learning paradigm, called errordriven learning, has been introduced for automatic induction of a specific kind of rewriting rules called transformations, and it has been shown that the achieved accuracy of the resulting transformation systems is competitive with that of existing systems.

edu Abstract String transformation systems have been introduced in (Brill, 1995) and have several applications in natural language processing.
J95-4004
Ordered sequences of rewriting rules are used in several applications in natural language processing, including phonological and morphological systems (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), morphological disambiguation, part-of-speech tagging and shallow syntactic parsing (Brill, 1995), (Karlsson et ah, 1995).

Other than transformation based systems the methods presented in this paper can be used for learning rules of constraint grammars (Karlsson et al., 1995), phonological rule systems as in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), and in general those grammatical systems using constraints represented by means of rewriting rules.

learning paradigm The learning paradigm we adopt is called errordriven learning and has been originally proposed in (Brill, 1995) for part of speech tagging applications.
