4 Self-tuning 4.1 Grammar and baseline The experiments on the self-tuning approach were carried out with a computational grammar for Portuguese developed with the LKB platform (Copestake, 2002) that uses MRS for semantic representation (Copestake et al., 2001) (Branco and Costa, 2005).
P01-1019
An algebra for MRS was defined by Copestake et al.(2001) (henceforth CLF) and forms the starting point for the work reported here.

79 7 Related work Bos et al.(2004) and Bos (2005) derive semantic interpretations from a wide-coverage categorial grammar.

Ruth Fuchss, Alexander Koller, Joachim Niehren, and Stefan Thater 2004.
P04-1032
For example, Fuchss et al.(2004) formally show that the translation from MRS to Dominance Constraints is feasible.
P04-1032
Useful properties concerning monotonicity and scope (see Fuchss et al.(2004)) are thus guaranteed for a range of grammars.
