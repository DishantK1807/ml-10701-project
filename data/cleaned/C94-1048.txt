flY", and "&}i~" (jinshu : human race) as their respective equivalencies.
Since ".&~i\[(" has notl,ing to do with "~(/,'", race is excluded.
We call this inethod of looking up ECs in the inverse dictionaries when choosing relevant equivalencies inverse consultation, and we call the words obtained by looking up inverse dictionaries the selection area (SA).
Inverse consultation utilizes the.
structure of dictionaries to measure the nearness of the meanings of words in (tiff>rent languages.
The simplest application of inverse consultation is to use Dic~_,~.
In the above example, each EC is looked up in Dict_,e and the results are compared with the English equivalencies of ")~'6"" (E); namely, competition, contest, and race.
The SA of eompdtitlon is competition, contest and match, which have tile elements contest and competition in common with E (Fig.
2). As compdtition derived from competition, competition should be put aside, but contest is still left as a common element and thus compdtition is selected as an equivalence of '"~(P"'.
As for race, the SA of race consists of race and ancestry, whose intersection with E only gives race; so race is judged as an inadequate EC.
In shorl;, the number of elements in common between the selection area and E indicates the nearness of the meaning between the EC and the original word.
For the inverse consultation (lmseril)ed above, the SA was in English.
If we use Dice~j as an inverse dictionary successively afl;er consult> ing Dic~-.e, then the SA is in Japanese an(1 we ~f\[' with the SA (Fig.

There can be a infinit.e number of inverse (:onsultations according to the nmnber of (:onsulte(1 inverse (tietionaries.
If the inverse dictionaries arc consulted 'n times, we call the method n ti'mes inverse cons'ultation.
(/C',,).
Which inverse di(:tionary to use.
does not always have a unique answer.
For IC2 for example, we ntay consulU Di%_** af ter consulting Dicf.-.e with the SA in French.
2.2 Selection
Procedure Once the SA tbr a give.n woM is obtained, equivMencies are selected by handling two collections of words.
We (:all this process the selection p'roced.ure.
One way to do this is to count the mnnber of specific element:s in the SA.
For example, if the SA is in Japanesc', the number of l.he element ""~¢~d @"' itself is counted.
Another way is to count how many parts of words (PWs) are eontMnmd in the SA.
" ~a and "¢6" \[ or exaulple, the number o\[' ""'~:" contained in the SA is considered (thus "" .....
~ in "~j~'~" iS ;dSO collnl;ed).
If we handle the meaning of words, a third way .v)¢.~ ~ in ;t Japalmse Lhesaurns an(1 is to look up ' *'~-" COllar how nlal\]y times the synottynls ai)i)ear in the $A.
For exanq)le, il',.
is a synonym or .,%,k ~", ~)t.)',, then the numl)e.r of at)i)ear:mces of "~j~ ~( ~'lfi: z" I ~}:" is added to that of ~,g ~ . If we go further to h;mdle the meaning, we might as well process words by semantic processing.
Since a kanji is an ideogram, the second method also handles the meaning.
When 1;11o s(,qection area is in English or l"rench, the eorresi)on(ting me.tlm(1 is to count morphemes such as "inl;er" and "national" for the word "int0.rnationar'.
W(; are interested in to what extent the method that does not (;xplicitly concern the meaning may be used to handle the me,ruing of words, lln |;11(; for lowing, we.
focus on 1;11(; former two inethods.
29B 3 Fundamental Concepts 3.1.
Harmonized Dictionary A bilingual dictionary forms a grN)h whose nodes are words and whose })ranches are correspondences between the words.
Branchc's haw; directions, which make the graph asymmetric.
D:ic.,(1,g is a graph with all the tn'anches in Dic> 'v in inverse direction.
Since the purpose of bilingual dictionaries is to denote the correspondences of words that have the same meaning \[tIar83\], it; is Iud.ura\] that branches ~re bidirectional.
We t;herefore design symmetrical dictionaries and we denote, a di(:tionary from hmguage :c to y as D .... u,calling it; ;t harmonized dictiona'uI.
When D,._,,/and D:j,~, are construc~;e(1 fi'om the same dictionaries, D!t.**=: DTly holds.
We remove the overlaps of branches.
3.2 Syntactic
Selection Procedure A multiset here is a set in which each element: has :~ weight that is a m~tural nmnl)er.
The weighl; of ml element is defined as the nmnl)er of times it appears when looking up words in dietiomwies.
In the example shown in Fig.
3, the nmltiset SA ~\[(' with weighl; 2 for eompdtition ('onsists of "~"~ .... and ")j~J,hi" with weight 3.
We denote the.
weight: of eh;nlent x in multiset X as ba(X,x); for instance, 5~(SA, ~e)~-Tf~**~ ) = 2.
Using the same notation, 5a(X, Y) is defined as ibllows when X and Y are multisets: ~'a(X, Y) = ~ 5a(X, .,) yCl / When a multiset Z consists of",,,.,,:zw)~.)q ...... and ma~z,~'~"" the.n G(SA, Z) = 5.
The nol;;tl;ion ~b(X, X) represents the sum of the weights of the elements that contain PWs of :c in Inultiset X.
For instance., if PWs are defined as k~mji, 5 / .....
~a, bLot*,~.~q) is 7 by adding 5 (sum of weights of elements in the SA that have kmt}i "~") ~ul(l 2 (SlllII Of weights of elemenl:s ht I.he SA that have kanji "q"").
Using ~lw.
same notal;ion, 5a(X,Y) is defined as fi)llows when X ~md Y are multisets: eb(X,V) :: ~ eb(X,v) y~Y For instance, 5b(SA, Z) = 12; that is 7 plus 5 (=~b(SA,'~)).We,,se the .,,t~|:i,,,, ~ .s ~ >ramet;er for ~a or ~5 b.

Dj ~o = De-lj 1 De-.f = Dic~eU Dico-~f Df-~e = Do._.+ f Although there are other ways to symmetrize dictionaries, (for example, by removing all branches that are not bidirectional), we chose the above procedm:es for the lexieographical reason described below \[IlarS3\].
There are two kinds of bilingual dictionaries, one is from,~ foreign language (f) to the nmther language (Die/ .....
), and tile other is fi'om a mother language \[m) to a foreign language (Diem_,/).
In Dic/ ...... when there are no equivaleneies in m for a foreign word, the dictionary gives its definition or explam~tion of the word in m.
Therefore, all the foreign words can be contained in the dictionary.
In Dic,r>~f on tl,e other hand, if there are no equivalencies in f for a word of m, the word itself is often dropped fl'om the dictionary.
The words contained in the dictionary are therefbre a part of m, and Dic ....... f lacks many entries.
A harmonized dictionary is a solution t;o this problem because it contains equiwdenc, ies of Dicf_.,~ as entries of Diem--,\]'.
4.2 Procedure
of Inverse Consultation lh'om Property 1, we use 5a wi~h IC1 and we use 5b with IC'2.
The PW for 5b are defined as for lows: • Japanese 6353 kanjis.
• French morphemes \[Mauaa\].
1151 prefix and 710 suffix.
ih'om Property 2, inverse consultation is applied to both Japanese and French entries, and then tile results are put together to construct a harmonized dictionary.
We denote it as Dj~t or Df_+j.
Each entry within Dj-+e and Dt--,e is classified into one of five types according to the procedure used to select its equivaleneies from ECs.
• Type A A single EC exists and is selected unconditionally as the eqnivalence.
• Type 13 Equiwdeneies 1)y \[CI exist; all are selected and the rest of the ECs are discarded.
• Type C There are no equivalencies by ICt but there are by \[C.2 . One third (empirically decided) of ECs by 1C2 arc' selected according to the wdue of the following fl'action (larger ones are seleet:ed): Value of flmction 5b SA (byte) • Type D No equivahmeies by ICt nor by IC'2 appeared but there are several ECs.
For this entry, it is impossible to select the relewmt equivalencies.
• Type E There are no ECs.
Entries of Type A acquire more appropri~te equivalencies than do entries of Type B, and entries of Type B acquire more appropri~d;e equiw> lencies t;han do entries of Type C.

On the other hand, since the direct translation of distlque in the published dictionary adopts the concept of French imems, it is uncommon and cannot be mttlerstoo(1 \])y iilOSl; Japanese readers.
The same is true for boulier except that the commml Japanese is indicated in a published dictionary.
Pull is borrowed front the English word pull-over whose direct translation is contained in a published dictionary, and it is not a common word in Japanese.
In the first example in Table 6, grive is the generic name equivalent to th rush, whereas merle is a kind of thrush.
The second example shows that more equivalencies are found in Dj_d.
To sum up, the resulting dictionary can be utilized in conjunction with the published (tictionaries as follows: • To revise the equiwdeneies.
• To supplement the equivaleneies.
Sections of the resulting dictionaries is listed in Table 7.
List 1 is Dj_~, and List 2 is D,+j.
For each list, entrie.s arc in t;he first row and their equiwdeneies are in the third row.
Symbols in the.
second row indicate how approI/riate each equivalence is.
(Refer to t, he notes beside).

Work The use of a third hmguage English as an intermediary in the construction of a bilingual diet:to-nary was test;ed manually on a large scale on c(liting the Spanish-Japanese (lictionary \[Kuwg0\].
It is now a representative middle-sized dictionary having a large quantity of informal;ion.
Toktmaga and Tanaka \[Tok90\] tried t;o extract; a eonceI)tual dictionary fi'om Japanese-English and English-Japanese dictionaries.
Although they used a concept similar to ours that is the graph structure of a dictionaryrelate(\[ to meaning of words, their t?ameworks and final product differ frolil ollrs.
7 Conclusion
and Future Works The i)rol)osed method for using a intermediate hmguage to construct a l)ilingu:d dictionary utilizes the structure of dictionaries and morphemes and can choose appropriate equiwdencies for most, entries.
Comi)aring the resulting dictionary with publishe(l dictionaries showed that tiara obtained are usefltl for revising and sUi)l)lementing t.he vocabulary of existing dictionaires.
To increase the accuracy with which eqnivah',ncie.s can be selected, mistakes in word-to-word dictionaries must t)e corrected even if' our method may detect aI)i)ropri:~te equiwdeneies.
One way to do this would be t.o use thesaurus to cheek whether the extracted eorresi)ondences are relewmt.
Nouns were l;akeu into consideration in tiffs research, and the next ste I) will be to apply the proposed method to other parts of speech.
We also need to estat/lish a way to handle compom~d words in European languages.
