There is reason to hope that this will often be the case; while disjunction may be widespread in grammar rules and texical entries, Kasper (1987) observes that in his implementation, "in the analysis of a particular sentence most fieatures have a unique value, and some features are not present at, all.
P87-1033
Unification time here is order n lo,q n in the sizes n of the input structures (Kasper, 1987).

This variation of the algorithm given in Kasper (1987) is closer t.o Propane's strategy, b~H.
P87-1033
Kasper (1987) describes a teelmique which, lbr every set of ',~ conjoined disjt,p.ctions, checks the:, con:;~stcncy first of single disjuncls against the delinite part of the description.
P87-1033
The general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of disjunctions (Kasper, 1987).
