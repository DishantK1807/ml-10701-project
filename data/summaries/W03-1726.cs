A bottom-up merging algorithm was proposed in (Ma & Chen 2003), which utilizes hybrid statistical and linguistic information to extract unknown words effectively.

The detection process detects possible occurrences of unknown words (Chen & Bai 1998), so that deeper morphological analysis is carried out only at the places where unknown word morphemes were detected (Chen & Ma 2002).

After that, we were paying more attention on the problems of extracting and identifying unknown words (Chen et.al 1997, Chen & Bai 1998, Chen & Ma 2002, Tseng & Chen 2002, Ma & Chen 2003).

In (Chen & Liu 1992), if an ambiguous segmentation does occur, the matching algorithm looks ahead two more words, and the disambiguation rules for those three word chunks is applied afterward.

Our earlier work mainly focused on the resolving of segmentation ambiguities and using regular expressions to handle the determinantmeasure and reduplication compounds (Chen & Liu 1992, Chen 1999).

We adopt a bottom-up merging algorithm (Ma & Chen 2003), which utilizes hybrid statistical and linguistic information, to extract unknown words.

Therefore, we (Chen et.al 1997, Tseng & Chen 2002) use association strength between morphemes and syntactic categories to predict the category of a new word.
