The system under evaluation here is based on language processing components that have demonstrated strong performance capabilities in previous evaluation s [Lehnert et al . 1992a] . Having demonstrated the general viability of these techniques, we are no w concentrating on the practicality of our technology by creating trainable system components to replac e hand-coded data and manually-engineered software.

We employ a hybrid system architecture that combines selective concept extraction [Lehnert 1991] technologies developed at UMass with trainable classifier technologies develope d at Hughes [Dolan et al . 1991].

Although our upstream components were operating reasonably well, additional feedback cycles were badly needed for other components operating downstream . In particular, trainable coreference and trainable template generation did not received the time and attention they deserve . We are generally encouraged by the success of our trainable components for part-of-speech tagging, dictionary generation, noun phrase analysis, semantic feature tagging, and coreference based on appositive recognition . But we encountered substantial difficulties with general coreference prior to template generation . This appears to be the greatest challenge remaining for trainable components supporting information extraction . We know from our earlier work in the domain of terrorism that coreference resolution can be reasonably well-managed on the basis of hand-coded heuristics [Lehnert et al . 1992b] . But this type of solution does not port acros s domains and therefore represents a significant system development bottleneck . True portability will only be achieved with trainable coreference capabilities.
