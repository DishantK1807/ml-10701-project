Whereas Martin Kay (1982:74) suggests that the person who interprets machine output "would not have to be a translator and could quite possibly be drawn from a much larger segment of the labor pool", the SPANAM experience suggests that this conclusion would be valid only for technical experts working on a text for information purposes only.
