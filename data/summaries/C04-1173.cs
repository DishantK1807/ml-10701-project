Another study of disambiguation using a semantic similarity derived from WordNet is (Abney and Light, 1999); it sees the task as a Hidden Markov Model, whose parameters are estimated from corpus data, so this is a mixed model more than a purely dictionary-based model.

The graph then includes two types of nodes: w-nodes used for the words that occur 2With the exceptions of the methods of (Kozima and Furugori, 1993; Ide and Véronis, 1990), both based on models of activation of lexical relations, but who present no quantified results.

We can see that this score is about 50% only for the coarse polysemy, and 40% for the fine polysemy, compared to a typical 70-80% in usual disambiguation test sets, for similar sense dispersion (given by the random baseline); in (Abney and Light, 1999), the first-sense baseline gives 82%.

Dictionarybased approaches usually rely on a comparison of the set of words used in sense definitions and 1A good introduction is (Ide and Véronis, 1998), or (Manning and Schütze, 1999), chap.

A method not evaluated by (Patwardhan et al., 2003) and using another semantic relatedness measure ("conceptual density") is (Agirre and Rigau, 1996).
