Examining SEGMENTER'S results show a significant improvement over the initial algorithm of Hearst 1994 (called TEXTTILING), both in precision and recall.

Morris and Hirst (1991) first proposed this notion to chain semantically related words together via a 198 thesaurus, while we chose only repetition of the same stem word'.

We want to expand and ref'me our definition of the types of segment function to include more distinctions, such as the difference between document/segment borders (Reynar 1994).
P94-1050
A future step could be to compare our segmenting algorithm against other more recent systems (such as Yaari 1997, Okumura and Honda 1994).
C94-2121
We achieve a 10% increase in accuracy and recall levels over prior work (Hearst 1994, 1997).
J97-1003 P94-1002
Our evaluation corpus exhibited a weak level of agreement among judges, which we believe correlates with the low level of performance of automatic segmentation programs as compared to earlier published works (Hearst 1997).
J97-1003
Considering the problem from another angle, discourse approaches have focused on shorter units than multi-paragraph segments, but Rhetorical Structure Theory (Marcu 1997 and others) may be able to scale up to associate rhetorical functions with segments.

1 SEGMENTER: Linear Segmentation For the purposes of discourse structure identification, we follow a formulation of the problem similar to Hearst (1994), in which zero or more segment boundaries are found at various paragraph separations, which identify one or more topical text segments.

Passonneau and Litrnan (1993) show that this surprisingly low agreement is often the result of evaluators being divided between those who regard segments as more localized and those who prefer to split only on large boundaries.
P93-1020
We based our POS table lookup on NYU's COMLEX (Grishman et al.1994). After simplifying'COMLEX's categories to only reflect information important to to our three term types, we flattened all multi-category words (i.e.
C94-1042
We test for inter-judge reliability using Cochran (1950)'s Qtest, also discussed in Passonneau and Litrnan (1993).
P93-1020
We also tried to semantically cluster terms by using Miller et al.(1990)'s WordNet 1.5 with edge counting to determine relatedness, as suggested by Hearst (1997).
J97-1003
For segmentation, applying machine learning techniques (Beeferman et al.1997) to learn weights is a high priority.
W97-0304
Our segmentation is linear, rather than hierarchical (Marcu 1997 and Yaari 1997), i.e. the input article is divided into a linear sequence of adjacent segments.
