Punyakanok et al.(2004) represent full parsing information as constraints in integer linear programs.

In CoNLL-2005, full parsing trees are provided by two full parsers: the Collins parser (Collins, 1999) and the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000).

According to Punyakanok et al.(2004), given a set of constituents, S, and a set of semantic role labels, A, the SRL problem can be formulated as an ILP as follows: Let z ia be the indicator variable that represents whether or not an argument, a, is assigned to any S i âˆˆ S; and let p ia = score(S i = a).

Therefore, our system exploits the heuristic rules introduced by Xue and Palmer (2004) to filter out simple constituents that are unlikely to be arguments.
