MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS FOR A GERMAN TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYSTEM Amanda Pounder, Markus Kommenda Institut ffir Nachrichtentechnik und Hochfrequonztechnik Technische Universit/it Wien Gusshausstrasse 25, A-1040 Wien, Austria ABSTRACT A central problem in speech synthesis with unrestricted vocabulary is the automatic derivation of correct pronunciation from the graphemic form of a text.
The software module GRAPHON was developed to perform this conversion for German and is currently being extended by a morphological analysis component.
This analysis is based on a morph lexicon and a sot of rule~ and structural descriptions for German word-forms.
It provides each text input item with an individual characterization such that the phonological~ syntactic, and prosodic components may operate upon it.
This systematic approach tht~s serves to minimize the number of wrong transcriptions and at the same time lays the foundation for the generation of stress and intonation patterns, yielding more intelligible~ natural-sounding, and generally acceptable synthetic speech.
1. INTRODUCTION Many applications of computer speech require unrestricted vocabulary.
In particular~ voice output units of this kind permit the linkage of the common telephone network to a central computer, thus enabling access for a large public.
"Karlchen", the Frankfurt talking railway timetable, and other automatic information services are based on this principle.
If a written text serves as input to a speech synthesis system with unrestricted vocabulary (text-tospeech synthesis)p the derivation of a correct and natural-sounding pronunciation and intonation must be provided for.
The software module GRAPHON (GRAPHemo-PHONome-conversion) has boon developed to convert any given German text into its phonetic transcription (I.P.A.)~ enriched by some prosodic markers.
The text-to-speech system is being implemented on an HP 9816 workstation system with a 68000 CPU and 768 kbyte of RAM.
At present a SSI 263 phone synthesizer serves as acoustical output unit; a simplified articulatory model used to control a refined digital vocal tract synthesizer is under development.
The software is written in PASCAL and operation of the whole system is expected to be almost real-time.
(For further implementational details cf.
\[1\]). While text-to-speech systems for the English language are fairly advanced, there is much room for development for German ~peaking systems.
It is possible only to a limited extent to profit from work in the field of English.
Obviouslyj German pronunciation rules differ from those of other languages; however9 the mere replacement of a given grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rule by another is inadequate to meet the demands of the very different principles on which two writing-systems are founded.
Tills also applies to the structural levels of morphology and syntax.
2. MOTIVATION FOR A MORPHOIA)GICAL COMPONENT The application of an English pronunciation rule is lexically determined, that is to say, is restricted to a generally arbitrary subset of the lexicon (compare~ for example, the values of (eaY in the sets 4bread, head, thread...~ and {kneads bead, heat..,} ).
It is for this reason that many English-based systems include very extensive dictionaries, for example the pioneering work of Allen \[2\] with a 12000 morpheme lexicon.
On the other hand, German rules have in general a much wider scope of application, which has led researchers working in the field of German to consider large lexical inventories unnecessary.
The inventories in e.g.
SAMT \[3\] or SPRAUS-VS \[4\] are thus restricted to function words needed for the syntactic analysis (prepositions, pronouns, articles, etc.).
Similarly, our earliest efforts in this area were based 263 on a small lexicon and an extensive rule catalogue; howeverp numerous incorrect transcriptions at morphological boundaries and the frequent recurrence to ad-hoc rules (of.
\[1\]) made the lack of some sort of morphological indicator apparent.
However more closely German spelling may reflect pronunciation than is the case in Englishp difficulties arise in producing a correct pronunciation automatically if knowledge available to the human speaker, such as the internal structure of a given word or its native as opposed to foreign origin, is not made use of.
The following examples should suffice to demonstrate the relationship between morphology and the values of the written symbols: One fundamental rule is that vocalic quantity is determined by the number of following consonants: the first rule given in the DUDEN AussprachewSrterbuch \[5\] states that <a) is to be pronounced /a:/ when followed by only one consonant grapheme before the stem boundary, so that the inflectional form fast of the verb rasen ("rush") becomes /ra:st/~ whereas the simplex noun Rast ("rest") becomes /fast/.
Consonant or vowel groups may be assigned digraph or trigraph value only when they appear within morphological boundaries; compare for example the different values of <sch> in 15schen /f/ ("extinguish") und HiSschen /sq/ (dim.
of "pants"), or of <ei> in Geier /ai/ ("vulture") and geirrt /al i/ ("erred").
The first stem syllable in German (native stock) receives the primary word stressj a rule which implies this stemJs being identifiable; compare geben /'ge:bn/ ("give") and Gebein /ga'bain/ ("bones').
Those phenomena play a role in the domain of derivation and inflection~ which has been dealt with in several systemst e.g.
SYNTEX \[6\] or REDE \[7\]; these do contain lists of common prefixes and suffixes to permit affix-stripping~ although they are predominantly rule-based.
The same problems are found in the field of composition; their import is heightened by the very great frequency of this process in the German language.
Still, Riihl \[6\] proposes a decomposition algorithm which relies on distributional criteria and on lists of consonant clusters in initial 264 and final position (based on K6stner \[8\]).
Other authors too prefer to minimize the lexical component: "The attempt to incorporate this problem into a mainly rule-based system seemed to us to require a rather great and thus undesired step towards a kind of dictionary approach" (\[9\]~ p.226).
It is however certainly possible to make a case for a morphological analysis containing a morph-lexicon of some depth.
The conversion program presented here makes extensive use of such an analysis component (see fig.
1) and thus in our opinion profits from the following advantages: inflection~ derivation~ and composition can be treated simultaneously, more economically, and with a reduced number of incorrect segmentations; this latter is achieved by specifying the respective environments of potential elements; simple and efficient treatment of exceptions~ for instance the pronunciation of foreign words; this and the preceding result in a reduced transcription error rate and in simplified and more transparent grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules; correct placement of word-internal boundariesj labelling of the constituents and the lexieally stored information concerning native vs.
foreign status favour accurate word stress assignment; the lexicon-based approach prepares the ground for word classification and extraction of certain syntactic constraints, providing the input for an elementary sentence parser.

SKETCH OF THE MOHPHOIX)GICAL OOMPONENT 3.1.
Lexieal l:nventory Morphological analysis in our system relies on a single lexicon rather than on separate lists of, say, prefixes, stems, junctures etc.
The entries in this lexicon are morphs and not morphemes in that stem variation, i.e. processes such as umlaut (e.g.
Apfel ~pfel "apple"), ablaut (lau£ lie?
"run") and e-deletion (trocken trockn"dry") are not covered by rule but by storage of allomorphs.
As we are not concerned with generation, this appears to be the most practical method.
Forms that are in some way irregular are then naturally provided with individual entries, for example anomalous verb forms (sein bin war w~r ...
"be") or forms of the definite article (dot, die, das, dem,...).
We have chosen to set up the most basic forms wherever possible, e.g.
NAMas opposed to NAME (nominative singular), which permits an economical treatment of derivation and inflection.
AE~ a matter of fact, the overriding principle gow~rning the decision what exactly should constitute an entry is a pragmatic one: for example, rather than taking sides on linguistic, historical, or psychological grounds in such controversial cases as antwortvs.
ant + worL("answer"), himbeervs.
him + beer("raspberry"), or verlie~ ~ vs.
ver + lier("lose")~ we choose the solution favouring the ideal functioning ot' the system as a whole.
3.1.1. Structure of a Dictionary Entry A dictionary entry consists of the lemma, i.e. graphemic representation of the morph, on the one hand and an information-tree, serving to characterize its phonological, morphological and syntactic value on the other.
A number of practical conventions has been set up for the form of the lemma: a given morph is represented by a maximum of ten lower-case letters ; the diacritic sign " (umlaut) is made use of (cf.
other systems which decompose the vowels in question as <ae),<oe>,<ue>); likewise, the sign <D> is not replaced by <ss> either in the input text or in the lexicon.
An orthographic ~ule of German states that <ss> becomes </\]> before a consonant or a word-boundary, so that the latter sign's usual function as an indicator of vowel length is neutralized in these positions (compare Flfiaae "rivers" vs.
F/,De "feet" with FluI3 (/tr/) vs.
FuB (/u:/)); this "defect" (cf.
\[10\]) p.108) can be got round by maintaining the opposition between <ss> and <~> in the lemma.
The information-tree contains classificatory data pertaining to the morph itself and to those it may immediately select; they concern morphological status ( lexical stem particle derivational morph inflectional morph juncture -...), native or foreign status, and combinatorial restrictions.
In addition, the lexicon allows the introduction of information for the assignment to parts of speech and, wherever necessary, indications as to exceptional pronunciation or stress pattern.
3.1.2. Extent of the Lexical Inventory At present the lexical inventory comprises some 2000 entries, the choice of which was based on Ortmann \[11\], itself compiled from four frequency lists.
As for the contents of the entries, we relied on Augst \[12\], Mater \[13\], and Wahrig \[14\].
For the ongoing testing, revie~ion~ and supplementing of this primary list we depend on the frequency list in Meier \[15\] as well as on sample texts from various random sources.
Inasmuch as affixes, particles, and junctures (at least native ones) constitute closed classes, they should be represented exhaustively in the inventory.
This is unfortunately not the case as soon as one turns to foreign elements, to whose number are always being added new candidates.
Moreover, it is very difficult if not impossible to establish general principles according to which foreign suffixes in particular may be isolated and the dividing line found between stem and suffix.
Proper nouns are represented only to a very limited extent; their range should be adapted to the requirements of the task at hand.
In fact, the compilation of the inventory has been carried out with the aims of expandability and maximum flexibility.
It ts of course not to be expected that the lexicon would ever cover the entire vocabulary of a native speaker, nor is that our intention; consequently, we foresee a "joker raorph" which can stand for any stem that may happen to occur.
This is made possible 265 by the generalization that a German stem conforms to a number of structural principles: for example, every stem must contain a vowel and the variety of consonant clusters in initial, medial, and final position is restricted (of.
\[8\]). An oven more general canonical description can be expleited in the case of foreign elements.
Such a device has not yet been implemented.
For the time being, 64 kbyte have been reserved to accomodate the loxieal inventory.
Note that all loxical data as described above are coded so as to achieve maximum storage efficiency.
3.2. Word Parser The segmentation of a given (complex) word is carried cut automatically in a series of steps; the process is bound from the very first of these to the dictionary, as stated above.
Just as the human speaker seeks familiar units in his identification of a werd, the automatic analysis considers for further attention only those segment~ which correspond to forms available in the lexicon, such that the segments are contiguous and no letters are left unaccounted for.
Thus a segmentation such as mein + un + g for Meinung ("opinion") could not be produced in the first place, as +g+ has no representation in the lexicon.
The number of petentlal analyses is further reduced by the fact that no boundaries are searched for in a word corresponding identically to a single unit in the lexicon, for example der would not be analyzed as d + or or d + o + r . For reasons of run-time efficiency, a strategy is used which "prefers" the longest segments, starting from the beginning of a given word; thus deck + on ("cover") would be the first segmentation proposed before d + eck + on.
The usefulness of this principle can be seen from an example like Eintritt ("entrance"), where the order of segmentations would be: sin + tritt, sin + t + rift, ei + n + tritt, ei + n + t + flit, e + in + tritt, e + in + t + rift, e + i + n + tritt, e + i + n + t + rift.
The first decision proposed by the parser can be proved to be the correct one in the overwhelming majority of cases, which allows us to delay requiring a second proposal until the first has been rejected on structural grounds in the following step of the analysis procedure.
266 In this second step the proposed segmentations are examined as to their conformity to the principles of German morphological structure.
The following structural formula describes every German word, whether of native or foreign erigin: \[P: + S + Ds o + J\]: whereby: llb..
a +,# # pa + S + DS + It o o o .there may be between a and b segments of this type in a given structure represent morphological boundaries of different strengths (differentiatlon relevant for the context of certain phonolegical rules) P...
Particle (in general equivalent to inseparable prefixes, e.g.
+e~zt+, +prfi+) S.°.
Stem D... dorivational morph, always a surf i× (e.g.
+ iS+, + m~g~) I... inflectional morph, always a suffix (e.g.
+em-,+e~) J... juncture morph (e.
g. +ese in Bm~desbEdm "national railway") The segmentation is assigned a structural description by matching the combinatorial features of each unit with the morph status information of its neighbour as given in the respective lexicon entries.
A morph may be specified according to the following properties and in turn select certain values for these properties in its neighbour: native or foreign status, lexical functionality {this property is manifested by the capacity to receive inflection), -morphological status (as in the above structure definition with additional detailed classification), and lexical class, i.e. part of speech as reflected in the inflectional ending.
Specification of these properties is optional; however~ the more information provided, the more restrictions with respect to the general structure formula are achieved, so that the number of potential labellings is reduced and the labellings themselves bear more information.
Thus, it is possible to previde at least a partial treatment for words whose stems are not roDresented in the 2000 entry lexicon.
Should no match be obtained in this stop, the process is repeated with a new segmentation until compatible sets of features are found.

2 presents examples of the resulting segmentations and labellings.
We see that the first segmentation of Anteil ("portion") is rejected, as in this case the stem would be preceded by a suffix (+ant+ being a longer segment than +an+, it has received "priority" up to this point).
In the second segmentation, +an+ is correctly recognized as a non-lexical E~tem, upon which a lexical stem may follow.
It is not possible to specify the lexical class selected by +an+, as it combines with all parts of speech; and as +toil+ can function as a noun or a verb stem, there result two potential labellings.
The ambiguity cannot be resolved at this stage.
The following example is somewhat more complicated.
Crucial here is the boundary between the two stems of the compound Erwerbst~tiKen ("employees"): the phonological consequences of an error (/It/ instead of /st/) are quite serious.
After the correct segmentation has finally been found, three possible interpretations are proposed.
Note that +on+ can serve as a participle morph (Z), so that the word would syntactically function as an adjective.
The third step consists of additional checks and finer specifications in order to isolate the correct structure and part-of-speech assignment for the whole word.
For instance, if a suffix has been identified as a possible past participle morph, this could be verified by searching for a corresponding prefix (of.
toil + t "shares" vs.
ge + tell + t "shared").
Another check could exploit certain restrictions on the sequence of lexical and non-lexical stems in a complex word,, Such tests have not as yet been implemented.
The lexical class of a German word is, generally speaking, determined by its last element, so that the classification algorithm makes use of the results of the matching process at the end of the word.
Some derivational morphs, e.g.
+un~'h +keit+, +iech+, permit unambiguous classification.
Unfortunately the same cannot be said of inflectional endings in particular and many other elements as well, taken alone.
By exploiting the combinatorial information, however, many ambiguities are eliminated; moreover, capitalization can be treated as a signal for the lexical class noun.
Each text unit is now provided with a structural specification i~uch that the phonological, syntactic and prosodic component~ may operate on it.
Fig. 3 shows segmentations and lexical class assignment for a sample sentence; based on these, the phonological component already in place determines the correct pronunciation and generates the I.P.A. transcription, also given in fig.

CONCLUSION Although extensive tests on large corpora have not as yet been carried out, experiments with our current system permit evaluation of following aspects of the morphological analysis component in GRAPHON: The development of the phonological component has shown that the setting up of a catalogue of pronunciation rules became simpler and more systematic, and at the same time, the rate of transcription errors could be greatly reduced.
A relatively limited number of lexical entries is capable of handling a considerable quantity of running text.
The morphological information stored in each entry has proved to be relevant and in general sufficient for correct segmentation.
However, in order to increase accuracy in determining lexical class, as required by the syntactic analysis, it would be advantageous to expand the number of categories represented in the lexicon entries.
As it was not clear before the present tests exactly which additional classification would be useful, we chose to start from a minimum and provide for easy future expansion.
For example, the experiments confirm our assumptionthat it would be desirable to specify the potential junctures for a given stem and to differentiate several inflectional paradigms within a lexical class, in particular strong and weak verbs.
These data would have resolved the ambiguities encountered for the sample words in Fig.
2. As the aims of our system do not include any attempt to incorporate semantics and as moreover there is no feedback from the syntactic component planned, a unique structural specification cannot be expected in the case of ambiguities requiring reference to these structural levels.
Since such ambiguities do not necessarily lead to incorrect grammatical specification and only rarely to incorrect pronunciation, this is only a relative limitation.
Correctness of the phonemic transcription certainly accounts for a great part of the quality and acceptability of a text-to-speech system.
Nevertheless it is often claimed {e.g.
\[6\]) that synthetic speech should be evaluated along further dimensions, such as inte\[268 ligibility, listening comprehension and naturalness.
One goal Of the approach presented here is to lay the ground for the incorporation of rules for the assignment and realization of stress and intonation patterns not only on the word but also on the sentence level.
Thus the basic phonetic transcription will be extended and modified so as to give a representation closer to natural speech.
