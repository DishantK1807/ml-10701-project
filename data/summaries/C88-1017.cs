features defined for file English grammar in \[GKPS\], a lower bound for the number of categories to be checked by the FCRs is 10 774 \[Ristad 1986\].

Note that a similar ordering discovered by Shieber \[Shieber 1986\] results from investigations of underlying assumptions of \[GKPS\].

One possible way out of this dilemma is suggested in \[Shieber 1986\], but it is based on the assumption that HEAD features may be split up into two disjoint sets: those HEAD features which are prerequisites for the assignment of semantic types and thus for the applicability of the CAP, and those HEAD features that can safely be applied after the CAP has done its work.
