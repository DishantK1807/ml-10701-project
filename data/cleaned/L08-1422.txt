<context>.1.1 Word sense disambiguation Our disambiguation procedure uses other English translations of Persian word PW (that are named EWs later in this text) as context words. Similar to the Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986), our method uses the EW gloss, However the measures of the semantic similarity is chosen differently. For every sense of EW, a score is calculated using its gloss and the context words: for every wo</context>
