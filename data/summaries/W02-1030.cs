The parserâ€™s output was post-processed to remove bracketing errors and errors in identifying chunk categories that could potentially result in bigrams whose members do not stand in a verb-argument relationship (see Lapata (2001) for details on the filtering process).

If a bigram is unseen in a given corpus, conventional approaches recreate its frequency using techniques such as back-off, linear interpolation, class-based smoothing or distance-weighted averaging (see Dagan et al.(1999) and Lee (1999) for overviews).

In the present study, we used the plausibility judgments collected by Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001) for adjective-noun bigrams and conducted additional experiments to obtain nounnoun and verb-object judgments for the materials described in Section 2.1.

For the present study, we applied the procedure used by Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001) to noun-noun bigrams and to verb-object bigrams, creating a set of 90 seen and 90 unseen bigrams for each type of predicate-argument relationship.
E99-1005 N01-1009 P01-1046
Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001) collected plausibility ratings for 90 seen and 90 unseen adjective-noun bigrams (see Section 2.1) using magnitude estimation.

Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the web for word sense disambiguation, and Volk (2001) proposes a method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities based on web data.

In the experiments conducted by Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001), native speakers of English were presented with adjectivenoun bigrams and were asked to rate the degree of adjective-noun fit proportional to the modulus item.

This results holds for both seen bigrams (Lapata et al., 1999) and for unseen bigrams whose counts were recreated using smoothing techniques (Lapata et al., 2001).
E99-1005 N01-1009 P01-1046
Lapata et al.(2001) compiled a set of 90 unseen adjective-noun bigrams using the same 30 adjectives.
N01-1009 P01-1046
For unseen adjective-noun bigrams, Lapata et al.(2001) found a correlation of :356 between mean judgments and frequencies recreated using class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993).

Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts.

Table 6 lists the descriptive statistics for all six judgment experiments: the original experiments by Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001) for adjective-noun bigrams, and our new ones for nounnoun and verb-object bigrams.
E99-1005 N01-1009 P01-1046
We used the same experimental procedure as the original study (see Lapata et al.(1999) and Lapata et al.(2001) for details).
E99-1005 N01-1009 P01-1046
For the seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of Lapata et al.(1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows.
E99-1005
The procedure described by Lapata et al.(2001) was followed for creating sets of unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams: for each of noun or verb, we compiled a list of all nouns with which it failed to co-occur with in a noun-noun or verb-object bigram in the BNC.
N01-1009 P01-1046
Lapata et al.(1999) report a correlation of :570 between mean plausibility judgments and BNC counts for the seen adjectivenoun bigrams.

In two recent papers, Banko and Brill (2001a; 2001b) criticize the fact that current NLP algorithms are typically optimized, tested, and compared on fairly small data sets (corpora with millions of words), even though data sets several orders of magnitude larger are available, at least for some tasks.
