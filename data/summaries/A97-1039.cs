REALPRO is derived from previous systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1988; Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Rambow and Korelsky, 1992), but represents a new design and a completely new implementation.

The system is fully operational, runs on PC as well as on UNIX work stations, and is currently used in an application we have developed (Lavoie et al., 1997) as well as in several on-going projects (weather report generation, machine translation, project report generation).

265 We reserve a more detailed comparison with PENMAN and FUF, as well as with AlethGen/GL (Coch, 1996) (which is perhaps the system most similar to REALPRO, since they are based on the same linguistic theory and are both implemented with speed in mind), for a more extensive paper.

Instead, such projects use an off-the-shelf realizer, among which PENMAN (Bateman, 1996) and SURGE/FUF (Elhadad and Robin, 1996) are probably the most popular.

Typically, natural language generation is divided into several phases, namely text planning (determining output content and structure), sentence planning (determining abstract target language resources to express content, such as lexical items and syntactic constructions), and realization (producing the final text string) (Reiter, 1994).
