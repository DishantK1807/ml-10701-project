Software engineering, testing, and quality assurance
for natural language processing
Software engineering in general is a first-class research object in computer science, but generally has
not been treated as such within the natural language processing community. This is despite the fact that
natural language as an input type has unique characteristics that present special problems for software
testing, quality assurance, and even requirements specification.
The goals of this workshop included raising awareness of the need for good software engineering
practices in NLP, stimulating research on same, and disseminating the results of current work in this
area. We are grateful to the authors for sharing their work, and to the program committee for their
efforts.
