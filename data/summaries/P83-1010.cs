But while it may be possible to make limited use of intensional logic expressions, IÂ° there are many problems that need to be solved before intensional logic or other flavors of logical forms could support the type of inference and problem solving that AI requires of its semantic representations; see Moore 1981 for a useful discussion.

Hendler and Phillips (1981; Phillips and Hendler 1982) have implemented a control structure for NLU 18Gawron et al produce all poslible trees and their tranilations for the input sentence, s.nd then throw away any that don't make sense to the database.

Schubert and Peiletier (1982) have also sought to simplify the semantic output of a GPSG to a more ~conventional" logical form; and Rosenschein and Shieber (1982) describe a similar translation process into extensional logical forms, using a context-free grammar intended to be similar to a GPSG.
