This system not only is frequently used for off-line data preprocessing, but also is included as a black-box component for applications such as document summarization (Daume and Marcu, 2002), information extraction (Miller et al., 2000), machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001), and question answering (Harabagiu et al., 2001).

Gildea and Palmer (2002) report F-score results in the 55% range for argument and boundary recognition based on automatic parses.

The XLE system achieves 12% reduction in error rate over the Collins parser, that is 77.6% F-score for the XLE system versus 74.6% for the Collins parser, at a cost in parsing time of a factor of 1.49. 2 Stochastic Parsing with LFG 2.1 Parsing with Lexical-Functional Grammar The grammar used for this experiment was developed in the ParGram project (Butt et al., 2002).

Dynamic-programming algorithms that allow the efficient estimation and searching of log-linear models from a packed parse representation without enumerating an exponential number of parses have been recently presented by Miyao and Tsujii (2002) and Geman and Johnson (2002).

For a more detailed description of the optimization problem and the feature-functions we use for stochastic LFG parsing see Riezler et al.(2002). We also employed a combined lscript1 regularization and feature selection technique described in Riezler and Vasserman (2004) that considerably speeds up estimation and guarantees small feature sets for stochastic disambiguation.

For example, since the Collins parser depends on a prior part-of-speech tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), we included the time for POS tagging in our Collins measurements.

We investigated the accuracy of recovering semantically-relevant grammatical dependencies from the tree-structures produced by the Collins parser, comparing these dependencies to gold-standard dependencies which are available for a subset of 700 sentences randomly drawn from section 23 of the Wall Street Journal (see King et al.(2003)). We compared the output of the XLE system, a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the English Lexical-Functional Grammar previously constructed as part of the Pargram project (Butt et al., 2002), to the same gold standard.
