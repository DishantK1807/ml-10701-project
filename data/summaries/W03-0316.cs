In order to proceed with POS-tagging, such various methods as Hidden Markov Models (HMM); Memorybased models (Daelemans, 1996); Transformationbased Learning (TBL) (Brill, 1995); Maximum Entropy; decision trees (Schmid, 1994a); Neural network (Schmid, 1994b); and so on can be used.

Our approach in this work is to use a bootstrapped POS tagger for English to annotate the English side of a word-aligned parallel corpus, then directly project the tag annotations to the second language (Vietnamese) via existing word-alignments (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001).

Our solution is motivated by a similar work of David Yarowsky and Grace Ngai (2001).

In 2001, Radu Florian and Grace Ngai proposed the fast Transformation-Based Learning (or fTBL) (Florian and Ngai, 2001a) to improve the learning speed of TBL without affecting the accuracy of the original algorithm.

For full details of word alignment of this EVC corpus (precision, recall, coverage, etc.), please refer to (Dinh Dien et al., 2002a).

This EVC has been automatically word-aligned (Dinh Dien et al., 2002a).

Despite the POS-tagging improvement, the results can hardly said to be fully satisfactory due to the following reasons: * The result of automatic word-alignment is only 87% (Dinh Dien et al., 2002a).

English POS-Tagger by TBL method To make the presentation clearer, we re-use notations in the introduction to fnTBL-toolkit of Radu Florian and Grace Ngai (2001b) as follows: • χ : denotes the space of samples: the set of words which need POS-tagging.
N01-1006
The accuracy of word-alignment of this parallel corpus has been reported approximately 87% in (Dinh Dien et al., 2002b).
W02-1607
The result of this word-aligned parallel corpus has been used in various Vietnamese NLP tasks, such as in training the Vietnamese word segmenter (Dinh Dien et al., 2001a), word sense disambiguation (Dinh Dien, 2002b), etc.
