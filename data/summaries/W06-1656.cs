Another direction for unsupervised relation learning was taken in (Hasegawa, Sekine et al.2004; Chen, Ji et al.2005). These systems use a NER system to identify pairs of entities and then cluster them based on the types of the entities and the words appearing between the entities.

Information Extraction (IE) (Riloff 1993; Cowie and Lehnert 1996; Grishman 1996; Grishman 1997; Kushmerick, Weld et al.1997; Freitag 1998; Freitag and McCallum 1999; Soderland 1999) is the task of extracting factual assertions from text.

This makes URES patterns much more general, and allows to recognize instances in sentences inaccessible to the simple surface patterns of systems such as (Brin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).

(Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web.
