The rst class-based feature we use is based on word classes derived from the web corpus mentioned earlier and computed as described by (Ravichandran et al., 2005).

In particular, we use the name/instance lists described by (Fleischman et al., 2003) and available on Fleischmanâ€™s web page to generate features between names and nominals (this list contains a110a111a85 pairs mined from a112a73a96 GBs of news data).

Since this data set tends to focus mostly on person instances from news, we have additionally used similar data mined from a a112a73a113a49a114 GB web corpus, for which more general ISA relations were mined (Ravichandran et al., 2005).
