Second, there is no definition of partial specification of strings, in Calder (1989), while the distinction between helping and main paradigms is one of the main features of the present approach: it allows to define morphemes independently of any specific root, and thereby to capture generalizations about morphemes.

Inheritance (monotonic and non-monotonic) is a feature of object-oriented programming languages, and both kinds of unification have been extensively used, unification of feature structures in the NLP community, string unification in the field of automatic theorem proving (Calder 1989); thus we can hope that implementation will be straightforward and results acceptable in terms of efficiency.

This work departs from two-level morphology, which has been at the center of computational morphology since the implementation of URKIMMO (Koskenniemi 1983) and was applied to Arabic morphology first by Kay (1987), then by Beesley (1989, 1996), Kiraz (1994, 1996a) and to Syriac morphology by Kiraz (1996b).

As shown by Siekmann (Calder 1989), string unification is decidable and has a finite number of substitutions if repeated variables are only permitted on one side of the equation.

The string specification is a partial description of string which may contain variables (Calder 1989).

There have been other approaches to morphology than the two-level approach in computational linguistics; Gazdar and Evans have developed DATR (1996), a knowledge representation language, which has been used to write fragments of the morphology of a number of languages, among them Arabic (Gibbons 1990, Cahill 1990).

Finally, this approach does not restrict the grammar writer to the framework of linear phonology, and allows for the testing of a certain type of morphological theories, which claim that bound morphemes do not exist as lexicon l~There are a number of exceptions, Bear (1986), Ritchie et al.(1992), Kiraz (1996).

11The way paradigm entries combine is reminiscent of Kay (1984) who mentions unification of patterns (which constrain the order in which syntactic constituents must appear) alongside unification of other types of features.

For example, the third entry of the perf-temp paradigm unifies with the first entry of the meI-perf paradigm: PHON \[\[C1,Va,Vx,C2,V2,C3\] n \[(C,a*)*,a,C*\]\] & \[III n perf active n {II, III, IV}\] The PHON values are unified by string unification (Calder 1989), the feature structures by standard unification of features.

This approach is inspired from work done by Calder (1989) who uses paradigms to organize morphological information, and string equations to handle string operations.

Although particularly suited to concatenative morphology, this approach has been extended to other types of morphologies, and more precisely to templatic morphology first by Kay (1987), then by Beesley (1991,1996) and Kiraz (1994, 1996) among others.

with other Frameworks 4.1 Calder's Paradigmatic Morphology The approach described in this paper is directly inspired by Calder's paradigmatic approach (1989); however, there are major differences between the two approaches.
