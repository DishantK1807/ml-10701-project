However, obtaining considerable improvements in speech recognition accuracy seems hard, as is demonstrated by the fairly meager improvements (1–4 % relative) over standard word-based models accomplished by, e.g., Berton et al.(1996), Ordelman et al.(2003), Kirchhoff et al.(2006), Whittaker and Woodland (2000), Kwon and Park (2003), and Shafran and Hall (2006) for Dutch, Arabic, English, Korean, and Czech, or even the worse performance reported by Larson et al.(2000) for German and Byrne et al.(2001) for Czech.

Similarly, Goldwater et al.(2006) use a hierarchical Dirichlet model in combination with morph bigram probabilities.

The Finnish, Estonian, and Turkish test configurations are slight variations of experiments reported earlier in Hirsim¨aki et al.(2006) (Fin1: ‘News task’, Fin2: ‘Book task’), Kurimo et al.(2006a) (Fin3, Tur1), and Kurimo et al.(2006b) (Fin4, Est, Tur2).

Nevertheless, clear improvements over a word baseline have been achieved for Serbo-Croatian (Geutner et al., 1998), Finnish, Estonian (Kurimo et al., 2006b) and Turkish (Kurimo et al., 2006a).

Among others, de Marcken (1996), Brent (1999), Goldsmith (2001), Creutz and Lagus (2002), and Creutz (2006) have shown that models based on the above approach produce segmentations that resemble linguistic morpheme segmentations, when formulated mathematically in a probabilistic framework or equivalently using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle (Rissanen, 1989).
