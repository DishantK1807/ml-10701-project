Penn and Popescu (1997) build an automaton-based index for surface realization with large lexica, and suggest an extension to statistically trained decision trees.

Ninomiya et al.(2002) take a more computationally brute-force approach to index very large databases of feature structures for some kind of information retrieval application.

The OVIS system (van Noord, 1997) employs selective memoization, which tabulates only maximal projections in a head-corner parser — partial projections of a head are still recomputed.

EFD-closure bears some resemblance in its intentions to Greibach Normal Form, but: (1) it is far more conservative in the number of extra rules it must create; (2) it is linked directly to the derivable empty categories of the grammar, whereas GNF conversion proceeds from an already a0 -eliminated grammar (EFD-closure of any a0 -free grammar, in fact, is the grammar itself); (3) GNF is rather more difficult to define in the case of unification-based grammars than with classical CFGs, and in the one generalization we are aware of (Dymetman, 1992), EFD-closure is actually not guaranteed by it; and Dymetman’s generalization only works for classically offline-parseable grammars.

This transformation is similar to many of the myriad of earlier transformations proposed for exploring the decidability of recognition under various parsing control strategies, but the property it establishes is more conservative than brute-force epsilon elimination for unification-based grammars (Dymetman, 1994).
