Abstract
The automatic compilation of bilingual dic-
tionaries from comparable corpora has been
successful for single-word terms (SWTs),
but remains disappointing for multi-word
terms (MWTs). One of the main problems is
the insuf cient coverage of the bilingual dic-
tionary. Using the compositional translation
method improved the results, but still shows
some limits for MWTs of different syntac-
tic structures. In this paper, we propose to
bridge the gap between syntactic structures
through morphological links. The results
show a signi cant improvement in the com-
positional translation of MWTs that demon-
strate the ef ciency of the morphologically
based-method for lexical alignment.
1 Introduction
Current research in the automatic compilation of
bilingual dictionaries from corpora uses of compara-
ble corpora. Comparable corpora gather texts shar-
ing common features (domain, topic, genre, dis-
course) without having a source text-target text re-
lationship. They are considered by human transla-
tors more trustworthy than parallel corpora (Bowker
and Pearson, 2002). Moreover, they are available for
any written languages and not only for pairs of lan-
guages involving English. The compilation of spe-
cialized dictionaries should take into account multi-
word terms (MWTs) that are more precise and spe-
ci c to a particular scienti c domain than single-
word terms (SWTs). The standard approach is based
on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple
observation that a SWT or a MWT and its trans-
lation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts.
Correct results are obtained for SWTs with an ac-
curacy of about 80% for the top 10-20 proposed
candidates using large comparable corpora (Fung,
1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002)
or 60% using small comparable corpora (D·ejean
and Gaussier, 2002). In comparison, the results ob-
tained for MWTs are disappointing. For instance,
(Morin et al., 2007) have achieved 30% and 42%
precision for the top 10 and top 20 candidates in a
0.84 million-word French-Japanese corpus. These
results could be explained by the low frequency of
MWTs compared to SWTs, by the lack of paral-
lelism between the source and the target MWT ex-
traction systems, and by the low performance of the
alignment program. For SWTs, the process is in
two steps: looking in a dictionary, and if no direct
translation is available, starting the contextual anal-
ysis. Looking in the dictionary gives low results for
MWTs: 1% compared to 30% for French and 20%
for Japanese SWTs (Morin and Daille, 2006). To ex-
tend the coverage of the bilingual dictionary, an in-
termediate step is added between looking in the dic-
tionary and the contextual analysis that will propose
several translation candidates to compare with the
target MWTs. These candidate translations are ob-
tained thanks to a compositional translation method
(Melamed, 1997; Grefenstette, 1999). This method
reveals some limits when MWTs in the source and
the target languages do not share the same syntactic
patterns.
In this paper, we put forward an extended compo-
95
sitional method that bridges the gap between MWTs
of different syntactic structures through morpho-
logical links. We experiment within this method
of French-Japanese lexical alignment, using multi-
lingual terminology mining chain made up of two
terminology extraction systems; one in each lan-
guage, and an alignment program. The term extrac-
tion systems are publicly available and both extract
MWTs. The alignment program makes use of the
direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Rapp,
1999). The results show an improvement of 33% in
the translation of MWTs that demonstrate the ef -
ciency of the morphologically based-method for lex-
ical alignment.
2 Multilingual
terminology mining chain
Taking a comparable corpora as input, the multi-
lingual terminology mining chain outputs a list of
singleand multi-word candidate terms along with
their candidate translations (see Figure 1). This
chain performs a contextual analysis that adapts the
direct context-vector approach (Rapp, 1995; Fung
and McKeown, 1997) for SWTs to MWTs. It con-
sists of the following  ve steps:
1. For each language, the documents are cleaned,
tokenized, tagged and lemmatized. For French,
Brill’s POS tagger1 and the FLEM lemmatiser2
are used, and for Japanese, ChaSen3. We then
extract the MWTs and their variations using
the ACABIT terminology extraction system avail-
able for French4 (Daille, 2003), English and
Japanese5 (Takeuchi et al., 2004). (From now
on, we will refer to lexical units as words,
SWTs or MWTs).
2. We collect all the lexical units in the context of
each lexical unit a2 and count their occurrence
frequency in a window of a3 words around a2.
For each lexical unit a2 of the source and the
target languages, we obtain a context vector

a4a6a5 which gathers the set of co-occurrence units
a7 associated with the number of times that a7
and a2 occur together a8a6a9a10a9
a5
a11 . In order to iden-
tify speci c words in the lexical context and
to reduce word-frequency effects, we normal-
ize context vectors using an association score
such as Mutual Information (Fano, 1961) or
Log-likelihood (Dunning, 1993).
3. Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the
lexical units of the source context vector. If the
bilingual dictionary provides several transla-
tions for a lexical unit, we consider all of them
but weigh the different translations by their fre-
quency in the target language.
4. For a lexical unit to be translated, we com-
pute the similarity between the translated con-
text vector and all target vectors through vector
distance measures such as Cosine (Salton and
Lesk, 1968) or Jaccard (Tanimoto, 1958).
5. The candidate translations of a lexical unit are
the target lexical units closest to the translated
context vector according to vector distance.
In this approach, the translation of the lexical units
of the context vectors (step 3 of the previous ap-
proach), which depends on the coverage of the bilin-
gual dictionary visa-vis the corpus, is the most im-
portant step: the greater the number of elements
translated in the context vector, the more discrim-
inating the context vector in selecting translations
in the target language. Since the lexical units re-
fer to SWTs and MWTs, the dictionary must con-
tain many entries which occur in the corpus. For
SWTs, combining a general bilingual dictionary
with a specialized bilingual dictionary or a multi-
lingual thesaurus to translate context vectors ensures
that much of their elements will be translated (Chiao
and Zweigenbaum, 2002; D·ejean et al., 2002). For a
MWT to be translated, steps 3 to 5 could be avoided
thanks to a compositional method that will propose
several translation candidates to directly compare
with the target MWTs identi ed in step 1. More-
over, the compositional method is useful in step 3
to compensate for the bilingual dictionary when the
multi-word units of the context vector are not di-
rectly translated.

3 Default
compositional method
In order to increase the coverage of the dictionary for
MWTs that could not be directly translated, we gen-
erated possible translations by using a default com-
positional method (Melamed, 1997; Grefenstette,
1999).
For each element of the MWT found in the bilin-
gual dictionary, we generated all the translated com-
binations identi ed by the terminology extraction
system. For example, for the French MWT fatigue
chronique (chronic fatigue), there are four Japanese
translations for fatigue (fatigue)  a12a14a13 ,a12a16a15 ,a17a19a18 ,
a20a22a21  and two translations for chronique (chronic)
 a23a25a24a27a26a27a28 , a29a31a30 . Next, we generated all possi-
ble combinations of the translated elements (see Ta-
ble 16) and selected those which refer to an existing
MWT in the target language. In the above example,
only one term for each element was identi ed by the
Japanese extraction system: a29a32a30a25a12a32a15 . In this ap-
proach, when it is not possible to translate all parts
of an MWT, or when the translated combinations are
not identi ed by the extraction system, the MWT is

(the underlined Japanese MWT actually exists)
This approach also differs from that used by
(Robitaille et al., 2006) for French-Japanese trans-
lation. They  rst decompose the French MWT
into combinations of shorter multi-word unit ele-
ments. This approach makes the direct transla-
tion of a subpart of the MWT possible if it is
present in the bilingual dictionary. For MWTs
of length a3 , (Robitaille et al., 2006) produce all
the combinations of shorter multi-word unit ele-
ments of a length less than or equal to a3 . For
97
example, the French MWT syndrome de fatigue
chronique (chronic fatigue disorder) yields the fol-
lowing four combinations: i) a36syndrome de fatigue
chroniquea37, ii)a36syndrome de fatiguea37a38a36chroniquea37, iii)
a36syndromea37a39a36fatigue chroniquea37 and iv) a36syndromea37
a36fatiguea37a40a36chroniquea37. We limit ourselves to the com-
bination of type iv) above since 90% of the French
candidate terms provided by the term extraction pro-
cess after clustering are only composed of two con-
tent words.
4 Pattern
switching
The compositional translation presents problems
which have been reported by (Baldwin and Tanaka,
2004; Brown et al., 1993):
Fertility SWTs and MWTs are not translated by a
term of a same length. For instance, the French
SWT hypertension (hypertension) is translated
by the Japanese MWT a41a34a42a32a43 (here the kanji
a41 (taka) means high and the terma42a16a43 (ketsu-
atsu) means blood pressure).
Pattern switching MWTs in the source and the tar-
get language do not share the same syntactic
patterns. For instance, the French MWT cel-
lule graisseuse (fat cell) of N ADJ structure is
translated by the Japanese MWTa44a32a45a47a46a47a48 of
N N structure where the French noun cellule
is translated by the Japanese noun a46a49a48 (sai-
boo cellule cell) and the French adjective
graisseuse by the Japanese noun a44a32a45 (shiboo
graisse fat).
Foreign name When a proper name is part of the
MWT, it is not always translated: within the
French MWT syndrome de Cushing (Cush-
ing syndrome), Cushing is either transliterated
a50a22a51a14a52a54a53a56a55a58a57a60a59a60a61 or remains unchanged
Cushinga57a34a59a19a61 . The foreign name Cushing is
of course not present in the dictionary.
The pattern switching problem involves the Ad-
jective/Noun and the Noun/Verb part-of-speech
switches. The Adjective/Noun switch commonly
involves a relational adjective (ADJR). According
to grammatical tradition, there are two main cate-
gories among adjectives: epithetic adjectives such
as important (signi cant) and relational adjectives
such as sanguin (blood). The former cannot have
an agentive interpretation in contrast to the lat-
ter: the adjective sanguin (blood) within the MWT
acidit·e sanguine (blood acidity) is an argument to
the predicative noun acidit·e (acidity) and this is
not the case for the adjective important (signi cant)
within the noun phrase acidit·e importante (signi -
cant acidity). Such adjectives hold a naming func-
tion (Levi, 1978) and are particularly frequent in sci-
enti c  elds (Daille, 2001). Relational adjectives
are either denominal adjectives, morphologically de-
rived from a noun thanks to a suf x, or adjectives
having a noun usage such as math·ematique (mathe-
matical/mathematics). For the former, there are ap-
propriate adjective-forming suf xes for French that
lead to relational adjectives such as -ique, -aire, -al.
For a noun, it is not possible to guess the adjective-
forming suf x that will be employed as well as the
alternation of the noun stem that could occur. Re-
lational adjectives part of a MWT are often trans-
lated by a noun whatever the target language is.
From French to Japanese, the examples are numer-
ous: prescription m·edicamenteuse (a62a16a63a33a64 medic-
inal prescription), surveillance glyc·emique (a42a34a65a33a66
a67 glycemic monitoring),  bre alimentaire (
a68a25a69
a70a33a71 dietary  bre), produit laitier (
a72a58a73a49a74 dairy
product), fonction r·enale (a75a33a76a32a77a31a78 kidney func-
tion).
The problem of fertility could only be solved
thanks to a contextual analysis in contrast to the
foreign name problem that could be solved by an
heuristic. We decided to concentrate on the MWT
pattern switching problem.
5 Morphologically-based compositional
method
When it is not possible to directly translate a MWT
 i.e. i) before performing the steps 3 to 5 of
the contextual analysis for a multi-word term to be
translated or ii) during step 3 for the translation of
multi-word units of the context vector  , we  rst
try to translate the MWT using the default composi-
tional method. If the default compositional method
fails, we use a morphologically-based compositional
method. For each MWT of N ADJ structure, we
generate candidate MWTs of N Prep N structure
thanks to the rewriting rule:

a103a105a104a106a82a112a84a133a86a108a107a97a79a112a109a111a110 gathers a relational adjective a82a112a84a87a86
such as glyc·em-ique and the nouna79a133a109 from which the
adjective has been derived such as glyc·em-ie thanks
to the stripping-recoding rule a36a116a115a124a117a127a119a122a121 a96a123a107a115a118a117a96a37. We gen-
erate all possible forms ofa79a87a109 as matching stripping-
recoding rules and keep those that belong to the
biligual dictionary such as glyc·em-ie. Thus, we have
created a morphological link between the MWT
contr ole glyc·emique (glycemic control) of N ADJ
structure and multi-word unit (MWU) of N Prep
N structure contr ole de la glyc·emie (lit. control of
glycemia). Since it has not been possible to trans-
late all the parts of the MWT contr ole glyc·emique,
because glyc·emique was not found in the dictionary,
we use the morpholocally-linked MWU contr ole de
la glyc·emie of which all the parts are translated.
The morpholocally-linked MWU could be seen as
a canonical lexical form in the translation process
that possibly does not exist in the source language.
For instance, if index glyc·emique (glycemic index) is
a French MWT, the MWU index de la glyc·emie (lit.
index of the glycemia) does not appear in the French
corpus.
The stripping-recoding rules could be manually
encoded, mined from a monolingual corpus using
a learning method such as (Mikheev, 1997), or sup-
plied by a source terminology extraction system that
handles morphological variations. For such a sys-
tem, a MWT is a canonical form which merges sev-
eral synonymic variations. For instance, the French
MWT exc es pond·eral (overweight) is the canoni-
cal form of the following variants: exc es pond·eral
(overweight) of N ADJ structure, exc es de poids
(overweight) of N PREP N structure. It is this last
method that we used for our experiment.
6 Evaluation
In this section, we will outline the different lin-
guistic resources used for our experiments. We
then evaluate the performance of the default and
morphologically-based compositional methods.
6.1 Linguistic
resources
In order to obtain comparable corpora, we selected
the French and Japanese documents from the Web.
The documents were taken from the medical do-
main, within the sub-domain of ‘diabetes’ and ‘nu-
trition’. Document harvesting was carried out by a
domain-based search, then by manual selection. A
search for documents sharing the same domain can
be achieved using keywords re ecting the special-
ized domain: for French alimentation, diab ete and
ob·esit·e (food, diabetes, and obesity); for Japanese,
a65a19a134a34a135 and a136a32a137 (diabetes, and overweight). Then
the documents were manually selected by native
speakers of each language who are not domain spe-
cialists. These documents (248 for French and 538
for Japanese) were converted into plain text from
HTML or PDF, yielding 1.5 million-word corpus
(0.7 million-word for French and 0.8 million-word
for Japanese).
The French-Japanese bilingual dictionary used
in the translation phase was composed of four
dictionaries freely available on the Web (a36dico 1a37 7,
a36dico 2a37
8,
a36dico 3a37
9, and
a36dico 4a37
10), and the French-
Japanese Scienti c Dictionary (1989) (called
a36dico 5a37). Besides a36dico 4a37, which deals with the
medical domain, the other resources are general
(as a36dico 1, 2, and 3a37) or technical (as a36dico 5a37)
dictionaries. Merging the dictionaries yields a
single resource with 173,156 entries (114,461 single
words and 58,695 multi words) and an average of
2.1 translations per entry.
6.2 French
N ADJ reference lists
We needed to distinguish between relational and epi-
thetic adjectives appearing among the French N ADJ
candidates to demonstrate the relevance of the mor-
phological links. To build two French N ADJ refer-
ence lists, we proceeded as follows:
1. From the list of MWT candidates, we selected
those sharing a N ADJ structure.
2. We kept only the candidate terms which occur

more than 2 twice in the French corpus. As a
result of  ltering, 1,999 candidate terms were
extracted.
3. We manually selected linguistically well-
formed candidate terms. Here, 360 candidate
terms were removed that included: misspelled
terms, English terms, or subparts of longer
terms.
4. We took out the terms that are directly trans-
lated by the bilingual dictionary and found in
the comparable corpora. We identi ed 61 terms
of which 30 use a relational adjective such as
vaisseau sanguin (blood vessel a42a138a66 ), pro-
duit laitier (dairy product -a72a139a73a25a74 ) and insuff-
isance cardiaque (heart failure -a140a58a141a33a142 ).
Finally, we created two French reference lists:
a143
a36N ADJEa37 composed of 749 terms whereADJE
is a epithetic adjective;
a143
a36N ADJRa37 composed of 829 terms whereADJR
is a relational adjective.
6.3 Default
compositional method
We  rst evaluated the quality of the default compo-
sitional method for the two French reference lists.
Table 2 shows the results obtained. The  rst three
columns indicate the number of French and Japanese
terms found in the comparable corpora, and the
number of correct French-Japanese translations.
The results of this experiment show that only a
small quantity of terms were translated by the de-
fault compositional method. Here, the terms belong-
ing to a36N ADJEa37 were more easily translated (10%
with a precision of 69%) than the terms belonging
to a36N ADJRa37 (1%). We were unable to generate any
translations for 56 (12%) and 227 (27%) terms re-
spectively from the a36N ADJEa37 and a36N ADJRa37 lists.
This was because one or several content words of
the MWT candidates were not present in the bilin-
gual dictionary. The best translations of candidates
belonging to the a36N ADJEa37 list are those where the
adjective refers to a quantity such as faible (low),
moyen (medium), or haut (high). Since our French-
Japanese dictionary contained a small quantity of
medical terms, the identi ed translations of the can-
didates belonging to the a36N ADJRa37 list refers to
generic relational adjectives such as poids normal
(standard weight -a144a32a145a33a146a19a147 ), ·etude nationale (na-
tional study -a142a32a148a150a149a33a151 ), or activit·e physique (phys-
ical activity -a152a153a146a33a154a33a155 ). We noticed that some gen-
erated MWUs do not exist in French such as poids
(de) norme (standard weight), only the N ADJR
form exists.

6.4 Morphologically-based compositional
method
We will now turn to the evaluation of the
morphologically-based compositional method is are
dedicated to the translation of thea36N ADJRa37 list (see
Table 4).
By comparison with the previous method, the re-
sults of this experiment show that a signi cant quan-
tity of terms have now been translated. Since the
compositional method can yield several Japanese
translations for one French term, we associated 170
Japanese terms to 128 French terms with a high level
of precision: 88.2%. Here, we were unable to gener-
ate any translations for 136 (16%) terms in compar-
ison with the 227 terms (27%) for the default com-
positional method.

Finally from 859 terms relative to N ADJR struc-
ture, we translated 30 terms (5.1%) with the dic-
tionary, 5 terms (0.6%) by the default compo-
sitional method, and 150 terms (17.5%) by the
morphologically-based compositional method. It
was dif cult to  nd more translations for several rea-
sons: i) some specialized adjectives or nouns were
not included in our resources, ii) some terms were
not taken into account by the Japanese extraction
system, and iii) some terms were not included in the
Japanese corpus.
7 Conclusion
and future work
This study investigated the compilation of bilin-
gual terminologies from comparable corpora and
showed how to push back the limits of the methods
used in alignment programs to translate both single
and multiword terms. We proposed an extended
compositional method that bridges the gap between
MWTs of different syntactic structures through mor-
phological links. We experimented with the method
on MWTs of N ADJ structure involving a relational
adjective. By the use of a list of stripping-recoding
rules conjugated with a terminology extraction sys-
tem, the method was more ef cient than the de-
fault compositional method. The evaluation pro-
posed at the end of the paper shows that 170 French-
Japanese MWTs were extracted with a high preci-
sion (88.2%). This increases the coverage of the
French-Japanese terminology of MWTs that can be
obtained by the bilingual dictionary or the default
compositional method. We are aware that the ef-
 ciency of this method relies on the completeness
of the morphological ressources, dictionaries and
stripping-recoding rules. Such resources need to be
up todate for new domains and corpus.
In this study, we have observed that MWTs are of
a different nature in each language: French patterns
cover nominal phrases while Japanese patterns focus
on morphologically-built compounds. A Japanese
nominal phrase is not considered as a term: thus, the
Japanese extraction system does not identify a184a138a185
a186 a176a153a187
a172a49a173 (caloric intake) as a candidate MWT
but a184a35a185 a186 a176 a172a188a173 , unlike the French extraction
system which does the contrary (apport calorique
caloric intake). Since our morphologically-based
compositional method associated a184a14a185 a186 a176 a172a19a173 to
apport calorique, we could yield the nominal phrase
a184a19a185
a186 a176a189a187
a172a16a173 and improve lexical alignment.
