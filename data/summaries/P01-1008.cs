Alignment is performed using dynamic programming (Gale and Church, 1991) with a weight function based on the number of common words in a sentence pair.
P91-1023
This characteristic of our corpus is similar to problems with noisy and comparable corpora (Veronis, 2000), and it prevents us from using methods developed in the MT community based on clean parallel corpora, such as (Brown et al., 1993).
J93-2003
Following (Collins and Singer, 1999), filtering is based on the strength of the context and its frequency.
W99-0613
Statistical techniques were also successfully used by (Lapata, 2001) to identify paraphrases of adjective-noun phrases.
N01-1009
The first attempt to derive paraphrasing rules from corpora was undertaken by (Jacquemin et al., 1997), who investigated morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms.
P97-1004
Examples of such contexts are verb-object relations and noun-modifier relations, which were traditionally used in word similarity tasks from non-parallel corpora (Pereira et al., 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993).
P93-1023 P93-1024
For example, while “dog” and “cat” are recognized as the most similar concepts by the method described in (Lin, 1998), it is hard to imagine a context in which these words would be interchangeable.
P98-2127
This method of co-training has been previously applied to a variety of natural language tasks, such as word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), lexicon construction for information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999), and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999).
P95-1026 W99-0613
This extension will require using a more selective alignment technique (similar to that of (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 1999)).
W99-0625
Our model is based on the DLCoTrain algorithm proposed by (Collins and Singer, 1999), which applies a co-training procedure to decision list classifiers for two independent sets of features.
W99-0613
In some applications, only synonyms are considered as paraphrases (Langkilde and Knight, 1998); in others, looser definitions are used (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).
W97-0703
In fact, a similar representation was used by (Jacquemin et al., 1997) to describe term variations.
P97-1004
The same question arises with automatically constructed thesauri (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998).
