Ng (1997) estimates that the manual annotation effort necessary to build a broad coverage word-sense annotated English corpus is about 16 person-years; and this effort would have to be replicated for each different language.

Below, we can see the selectional preference for the first sense of know from (Agirre & martinez, 2002).

Many standard ML techniques have been tried, such as Bayesian learning, Exemplar based learning, Decision Lists, and recently margin-based classifiers like Boosting and Support Vector Machines (Escudero et al., 2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2000d, 2001; Martínez and Agirre, 2000).

The same is applicable to selectional preferences; traditional approaches that learn selectional preferences for a verb, tend to mix e.g. all subjects for differents senses, even if verbs can have different selectional preferences for each word sense (Agirre & Martinez, 2002).

In another line of research, (Yarowsky, 1995) and (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) have shown that it is possible to reduce the need for supervision with the help of large amounts of unannotated data.

Research in the acquisition of subcategorization information, selectional preferences, in thematic role assignments and diathesis alternations (Agirre and Martínez 2001, 2002, McCarthy and Korhonen, 1998; Korhonen et al., 2000; McCarthy 2001), domain information (Magnini and Cavaglià 2000), topic signatures (Agirre et al.2001b), lexico-semantic relations between words (Agirre et al.2002) etc.

Leacock et al.(1998) and Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) automatically generate arbitrarily large corpora for unsupervised WSD training, using the synonyms or definitions of word senses provided in WordNet to formulate search engine queries over the Web.

Ide and Veronis (1998) argue that word sense ambiguity is a central problem for many established HLT applications (for example Machine Translation, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval).

But in order to make significant advances in WSD system accuracy, systems need to be able to use types of lexical knowledge that are not currently available in wide-coverage lexical knowledge bases: for example subcategorisation frequencies for predicates (particularly verbs) rely on word senses, selectional preferences of predicates for classes of arguments, amongst others (Carroll and McCarthy, 2000; McCarthy et al., 2001; Agirre and Martínez, 2002;).
