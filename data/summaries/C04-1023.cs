However, it is considered that those who have a detailed knowledge of a technical field are unaccustomed to represent the advantages of the technologies in a title because previous research showed that most of technical paper titles in Japanese does not included such a phrase (Senda and Sinohara, 2002).

The role of this parallel corpus is basically the same as the one of “Example-Based Translation Aid (EBTA)” (Sato, 1992) (Furugori and Takeda, 1993) (Kumano and Tanaka, 1998).

Several researches have been reported on title generation (Jin and Hauptmann, 2000) (Berger and Mittal, 2000) and readability of texts (Minel et al., 1997) (Hartley and Sydes, 1997) (Inui et al., 2003).
