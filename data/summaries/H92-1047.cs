In this respect, our program is similar to Zernik (1989) and Zernik and Jacobs (1990), working on extracting verb semantics from corpora using lexical categories.

Using techniques described in Church and Hindle (1990), Church and Hanks (1990), and Hindle and Rooth (1991), below are some examples of the most frequent V-O pairs from the AP corpus.

In this paper I describe research devoted to developing techniques for building sublanguage lexicons via syntactic and statistical corpus analysis coupled with analytic techniques based on the tenets of a generative theory of the lexicon (Pustejovsky 1991).

This is in fact the type of experiment reported on in Anick and Pustejovsky (1990).

Following Pustejovsky and Anick (1988), we call such meta-entries lexical conceptuM paradigms (LCPs).

semantic collocations) can be represented as that part of the lexical structure of a word called the projective conclusion space (Pustejovsky (1991))).

This is another example of logical polysemy and is represented in the lexical structure for newspaper explicitly (Pustejovsky (1991)).

In Pustejovsky et al (1991), we discuss how this general technique compares to somewhat different but related approaches described in Smadja (1991) and Zernik and Jacobs (1991).

In Pustejovsky (1991) it is argued that in such cases, the verb need not have multiple subcategorizations, but only one deep semantic type, in this case, an event.
