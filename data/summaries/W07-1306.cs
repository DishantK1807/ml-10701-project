An example of a major work on text based similarity is the paper by Kondrak and Sherif (Kondrak and Sherif, 2006).

Cross Entropy (SCE) The first measure is purely a letter n-gram based measure similar to the one used by Singh (Singh, 2006b) for language and encoding identification.

In linguistics, the study of inter-language distances, especially for language classification, has a long history (Swadesh, 1952; Ellison and Kirby, 2006).
P06-1035
Many earlier attempts (Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997; Kondrak, 2002) were based on crosslingual comparison of phonetic forms, but some researchers have argued against the possibility of obtaining meaningful results from crosslingual comparison of phonetic forms.
W97-1102
Different researchers have argued about the importance of order sensitivity and scaling in using string comparison algorithms (Heeringa et al., 2006; Ellison and Kirby, 2006).
P06-1035 W06-1108
It may be noted that Ellison and Kirby (Ellison and Kirby, 2006) have shown that scaling by distance does give significantly better results.
P06-1035
System using a decision tree based learning algorithm (CN2) has been developed for statistical Hindi POS tagging (Singh et al., 2006).

Like in other disciplines, computational methods are increasingly being combined with other more conventional approaches (Dyen et al., 1992; Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997; Kondrak, 2002; Ellison and Kirby, 2006).

Better versions of the two cognate based measures can be defined by using the idea of confusion probabilities (Ellison and Kirby, 2006) and the idea of distributional similarity.
P06-1035
Ellison and Kirby (Ellison and Kirby, 2006) argue that even if there is a common space, language specific categorization of sound often restructures this space.
P06-1035
Kessler (2001) estimates the likelihood of chance phonemic correspondences using permutation statistics; Kondrak (2002) develops algorithms to detect cognates and sound correspondences; McMahon and McMahon (2005) and also Nakhleh, Ringe and Warnow (2005) apply phylogenetic techniques to comparative reconstruction; and Ellison and Kirby (2006) suggest means of detecting relationships which do not depend on word by word comparisons.
P06-1035
A recent work on applications of such techniques for linguistic study is by Heeringa et al.(Heeringa et al., 2006).

Such measures have proved to be very effective in automatically identifying languages of text, with accuracies nearing 100% for fairly small amounts of training and test data (Adams and Resnik, 1997; Singh, 2006b).
W06-1109 W97-0907
The measures can be based on inter-lingual or on intra-lingual comparison of phonetic forms (Ellison and Kirby, 2006).
P06-1035
For identifying cognates, we are using the computational model of scripts or CPMS (Singh, 2006a).
