c©2007 Association for Computational Linguistics Parsing and Generation as Datalog Queries Makoto Kanazawa National Institute of Informatics 2–1–2 Hitotsubashi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, 101–8430, Japan kanazawa@nii.ac.jp Abstract We show that the problems of parsing and surface realization for grammar formalisms with “context-free” derivations, coupled with Montague semantics (under a certain restriction) can be reduced in a uniform way to Datalog query evaluation.
As well as giving a polynomialtime algorithm for computing all derivation trees (in the form of a shared forest) from an input string or input logical form, this reduction has the following complexity-theoretic consequences for all such formalisms: (i) the decision problem of recognizing grammaticality (surface realizability) of an input string (logical form) is in LOGCFL; and (ii) the search problem of finding one logical form (surface string) from an input string (logical form) is in functional LOGCFL.
Moreover, the generalized supplementary magic-sets rewriting of the Datalog program resulting from the reduction yields efficient Earley-style algorithms for both parsing and generation.
1 Introduction
The representation of context-free grammars (augmentedwithfeatures)intermsofdefiniteclauseprograms is well-known.
In the case of a bare-bone CFG, the corresponding program is in the functionfree subset of logic programming, known as Datalog.
For example, determining whether a string John found a unicorn belongs to the language of the CFG in Figure 1 is equivalent to deciding whether the Datalog program in Figure 2 together with the database in (1) can derive the query “?−S(0,4).” (1) John(0,1).

By naive (or seminaive) bottom-up evaluation (see, e.g., Ullman, 1988), the answer to such a query can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the database for any Datalog program.
By recording ruleinstancesratherthanderivedfacts,apackedrepresentation of the complete set of Datalog derivation trees for a given query can also be obtained in polynomial time by the same technique.
Since a Datalog derivation tree uniquely determines a grammar derivation tree, this gives a reduction of context-free recognition and parsing to query evaluation in Datalog.
In this paper, we show that a similar reduction to Datalog is possible for more powerful grammar formalisms with “context-free” derivations, such as (multi-component) tree-adjoining grammars (Joshi and Schabes, 1997; Weir, 1988), IO macro grammars (Fisher, 1968), and (parallel) multiple contextfree grammars (Seki et al., 1991).
For instance, the TAG in Figure 3 is represented by the Datalog program in Figure 4.

tion extends to the problem of tactical generation (surface realization) for these grammar formalisms coupled with Montague semantics (under a certain restriction).
Our method essentially relies on the encoding of diﬀerent formalisms in terms of abstract categorial grammars (de Groote, 2001).
The reduction to Datalog makes it possible to apply to parsing and generation sophisticated evaluation techniques for Datalog queries; in particular, an application of generalized supplementary magicsets rewriting (Beeri and Ramakrishnan, 1991) automatically yields Earley-style algorithms for both parsing and generation.
The reduction can also be used to obtain a tight upper bound, namely LOGCFL, on the computational complexity of the problem of recognition, both for grammaticality of input strings and for surface realizability of input logical forms.
With regard to parsing and recognition of input strings, polynomial-time algorithms and the LOGCFL upper bound on the computational complexity are already known for the grammar formalisms covered by our results (Engelfriet, 1986); nevertheless, we believe that our reduction to Datalog oﬀers valuable insights.
Concerning generation, our results seem to be entirely new.
1 2 Context-free grammars on λ-terms Consider an augmentation of the grammar in Figure 1 with Montague semantics, where the left-hand 1 We only consider exact generation, not taking into account the problem of logical form equivalence, which will most likely render the problem of generation computationally intractable (Moore, 2002).
S(X 1 X 2 ) → NP(X 1 ) VP(X 2 ) VP(λx.X 2 (λy.X 1 yx)) → V(X 1 ) NP(X 2 ) V(λyx.X 2 (X 1 yx)(X 3 yx)) → V(X 1 ) Conj(X 2 ) V(X 3 ) NP(X 1 X 2 ) → Det(X 1 ) N(X 2 ) NP(λu.u John e ) → John V(find e→e→t ) → found V(catch e→e→t ) → caught Conj(∧ t→t→t ) → and Det(λuv.∃ (e→t)→t (λy.∧ t→t→t (uy)(vy))) → a N(unicorn e→t ) → unicorn Figure 5: A context-free grammar with Montague semantics.

side of each rule is annotated with aλ-term that tells how the meaning of the left-hand side is composed from the meanings of the right-hand side nonterminals, represented by upper-case variables X 1,X 2,...
(Figure 5).
2 The
meaning of a sentence is computed from its derivation tree.
For example, John found a unicorn has the derivation tree in Figure 6, and the grammar rules assign its root node theλ-term (λu.u John)(λx.(λuv.∃(λy.∧(uy)(vy))) unicorn (λy.find yx)), whichβ-reduces to theλ-term (2) ∃(λy.∧(unicorn y)(find y John)) encoding the first-order logic formula representing the meaning of the sentence (i.e., its logical form).
Thus, computing the logical form(s) of a sentence involves parsing andλ-term normalization.
Tofind a sentence expressing a given logical form, it suﬃces 2 We follow standard notational conventions in typed λcalculus.
Thus, an application M 1 M 2 M 3 (written without parentheses) associates to the left,λx.λy.M is abbreviated toλxy.M, andα→β→γstands forα→(β→γ).

to find a derivation tree whose root node is associated with aλ-term thatβ-reduces to the given logical form; the desired sentence can simply be read oﬀ from the derivation tree.
At the heart of both tasks is the computation of the derivation tree(s) that yieldtheinput.
Inthecaseofgeneration, thismaybe viewed as parsing the inputλ-term with a “contextfree” grammar that generates a set of λ-terms (in normal form) (Figure 7), which is obtained from the original CFG with Montague semantics by stripping oﬀterminal symbols.
Determining whether a given logical form is surface realizable with the original grammar is equivalent to recognition with the resulting context-freeλ-term grammar (CFLG).
In a CFLG such as in Figure 7, constants appearing in theλ-terms have preassigned types indicated by superscripts.
There is a mappingσfrom nonterminals to their types (σ={Smapsto→t,NPmapsto→(e→t)→ t,VPmapsto→e→t,Vmapsto→e→e→t,Conjmapsto→t→t→t,Detmapsto→ (e→t)→(e→t)→t,Nmapsto→e→t}).
A rulethat has A on the left-hand side and B 1,...,B n as right-hand side nonterminals has its left-hand side annotated with a well-formedλ-term M that has typeσ(A) under the type environment X 1 :σ(B 1 ),...,X n :σ(B n ) (in symbols, X 1 :σ(B 1 ),...,X n :σ(B n )turnstileleft M :σ(A)).
What we have called a context-freeλ-term grammar is nothing but an alternative notation for an abstract categorial grammar (de Groote, 2001) whose abstract vocabulary is second-order, with the restriction to linear λ-terms removed.

the linear case, Salvati (2005) has shown the recognition/parsing complexitytobePTIME,andexhibitedanalgorithm similar to Earley parsing for TAGs.
Second-order 3 Aλ-term is aλI-term if each occurrence ofλbinds at least one occurrence of a variable.

linear ACGs are known to be expressive enough to encode well-known mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms in a straightforward way, including TAGs and multiple context-free grammars (de Groote, 2002; de Groote and Pogodalla, 2004).
For example, the linear CFLG in Figure 8 is an encodingoftheTAGinFigure3,whereσ(S)=o→o andσ(A)=(o→o)→o→o (see de Groote, 2002 for details of this encoding).
In encoding a stringgenerating grammar, a CFLG uses o as the type of string position and o→o as the type of string.
Each terminal symbol is represented by a constant of type o→o, and a string a 1...a n is encoded by theλ-term λz.a o→o 1 (...(a o→o n z)...), which has type o→o.
A string-generating grammar coupled with Montague semantics may be represented by a synchronous CFLG, a pair of CFLGs with matching rule sets (de Groote 2001).
The transduction between strings and logical forms in either direction consists of parsing the inputλ-term with the sourceside grammar and normalizing the λ-term(s) constructed in accordance with the target-side grammar from the derivation tree(s) output by parsing.
3 Reduction
to Datalog We show that under a weaker condition than linearity, a CFLG can be represented by a Datalog program, obtaining a tight upper bound (LOGCFL) on the recognition complexity.
Due to space limitation, our presentation here is kept at an informal level; formal definitions and rigorous proof of correctness will appear elsewhere.
We use the grammar in Figure 7 as an example, which is represented by the Datalog program in Figure 9.
Note that allλ-terms in this grammar are almost linear in the sense that they areλI-terms where any variable occurring free more than once in any subterm must have an atomic type.
Our construction is guaranteed to be correct only when this condition is met.
Each Datalog rule is obtained from the corresponding grammar rule in the following way.
Let 178 S(p 1 ):−NP(p 1,p 2,p 3 ),VP(p 2,p 3 ).

M be theλ-term annotating the left-hand side of the grammar rule.
We first obtain a principal (i.e., most general) typing of M.
4 In
the case of the second rule, this is X 1 : p 3 →p 4 →p 2, X 2 :(p 3 →p 2 )→p 1 turnstileleft λx.X 2 (λy.X 1 yx):p 4 →p 1 . We then remove→and parentheses from the types in the principal typing and write the resulting sequences of atomic types in reverse.
5 We
obtain the Datalog rule by replacing X i and M in the grammar rule with the sequence coming from the type paired with X i and M, respectively.
Note that atomic types in the principal typing become variables in the Datalog rule.
When there are constants in theλ-term M, they are treated like free variables.
In the case of the second-to-last rule, the principal typing is ∃:(p 4 →p 2 )→p 1,∧: p 3 →p 5 →p 2 turnstileleft λuv.∃(λy.∧(uy)(vy)):(p 4 →p 3 )→(p 4 →p 5 )→p 1 . If the same constant occurs more than once, distinct occurrences are treated as distinct free variables.
The construction of the database representing the inputλ-term is similar, but slightly more complex.
A simple case is theλ-term (2), where each constant occurs just once.
We compute its principal typing, treating constants as free variables.
6 ∃:(4→2)→1,∧:3→5→2, unicorn :4→3, find :4→6→5,John :6 turnstileleft∃(λy.∧(unicorn y)(find y John)):1.
4 To
be precise, we must first convert M to itsη-long form relative to the type assigned to it by the grammar.
For example, X 1 X 2 in the first rule is converted to X 1 (λx.X 2 x).
5 The
reason for reversing the sequences of atomic types is to reconcile theλ-term encoding of strings with the convention of listing string positions from left to right in databases like (1).
6 We
assume that the inputλ-term is inη-long normal form.
We then obtain the corresponding database (3) and query (4) from the antecedent and succedent of this judgment, respectively.
Note that here we are using 1,2,3,...as atomic types, which become database constants.

John(6). (3) ?−S(1).(4) Whentheinputλ-termcontainsmorethanoneoccurrence of the same constant, it is not always correct to simply treat them as distinct free variables, unlike in the case of λ-terms annotating grammar rules.
Consider the λ-term (5) (John found and caught a unicorn): (5) ∃(λy.∧(unicorn y)(∧(find y John)(catch y John))).
Here, the two occurrences of John must be treated as the same variable.
The principal typing is (6) and the resulting database is (7).
∃:(4→2)→1,∧ 1 :3→5→2, unicorn :4→3,∧ 2 :6→8→5, find :4→7→6, John :7,catch :4→7→8 turnstileleft∃(λy.∧ 1 (unicorn y) (∧ 2 (find y John)(catch y John))) : 1.

(7) It is not correct to identify the two occurrences of ∧ in this example.
The rule is to identify distinct occurrences of the same constant just in case they occur in the same position withinα-equivalent subterms of an atomic type.
This is a necessary condition for those occurrences to originate as one and the same occurrence in the non-normalλ-term at the root of the derivation tree.
(As a preprocessing step, it is also necessary to check that distinct occurrences of a bound variable satisfy the same condition, so that the givenλ-term isβ-equal to some almost linearλ-term.
7 ) 7 Note that the way we obtain a database from an input λ-term generalizes the standard database representation of a string: from the λ-term encoding λz.a o→o 1 (...(a o→o n z)...)ofa string a 1 ...a n,weobtainthedatabasea 1 (0,1),...,a n (n−1,n)}.
179 4 Correctness of the reduction We sketch some key points in the proof of correctness of our reduction.
The λ-term N obtained from the input λ-term by replacing occurrences of constants by free variables in the manner described above is the normal form of some almost linearλterm N prime . The leftmost reduction from an almost linearλ-term to its normal form must be non-deleting and almost non-duplicating in the sense that when a β-redex (λx.P)Q is contracted, Q is not deleted, and moreover it is not duplicated unless the type of x is atomic.
We can show that the Subject Expansion Theorem holds for suchβ-reduction, so the principal typing of N is also the principal typing of N prime . By a slight generalization of a result by Aoto (1999), this typing Γ turnstileleft N prime :α must be negatively non-duplicated in the sense that each atomic type has at most one negative occurrence in it.
By Aoto and Ono’s (1994) generalization of the Coherence Theorem (see Mints, 2000), it follows that everyλterm P such thatΓ prime turnstileleft P :αfor someΓ prime ⊆Γmust be βη-equal to N prime (and consequently to N).
Given the one-one correspondence between the grammar rules and the Datalog rules, a Datalog derivation tree uniquely determines a grammar derivation tree (see Figure 10 as an example).
This relation is not one-one, because a Datalog derivation tree contains database constants from the input database.
This extra information determines a typingoftheλ-term P attherootofthegrammarderivationtree(withoccurrencesofconstantsintheλ-term corresponding to distinct facts in the database regarded as distinct free variables): John :6, find :4→6→5,∃:(4→2)→1, ∧:3→5→2, unicorn :4→3turnstileleft (λu.u John) (λx.(λuv.∃(λy.∧(uy)(vy))) unicorn (λy.find yx)) : 1.
The antecedent of this typing must be a subset of the antecedent of the principal typing of the λ-term N from which the input database was obtained.
By the property mentioned at the end of the preceding paragraph, it follows that the grammar derivation tree is a derivation tree for the inputλ-term.
Conversely, consider theλ-term P (with distinct occurrences of constants regarded as distinct free variables) at the root of a grammar derivation tree for the input λ-term.
We can show that there is a substitution θ which maps the free variables of P to the free variables of theλ-term N used to build the input database such thatθsends the normal form of P to N.
Since P is an almost linearλ-term, the leftmost reduction from Pθto N is non-deleting and almost non-duplicating.
By the Subject Expansion Theorem, the principal typing of N is also the principal typing of Pθ, and this together with the grammar derivation tree determines a Datalog derivation tree.
5 Complexity-theoretic consequences Let us call a rule A(M):− B 1 (X 1 ),...,B n (X n )ina CFLG anepsilon1-rule if n=0 and M does not contain any constants.
We can eliminateepsilon1-rules from an almost linearCFLGbythesamemethodthatKanazawaand Yoshinaka (2005) used for linear grammars, noting that for any Γ and α, there are only finitely many almost linearλ-terms M such thatΓturnstileleft M :α.Ifa grammar has no epsilon1-rule, any derivation tree for the inputλ-term N that has aλ-term P at its root node correspondstoaDatalogderivationtreewhosenumber of leaves is equal to the number of occurrences of constants in P, which cannot exceed the number of occurrences of constants in N.
A Datalog program P is said to have the polynomial fringe property relative to a class D of databases if there is a polynomial p(n) such that for every database D inDof n facts and every query q suchthat P∪D derives q, thereisaderivationtreefor q whose fringe (i.e., sequence of leaves) is of length at most p(n).
For such P and D, it is known that {(D,q)|D∈D,P∪D derives q}is in the complexity class LOGCFL (Ullman and Van Gelder, 1988; Kanellakis, 1988).
We state without proof that the database-query pair (D,q) representing an input λ-term N can be computed in logspace.
By padding D with extra useless facts so that the size of D becomes equal to the number of occurrences of constants in N, we obtain a logspace reduction from the set ofλ-terms generated by an almost linear CFLG to a set of the form {(D,q)| D ∈D,P∪D turnstileleft q}, where P has the polynomial fringe property relative to D.
This shows that the problem of recognition for an almost linear CFLG is in LOGCFL.

In the case of a synchronous almost linear CFLG, the derivation tree found from the sourceλterm can be used to compute a targetλ-term.
Thus, to the extent that transduction back and forth between strings and logical forms can be expressed by a synchronous almost linear CFLG, the search problem of finding one logical form of an input sentence andthatoffindingonesurfacerealizationofaninput logical form are both in functional LOGCFL.
8 As
a consequence, there are eﬃcient parallel algorithms for these problems.
6 Regular
sets of trees as input Almost linear CFLGs can represent a substantial fragment of a Montague semantics for English and such “linear” grammar formalisms as (multi-component) tree-adjoining grammars (both as string grammars and as tree grammars) and multiple context-free grammars.
However, IO macro grammars and parallel multiple context-free grammars cannot be directly represented because representing string copying requires multiple occurrences of a variable of type o→o.
This problem can be solved by switching from strings to trees.
We convert the input string into the regular set of binary trees whose yield equals the input string (using c 8 If the target-side grammar is not linear, the normal form of the targetλ-term cannot be explicitly computed because its size may be exponential in the size of the sourceλ-term.
Nevertheless, a typing that serves to uniquely identify the targetλ-term can be computed from the derivation tree in logspace.
Also, if the target-side grammar is linear and string-generating, the target string can be explicitly computed from the derivation tree in logspace (Salvati, 2007).
as the sole symbol of rank 2), and turn the grammar into a tree grammar, replacing all instances of string concatenation in the grammar with the tree operation t 1,t 2 mapsto→ c(t 1,t 2 ).
This way, a string grammar is turned into a tree grammar that generates a set of trees whose image under the yield function is the language of the string grammar.
(In the case of an IO macro grammar, the result is an IO contextfree tree grammar (Engelfriet, 1977)).
String copying becomes tree copying, and the resulting grammar can be represented by an almost linear CFLG and hence by a Datalog program.
The regular set of all binary trees that yield the input string is represented by a database that is constructed from a deterministic bottom-up finite tree automaton recognizing it.
Determinism is important for ensuring correctness of this reduction.
Since the database can be computed from the input string in logspace, the complexity-theoretic consequences of the last section carry over here.
7 Magic
sets and Earley-style algorithms Magic-sets rewriting of a Datalog program allows bottom-up evaluation to avoid deriving useless facts by mimicking top-down evaluation of the original program.
The result of the generalized supplementary magic-sets rewriting of Beeri and Ramakrishnan (1991) applied to the Datalog program representing a CFG essentially coincides with the deduction system (Shieber et al., 1995) or uninstantiated parsing system (Sikkel, 1997) for Earley parsing.
By applying the same rewriting method to Datalog programs representing almost linear CFLGs, we can obtain eﬃcient parsing and generation algorithms for various grammar formalisms with context-free derivations.
We illustrate this approach with the program in Figure 4, following the presentation of Ullman 181 (1989a; 1989b).
We assume the query to take the form “?−S(0,x).”, so that the input database can be processed incrementally.
The program is first made safe by eliminating the possibility of deriving nonground atoms: S(p 1,p 3 ):−A(p 1,p 3,p 2,p 2 ).
A(p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−A(p 2,p 7,p 3,p 6 ),a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 3,p 4 ),c(p 5,p 6 ),d(p 7,p 8 ).
A(p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 2,p 4 ),c(p 5,p 6 ),d(p 6,p 8 ).
The subgoal rectification removes duplicate arguments from subgoals, creating new predicates as needed: S(p 1,p 3 ):− B(p 1,p 3,p 2 ).
A(p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−A(p 2,p 7,p 3,p 6 ),a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 3,p 4 ),c(p 5,p 6 ),d(p 7,p 8 ).
A(p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 2,p 4 ),c(p 5,p 6 ),d(p 6,p 8 ).
B(p 1,p 8,p 4 ):−A(p 2,p 7,p 3,p 6 ),a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 3,p 4 ),c(p 4,p 6 ),d(p 7,p 8 ).
B(p 1,p 8,p 4 ):−a(p 1,p 2 ),b(p 2,p 4 ),c(p 4,p 6 ),d(p 6,p 8 ).
We then attach to predicates adornments indicating the free/bound status of arguments in top-down evaluation, reordering subgoals so that as many arguments as possible are marked as bound: S bf (p 1,p 3 ):− B bﬀ (p 1,p 3,p 2 ).
B bﬀ (p 1,p 8,p 4 ):−a bf (p 1,p 2 ),A bﬀf (p 2,p 7,p 3,p 6 ),b bf (p 3,p 4 ),c bb (p 4,p 6 ), d bf (p 7,p 8 ).
B bﬀ (p 1,p 8,p 4 ):−a bf (p 1,p 2 ),b bf (p 2,p 4 ),c bf (p 4,p 6 ),d bf (p 6,p 8 ).
A bﬀf (p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−a bf (p 1,p 2 ),A bﬀf (p 2,p 7,p 3,p 6 ),b bf (p 3,p 4 ),c bb (p 5,p 6 ), d bf (p 7,p 8 ).
A bﬀf (p 1,p 8,p 4,p 5 ):−a bf (p 1,p 2 ),b bf (p 2,p 4 ),c ﬀ (p 5,p 6 ),d bf (p 6,p 8 ).
The generalized supplementary magic-sets rewriting finally gives the following rule set: r 1 : m B(p 1 ):−m S(p 1 ).

The following version of chart parsing adds control structure to this deduction system: 1.
() Initialize the chart to the empty set, the agenda to the singletonm S(0)}, and n to 0.
2. Repeat the following steps: (a) Repeat the following steps until the agenda is exhausted: i.
Remove a fact from the agenda, called the trigger.
ii. Add the trigger to the chart.
iii. Generate all facts that are immediate consequences of the trigger together with all facts in the chart, and add to the agenda those generated facts that are neither already in the chart nor in the agenda.
(b) () Remove the next fact from the input database and add it to the agenda, incrementing n.
If there is no more fact in the input database, go to step 3.
3. If S(0,n) is in the chart, accept; otherwise reject.
The following is the trace of the algorithm on input string aabbccdd: 1.

8 Conclusion
Our reduction to Datalog brings sophisticated techniques for Datalog query evaluation to the problems 182 of parsing and generation, and establishes a tight bound on the computational complexity of recognition for a wide range of grammars.
In particular, it shows that the use of higher-order λ-terms for semantic representation need not be avoided for the purpose of achieving computational tractability.
