for role labelling, Gildea and Palmer (2002) emphasise the role of deeper syntactic analysis for semantic role labelling.

Beamten, Politikern und Gesch¨aftsleuten wird Schmiergeld bezahlt – Clerks, politicians and businessmen are payed bribes Figure 9: Frame with coordinated RECVR role Underspecification The SALSA annotation scheme allows for underspecification, to represent unresolved word sense ambiguities or optionality (Erk et al., 2003).

Currently, the grammar is further extended, and will be enhanced with stochastic disambiguation, along the lines of (Riezler et al., 2002).

FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), building on Fillmore’s theory of frame semantics, provides definitions of frames and their semantic roles, a lexical database and a manually annotated corpus of example sentences.

First approaches for learning stochastic models for semantic role assignment from annotated corpora have emerged with Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) and Fleischman et al.(2003). While current competitions explore the potential of shallow parsing 1The research reported here was conducted in a cooperation project of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, DFKI Saarbr¨ucken with the Computational Linguistics Department of the University of the Saarland at Saarbr¨ucken.

The basis for our work are annotations of the SALSA/TIGER corpus (Erk et al., 2003), encoded in an XML annotation scheme that extends the syntactic TIGER XML annotation scheme.

and Grammar Resources Frame Semantic Corpus Annotations The basis for our work is a corpus of manual frame annotations, the SALSA/TIGER corpus (Erk et al., 2003).2 The annotation follows the FrameNet definitions of frames and their semantic roles.3 Underlying this corpus is a syntactically annotated corpus of German newspaper text, the TIGER treebank (Brants et al., 2002).
