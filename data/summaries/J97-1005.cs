Several studies have used trained coders to locally and globally structure spontaneous or read speech using the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986), including Grosz and Hirschberg 1992; Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz 1995; Stifleman 1995; Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996.

Finally, a method for segmenting dialogues based on a notion of control was used in Whittaker and Stenton (1988) and Walker and Whittaker (1990).
P88-1015 P90-1010
We believe our results confirm the utility of abstracting from the responses of relatively many naive subjects (our method), and indicate a strong potential for developing coding protocols using smaller numbers of trained coders (as in Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz \[1995\], and Hirschberg and Nakatani \[1996\]).

Hearst's (1994) TextTiling algorithm structures expository text into sequential segments based on term repetition.

These and other studies (e.g., Hirschberg and Litman \[1993\]) also found it useful to distinguish between sentence-final and non-sentence-final intonational contours.

In Litman and Passonneau (1995b), we also present relaxed IR metrics that penalize near misses less heavily (cases where an algorithm does not place a boundary at a statistically validated boundary location, but does place one within one phrase of the validated boundary).
P95-1015
These figures compare with other studies (74% to 95% in Grosz and Hirschberg \[1992\], depending upon discourse feature, and greater than 80% in Hearst \[1993\]).
J93-3003
In sum, relatively few quantitative empirical studies have been made of how to annotate discourse corpora with features of discourse structure, and those recent ones that exist use various models such as the Grosz and Sidner model (1986), an informal notion of topic (Hearst 1994; Flammia and Zue 1995), transactions (Isard and Carletta 1995), Relational Discourse Analysis (Moser and Moore 1995), or control (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990).

Other studies have shown that when both speech and text are available to labelers, segmentation is clearer (Swerts 1995) and reliability improves (Hirschberg and Nakatani 1996).
P96-1038
In Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996), average reliability (measured using the kappa coefficient discussed in Carletta \[1996\]) of segmentinitial labels among 3 coders on 9 monologues produced by the same speaker, labeled using text and speech, is.8 or above for both read and spontaneous speech; values of at least .8 are typically viewed as representing high reliability (see Section 3.2).
J96-2004 P96-1038
The linguistic structure of Grosz and Sidner's (1986) discourse model consists of multiutterance segments and structural relations among them, yielding a discourse tree structure.

NP algorithm can assign multiple boundaries within one prosodic phrase if the phrase contains multiple clauses; these very rare cases are normalized (Passonneau and Litman 1993).

Moser and Moore (1995) investigated the reliability of various features defined in Relational Discourse Analysis (Moser, Moore, and Glendening 1995), based in part on RST.

of Segmentation with Utterance Features The segmental structure of discourse has been claimed to constrain and be constrained by disparate phenomena, e.g., cue phrases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Cohen 1984), plans and intentions (Carberry 1990; Litman and Allen 1990; Grosz and Sidner 1986), prosody (Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986; Butterworth 1980), nominal reference (Webber 1991; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Linde 1979), and tense (Webber 1988; Hwang and Schubert 1992; Song and Cohen 1991).

By statistically analyzing distributions of discourse anaphora with respect to control-based discourse segments, Walker and Whittaker (1990) showed that shifts of attentional state (Grosz and Sidner 1986) occurred when shifts in control were accepted by all dialogue participants.
J86-3001 P90-1010
Our results thus suggest that accurately predicting discourse segmentation involves far more than directly using known linguistic differences between discourse boundaries and nonboundaries, is Here we analyze some of the likely reasons for our 15 Whittaker and Stenton (1988) also show that cue phrases are not reliable for predicting segment boundaries, and similarly argue for the use of multiple linguistic devices.
P88-1015
The results of a study of 953 spoken cue phrases showed that two judges agreed on whether cue phrases illustrated a discourse signaling usage or not in 878 (92.1%) cases (Hirschberg and Litman 1993).
J93-3003
Similar results are reported in Nakatani, Hirschberg, and Grosz (1995) and Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996) for spontaneous speech as well.
J95-2003 P96-1038
Despite this variation, as we pointed out in Litman and Passonneau (1995a), there are certain narratives that the NP, EA, and both machine learning algorithms perform similarly well, or poorly, on.
P95-1015
In addition, if our results were fully automated, they could also be used to enhance the ability of understanding systems to recognize discourse structure, which in turn improves tasks such as information retrieval (Hearst 1994) and plan recognition (Litman and Allen 1990).
P94-1002
Recent work (Moore and Paris 1993; Moore and Pollack 1992) has argued that to account for explanation dialogues, it is necessary to independently model both RST relations and intentions.
J92-4007 J93-4004
As for the utility of our work, even though the algorithms in this paper were produced using some features that were manually coded, once developed, they could be used in reverse to enhance the comprehensibility of text generation systems or the naturalness of text-to-speech systems that already attempt to convey discourse structure (e.g., systems such as Moore and Paris \[1993\], and Hirschberg \[1990\]).

108 Passonneau and Litman Discourse Segmentation 3.1 Methodology: Empirically Derived Segmentation The claim has been made that different people (investigators or subjects) are likely to assign similar segment boundaries or segment relations to a discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Reichman 1985; Mann and Thompson 1988), but it has also been observed that discourse structure can be ambiguous (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1987).
J86-3001
We have not yet determined what causes these differences, although in an early paper on our pilot study, we reported that there is a strong tendency for recall to increase and precision to decrease as boundary strength increases (Passonneau and Litman 1993).
P93-1020
Finally, to interpret our quantitative results, we use the performance of our human subjects as a target for the performance of our algorithms (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992).

Hearst (1994) uses information retrieval metrics (see Section 4.1) to evaluate two versions of TextTiling against independently derived segmentations produced by at least three of seven human judges.

For example, using a threshold of seven subjects yields the set of consensus boundaries, as defined in Hirschberg and Nakatani (1996).

However, in Whittaker and Stenton (1988), a higher level of discourse structure based on topic shifts was agreed upon by at least 4 of 5 judges for 46 of the 56 control shifts.

In Aone and Bennett (1995), machine learning is used to automatically derive anaphora resolution algorithms from automatically produced feature representations; the learned algorithms outperform a manually derived system (whose average recall and precision was 66.5% and 72.9%, respectively).

We use an informal notion of communicative intention as the segmentation criterion, motivated by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Polanyi (1988), who argue that defining a segment as having a coherent goal is more general than establishing a repertoire of specific types of segment goals.
J86-3001
After identifying segments, and core and contributor relations within segments, Moser and Moore (1995) investigate whether cue words occur, where they occur, and 107 Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 1 what word occurs.
P95-1018
the Notion of a Segment A number of alternative proposals have been presented, which relate segments to intentions (Grosz and Sidner 1986), Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) relations (Mann and Thompson 1988) or other semantic relations (Polanyi 1988; Hobbs 1979).
J86-3001
5. Conclusion and Future Directions Our initial hypotheses regarding discourse segmentation were that multiutterance segment units reflect discourse coherence, and that while the semantic dimensions of this coherence may vary, it arises partly from consistency in the speaker's communicative goals (Grosz and Sidner 1986; Polanyi 1988).

Reliability metrics (Krippendorff 1980; Carletta 1996) are designed to give a robust measure of how well distinct sets of data agree with, or replicate, one another.

For example, discourse deixis (demonstrative reference to a referent derivable from prior discourse \[Passonneau 1993; Webber 1991\]) was added to the types of inferential links to code for.

These hypotheses are inspired by centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995), psycholinguistic research (Marslen-Wilson, Levy, and Tyler 1982; Levy 1984), and pilot 9 The cue phrases that occur in the corpus are shown as potential values in Figure 6.

Initial phrase position (cue1) was correlated with discourse signaling uses of cue words in Hirschberg and Litman (1993).
J93-3003
The hypothesis that discourse has a tree structure has frequently been questioned (Dale 1992; Moore and Pollack 1992; Hearst 1994; Walker 1995), and the magnitude of our segmentation task precludes asking subjects to specify hierarchical relations.
J92-4007 P94-1002
As in Grosz and Sidner's (1986) model, Polanyi (1988) proposes that DCUs (analogous to segments) are structured as a tree, and in both models, the tree structure of discourse constrains how the discourse evolves, and how referring expressions are processed.
J86-3001
Hirschberg and Litman (1993) examined a large set of cue words proposed in the literature and showed that certain prosodic and structural features, including a position of first in prosodic phrase, are highly correlated with the discourse uses of these words.
J93-3003
The use of term repetition (and a related notion of lexical cohesion) is not unique to Hearst's work; related studies include Morris and Hirst (1991), Youmans (1991), Kozima (1993), and Reynar (1994).
