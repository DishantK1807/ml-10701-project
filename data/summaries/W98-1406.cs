In English, Objects are typically realized by nouns, although the actual mapping might be rather complex \[Beale and Viegas1996\].

Both of these core lexicons can be expanded with lexical rules to contain around 30,000 entries (\[Viegas et al.1996\]).

Indeed, with the exception of a few researchers (\[Elhadad et a1.1997\] and the incrementalists listed below), the taskoriented view is standard in the generation community.

Note that this is allowed by unification processors \[Elhadad et a1.1997\], but HG gives the added benefits of speed and capability of "fuzzy" constraint processing.

\[Nirenburg et al.1989\] and more recently, \[Wanner and Hovy1996\] advocate a blackboard control mechanism, arguing that the order of sentence planning tasks cannot be pre-determined.

\[Elhadad et a1.1997\] recognizes that constraints on lexical choice come from a wide variety of sources and are multidirectional, making it difficult to determine a systematic ordering in which they should be taken into account.

The general argument is that since sentence planning tasks are not single-step operations, since they do not have to be performed in strict sequence, and since the planner's operation is non-deterministic, each sentence planning task should be implemented by a separate module or by several modules (see, e.g., \[Wanner and Hovy1996\]).

-1 Introduction This paper addresses the area of text generation known as microplanning \[Levelt1989, Panaget1994, Huang and Fiedler1996\], or sentence planning \[Rambow and Korelsky1992\]; \[Wanner and Hovy1996\].
