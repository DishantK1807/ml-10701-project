The techniques of Charniak #281997#29, Collins #281997#29, and Ratnaparkhi #281997#29 achieved roughly comparable results using the same sets of training and test data.

The parsing models of Charniak #282000#29 and Collins #282000#29 add more complex features to the parsing model that we use as our baseline.

While this does not re#0Dect the state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ task achieved by the more the complex models of Charniak #282000#29 and Collins #282000#29, we regard it as a reasonable baseline for the investigation of corpus e#0Bects on statistical parsing.

Models 2 and 3 of Collins #281997#29 add some slightly more elaborate features to the probability model, as do the additions of Charniak #282000#29 to the model of Charniak #281997#29.
