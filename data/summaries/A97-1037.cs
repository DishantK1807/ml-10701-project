of the Framework and Comparison with Other Systems realization of deep-syntactic structures in NLG (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).

Automatically generated text includes paragraphs describing the relations between classes, and paral(Lavoie et al., 1996) focuses on an earlier version of MoDEx which did not yet include customization.

So far the framework has been used successfully for building a wide variety of applications in different domains and for different languages: NLG:  Realization of English DSyntSs via SSyntS level for the domains of meteorology (MeteoCogent; Kittredge and Lavoie, 1998) and object modeling (ModelExplainer; Lavoie et al., 1997).

Figure 2 illustrates a DSyntS from a meteorological application, MeteoCogent (Kittredge and Lavoie, 1998), represented using the standard graphical notation and also the RealPro ASCII notation used internally in the framework (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997).

The resulting text structure is then passed to the text realizer which uses REALPRO (Lavoie and Rambow, 1997), a sentence realizer, to realize each individual syntactic representation in the text structure.
