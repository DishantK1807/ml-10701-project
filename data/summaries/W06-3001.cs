Chai and Ron (2004) propose a discourse modeling for QA interactions in which they keep track of thematic transitions between questions.

For example, in the information browsing tasks in (Kato et al., 2004), there is not a global topic encompassing the whole interaction, but the information needs of the user are given by the information he is encountering as the interaction proceeds, that is, he is browsing the information in a free way, without having particular goals or particular pieces of information he wants to obtain in mind.

There is a topic shift, as defined by Chai and Jin (2004), where the main topic becomes an entity related to the entity the preceding question was about.

In more recent studies of interactive QA special attention has been paid to the thematic relatedness of questions, (Chai and Ron, 2004), (Kato et al., 2004).

We can speak of thematic nesting of segments, which seems to be analogous to the intentional structure in taskoriented dialogues as in (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), also allowing for reference with implicit devices to entities in the superordinate segments after the subordinated ones have been closed.

As pointed out by several authors (Kato et al., 2004), (Chai and Ron, 2004), the information needs of users interacting with QA systems often go beyond a single stand-alone question.

Although Chai and Jin (2004) only consider transitions among questions in dialogues about events, most of our relations have a correspondence with theirs.

Upon Ahrenberg et al.(1990) this is given by the discourse goals, rather than the overall goals of the user, as is the case in task-oriented dialogues, (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).
