Melamed (1999) aligns texts using correspondence points taken either from orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al., 1992) or from a seed translation lexicon.

The latter approach uses other filtering parameters: maximum point ambiguity level, point dispersion and angle deviation (Melamed, 1999, pp.

Martin Kay and Martin Röscheisen (1993) also needed clearly delimited sentences.

Two sentences were aligned if the number of correspondence points associating them was greater than an empirically defined threshold: “[...] more than some minimum number of times [...]” (Martin Kay and Martin Röscheisen, 1993, p.128).

In Ido Dagan et al.(1993) noisy points were filtered out by deleting frequent words.

Using lexical information, Kenneth Church (1993) showed that cheap alignment of text segments was still possible exploiting orthographic cognates (Michel Simard et al., 1992), instead of sentence delimiters.

This approach is similar to Melamed (1999) but, in contrast, it is statistically supported and uses no heuristics.

Moreover, the methodology does not depend on the way candidate correspondence points are generated, i.e. although we used homographs with equal frequencies, we could have also bootstrapped the process using cognates (Michel Simard et al.1992) or a small bilingual lexicon to identify equivalents of words or expressions (Dekai Wu 1994; Pascale Fung and Kathleen McKeown 1997; Melamed 1999).

Melamed (1999) also filtered candidate correspondence points obtained from orthographic cognates.

Early work by Peter Brown et al.(1991) and William Gale and Kenneth Church (1991) aligned sentences which had a proportional number of words and characters, respectively.
