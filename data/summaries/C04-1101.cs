Its major applications cover syntactic structural disambiguation (Brent, 1990), information extraction and question answering (Li, 2002), language generation and machine translation (Dorr, 2002).

Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997).

Later, Hitzeman (Hitzeman, 1995) described a method for analyzing temporal structure of a discourse by taking into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhe2 The structure comprises a culmination, an associated preparatory process and a consequence state.

Generally, constraints were used to support syntactic disambiguation (Brent, 1990) or to generate acceptable sentences (Dorr, 2002).

It has been used to explain semantics of temporal expressions (Moens, 1988; Webber, 1988), to constrain possible temporal interpretations (Hitzeman, 1995; Sing, 1997), or to generate appropriate temporally conjoined clauses (Dorr, 2002).

Passonneau (Passonneau, 1988), Brent (Brent, 1990 and Sing (Sing, 1997) determined intra-sentential relations by accounting for temporal or causal connectives.

Lascarides and Asher (Lascarides, 1991) investigated various contextual effects on rhetorical relations (such as narration, elaboration, explanation, background and result).
P91-1008
Moens and Steedmen (Moens, 1988) developed a tripartite structure of events 2, and emphasized it was the notion of causation and consequence that played a central role in defining temporal relations of events.

Linguistic Features with Machine Learning Approach Previous efforts in corpus-based NLP have incorporated machine learning methods to coordinate multiple linguistic features, for example, in accent restoration (Yarowsky, 1994) and event classification (Siegel, 1998).
