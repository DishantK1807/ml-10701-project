Sondheimer Meta-rules as a Basis for Processing Ill-Formed Input Nor does a metric reflect the fact that there are clear patterns of error, such as those that have been reported in linguistic studies (Fromkin 1973) and in application studies (Thompson 1980, Eastman and McLean 1981).

In the study by Eastman and McLean (1981) this occurred in 3.3% of all queries.

For instance, Fineman (1983) reports that in an experiment where users were constrained to discrete speech, ill-formedness occurred in as little as 2% of the input.

Except for the one metarule regarding incorrect phrase ordering in Section 3.2.4, the semantic meta-rules themselves are independent of whether proposing a phrase for a given case in a frame is based on syntactic considerations or other criteria (for example, Schank et al.1980). Naturally, the primitive conditions and actions of a given set of rules will depend on a particular formalism.

We have begun research on how to use pragmatic knowledge in an information-seeking environment for this purpose; see Carberry (1983, 1984) and Ramshaw and Weischedel (1984).

The EPISTLE project (Jensen and Heidorn 1983) is employing bottom-up parsing.

Kaplan (1978) developed a strategy to give more useful responses when a data base query yields a negative response, for example, when no entity satisfies the desired conditions.
T78-1029
In one study (Eastman and McLean 1981), subject-verb disagreement occurred in 2.3% of the English queries.

Many of our examples here are reformulations of our earlier work (Weischedel et al.1978, Kwasny and Sondheimer 1979, Weischedel and Black 1980) within the uniform framework of meta-rules.

This is not the only alternative in the face of failure to parse even with relaxation; Jensen and Heidorn (1983) present heuristics for what to pass to the semantic interpreter in this case, given bottom-up parsing.
A83-1015
In Weischedel and Sondheimer (1982), we extended that heuristic to allow for turntaking in dialogues and to allow expansions as well as American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1983 171 Ralph M.

Weischedel and Black (1980) presented a technique for associating error messages with states where the parser blocked.
J80-2003
Some preliminary evidence (Weischedel and Black 1980) indicates that this heuristic frequently does indicate where the problem is, if the normative system is nearly deterministic, for example, because the grammar is a fairly constrained subset of English or because semantic criteria filter out parses that have no meaning in the application domain.
J80-2003
In another experiment (Eastman and McLean 1981), 693 English queries to a data base system were analyzed.
J81-4004
Many syntactic formalisms have a similar framework for expressing rules: these include context-free grammars, augmented phrase structure grammars (Heidorn 1975), Programmar (Winograd 1972), the linguistic string parser (Sager 1981), Lifer (Hendrix et al.1978), and augmented transition networks (ATNs) (Woods 1970).
T75-2001
For instance, in an extensive study (Thompson 1980) including 1615 inputs, only 1093 were parsable, and an overall total of 446 contained various kinds of errors: 161 with vocabulary problems, 72 with punctuation errors, 62 with ungrammaticality, and 61 with Copyright 1984 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.

In one, case constraints are expressed as sets of logical formulas; in the other, KL-ONE is used to encode case frames (Sondheimer et al.1984). Four design issues are considered in the following sections.
P84-1024
c) whether examples exist in which the constraint carries meaning, d) whether the constraint, if classified as normative, trims the search space, and e) whether a processing strategy for the constraint can be stated more easily as a modification of normative processing, as in the case of conjunction (Woods 1973) or the case of contextual ellipsis in the data base environment (Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1982).

Consequently, many relaxation strategies and systems in the literature (for example, Hendrix, et al.1978; Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981; Weischedel and Sondheimer 1982) have been proposed and implemented in that framework.

The EPISTLE project (Jensen and Heidorn 1983, Miller et al.1981) employs this alternative for grammatical violations.
A83-1015
Semantic constraints may be expressed in several formalisms, such as semantic nets (Bobrow and Webber 1980a,b; Sondheimer et al.1984), first-order logic, and production rules (for example, PROLOG, Warren et al.1977). It is generally agreed that all are formally equivalent to first-order logic.
