In machine transliteration, the noisy channel model (NCM), based on a phoneme-based approach, has recently received considerable attention (Meng et al.2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003; Knight & Graehl, 1998).

Virga and Khudanpur (2003) reported 8.3% absolute accuracy drops when converting from Pinyin to Chinese characters, due to homophone confusion.

The Viterbi algorithm produces the best sequence by maximizing the overall probability, ),,( γβαP . In CLIR or multilingual corpus alignment (Virga and Khudanpur, 2003), N-best results will be very helpful to increase chances of correct hits.

The Chinese-English backward transliteration process is also called back-transliteration, or C2E (Knight & Graehl, 1998).

Several phoneme-based techniques have been proposed in the recent past for machine transliteration using transformation-based learning algorithm (Meng et al.2001; Jung et al, 2000; Virga & Khudanpur, 2003) and using finite state transducer that implements transformation rules (Knight & Graehl, 1998), where both handcrafted and data-driven transformation rules have been studied.
