It assumes that the distance of the positions relative to the diagonal of the (j, i) plane is the dominating factor: r(i _j I) p(ilj, J, I) = (7), Ei,=l r(i' j ) As described in (Brown et al., 1993), the EM algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters of the model.

Pruning methods have already been used successfully in machine translation (Tillmann et al., 1997a).

(Wang and Waibel, 1997) describe an algorithm based on A*-search.

In our search procedure, we use a mixture-based alignment model that slightly differs from the model introduced as Model 2 in (Brown et al., 1993).

This is why we also asked five experts to classify independently the produced translations into three categories, being the same as in (Wang and Waibel, 1997): Correct translations are grammatical and convey the same meaning as the input.

in Statistical Machine Translation In the last few years, there has been a number of papers considering the problem of finding an efficient search procedure (Wu, 1996), (Tillmann et al., 1997a), (TiUmann et al., 1997b), (Wang and Waibel, 1997).

In (Tillmann et al., 1997b) text transformations in the source language are used to adapt the word ordering in the source strings to the target language grammar.

(Tillmann et al., 1997b) and (Tillmann et al., 1997a) propose a search procedure based on dynamic programming, that examines the source string sequentially.

(Wu, 1996) formulates a DP search for stochastic bracketing transduction grammars.

960 1.2 Alignment with Mixture Distribution Several papers have discussed the first issue, especially the problem of word alignments for bilingual corpora (Brown et al., 1993), (Dagan et al., 1993), (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993), (Fung and Church, 1994), (Vogel et al., 1996).

(Vogel et al., 1996) report better perplexity results on the Verbmobil Corpus with their HMMbased alignment model in comparison to Model 2 of (Brown et al., 1993).

The underlying translation model is Model 2 from (Brown et al., 1993).
