Collocation Extraction: Needs, Feeds and Results of an Extraction System for German Julia Ritz Institut f r Maschinelle Sprachverarbeitung (IMS) Universit t Stuttgart Azenbergstr.
12 70174 Stuttgart Germany Julia.Ritz@ims.uni-stuttgart.de Abstract This paper provides a speci cation of requirements for collocation extraction systems, taking as an example the extraction of noun + verb collocations from German texts.
A hybrid approach to the extraction of habitual collocations and idioms is presented, aiming at a detailed description of collocations and their morphosyntax for natural language generation systems as well as to support learner lexicography.
1 Introduction
Since Firth rst described collocations as habitual word combinations in the 1950ies (cf.
Firth, 1968), a number of papers focusing on collocation extraction have been published (see the overviews in (Evert, 2004; Bartsch, 2004)).
Most studies concentrate on the extraction from English.
However, the procedures proposed in these studies cannot necessarily be applied to other languages as English stands out, e.g. with respect to con gurationality.
They rely on the fact that the syntax of English (and of all con gurational languages) provides positional clues to the grammatical function of noun phrases, and they exploit this concept by means of window-based, adjacency-based or pattern-based extraction, combined with association measures to identify co-occurrences that are more frequent than statistically expectable.
What these procedures do not cover is semantic-oriented de nitions like (a) and (b).
a. A collocation is a combination of a free (’autosematic’) element (the base) and a lexically determined (’synsemantic’) element (the collocate, which may lose (some of) its meaning in a collocation) (adapted from (Hausmann, 1979; Hausmann, 1989; Hausmann, 2003)).
b. A collocation is a word combination whose semantic and/or syntactic properties cannot be fully predicted from those of its components, and which therefore has to be listed in a lexicon (Evert, 2004).
We argue that linguistic knowledge could not only improve results (Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993) but is essential when extracting collocations from certain languages: this knowledge provides other applications (or a lexicon user, respectively) with a ne-grained description of how the extracted collocations are to be used in context.
Additional requirements resulting from the needs of dictionary users are described in (Hausmann, 2003; Heid and Gouws, 2005) and are of interest not only in lexicography but can also be transferred to the eld of natural language generation.
These requirements in uence the development of collocation extraction systems, which motivates this paper.
The structure of the paper is as follows: In chapter 2, the requirements, depending on factors like the targeted language, are presented.
We then discuss and suggest methods to meet the given needs.
A documentation of ongoing work on the extraction of noun + verb collocations from German texts is given in chapter 3.
Chapter 4 gives a conclusion and an outlook on work still to be done.
2 Collocation
Extraction Tools: Requirements The development of a collocation extraction tool depends on the following conditions: 1.
properties of the targeted language 41 2.
the targeted application 3.
the kinds of collocations to be extracted 4.
the degree of detail Whereas issues 1 to 3 deal with the collocation itself, issue 4 is focused at the collocation in context, i.e. its behaviour (from a syntagmatic analysis point of view) or, respectively, its use (from a generation perspective).
2.1 Language
factors One of the most important factors is, of course, the targeted language and its main characteristics with respect to word formation and word order.
Depending on word and constituent order, the pros and cons of positional vs.
relational extraction patterns need to be considered.
Positional patterns (based on adjacency or a ’window’) are adequate for con gurational languages, but in languages with rather free word order, words belonging to a phrase or collocation do not necessarily occur within a prede ned span1.
Extracting word combinations using relational patterns (represented by part of speech (PoS) tags or dependency rules) offers a higher level of abstraction and improves the results (cf.
(Krenn, 2000b; Smadja, 1993)).
However, this requires part of speech tagging and possibly partial parsing.
A system extracting word combinations by applying relational patterns, obviously pro ts from language speci c knowledge about phrase and sentence structure and word formation.
One example is the order of adjective + noun pairs: in English and German, the adjective occurs left of the noun, whereas in French, the adjective can occur left or right of the noun.
Another example is compounding, handled differently in different languages: noun + noun in English, typically separated by a white space (e.g.
death penalty) vs.
noun + prepositional phrase in French (e.g.
peine de mort) vs.
compound noun in German (e.g.
Todesstrafe). Consequently, language speci c word formation rules need to be considered when designing extraction patterns.
For languages with a rich inectional morphology where the individual word forms are rather rare, frequency counts and results 1In German, e.g., in usual verb second constructions with a full verb in the left sentence bracket (topological eld theory see (W llstein-Leisten et al., 1997)), particles of particle verbs appear in the right sentence bracket.
The middle eld (containing arguments and possibly adjuncts of the verb) is of undetermined length.
of statistical analyses are little reliable.
To allow a grouping of words sharing the same lemma, lemmatisation is crucial.
2.2 Application
factors Other important factors are the targeted application (i.e.
analysis vs.
generation) and, to some extent resulting from it, factors (3).
and (4.), above.
Depending on the purpose of the tool (or lexicon, respectively), the collocation de nition chosen as an outline may vary, e.g. including transparent and regular collocations (cf.
(Tutin, 2004)) for generation purposes, but excluding them for analysis purposes.
In addition, a more detailed description of the use of collocations in context (e.g.
information about preferences with respect to the determiner, etc).
is needed for generation purposes than for text analysis.
2.3 Factors
of collocation de nition Collocations can be distinguished on two levels: the formal level and the content level.
On the formal level, a collocation can be classi ed according to the structural relation between its elements.
Typical patterns are shown in table 12 (taken from (Heid and Gouws, 2005)).
On the content level, there are regular, transparent, and opaque collocations (according to (Tutin, 2004)) and, taking de nition (b) into account, idioms as well.
However, as a classi cation at the content level needs detailed semantic description, we see no means of accomplishing this goal other than manually at the moment.
2.4 Contextual
factors (Hausmann, 2003; Heid and Gouws, 2005; Evert et al., 2004) argue that collocations have strong preferences with respect to their morphosyntax (see examples (1) and (2)) and may be combined (see example (3)).
The collocation in example (1) (’to charge somebody’) is restricted with respect to the determiner (null determiner) of the base, whereas the same base shows a strong preference for a (de nite or inde nite) determiner when used 2Abbreviations in table 1: advl adverbial prd predicative subj subject obj object pobj prepositional object dat dative case gen genitive case quant quantifying 42 No.

Therefore, the extraction of contextual information (called ’context parameters’ in the following) should be integrated into the collocation extraction process.
3 Extracting
noun + verb collocations from German The standard architecture for collocation extraction systems contains three stages (cf.
(Krenn, 2000)): a more or less detailed linguistic analysis of the corpus text (preprocessing), an extraction step and a statistic ltering of the extracted word combinations.
We follow this architecture (see gure 1).
However, our hypothesis differs from other approaches.
Collocations are often restricted with respect to their morphosyntax.
We test to what extent they can be identi ed via these restrictions.
3.1 Approach
In an experiment, we extracted relational word combinations (verb + subject/object pairs) from German newspaper texts.
The syntactic patterns for the extraction of these combinations concentrate on verbnal constructions as in example (4) and verb second constructions with a modal verb in the left sentence bracket according to the topological eld theory (see (W llstein-Leisten et al., 1997)) as in example (5).
The reason is that, in these constructions, the particle forms one word with the verb (see example (6)), as opposed to usual verb second constructions (see example (7)).
Thus, we need not recombine verb + particle groups that appear separatedly.

(’He puts a sign up.’) (He puts up a sign.) Preprocessing As data, we used a collection of 300 million words from German newspaper texts dating from 1987 to 1993.
The corpus is tokenized and PoStagged by the Treetagger (Schmid, 1994), then chunk annotated by YAC (Kermes, 2003).
The chunker YAC determines phrase boundaries and heads, and disambiguates agreement information as far as possible.
It is based on the corpus query language cqp (Christ et al., 1999)3, which can in turn be used to query the chunk annotations.
Data Extraction The syntactic patterns used to extract verb + subject/object combinations are based on PoS tags and chunk information.
These patterns are represented using cqp macros (see gure 2).
The cqp syntax largely overlaps with regular expressions.

In line (3), a word PoS tagged KOUS (subordinating conjunction) or VMFIN ( nite modal verb) is requested, followed by an arbitrary number (’*’) of words without any restrictions (line (4)).
Line (5) indicates the start of a nominal phrase (np), line (11) its end.
The elements within this np (one or more words, as indicated by ’+’) must not be part of a prepositional phrase (pp) to avoid the extraction of pp + verb (line (6), see example (8)).
In addition, the np must be neither a named entity (ne, see line (7)) nor a pronoun (pron, line (8)) nor an np of measure (meas, line (9), see example (9)), nor must its head be a cardinal number (card, line (10), see example (10)).
An arbitrary number of words may follow the np (punctuation marks (PoS tagged $.), subordinating conjunctions and nite modal verbs excluded).
At least one verb is required (line (13), all PoS tags for verbs start with a capital ’V’4).
Line (14) indicates the end of the subclause or sentence.

By applying the macro to the corpus, all sequences of words matching the pattern are extracted.
From these sequences, the following information is made explicit (cf.
(Heid and Ritz, 2005)): a41 lemma of the noun (potential base) a41 lemma of the verb (potential collocate) a41 number of the noun (singular, plural) a41 case of the noun 4The search condition is underspeci ed with respect to the niteness and the role of the verb (auxiliary, modal or full verb).
Thus, line (13) matches verbal complexes.
It also covers cases where full verbs are accidentally PoS tagged modal or auxiliary verbs.

The database can be queried via SQL.
See gure 3 for a sample query asking for distinct lemma pairs, ordered by frequency (in descending order), and gures 5 and 4 for more speci c queries and some of their results.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS f, n_lemma, v_lemma FROM comfea1 GROUP BY n_lemma, v_lemma ORDER BY f DESC; Figure 3: sample query Filtering The instances extracted in the previous step are grouped according to noun and verb lemmas, i.e. instances of the same lemma pair form one group.
Within these groups, a relative frequency distribution is computed for each of the features.
For queriability reasons, the results of this postprocessing are also stored in the database, as shown in gure 1.
A word combination is chosen as a collocation candidate if a preference (speci ed by a threshold of e.g. 60% of the occurrences) for a certain feature value (singular / plural, presence / absence of a determiner, de nite / inde nite / demonstrative / possessive / quantifying determiner, presence of modifying elements) is discovered.
3.2 Results
From 300 million words, we extracted more than 1.3 million noun + verb combinations, the instances of 726,488 different lemma pairs.
10,934 of these lemma pairs appeared with a minimum SELECT COUNT(*) AS f, n_lemma, v_lemma FROM comfea1 WHERE neg = ’+’ GROUP BY n_lemma, v_lemma ORDER BY f DESC; f | n_lemma | v_lemma 1152| Rede | sein 748 | Angabe | machen 322 | Einigung | erzielen 228 | Chance | haben 217 | Forderung | erf llen 188 | Problem | l sen 151 | Rolle | spielen 131 | Auskunft | geben 127 | Stellungnahme | abgeben 120 | Alternative | geben 110 | Interesse | haben 110 | Angabe | best tigen 102 | Geld | haben Figure 4: sample query: word combinations from negated phrases frequency of 10.
Sample results are shown in gure 65.
We evaluated collocation candidates with a frequency of at least 100.
Within the 323 most frequent collocation candidates, we found 213 collocations (including 11 idioms).
This corresponds to a precision of 66% (see table 26).
As a comparison, a window-based study was carried out on the same (PoS-tagged) data.
In this study, the window was de ned in a way that up to two tokens (excluding sentence boundaries and nite full verbs) were allowed to appear between a noun (PoS tagged NN) and a nite full verb (PoS tagged VVFIN).
Log-likelihood7 was used as an association measure.
The precision of this approach is 41%8.

For chosing collocation candidates, a threshold of 60% is used.
However, additional preferences are displayed for values greater than 50%.

First, there is the problem of semantic equivalence: does the combination express more than its elements (consider example (11))?
Secondly, de nitions (a) and (b) may judge the same example differently: Anteil nehmen (example (12)) is usually agreed upon to be a support verb construction, but the distinction of the noun Anteil as the base (making the main contribution to the meaning) is questionable.
On the other hand, its unpredictable syntactic properties (e.g.
null determiner) and semantics (partial loss of meaning of the collocate nehmen) make it clear that this combination has to be listed in a lexicon.

Pro ting from linguistic information (PoS tagging, chunking), the tool reaches a precision of 66% on the top 323 candidates by frequency.
On the same data, a windowbased approach relying only on PoS information reached a precision of 41%.
As the extracted word combinations as well as their context parameters (including the original evidence from the corpus) are stored in a database, the tool also supports explorative research in lexicography.
However, there are some enhancements worth doing: Especially when dealing with low frequencies, relative frequencies lack reliability.
Therefore, we suggest computing a con dence interval as proposed in (Evert, 2004b; Heid and Ritz, 2005; Ritz, 2005).
As indicated in gure 1, several postprocessing steps can be added to the system, e.g. enabling a sorting of collocation candidates with compound nouns by the morphological heads of their base.
In order to get more data, the extraction from verb rst and verb second constructions is also possible.
To complete the tool, extraction patterns for collocations of different syntactic relations (cf.
table 1) could be designed.
