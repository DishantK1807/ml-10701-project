It provides standardized biomedical concept relations and synonyms (Humphreys et al.1998). The UMLS has been widely used in many natural language processing tasks, including information retrieval (Eichmann et al.1998), extraction (Rindflesch et al.2000), and text summarization (Elhadad et al.2004; Fiszman et al.2004). The UMLS includes the Metathesaurus (MT), which contains over one million biomedical concepts and the Semantic Network (SN), which represents a high-level abstraction from the UMLS Metathesaurus.

For example, researchers (Turney 2002; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003) have identified semantic correlation between words and views: positive words tend to appear more frequently in positive movie and product reviews and newswire article sentences that have a positive semantic orientation and vice versa for negative reviews or sentences with a negative semantic orientation.

Most systems apply one-size-fits-all lexicosyntactic patterns to identify definitions (Liang et al.2001; Blair-Goldensohn et al.2004; Hildebrandt et al.2004; Cui et al.2005). For example, the pattern “NP, (such as|like|including) query term” can be used to identify the definition “New research in mice suggests that drugs such as Ritalin quiet hyperactivity” (Liang et al.2001). Few existing systems, however, have explored the relations between the semantic type (denoted as SDT) of a definiendum (i.e., a defined term (DT)) and the semantic types (denoted as SDef) of terms in its definiens (i.e., definition).

Work Systems have used named entities (e.g., “PEOPLE” and “LOCATION”) to assist in information extraction (Agichtein and Gravano 2000) and question answering (Moldovan et al.2002; Filatova and Prager 2005).
