Not only do all linguistic theories refer to some reformulation of the traditional notion of valency (in the form of 0grid, subcategorization list, argument list, or extended domain of locality); there is a growing number of parsers based on binary relations between words (Eisner, 1997; Maruyama, 1990).

Dependency Unification Grammar (DUG, Hellwig (1986)) defines a tree-like data structure for the representation of syntactic analyses.

In PSbased accounts, the construction is represented by phrasal categories, and extraction is limited 1)3-" bounding nodes (e.g., Haegeman (1994), Becker et al.(1991)). In dependency-based accounts, the construction is represented by the dependency relation, which is typed or labelled to indicate constructional distinctions which are configurationally defined in PSG.

J This result has been criticised to apply only to impoverished DGs which do not properly represent formally the expressivity of contemporary DG variants (Neuhaus & BrSker, 1997), and our use of a context-free backbone with further constraints imposed by dependency relations further supports the view that DG is not a notational ~riant of context-free grammar.
