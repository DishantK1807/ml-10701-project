In this paper, we give an overview of NLPWin, a multi-application natural language analysis and generation system under development at Microsoft Research (Jensen et al., 1993; Gamon et al., 1997; Heidorn 2000), incorporating analysis systems for 7 languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish).

The most common answer is component testing, where the component is compared against a standard of goodness, usually the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993), allowing a numerical score of precision and recall (e.g.
