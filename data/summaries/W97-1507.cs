As shown in the following function structure example for the sentence "The people that buy silver love it.", different functions can be filled by one and the same constituent: clause Senser: \[-~ nominal-group Deictic: det \[ Spelling: "the" \] Thing: noun \[ Spelling: "people" \] Qualifier: dependent-clause \[Spelling: \] "that buy silver" Process: /initeJ_ SpeUing: "love"\] Phenomenon: 2~\] nominal-group \[ SpeUing: "it" \] Subject: D Theme: \["i'\] Directcomplement: \[7\] Given the notational equivalence of HPSG and systemic grammar first mentioned by (Carpenter, 1992) and (Zajac, 1992), and further elaborated in (Henschel, 1995), one can characterize a systemic grammar as a large type hierarchy with multiple (conjunctive and disjunctive) and multi-dimensional inheritance with an open-world semantics.

(Reiter, 1994)).

In (Busemann, 1996) both approaches are combined resulting in a practical small generation grammar tool.

The following type axioms taken from the large systemic English grammar NXGI~L (Matthiessen, 1983) shall illustrate the nature of systems in a systemic grammar: nominal_group = class_name \[ individual_name.

Our approach shows some similarities to that proposed by (Rayner and Carter, 1996) for improving parsing performance by grammar pruning and specialization with respect to a training corpus.

The structures generated are still the 'full' grammatical structures that are produced by the corresponding full grammar: if, however, certain constituent descriptions are always unified (conflated in systemic terminology) then, analogously to (Rayner and Carter, 1996), they are candidates for replacement by a single constituent description in the extracted subgrammar.

Computational instances of systemic grammar are successfully employed in some of the largest and most influential text generation projects--such as, for example, PENMAN (Mann, 1983), COMMUNAL (Fawcett and Tucker, 1990), TECHDOC (KSsner and Stede, 1994), Drafter (Paris and Vander Linden, 1996), and Gist (Not and Stock, 1994).
