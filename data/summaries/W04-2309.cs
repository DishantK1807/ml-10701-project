We show how the Information State (IS) (Matheson et al., 2000) representing the state of the dialogue in the PTT (Poesio and Traum, 1998) model of dialogue must be updated to reflect this new information, with Conversational Acts (Matheson et al., 2000) that do not simply indicate DofE as in (Thomas and Matheson, 2003), but also annotate the relation underlying the expectation being denied.

We address how this information might be modelled in the PTT (Poesio and Traum, 1998) model of dialogue by adapting the Information State (IS) (Matheson et al., 2000) in order to facilitate more responsive generation from the system upon hearing the DofE.
