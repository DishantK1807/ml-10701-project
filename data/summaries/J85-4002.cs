For this reason systems which are designed for language generation have often employed either special choice systems of the type found in systemic grammar (Halliday 1968), or have had pattern-based grammars of the type found in PHRAN/PHRED and in unification grammar (Kay 1984), which require a sophisticated mechanism for dealing with the interaction of the patterns.

In this regard, the system within which PHRED operates does not promote the desirable interaction among text planning and structural choices, as suggested by Appelt (1982) and Danlos (1984).

Becker (1975) presents the idea of the phrasal lexicon as a means of handling canned and idiomatic phrases.

Fillmore, Kay, and O'Connor 1984; Lakoff 1984), focusing on expressions that exhibit certain regularities and obey some grammatical constraints but whose behavior cannot be determined by "core" grammar.

McKeown 1982, Appelt 1983).

The restriction process described in this paper is similar to the unification procedure in TELEGRAM (Appelt 1983), which employs a unification grammar.

The VIE-LANG system (Steinacker and Buchberger 1983) shares a "syntacticosemantic" lexicon, but the generator accesses this lexicon using a discrimination net with specialized choice knowledge.

The pattern-concept pair representation falls into a class of linguistic representations known as feature systems, including lexical functional grammar (Bresnan 1982), functional grammar (Kay 1979) and functional unification grammar (Kay 1984).
