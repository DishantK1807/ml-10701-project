There is, however, a large body of work using morphological analysis to define cluster-based translation models similar to ours but in a supervised manner (Zens and Ney, 2004), (Niessen and Ney, 2004).

Brown et al.(1993), consist of discrete probability distributions with separate parameters for each unique pairing of a source and target types; no attempt is made to leverage structure within the event spaces E and F during parameter estimation.

Aligning tokens in parallel sentences using the IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993), (Och and Ney, 2003) may require less information than full-blown translation since the task is constrained by the source and target tokens present in each sentence pair.

2). Here we consider a simple interpolation scheme; they could also be used within a backoff model (Yang and Kirchhoff, 2006).
