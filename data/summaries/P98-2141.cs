In addition, • Existence of efficient disambiguation scheme by dealing with best-only substructures utilizing stored empirical translation examples compiled from a linguistic database, the explosion of structural ambiguities is significantly constrained (Furuse, 1996).

Furthermore, ambiguity in the combination of patterns, which have not been constrained by the linguistic levels, is also dissolved incrementally by using the total sum of the semantic distances of patterns contained (Furuse, 1996).

TDMT has the following key features: • Utilization of Constituent Boundary Patterns (CB-Patterns) (Fumse, 1994b) (Furuse, 1996) CB-Patterns based on meaningful information units are applied to parse an input incrementally and produce translations based on the synchronization of the source and target language structure pairs (Abeillr, 1990) (Shieber, 1990).
C90-3045 C96-1070
We prepared 774 and 689 examples for the expressions respectively, and conducted the experiment in increments of 100 examples (Furuse, 1994a).

(Sumita, 1991) provides further details of the semantic distance caluculation.

Transfer-Driven Machine Translation (TDMT) (Furuse, 1994a) (Mima, 1997) has been proposed, and an efficient method of spoken dialog translation.

(Furuse, 1996) provides further details of the algorithm for incremental CB-Parsing.

Pattern Application The incremental application of CB-Pattems is based on the idea of incremental chart parsing (Furuse, 1996) (Amtrup, 1995) with notions of linguistic levels.
