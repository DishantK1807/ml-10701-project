Selector for multi-engine MT In our pilot experiment, our selectors (Akiba et al., 2002; Yasuda et al., 2002) outperformed not only the component systems but also a conventional selector using N-gram (Callison-Burch et al., 2001).

In order to overcome these problems, simpler models, such as word-for-word translation models (Brown et al., 1993) or HMM models (Och et al., 2000), have been introduced to determine the initial parameters and to bootstrap the training.

Conventional approaches to automatic evaluation include methods (Su, 1992; Yasuda et al., 2001) that automatically assign one of several ranks to MT output according to a single edit distance between an MT output and a correct translation example.
