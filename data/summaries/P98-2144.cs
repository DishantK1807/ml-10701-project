Other techniques to speed-up the parser are proposed in (Makino et al., 1998).
P98-2132
'Wa' The main usage of the postposition 'wa' is divided into the following two patternsS: â€¢ If two PPs with the postposition 'wa' appear consecutively, we treat the first PP as 5These patterns are almost similar to the ones in (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994).

We implemented our parser and grammar in LiLFeS (Makino et al., 1998) s, a featurestructure description language developed by our group.
P98-2132
In (Torisawa and Tsujii, 1996), an efficient HPSG parser is proposed, and our preliminary experiments show that the parsing time of the effident parser is about three times shorter than that of the naive one.
C96-2160
In (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), the parser always attaches a phrase with a comma to the second nearest possible phrase.
