This paper shows how an existing infrastructure for language engineering research – GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002a; Cunningham, 2002) – has been used successfully as an NLP teaching environment, in addition to being a successful vehicle for building NLP applications and reusable components (Maynard et al., 2002; Maynard et al., 2001).

A JAVA development environment like JBuilder and VisualCafe can be used for this and the next stages, if the students are familiar with them; • compile the class, and any others that it uses, into a Java Archive (JAR) file (GATE 2For further details and an example see (Cunningham et al., 2002b).

The GATE API (Application Programming Interface) is fully documented in Javadoc and also examples are given in the comprehensive User Guide (Cunningham et al., 2002b).

JAPE is a version of CPSL (Common Pattern Specification Language) (Appelt, 1996) and is used to describe patterns to match and annotations to be created as a result (for further details see (Cunningham et al., 2002b)).

If evaluated against the requirements for teaching environments discussed in (Loper and Bird, 2002), GATE covers them all quite well.

However, other such modules, e.g., those from NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002), can be used for such assignments.

from a Teaching Perspective GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002a) is an architecture, a framework and a development environment for human language technology modules and applications.
