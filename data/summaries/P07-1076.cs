This makes SRES patterns more general, and allows to recognize instances in sentences inaccessible to the simple surface patterns of systems such as (Brin 1998; Riloff and Jones 1999; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002).

We evaluate the methods using SRES (Feldman and Rosenfeld 2006) – a Web RE system, designed to extend and improve KnowItAll (Etzioni, Cafarella et al.2005). The contributions of this paper are as follows: • We show how to automatically generate the validating patterns for the target relation arguments, and how to integrate the results produced by the validating patterns into the whole relation extraction system.

Such methods are naturally much less precise and produce many entityrecognition errors (Feldman and Rosenfeld 2006).

Since the supervised training stage needs to be run only once, it is a part of the system development, and the complete system remains unsupervised, as demonstrated in (Feldman and Rosenfeld 2006).

Corpus-based correction of entity boundaries Our entity boundaries correction mechanism is similar to the known statistical term extraction techniques (Su, Wu et al.1994). It is based on the assumption that the component words of a term (an entity in our case) are more tightly bound to each other than to the context.

Another direction for unsupervised relation learning was taken in (Hasegawa, Sekine et al.2004; Chen, Ji et al.2005). These systems use a NER system to identify frequent pairs of entities and then cluster the pairs based on the types of the entities and the words appearing between the entities.

Ravichandran and Hovy (Ravichandran and Hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the Web.

The boundary correction process utilizes well-known term extraction methods, e.g., (Su, Wu et al.1994). We also recently became aware of the work by Downey, Broadhead and Etzioni (2007) that deals with locating entities of arbitrary types in large corpora using corpus statistics.

The details of the patterns language and the process of pattern learning are not significant for this paper, and are described fully in (Feldman and Rosenfeld 2006).
