Whereas, during individual deactivation of these factors, they observed comparatively small deteriorations of less than 4%, the combined deactivation led to a reduction of more than 25% (Lappin and Leass 1994, page 552).

For the most part, these results coincide with, or provide further support for, similar findings by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 549).
J94-4002
48 These findings may be compared with the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which report 2 cases of pronoun misinterpretation (out of a total of 75 failures) that are due to a failure to establish configurationally determined disjoint reference, and several additional cases in which a wrong antecedent was chosen because of a wrong heuristic assignment of syntactic salience factors.

36 The one-dimensional accuracy measure that is typically employed in the evaluation of pronoun resolution algorithms (for example, Lappin and Leass \[1994\] or Kennedy and Boguraev \[1996\]) implicitly relies on the fact that all pronouns are resolved.
C96-1021 J94-4002
The precision measure coincides with the accuracy measure employed by, for example, Lappin and Leass (1994) or Kennedy and Boguraev (1996).
C96-1021 J94-4002
Factors and Weights As in the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), weighted salience factors are employed for scoring and choosing among the candidates that remain after restriction application (cf.

An alternative solution, which is based on the possibly partial but potentially more comprehensive and reliable output of a conventional parser, has been suggested in Stuckardt (1997).
W97-1305
Under this architecture, evidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributed by strong expectations at the referential layer is not taken into account (Stuckardt 1996).
C96-2158
Based on this observation, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) have suggested an adaptation of Lappin and Leass's approach to the shallow analysis frontend of English Constraint Grammar (Karlsson et al.1995), which provides a part-of-speech tagging comprising an assignment of syntactic function but no constituent structure.

36 34 In generalizing the handling of optional coreferences (as originally specified in the coreference task definition \[Hirschman 1998\] with respect to model-theoretic scoring), unresolved pronouns whose antecedent link is marked as optional in the key (i.e., the elements of the set 0+,) are not taken into account in the recall measure of the nonpronominal anchor discipline.
M98-1029
In principle, even a "complete" algorithm that establishes the conceptually superior degree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation and anaphor resolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997).
W97-1305
These findings are in line with the results of Lappin and Leass (1994), who made similar observations in their factor variation experiments, but conjectured on a more abstract level that a relationship of complex interdependency holds between the different syntactic salience factors.

In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallow description model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model.

Hirschman 1998).
M98-1029
As a proper basis for comparing ROSANA with the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), one must focus on the evaluation results for third person pronouns in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline (as discussed in Section 6.2).
C96-1021 J94-4002
49 For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) mention the problem of interpreting quoted speech separately from its surrounding context, a complex problem whose solution should be facilitated if richer syntactic information is available.
C96-1021
However, since different evaluation corpora have been used, and, moreover, since the precision figure mentioned in the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) is not qualified with respect to text genre, a direct comparison of the empirical results should be based on further investigations.
C96-1021
32 Compare, for example, the predictions of the centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).

Again, the findings of the factor assignment experiments permit elaboration on a conjecture by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 552), according to which considerable improvement should be achieved by employing, for an optimization of the factor assignments, statistical analyses of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora.

Reference data have been provided by an intellectual annotation of the press release corpus according to the MUC-7 coreference task definition (Hirschman 1998).

23 The factor/weight relations determined by Lappin and Leass (1994) for third person pronouns were taken as the initial clue.
J94-4002
44 This result coincides with similar findings by numerous other researchers, for example, Lappin and Leass (1994, page 551).
J94-4002
Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approaches rely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing restrictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994).
