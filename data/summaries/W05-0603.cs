More recently, Keller and Lapata (2003) evaluate the utility of using Web search engines for obtaining frequencies for unseen bigrams.

Lapata and Keller (2004) derived their statistics from the Web and achieved results close to Lauer’s using simple lexical models.

This is confirmed by the adjacency model experiments in (Lapata and Keller, 2004) on Lauer’s NC set.

Other researchers have used prepositional paraphrases as a proxy for determining the semantic relations that hold between nouns in a compound (Lauer, 1995; Keller and Lapata, 2003; Girju et al., 2005).

Lapata and Keller (2004) achieved their best accuracy (78.68%) with the dependency model and the simple symmetric score #(wi,wj).1 3.3 Computing Probabilities Lauer (1995) assumes that adjacency and dependency should be computed via probabilities.

The best known early work on automated unsupervised NC bracketing is that of Lauer (1995) who introduces the probabilistic dependency model for the syntactic disambiguation of NCs and argues against the adjacency model, proposed by Marcus (1980), Pustejovsky et al.(1993) and Resnik (1993).

They then later propose using Web counts as a baseline unsupervised method for many NLP tasks (Lapata and Keller, 2004).
N04-1016
This is not surprising, given the previous results by Lapata and Keller (2004).
N04-1016
and Future Work We have extended and improved upon the state-ofthe-art approaches to NC bracketing using an unsupervised method that is more robust than Lauer (1995) and more accurate than Lapata and Keller (2004).

Table 3 compares our results to those of Lauer (1995) and of Lapata and Keller (2004).
