The corpus analyzed in this paper consists of 95 experimentally obtained spoken tutoring dialogues between 20 students and our system ITSPOKE (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004), a speech-enabled version of the text-based WHY2 conceptual physics tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2002).

This insight suggests an interesting tradeoff between the practicality of collapsing emotional classes (Ang et al., 2002; Litman and ForbesRiley, 2004) and the ability to observe meaningful interactions via finer level annotations.

While an inter-annotator agreement study is the best way to test the reliability of our two emotional annotations (FAH and CERT), our experience with annotating student emotions (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) has shown that this type of annotation can be performed reliably.

Recent work has shown that dialogue design can benefit from several higher level dialogue factors: dialogue acts (Frampton and Lemon, 2005; Walker et al., 2001), pragmatic plausibility (Gabsdil and Lemon, 2004).

Tutoring, as a new domain for speech applications (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004; Pon-Barry et al., 2004), brings forward new factors that can be important for spoken dialogue design.

A common practice in previous work on emotion prediction (Ang et al., 2002; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004) is to transform an initial finer level emotion annotation (five or more labels) into a coarser level annotation (2-3 labels).
