It is well known that the characteristics of hapax legomena are similar to those of unknown words (Baayen and Sproat, 1996).

Some statistical model to estimate the part of speech of unknown words from the case of the first letter and the prefix and suffix is proposed (Weischedel et al., 1993; Brill, 1995; Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Mikheev, 1997).

In Japanese, around 95% word segmentation accuracy is reported by using a word-based language model and the Viterbi-like dynamic programming procedures (Nagata, 1994; Yamamoto, 1996; Takeuchi and Matsumoto, 1997; Haruno and Matsumoto, 1997).

In order to estimate the entropy of English, (Brown et al., 1992) approximated P(kI<UNK> ) by a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the average word length A in the training corpus, and P(cz... cklk, <UNK>) by the product of character zerogram probabilities.

To improve the unknown word model, featurebased approach such as the maximum entropy method (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) might be useful, because we don't have to divide the training data into several disjoint sets (like we did by part of speech and word type) and we can incorporate more linguistic and morphological knowledge into the same probabilistic framework.

About the same accuracy is reported in Chinese by statistical methods (Sproat et al., 1996).
J96-3004
To improve word segmentation accuracy, (Nagata, 1996) used a single general purpose unknown word model, while (Sproat et al., 1996) used a set of specific word models such as for plurals, personal names, and transliterated foreign words.

The maximization search can be efficiently implemented by using the Viterbilike dynamic programming procedure described in (Nagata, 1994).

Segmentation Accuracy Word segmentation accuracy is expressed in terms of recall and precision as is done in the previous research (Sproat et al., 1996).
J96-3004
There are two approaches to solve this problem: to increase the coverage of the dictionary (Fung and Wu, 1994; Chang et al., 1995; Mori and Nagao, 1996) and to design a better model for unknown words (Nagata, 1996; Sproat et al., 1996).

For Japanese word segmentation and OCR error correction, (Nagata, 1996) proposed a modified version of the Brown model.
