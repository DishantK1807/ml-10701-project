The SSA is based on a discontinuous grammar, described more formally in (Basili et al.1992a). In tiffs section we provide a qualitative clescription of the rules by which esl's are generated.

The morphologic analyzer (Marziali, 1992) derives from the work on a generative approach to the Italian morphology (Russo, 1987), first used in DANTE, a NLP system for analysis of short narrative texts in the financial domain (Antonacci et al.1989). Tile analyzer includes over 7000 elementary lemmata (stems without affixes, e.g. flex is the elementary lemma for de448 flex, in-flex, re-fiex) anti has been experimented since now on economic, financial, commercial and legal domains.

Among the applications of collocational analysis for lexical acquisition are: the derivation of syntactic disambiguation cues (Basili et al.1991, 1993a; Hindle and Rooths 1991,1993; Sekine 1992) (Bogges et al.1992), sense preference (Yarowski 1992), acquisition of selectional restrictions (Basili et al.1992b, 1993b; Utsuro et al.1993), lexical preference in generation (Smadjia 1991), word clustering (Pereira 1993; Hindle 1990; Basili et al.1993c), etc.

A wider window (± tO0 words) is used in (Gale et al.1992). Windowing techniques are also used in (Jelinek et al, 1990), where it is proposed a trigram model to automatically derive, and refine, context-free rules of the grammar (Fujisaki et al, 1991).
