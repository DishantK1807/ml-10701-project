To identify conjunctions, lists, and appositives, we first parsed the corpus, using an efficient statistical parser (Charniak et al., 1998), trMned on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).

This is done, in the spirit of the Dependency Model of Lauer (1995), by selecting the noun to its right in the compound with the highest probability of occuring with the word in question when occurring in a noun compound.

Dunning. 1993.

In Riloff and Shepherd (1997), noun co-occurrence statistics were used to indicate nominal category membership, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of semantic lexicons.
W97-0313
Extracting semantic information from word co-occurrence statistics has been effective, particularly for sense disambiguation (Schiitze, 1992; Gale et al., 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).
P95-1026
For the final ranking, we chose the log likelihood statistic outlined in Dunning (1993), which is based upon the co-occurrence counts of all nouns (see Dunning for details).
