The generalization provided in Pustejovsky (1991) is that those predicates that like "enjoy" have multiple subcategorization frames on the surface select for only one deep semantic type, thus in (9a) the 'deep' type selected by the verb is an event, as is that in (9b) where the complement does not directly denote an event.

As a unit is reached and selected it is mapped to the first linguistic level of representation, Text Structure (Meteer 1990, 1992).

While we do not yet have an understanding of what this benefit might be, we can at this point narrow its character by identifying it with another set of phenomena, which, while also having no real explanation as yet in terms of their utility (but see Granville 1990 or Valduvf 1992), seem to us to be phenomena of the same kind.

Such a lack of prior commitment is the whole point of an incremental model of generation, which we are now exploring at the level of content selection rather than just the customary level of realization and surface form (see Kempen &.Hoenkamp 1987, DeSmedt 1990, McDonald 1980).

We apply it here to the process of generation, building on its application to lexical semantics by Pustejovsky (1991).
