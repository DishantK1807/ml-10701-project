A simple approach is presented in (Cardie and Pierce, 1998) called Treebank Apl)roach (TA).

The experiments were carried out 617 on the WSJ corpus, using the POS tag set; defined in (Marcus eetlal., 1993), considering only the NP chunts (lefine~l by (Church, 1988) and using tile models that we have presented above.

We can find some other machine-learning approaches that use more sophisticated LMs, such as Decision Trees (Mhrquez and Rodrfguez, 1998)(Magerman, 1996), memory-based approaclms to learn special decision trees (Daelemans et al., 1996), maximmn entropy approaches that combine statistical information from different sources (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), finite state autonmt2 inferred using Grammatical Inference (Pla and Prieto, 1998), etc.

Tile Memory-Based Sequence Learning (MBSL) algorithm (Argamon et al., 1998) learns substrings or sequences of POS and brackets.

In tiffs case, the language inodel can be estimated from a labelled corpus (supervised methods) (Church, 1988)(Weisehedel et al., 1.993) or from a nonlabelled corpus (unsupervised methods) (Cutting et 21., 1992).

In the second one, the model is learned using the Baunl-\Â¥elch algorithm from an initial model which is estimated using labelled corpora (Merialdo, 1994).

Supervised learning methods were proposed in (Brill, 1995) to learn a set, of transforlnation rules that repair tim error committed by a probabilistic tagger.

These results were criticised in (Raulshaw and Marcus, 1.995) due to some inconsistencies and aplmrenl; mistakKs which appeared on thK sample given in (Voutilainen, 1993).
