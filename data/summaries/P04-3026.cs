In an attempt to provide a quantitative evaluation of our results, for each of the 12 ambiguous words shown in table 1 we manually assigned the top 30 first-order associations to one of the two senses provided by Yarowsky (1995).
P95-1026
We used the procedure described in Rapp (2002), with the only modification being the multiplication of the loglikelihood values with a triangular function that depends on the logarithm of a word’s frequency.
C02-1007
Starting from the list of 12 ambiguous words provided by Yarowsky (1995) which is shown in table 2, we created a concordance for each word, with the lines in the concordances each relating to a context window of ±20 words.
P95-1026
As in previous work (Rapp, 2002), our computations are based on a partially lemmatized version of the British National Corpus (BNC) which has the function words removed.
