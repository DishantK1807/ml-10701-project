Wiebe (1994) also reports segment-based agenthood as one of the most successful features.

The main reason for using a hand-crafted, genre-specific lexicon instead of a general resource such as WordNet or Levin's (1993) classes (as used in Klavans and Kan (1998)), was to avoid polysemy problems without having to perform word sense disambiguation.

Our classification, which is a further development of the scheme in Teufel and Moens (1999), can be described procedurally as a decision tree (Figure 2), where five questions are asked about each sentence, concerning intellectual attribution, author stance and continuation vs.
E99-1015
The intellectual-attribution distinction we make is comparable with Wiebe's (1994) distinction into subjective and objective statements.

Marcu's (1997) work, which is based on RST (Mann and Thompson, 1987)), this type of segmentation aims at capturing the argumentative status of a piece of text in respect to the overall argumentative act of the paper.

We use 14 features given in figure 8, some of which are adapted from sentence extraction techniques (Paice, 1990; Kupiec et eL1., 1995; Teufel and Moens, 1999).

Annotation of Argumentative Zones We have previously evaluated the scheme empirically by extensive experiments with three subjects, over a range of 48 articles (Teufel et al., 1999).
E99-1015
We measured stability (the degree to which the same annotator will produce an annotation after 6 weeks) and reproducibility (the degree to which two unrelated annotators will produce the same annotation), using the Kappa coefficient K (Siegel and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996), which controls agreement P(A) for chance agreement P(E): K = PA)-P(E) 1-P(Z) Kappa is 0 for if agreement is only as would be expected by chance annotation following the same distribution as the observed distribution, and 1 for perfect agreement.

Argumentative Zoning As our task is not defined by topic coherence like the related tasks of Morris and Hirst (1991), Hearst (1997), Kan et al.(1998) and Reynar (1999), we predict that keyword-based techniques for automatic argumentative zoning will not work well (cf.
