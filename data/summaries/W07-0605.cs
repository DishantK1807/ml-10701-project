The system tokenizes, tags, lemmatizes and parses input sentences using the recent (second) release of the RASP (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing) system (Briscoe et al., 2006) which parses arbitrary English text with state-of-the-art levels of accuracy.

For comparison, Sagae et al.(2005) report 86.9% LAS on about 2,000 words of Eve data, using the Charniak (2000) parser with a separate dependency-labeling step.

It incorporates 168 SCF distinctions, a superset of those found in the COMLEX Syntax (Grishman et al., 1994) and ANLT (Boguraev et al., 1987) dictionaries.

Acquisition System We used for subcategorization acquisition the new system of Preiss, Briscoe and Korhonen (2007) which is essentially a much improved and extended version of Briscoe and Carroll?s (1997) system.

Despite the obvious disadvantage of using a parser trained on a completely different language genre, Sagae et al.(2005) demonstrated how current natural language processing techniques can be used effectively in child language work, achieving results that are close to those obtained by manual computation of syntactic development scores for child transcripts.

We use the new system of Preiss et al.(2007) to extract SCF frequency data from the (i) child and (ii) child-directed speech within CHILDES.

To maintain a robust analysis in the presence of noise, multiple similarity measures were used to compare the verb and SCF distributions (Korhonen and Krymolowski, 2002).

Although the CHILDES annotation scheme proposed by Sagae et al.(2004) has been used in practice for automatic parsing of child language transcripts (Sagae et al., 2004; Sagae et al., 2005), such work relied mainly on a statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank, since a large enough corpus of annotated CHILDES data was not available to train a domain-specific parser.

Syntactic analysis of child language transcripts using a GR scheme of this kind has already been shown to be effective in a practical setting, namely in automatic measurement of syntactic development in children (Sagae et al., 2005).

Generally, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented as a tree, and parsing is carried out by maximizing the likelihood of the tree (Charniak, 2000; Uchimoto et al., 1999).

Yet Sagae et al.(2005) have recently demonstrated that existing statistical parsing techniques can be usefully modified to analyse CHILDES 33 with promising accuracy.

In recent years, many accurate phrase-structure parsers have been developed (e.g., (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000)).

In this perliminary study, we show that a state-ofthe-art subcategorization acquisition system of Preiss et al.(2007) can be used to extract largescale subcategorization (frequency) information from the (i) child and (ii) child-directed speech within the CHILDES database without any domain-specific tuning.

That work relied on a phrase-structure statistical parser (Charniak, 2000) trained on the Penn Treebank, and the output of that parser had to be converted into CHILDES grammatical relations.
