This result is comparable with or better than most measures reported by McCarthy et al (2003).

Often, typical statistical algorithms measure the semantic distance between MWEs and their constituent words by comparing their contexts comprising co-occurrence words in near context extracted from large corpora, such as Baldwin et al’s algorithm (2003).

One of the often quoted applications is for machine translation (Melamed, 1997; Hwang & Sasaki, 2005), in which non-compositional MWEs need special treatment.
W97-0311
While there exist various definitions for MWEs, they are generally defined as cohesive lexemes that cross word boundaries (Sag et al., 2002; Copestake et al., 2002; Calzolari et al., 2002; Baldwin et al., 2003), which include nominal compounds, phrasal verbs, idioms, collocations etc.

Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) suggest that “an expression is likely to be relatively more compositional if it is decomposable”.
H05-1113
The algorithm is evaluated both on 89 manually ranked MWEs and on McCarthy et al’s (2003) manually ranked phrasal verbs.

However, similar semantic lexical resources are already under construction for some other languages, including Finnish and Russian (Löfberg et al., 2005; Sharoff et al., 2006), which will allow us to port our algorithm to those languages.

One of the earliest studies in this area was reported by Lin (1999) who assumes that “noncompositional phrases have a significantly different mutual information value than the phrases that are similar to their literal meanings” and proposed to identify non-compositional MWEs in a corpus based on distributional characteristics of MWEs.

McCarthy et al.(2003) suggested that compositional phrasal verbs should have similar neighbours as for their simplex verbs.

In order to evaluate our algorithm in comparison with previous work, we also tested it on the manual ranking list created by McCarthy et al (2003).

Bannard et al.(2003) tested techniques using statistical models to infer the meaning of verb-particle constructions (VPCs), focus2 In this lexicon, many MWEs are encoded as templates, such as driv*_* {Np/P*/J*/R*} mad_JJ, which represent variational forms of a single MWE, For further details, see Rayson et al., 2004.
W03-1809
Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005) measured relative compositionality of collocations having verb-noun pattern using a SVM (Support Vector Machine) based ranking function.
H05-1113
Lin (1999) argues that “non-compositional expressions need to be treated differently than other phrases in many statistical or corpus–based NLP methods”.
P99-1041
Baldwin et al.(2003) proposed a LSA-based model for measuring the decomposability of MWEs by examining the similarity between them and their constituent words, with higher similarity indicating the greater decomposability.
