Unlike the current mainstream in automatic linguistic knowledge acquisition, which can be characterized as quantitative, surface-oriented bulk processing of large corpora of texts (Hindle, 1989; Zernik and Jacobs, 1990; Hearst, 1992; Manning, 1993), we propose here a knowledge-intensive model of concept learning from few, positive-only examples that is tightly integrated with the non-learning mode of text understanding.

Work We are not concerned with lexical acquisition from very large corpora using surface-level collocational data as proposed by Zernik and Jacobs (1990) and Velardi et al.(1991), or with hyponym extraction based on entirely syntactic criteria as in Hearst (1992) or lexico-semantic associations (e.g., Resnik (1992) or Sekine et al.(1994)). This is mainly due to the fact that these studies aim at a shallower level of learning (e.g., selectional restrictions or thematic relations of verbs), while our focus is on much more fine-grained conceptual knowledge (roles, role filler constraints, integrity conditions).
