Our implementation is based on the approach to dialogue developed in (Traum, 1994; Poesio and Traum, 1997; Poesio and Traum, 1998; Traum et al., 1999).
P94-1001
Each new contribution results in a new DISCOURSE UNIT (DU) being added to the information state (Traum, 1994) and recorded in a list of 'ungrounded discourse units' (UDUS); these DUs can then be subsequently grounded as the result, e.g., of (implicit or explicit) acknowledgements.
P94-1001
As for the process by which common ground is established, or GROUNDING (Clark and Schaefer, 1989; Traum, 1994), the assumption in PTT is that classical speech act theory is inherently too simplistic in that it ignores the fact that co-operative interaction is essential in discourse; thus, for instance, simply asserting something does not make it become mutually 'known' (part of the common ground).
P94-1001
Poesio and Traum follow (Traum and Allen, 1994) in suggesting that the utterance of a question imposes an obligation on the hearer to address the question (e.g., by providing an answer), irrespective of intentions.
P94-1001
7We assume here, as in (Traum, 1994) and (Poesio and Traum, 1998), that understanding acts do not have to be grounded themselves, which would result in a infinite regress.
