Other work, such as Carbonnell and Collins (1970) and Weiner (1984), has hand-encoded salience values for attributes of individual objects directly into the knowledge base, permanently setting the ffunction.

Several systems that do assess object similarity (Rumelhart and Abrahamson 1973, McKeown 1982, Carberry 1984, Weiner 1984) use a metric based on distance in some space.

While I would conjecture that information about the focus of the discourse (Grosz 1981, Sidner 1983, Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) might give an indication of an object's prominence and would therefore be useful in setting the values of 0, a, and/3, in this work I have assumed a value of 1 for the 0, a, and 13 and have concentrated on setting the f function.
