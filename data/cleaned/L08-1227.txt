<context>). The MSR-MT training data comes solely from the IT domain, yet we find terminology translations challenging as many product groups use different terminology translations for the same English terms (Itagaki, et al, 2007). Such domain differences in training data for SMT systems may have led to different term translations by different systems. For instance, using several Web-based translation systems, we translated t</context>
