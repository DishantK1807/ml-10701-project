The MERT module is a highly modular, efficient and customizable implementation of the algorithm described in (Och, 2003).

In this paper, we present Phramer, an open-source system that embeds a phrase-based decoder, a minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) module and various tools related to Machine Translation (MT).

The release has implementations for BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), WER and PER error criteria and it has decoding interfaces for Phramer and Pharaoh.

The software also required GIZA++ word alignment tool(Och and Ney, 2003).

We generated for each phrase pair in the translation table 5 features: phrase translation probability (both directions), lexical weighting (Koehn et al., 2003) (both directions) and phrase penalty (constant value).

Using only the baseline system, we obtain +0.68 on DE→EN, +0.43 on FR→EN and -0.18 on ES→EN difference in BLEU score compared to WPT05’s best system (Koehn and Monz, 2005).

The second enhancement tries to improve the quality of the translation by rearranging the words in the source sentence to better match the correct word order in the target language (Collins et al., 2005).
