Although finite-state machines have been used for part-of-speech tagging (Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993; Silberztein 1993), none of these approaches has the same flexibility as stochastic techniques.

Unlike stochastic approaches to part-of-speech tagging (Church 1988; Kupiec 1992; Cutting et al.1992; Merialdo 1990; DeRose 1988; Weischedel et al.1993), up to now the knowledge found in finite-state taggers has been handcrafted and was not automatically acquired.

Such representations have been successfully applied to different aspects of natural language processing, such as morphological analysis and generation (Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Clemenceau 1993), parsing (Roche 1993; Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1993), phonology (Laporte 1993; Kaplan and Kay 1994) and speech recognition (Pereira, Riley, and Sproat 1994).

Recently, Brill (1992) described a rule-based tagger that performs as well as taggers based upon probabilistic models and overcomes the limitations common in rule-based approaches to language processing: it is robust and the rules are automatically ac* Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, 201 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02139.

We empirically compared our tagger with Eric Brill's implementation of his tagger, and with our implementation of a trigram tagger adapted from the work of Church (1988) that we previously implemented for another purpose.

6. Tagging Unknown Words The rule-based system described by Brill (1992) contains a module that operates after all known words--that is, words listed in the dictionary--have been tagged with their most frequent tag, and before contextual rules are applied.
