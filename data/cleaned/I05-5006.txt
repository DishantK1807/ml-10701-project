Transforming a Sentence End into News Headline Style Satoshi Ikeda and Kazuhide Yamamoto Dept.
of Electrical Engineering, Nagaoka University of Technology ikeda@nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp, yamamoto@fw.ipsj.or.jp Abstract News on electrical bulletin boards consist of high density expressions.
Many sentences end with unique expressions that consist of nouns and case particles.
This paper focuses on expressions used at the end of sentences and attempts to summarize them by forming noun or case particle endings.
We summarize the news sentence through pattern matching approach.
Our evaluation illustrates that the summarizer reduces 2.50 characters per sentence on average; the reduction ratio is 6%.
We also show that people perceive the correct meanings of the summarized sentences with 95% accuracy.
1 Introduction
Electrical bulletin board displays the latest news headlines which each newspaper office announced.
News headlines are shorter than newspapersâ€™ news with laconicism because they are summarized to transfer in limited space.
One of a characteristics of Japanese news headlines can be seen at sentence ends (Exp.1).
Exp.1)nï¿½Yï¿½x) Xw ï¿½ï¿½_ï¿½ï¿½ Qï¿½{ (Countermeasure for alleged abduction is judged after the movement of administration party.) Although the end of sentence in Exp.1 is omitted, we have no difficulty to understand the meaning.
We unconsciously complete the sentence by guessing what is omitted without a mistake.
Without unnecessary ends, these type of sentences are short and nonredundant.
The final purpose of this work is to transform news sentences into a news headline style.
In Japanese, sentences end with nouns or case particles are grammatically incorrect, however, this kind of expressions are shorter than grammatically perfect sentences, and hence often used to meet the limited length.
We believe many sentences have semantically redundant expressions in the end, which needs to be focused in summarization.
In this paper we present a list of deletable expressions at Japanese sentence ends.
We have to carefully investigate which sentence ends are deletable, and how to change into the headline style.
We present the concrete expressions of deletion with examples and illustrate effects of deletion.

Works As the most similar work to ours, Sato et al.[6] tries to extract paraphrasing patterns of sentence end by preparing a lot of alignment pairs between news sentences and their headline versions.
They compare the sentences from the ends and obtain many correspondences between the two.
However, they have no proposals on how to use these one-to-N correspondences, i.e., the way to select one from many candidates.
Our approach is to obtain many transformation patterns as well, but we do not use aligned corpus; we use a large collection of news headlines instead and find patterns by our thorough observation.
Wakao et al.[7] compares newscast and corresponding subtitle expressions to investigate the differences of them.
One of the observation targets is sentence end, and they have shown us some typical patterns of conversion into a short news.
This enumerates phraseologies which are able to be cut down and investigates the frequency of use.
In news subtitles nouns or case particles are used at the sentence end.
This work is drew upon literature [7] while we investigated in our own right.
We shaded light on the phraseologies which do not exist literature [7] such asï¿½ï¿½  `hq_ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ T(There seems to surrender.)ï¿½.
We examined the phraseologies which 41 are disposed by machine.
Fukushima et al.[1] cut off the unnecessary part from literature [7].
There are investigations to summarize text by confining the number of characters [2,3,5].
Ishizako et al.[2] cut off areas of overlap.
Ohmori et al.[5] and Mikami et al.[3] summarized text altogether, but these investigations do not focus on sentence ends.
3 News
Headlines and Their Sentence Ends There is an email service that delivers Japanese news headlines three times a day on weekdays.
That is Nikkei news mail(1) provided by NIKKEI-goo.
We have been collecting them since December 1999.
Table1 shows the statistics we have obtained.
Table 1: Statistical datum which are collected number of mails 3365 number of stories 21127 number of sentences 40374 News headlines are more distinctive than news stories in sentence end.
Therefore, we investigated part of speech on both news headlines and newspaper(Nihon Keizai Shimbun(2)).
Table2 shows the comparison.
Table 2: Occurrence ratio of POS in sentence end occurrence ratio[%] POS newspaper headlines noun 23.70 55.92 (verbal noun) (5.00) (39.90) verb 28.66 15.91 adjective 1.80 0.19 adverb 0.20 0.22 particle 1.56 8.83 (case particles) (0.34) (6.41) auxiliary verb 38.59 18.52 symbol 5.42 0.40 In the newspaper, declinable words are responsible for the majority of sentence ends.
In news headlines, there are in fact many verbal nouns in sentence ends.
Japanese words are classified broadly into two types; one derived from China and another originated in Japan.
News headlines contain the former more than the latter because words from China carry more information in fewer characters.
We investigated news headlines and news on a paper which contained words of both Chinese and Japanese origins.
The result is shown in Table3.
In fact, news headlines preferably use the words of Chinese origin about three times as much as that of Japanese origin.

We estimate that the news headlines are high density phraseology than newspaper.
4 Method
of Summarization In order to transform a sentence end into a shorter one, we have conducted three kinds of procedures: (1) Deletion of target words at sentence end (2) Deletion with minor transformation after the target words (3) Transformation of sentence end More precisely, we have proposed conducting the following 10 procedures for transforming Japanese sentence ends into a news headline style: 1.
Cut off dictum and honorific phraseology (1) 2.
Cut offï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo shimesu:show)ï¿½(1) 3.
Change verbal noun(2) 4.
Cut offï¿½sï¿½(naru)ï¿½(2) 5.
Cut off the part which followsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Tt(akirakani)ï¿½ (2) 6.
Change words of Japanese origin(2) 7.
Cut offï¿½o`ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½(1) 8.
Cut offï¿½qm(tatu)ï¿½(2) 9.
Transform phraseology indicated the action in the future (2) 42 10.
Change to compound noun (3) We summarized in this order, and process 3.ï¿½ 9.

4.1 Cut
Off Dictum and Honorific Phraseology Phraseologies shown below are dictum or honorific phraseology.
These phraseology in sentence end is cut off because these are not necessary to understand the meaning.
~dictum phraseology:ï¿½ilh(datta)ï¿½ï¿½pKï¿½ (dearu)ï¿½ï¿½i(da)ï¿½ ~honorific phraseology:ï¿½ï¿½b(masu)ï¿½ï¿½pb(desu)ï¿½ 4.2 Cut Offï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo simesu:show)ï¿½ When a sentence end isï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo shimesu)ï¿½orï¿½ï¿½ï¿½`h(wo shimeshita)ï¿½, this phraseology is cut off becauseï¿½ï¿½b(shimesu)ï¿½ has little meaning in that sentence.
The main verb of the sentence is the verbal noun beforeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ b(wo shimesu)ï¿½.
4.3 Change
Verbal Nouns The expression after the verbal noun closest to the main verb of the sentence is deleted.
In Japanese, we put a wordï¿½bï¿½(suru)ï¿½after a verbal noun to make a verb, but in the summary it can be deleted since we can still understand the usage.
When a self-sufficient word exists following a verbal noun, we do not dispose this.
Step 1 The part followingï¿½bï¿½(suru)ï¿½is cut.
Nominalized verbal noun to cutï¿½bï¿½(suru)ï¿½is the verbal noun in this arrangement.
Step 2 When the cut part contains an estimation phraseologyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(mirareru)ï¿½orï¿½iï¿½ O(daou)ï¿½, tack onï¿½T(ka))ï¿½and finish.

Step 3 When the cut part contains a contradiction phraseologyï¿½sM(nai)ï¿½orï¿½u(nu)ï¿½, tack onï¿½dc(sezu)ï¿½at the sentence end and finish.
When this part concurrently contains a passive phraseologyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(reru)ï¿½, tack onï¿½^ï¿½ c(sarezu)ï¿½and finish.
Step 4 When a sentence end isï¿½nounï¿½ï¿½(wo) ï¿½verbal nounï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½(wo)ï¿½is cut to become a compound nounï¿½nounï¿½verbal nounï¿½.

Step 3 When the cut part containsï¿½`o (shite)ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ s(go hatsu)ï¿½is tacked on in the sentence end.
When the term just before noun is particleï¿½T(ka)ï¿½, this particleï¿½T(ka)ï¿½ changes into particleï¿½w(no)ï¿½.

Words of Japanese Origin When a Japanese origin word by Table3 exists in a sentence, the part before it is cut off.
Then the Japanese origin word is replaced by Chinese one.
When a self-sufficient word exists following Japanese origin word, the sentence is not disposed of this arrangement.
We changed the word which shows Table3.
Step 1 Japanese origin word and following are cut off.
Step 2 When sentence end isï¿½bï¿½\q ï¿½(surukoto wo)ï¿½, cut offï¿½bï¿½\q(surukoto:doing)ï¿½, tack on the correspondent Chinese origin word, and finish the arrangement.

Thus we cut offï¿½o`ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½in the headline.
This arrangement is used not only the sentence ends but middle of the sentence.
When the term after the cut part isï¿½y(ba)ï¿½, we do not dispose it.
When the sentence end isï¿½o`ï¿½O (teshimau)ï¿½, change the term beforeï¿½o`ï¿½O (teshimau)ï¿½to primitive form and finish.
Whenï¿½o`ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½exists without the sentence end,ï¿½o`ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½and the character before this phraseology is cut off.

We picked up 1,000 sentences at random from summary sentences, and three examinees individually accounted them.
The sentences are measured by majority decision.
Assessment criterion is: (1) same meaning without context, and (2) low unnaturalness.
The result is shown in Table5.
The numbers in the table denote the section numbers explaining the process of transformation.

In this kind of subjective evaluation different person may answer difference judgment.
We have evaluated our results in three criteria: (1) at least one said correct, (2) at least two said correct, and (3) all three said correct.
This result is shown in Table6.
The Table illustrates that correctness is more than 90% in all cases.
Table 6: Correctness changes by personal differences.
â‰¥ 1 â‰¥ 2 = 3 correctness 0.98 0.95 0.91 5.3 Comparison to the Human Summaries We compare summaries of the proposed method and by the human.
We picked up 100 sentences in summary sentences at random.
One examinee summarized the original sentences which corresponded the pick up the summary sentences.
We computed the summarization ratio about these sentences.
The result is shown in Table7.
Table 7: Comparison of summaries by proposed technique and manual summary machine human # sentence 72727 100 summ.
ratio 0.94 0.92 # reduced characters 2.45 3.87 Although the sentence ratio of machine summary is close to the manual summaryâ€™s one, number of reduced characters are approximately one character different.
This indicates that human try to change many parts of sentence according to the change of the sentence end, while the machine does not consider such influence.
Change of sentence end often requires transforming the whole syntax structure, such as change of aspect or form.
We need more investigations on this issue.
6 Discussions
6.1 Discussion of Erroneous Summaries In this section we describe some erroneous summaries by our method and discuss the reasons.
Exp.13)%xfw w ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hMsï¿½wpz* Viï¿½ w ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½15.5mm uï¿½ Ovz ï¿½ï¿½b{ 46 ï¿½*1%xfw w ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hMsï¿½wpz* Viï¿½ w ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ uï¿½ Ovz { (The face show the character like an annual ring.) Exp.13 is error example in arrangement â€˜cut off theï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo shimesu:show)ï¿½â€˜ When the term beforeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo shimesu)ï¿½is the noun, the sentence does not have main verb.
The main verb which does not exist in the sentence is not right in Japanese.
when the term before ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½b(wo shimesu)ï¿½is noun, this arrangement does not disposed.
This kind of error is covered.
But when the noun isï¿½ï¿½Q(kangae:concept)ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½(ikou:disposition)ï¿½orï¿½_ ï¿½`(mitooshi:forecast)ï¿½, this arrangement is correct.
Exp.14)b;  ta Swï¿½;ï¿½/bï¿½\qï¿½>ï¿½h{ ï¿½*b;  ta Swï¿½;ï¿½/ï¿½> { (It is decided to caution the overuse to user.) Exp.14 is the error example â€˜change the word of Japanese origin.
When the cut offï¿½bï¿½\ q(surukoto:doing)ï¿½, the modification relation is changed.
Therefore, the modification relation is a wrong one.
When the particleï¿½ï¿½(wo)ï¿½is changed to particleï¿½w(no)ï¿½, this kind of error is covered(Exp.15).
Exp.15)b;  ta Swï¿½;ï¿½/bï¿½\qï¿½>ï¿½h{ ï¿½b;  ta Swï¿½;w/ï¿½> { Exp.16)< ï¿½t`o`ï¿½SOqï¿½loMh{ ï¿½*< ï¿½t`Oqï¿½loMh{ (He thinks that his mother killed.) Exp.16 is an error example in â€˜cut offï¿½o`ï¿½ O(teshimau)ï¿½â€™.
Whenï¿½o`ï¿½O(tesimau)ï¿½is cut off, it is not congruent inflected forms ofï¿½o `ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½and the verb.
Whenï¿½o` ï¿½O(teshimau)ï¿½is cut off, the inflected forms must be congruent.
6.2 Verbalness/Nominalness of Verbal Noun The sentence end isï¿½ï¿½x s(ha hatsu:first)ï¿½ in Section4.3.
There are a big differences by humans in degree of accepting this expression.
We thus change expressionï¿½ï¿½x s(ha hatsu)ï¿½into ï¿½ï¿½ sï¿½o(hajimete:first)ï¿½ï¿½.
The example before changed is shown in Exp.17.
Exp.17)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½G wï¿½Uï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hwï¿½ ï¿½  q qï¿½bï¿½wx sï¿½o{ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½G wï¿½Uï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hwï¿½ ï¿½  qw qï¿½x s{ 1symbol â€˜*â€™ indicates that the sentence is wrong.
(It is the first time that President Putin has a talk to the captain of Arab Crown) Some people feel unnatural or wrong in this example.
But when the original sentences do not haveï¿½ sï¿½o(hajimete:first)ï¿½, the summary sentences are correct.
The example is shown Exp.18 withoutï¿½ sï¿½o(hajimete:first)ï¿½.
Exp.18)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½G wï¿½Uï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hwï¿½ ï¿½  q qï¿½bï¿½{ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½G wï¿½Uï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hwï¿½ ï¿½  qqï¿½{ This example gives us no unnaturalness.
We think the verbal noun affect this.
The verbal noun represents that indicates the kind.
The verbal operation of verbal noun is varied by humans.
We think concretely aboutï¿½qï¿½ (kaidan:meeting)ï¿½of Exp.17and Exp.18.
First, we think thatï¿½qï¿½(kaidan:meeting)ï¿½ is complemented the verbal nounï¿½qï¿½bï¿½ (kaidan suru:have a talk)ï¿½.
The predicate is generally at sentence end in Japanese.
When the predicate does not exist in a sentence, it is inclinable in human thought that sentence end term is predicate.
The other hand, we think thatï¿½qï¿½(kaidan:colloquy)ï¿½is nominal or verbal operation in Exp.18 becauseï¿½qï¿½ (kaidan:meeing)ï¿½is not sentence end.
then whenï¿½qï¿½(kaidan:meeting)ï¿½is nominal, human have unnaturalness.
And whenï¿½qï¿½ (kaidan:meeting)ï¿½is verbal, human do not feel unnatural.
We cite the error summary which sentence end is noun other than verbal noun in this paper but the verbal operation of noun is pertained in these sentences.
And the noun of operation verbal is ï¿½ï¿½Q(kangae:concept)ï¿½other than verbal noun.
6.3 Comparison
of Machine and Manual Summaries We examine the machine and manual summaries.
Although many sentences are not much different, some sentences have big differences for summarization.
One example is shown as follows, original sentence, its machine summary and its manual summary respectively.
Exp.19)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½lhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½srï¿½Kï¿½ï¿½b{ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½lhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½srï¿½Kï¿½{ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½lhï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½srï¿½{ (There is graph used the color picture.) Exp.19 is cut off the honorific phraseology but the manual summary is cut offï¿½Kï¿½(aru)ï¿½too.
47 This is shown thatï¿½Kï¿½(aru)ï¿½is dictum phraseology.
And the sentence end isï¿½ï¿½(mo)ï¿½.
This is often seen in the news headline.
But the proposed technique do not deal with them.
6.4 Summarization
Failure We examine the sentences which are not summarized by the method.
We picked up the 200 sentences at random and examine whether or not it should be summarized.
This results is that 9 sentences are missing.
The example is shown below with the supposed summary.
Exp.20) ï¿½Z {Tï¿½ï¿½ï¿½^ï¿½Uï¿½.p C_ ^ï¿½h{ ï¿½ ï¿½Z {Tï¿½ï¿½ï¿½^ï¿½Uï¿½.p C_{ (Mr.
Ikemotoâ€™s blob was found from the burned-out site.) Exp.20 is not summarized.
The reason of this error is caused by an error of the morphological analysis.
7 Conclusion
In order to generate short and smart style seen in news headlines, this paper presents a method of transforming Japanese sentence end expressions into short style.
Our observation reveals that the end of sentence in the headlines are either nouns or case particles in many sentences, we thus attempt to summarize them as short as possible.
We have implemented the approach and evaluated in summarization ratio and their correctness.
The results illustrates that the reduction ratio is 6% against overall sentence length, and the sentence is expected to be cut off 2.50 characters per sentence.
The length of automatic shortening is approximately the same as manual summarization.
We also confirmed that 95% of the summaries were judged to be correct.
