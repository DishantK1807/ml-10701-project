The HMM tagger generally follows the Nymble model (Bikel et al, 1997), and uses best-first search to generate N-Best hypotheses for each input sentence.

In (Roth and 420 Yi 2002, 2004), given name boundaries in the text, separate classifiers are first trained for name classification and semantic relation detection.

More details about the re-ranking algorithm are presented in (Ji et al., 2006).
W06-3607
In (Ji and Grishman 2005) we generated Nbest NE hypotheses and re-ranked them after coreference and semantic relation identification; we obtained a significant improvement in Chinese name tagging performance.

Specifically, we will consider a system which was developed for the ACE (Automatic Content Extraction) task 3 and includes the following stages: name structure parsing, coreference, semantic relation extraction and event extraction (Ji et al., 2006).
W06-3607
However, (Roth and Yi 2002, 2004) and our recent work have focused on incorporating richer linguistic analysis, using the “feedback” from later stages to improve name taggers.
C02-1151 W04-2401
We expanded our last year’s model (Ji and Grishman, 2005) that used the results of coreference analysis and relation extraction, by adding ‘feedback’ from more information extraction components – name structure parsing, cross-document coreference, and event extraction – to incrementally rerank the multiple hypotheses from a baseline name tagger.
P05-1051
Standard Chinese family names are generally single characters drawn from a set of 437 family names (there are also 9 two-character family names, although they are quite infrequent) and given names can be one or two characters (Gao et al., 2005).
