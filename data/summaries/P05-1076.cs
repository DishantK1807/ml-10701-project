Some fairly extensive frame sets can be found in large syntax dictionaries, such as COMLEX (31 SCFs) (Wolff et al., 1998) and ANLT (24 SCFs) (Boguraev et al., 1987).

(Briscoe and Carroll, 1997)) is to extract SCFs from parse trees, introducing an unnecessary dependence on the details of a particular parser.

Our method has been implemented using a decision-tree classifier which tests for the presence of grammatical relations (GRs) in the output of the RASP (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing) system (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002).
C02-1013
We have made use of the RASP toolkit (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) — a modular statistical parsing system which includes a tokenizer, tagger, lemmatiser, and a wide-coverage unification-based tag-sequence parser.

The NP headed by “examples” is marked as the subject of the frame by ncsubj(be[6] examples[2]), and ncsubj(comprehend[12] we+[10])corresponds to the coindexation marked by 3 : the subject of the 3The format is slightly more complicated than that shown in (Carroll et al., 1998a): each argument that corresponds to a word consists of three parts: the lexeme, the part of speech tag, and the position (index) of the word in the sentence.

The parser uses a scheme of GRs between lemmatised lexical heads (Carroll et al., 1998a; Briscoe et al., 2002).

In this mode there is wide coverage (over 98% of the BNC receives at least a partial analysis (Carroll and Briscoe, 2002)) which is useful in view of the infrequent occurrence of some of the SCFs, although combining the results of competing parses may in some cases result in an inconsistent or misleading combination of GRs.

Subsequent research has yielded systems for English (Carroll and Rooth, 1998; Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Korhonen, 2002) capable of detecting comprehensive sets of SCFs with promising accuracy and demonstrated success in application tasks (e.g.

The first systems capable of automatically learning a small number of verbal subcategorization frames (SCFs) from English corpora emerged over a decade ago (Brent, 1991; Manning, 1993).
