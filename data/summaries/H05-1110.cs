There is work on lexicon induction using string distance or other phonetic/orthographic comparison techniques, such as Mann and Yarowsky (2001) or semantic comparison using resources such as WordNet (Kondrak, 2001).

They use a variety of approaches (a good overview is Koehn and Knight (2001)), many of which require advanced tools for both languages which we are not able to use.

Moreover, while some techniques (e.g., Mann and Yarowsky (2001)) use multiple languages, the languages used have resources such as dictionaries between some language pairs.

We can define P(LB|LA) as maxP A→B maxP aligns nsummationdisplay i=1 msummationdisplay j=1 PA→B (yj|xi)Paligns (xi|j) The GIZA software does the maximization by building a variety of models, mostly described by Brown et al.(1993). GIZA can be tuned in various ways, most importantly by choosing which models to run and for how many iterations.
