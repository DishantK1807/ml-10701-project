For instance, much current research on discourse phenomena distinguishes between behaviors which tend to occur at or around discourse segment boundaries and those which do not (Passonneau and Litman 1993; Kowtko, Isard, and Doherty 1992; Litman and Hirschberg 1990; Cahn 1992).

At one time, it was considered sufficient when working with such judgments to show examples based on the authors' interpretation (paradigmatically, (Grosz and Sidner \[1986\], but also countless others).

Passonneau and Litman (1993), in arguing that naive subjects can reliably agree on whether or not given prosodic phrase boundaries are also discourse segment boundaries, measure reliability using "percent agreement," defined as the ratio of observed agreements with the majority opinion among seven naive coders to possible agreements with the majority opinion.

Secondly, coding discourse and dialogue phenomena, and especially coding segment boundaries, may be inherently more difficult than many previous types of content analysis (for instance, 1 There are several variants of the kappa coefficient in the literature, including one, Scott's pi, which actually has been used at least once in our field, to assess agreement on move boundaries in monologues using action assembly theory (Grosz and Sidner 1986).

Litman and Hirschberg (1990) use this same pairwise technique for assessing the reliability of cue phrase categorization, using two equal-status coders and three categories.

Although in some cases discourse segments are defined automatically (e.g., Rodrigues and Lopes' \[1992\] definition based on temporal relationships), more usually discourse segments are defined subjectively, based on the intentional structure of the discourse, and then other phenomena are related to them.
