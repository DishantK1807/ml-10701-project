This approach has been taken, for example, by Cassell et al.(2001b) to choose posture shifts for REA, and by Kipp (2004) to select gestures for agents, and it is also the approach that we adopt here.

In the basic COMIC process for generating multimodal output (Foster et al., 2005), facial displays are selected using simple rules based only on the pitch accents specified by the text generation system.

First, we should gather usersâ€™ opinions of the behaviours annotated in the corpus: it may be that subjects actually prefer the generated facial displaystothedisplaysinthecorpus, aswasfound by Belz and Reiter (2006).

When Belz and Reiter (2006) performed a similar study comparing natural-language generation systems that used different text-planning strategies, they also found similar results: automated measures tended to favour majority-choice strategies,whilehumanjudgespreferredthosethat made weighted choices.

For the REA agent (Cassell et al., 2001a), for example, gesturing behaviour was selected to perform particular communicative functions, using rules based on studies of typical North American non-verbal displays.
