Work The closest related work to the task of biographic fact extraction was done by Cowie et al.(2000) and Schiffman et al.(2001), who explore the problem of biographic summarization.

For the special case of Rote extractors, a more attractive alternative has been proposed by Brin (1998), Agichtein and Gravano (2000), and Ravichandran and Hovy (2002).

More distantly related work for multi-field extraction suggests methods for combining information in graphical models across multiple extraction instances (Sutton et al., 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2004) . 7 Conclusion This paper has presented new experimental methodologies and results for cross-document information fusion, focusing on the task of biographic fact extraction and has proposed a new method for crossfield bootstrapping.

The initial work in the field used lexico-syntactic template patterns learned using a variety of different empirical approaches (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998; Huffman, 1995; 489 Soderland et al., 1995).

Prager et al.(2004) uses knowledge of birth year to weed out candidate years of death that are impossible.

Notable systems are SUMMONS (Radev and McKeown, 1998) and RIPTIDE (White et al., 2001), which assume perfect extracted information and then perform closed domain summarization.
H01-1054 J98-3005
Barzilay et al.(1999) does not explicitly extract facts, but instead picks out relevant repeated elements and combines them to obtain a summary which retains the semantics of the original.
