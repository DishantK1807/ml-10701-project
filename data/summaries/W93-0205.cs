We believe that this idea of stratified levels is applicable not only to syntactic aspects of rhetoric, but to lexical and semantic aspects as well, and have begun to apply our approach to studying \]tow lexical choices realize particular intentional goals (DiMarco, Hirst, and Sl,c(lc 1993).

In Makuta-(~iluk (1991) and Makuta-(iHluk and DiMarco (1993), we pointed out that a stylistic goal can be used to realize more than one rhetorical goal, and a rhetorical goal can be achieved in several different ways.

level of rhetorical goals Ill Makuta-(~iluk (1991) and Makuta-Giluk and DiMarco (1993), we describe the development of a rhetorical grammar that is built upon our stylistic grammar and composes rhetorical goals from combinations of stylistic goals.

Thus, the ways in which intentional relations interact with ideational, or informational, relations (Moore and Pollack 1992) can be accounted for nicely by our model of rhetoric, which integrates the ell~cl,s of lexis, syntax, and semantics on rhetorical strncture within a single cohesive framework.

In DiMarco and Hirst (1993), DiMarco et al (1992), Green (1992), and tloyt (forthcoming), we describe the construction of a syntactic stylistic grammar that relates stylistic goals to abstract stylistic properties, and then relates these abstract properties to low-level syntax.

A Goal-Based Grammar of Rhetoric Chrysanne DiMarco, Graeme Hirst, and Marzena Makuta-Giluk * University of Waterloo and University of Toronto May 28, 1993 1 An advocacy of rhetoric In many applications in computational linguistics, such as machine translation, we want to understand why a writer has used language in a particular way, what specific effects she intended to convey, and which linguistic choices were made to achieve those goals.
