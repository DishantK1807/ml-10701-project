But, the number of permutations examined can be reduced by using heuristic forward pruning or by constraining the permutations to be within a local window of adjustable size (also see (Kanthak et al., 2005)).

Most of the previous work on statistical machine translation, as exemplified in (Brown et al., 1993), employs word–alignment algorithm (such as GIZA++ (Och et al., 1999)) that provides local associations between source words and target words.

The probability distributions of these binary classifiers are learnt using maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996; Haffner, 2006).

A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntax–based) transduction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al., 2005).
