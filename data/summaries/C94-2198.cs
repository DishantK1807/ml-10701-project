1. INTRODUCTION Class-based language models (Brown et al., 1992)have been proposed for dealing with two problems confronted by the well-known word n-gram language models (1) data sparseness: the amount of training data is insufficient for estimating the huge number of parameters; and (2) domain robustness: the model is not adaptable to new application domains.

For a class bigram model, find ¢ : V --+ C to maximize ~(T) = ~I/L=I p(wi I¢(wl))p(¢(wi)l¢(wi-1)))) Alternatively, perplexity (Jardino an d Adda, 1993) or average mutual information (Brown et al., 1992) can be used as the characteristic value for optimization.
