This allows us to compute the conditional probability as follows (Berger et al., 1996): ag~ (h .f) P(/Ih)1L ' (2) Z (h) ct i . (3) Y i The maximum entropy estimation technique guarantees that for every feature gi, the expected value of gi according to the M.E. model will equal the empirical expectation of gi in the training corpus.
