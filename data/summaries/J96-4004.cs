We have applied our model to the task of capturing the effect of context on the perception of ambiguous word boundaries in Chinese sentences (Gan 1993).

Statistical techniques include the relaxation approach (Fan and Tsai 1988; Chang, Chen, and Chen 1991; Chiang et al.1992), the mutual information approach (Sproat and Shih 1990; Wu and Su 1993; Lua and Gan 1994), and the Markov model (Lai et al.1992). These approaches make use of co-occurrence frequencies of characters in a large corpus of written texts to achieve word segmentation without getting into deep syntactic and semantic analysis.

Our approach differs from existing work on Chinese word segmentation (Liang 1983; Wang, Wang, and Bai 1991; Fan and Tsai 1988; Chang, Chen, and Chen 1991; Chiang et al.1992; Sproat and Shih 1990; Wu and Su 1993; Lua and Gan 1994; Lai et al.1992; Sproat et al.1994; Sproat et al.1996) primarily in that our system performs sentence interpretation, in addition to word boundary identification.

However, many of the rules in existing rule-based systems (Huang 1989; Yao, Zheng, and Wu 1990; Yeh and Lee 1991; He, Xu, and Sun 1991; Chen and Liu 1992) are either arbitrary and word-specific, or overly general.

A detailed trace of the system's execution on this sentence can be found in Gan (1994), and a short description of the program's behavior can be found in Gan (1993).
