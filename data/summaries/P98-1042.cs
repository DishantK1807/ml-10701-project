(Collier et al., 1998a),(Collier et al., 1998b), for aligning texts in non-cognate languages at the article level.
P98-1041
Previous studies such as (Fung and Wu, 1994) have commented 268 that methods developed for Indo-European language pairs using alphabetic characters have not addressed important issues which occur with European-Asian language pairs.
P94-1012
(Wu, 1994), about whether the bytelength model by itself can perform well.

Wu. 1994.
P94-1012
It has also been suggested by (Wu, 1994) that sentence length ratio correlations may arise partly out of historic cognate-based relationships between Indo-European languages.

Church. 1993.
P93-1001
We were motivated by statistical alignment models such as (Gale and Church, 1991) to investigate whether byte-length probabilities could improve or replace the lexical matching based method.
P91-1023
Various methods have been developed for sentence alignment which we can categorise as either lexical such as (Chen, 1993), based on a large-scale bilingual lexicon; statistical such as (Brown et al., 1991) (Church, 1993)(Gale and Church, 1903)(Kay and RSsheheisen, 1993), based on distributional regularities of words or byte-length ratios and possibly inducing a bilingual lexicon as a by-product, or hybrid such as (Utsuro et al., 1994) (Wu, 1994), based on some combination of the other two.
