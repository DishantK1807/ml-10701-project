A novel approach was described in (Marcu and Echihabi, 2002), which used an unsupervised training technique, extracting relations that were explicitly and unamibiguously signalled and automatically labelling those examples as the training set.

The following experiments used manual meeting transcripts and relied on manual dialogue act segmentation (Shriberg et al., 2004).

Research Early work on automatic RST analysis relied heavily on discourse cues to identify relations (CorstonOliver, 1998; Knott and Sanders, 1998; Marcu, 1997; Marcu, 1999; Marcu, 2000) (e.g., “however” signaling an antithesis or contrast relation.

Theories such as RST have been popular for some time as a way of describing the multi-levelled rhetorical relations that exist in text, with relevant applications such as automatic summarization (Marcu, 1997) and natural language generation (Knott and Dale, 1996).

Finally, sometimes more than one relation can hold between two given units (Moore and Pollack, 1992).
