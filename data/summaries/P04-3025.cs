In the past, work has been done in the area of characterizing words and phrases according to their emotive tone (Turney and Littman, 2003; Turney, 2002; Kamps et al., 2002; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 2002; Wiebe, 2000), but in many domains of text, the values of individual phrases may bear little relation to the overall sentiment expressed by the text.
P02-1053
In the present work, the approach taken by Turney (2002) is used to derive such values for selected phrases in the text.

Pang et al.(2002)’s treatment of the task as analogous to topic-classification underscores the difference between the two tasks.

The SO for a a28a37a36a39a38a41a40a29a42a44a43 is the difference between its PMI with the word “excellent” and its PMI with the word “poor.” The method used to derive these values takes advantage of the possibility of using the World Wide Web as a corpus, similarly to work such as (Keller and Lapata, 2003).

Although such approaches have been employed effectively (Pang et al., 2002), there appears to remain considerable room for improvement.

PMI is defined by Church and Hanks (1989) as follows: a0a2a1a4a3a6a5a8a7a10a9a12a11a13a7a15a14a17a16a19a18a21a20a23a22a25a24 a14a27a26a29a28 a5a8a7a10a9a19a30a31a7a15a14a17a16 a28 a5a8a7 a9 a16 a28 a5a8a7 a14 a16a33a32 (1) where a28 a5a8a7a10a9a19a30a31a7a15a14a12a16 is the probability that a7a34a9 and a7a35a14 co-occur.
