For example, given that each semantic class exhibits a particular syntactic behaviour, information on the semantic class should improve POStagging for adjective-noun and adjective-participle ambiguities, probably the most difficult distinctions both for humans and computers (Marcus et al., 1993; Brants, 2000).

Within NLP, ensemble classifiers have been applied, for instance, to genus term disambiguation in machinereadable dictionaries (Rigau et al., 1997), using a majority voting scheme upon several heuristics, and to part of speech tagging, by combining the class predictions of different algorithms (van Halteren et 177 Levels Full Ac.

Work by Lapata (2001), contrary to the studies mentioned so far, focused on the meaning of adjective-noun combinations, not on that of adjectives alone.

Moreover, previous experiments on different datasets (Boleda et al., 2004; Boleda et al., 2005) provided some evidence that distributional information outperforms morphological information for our task.

This result is impressive by itself, and also in comparison to similar work such as (Rigau et al., 1997), who achieved a 9% improvement on a similar task.

Our work has focused on a broad classification of the adjectives, similarly to Merlo and Stevenson (2001), who classified transitive English verbs into three semantic classes.

In a recent paper, Yallop et al.(2005) reported experiments on the acquisition of syntactic subcategorisation patterns for English adjectives.

There are a few exceptions to this tradition, such as Pereira et al.(1993), Rooth et al.(1999), Korhonen et al.(2003), who used soft clustering methods for multiple assignment to verb semantic classes.

Work by Hatzivassiloglou and colleagues (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000) used clustering methods to automatically identify adjectival scales from corpora.

Apart from the above research with a classificatory flavour, other lines of research exploited lexical relations among adjectives for Word Sense Disambiguation (Justeson and Katz, 1995; Chao and Dyer, 2000).
