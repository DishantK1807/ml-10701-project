What is required is the addition of another context to the "E-Deletion" rule: or c::c --< +:0 a:0 t:t > ;; A-deletion This rule-clashing is a significant factor that must be taken into consideration when specifying spelling rules (see Black ell a1.(1987) for further discussion).

In earlier versions of this formalism, the linguist had to specify the spelling rules in a low-level notation similar to that for finite state automata, but Koskenniemi (1985) outlined a more perspicuous high level notation, and we have adopted a variant of that, with a compilation technique inspired by the work of Bear(1986).
