Related Work and Conclusions Our work can be seen as an algorithmic realization of suggestions of Church and Patil (Church, 1980; Church and Patil, 1982) on algebraic simplifications of CFGs of regular languages.

grammars not in this class must first be weakened using techniques such as Shieber's restrictor (Shieber, 1985).

IIowever, it is exact for in a variety of interesting cases, including the examples of Church and Patil (Church and Patil, 1982), which illustrate how typical attachment ambiguities arise as structural ambiguities on regular string sets.

For instance, depth cutoffs in the method described by Black (1989) lead to approximating FSAs whose language is neither a subset nor a superset of the language of the given phrase-structure grammar, In contrast, our method will produce an exact FSA for many interesting grammars generating regular languages, such as those arising from systematic attachment ambiguities (Church and Patil, 1982).
