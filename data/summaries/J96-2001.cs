So, in the UdB corpus, lopen occurs 92 times as an infinitive and 43 times as a finite plural, so the MLE 1 Even models of disambiguation that make use of context, such as statistical n-gram taggers, often presume some estimate of lexical priors, in addition to requiring estimates of the transition probabilities of sequences of lexical tags (Church 1988; DeRose 1988; Kupiec 1992), and this again brings up the question of what to do about unseen or low-frequency forms.

Ideally one would like to build models that use contextual information to perform lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky 1992, 1994), but such models must be trained on specialized tagged corpora (either hand-generated or semi-automatically generated) and such training corpora are often not available, at least in the early phases of constructing a particular application.

In working taggers, a common approach is simply to apply a uniform small probability to the various senses of unseen or low-frequency forms: this was done in the tagger discussed in Church (1988), for example.
