Attachment Experimental Results The experiments have been performed using the Wall-Street Journal dataset described in (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994).

The literature is rich with examples of kernels on discrete data structures such as sequences (Lodhi et al., 2002; Leslie et al., 2002; Cortes et al., 2004), trees (Collins and Duffy, 2002; Kashima and Koyanagi, 2002), and annotated graphs (G¨artner, 2003; Smola and Kondor, 2003; Kashima et al., 2003; Horv´ath et al., 2004).

Applications are numerous and diverse and include for example refinement of statistical parsers (Collins and Duffy, 2002), tagging named entities (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), syntactic chunking (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2005), extraction of relations between entities (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004), semantic role labeling (Moschitti, 2004).

In the following we resort to a multiset version of the proximity measure used in (Siolas and d’Alche Buc, 2000), though more refined alternatives are also possible (for example using the conceptual density as in (Basili et al., 2005)).

Additional meanings derived from specific synsets have been attached to the words as described in (Stetina and Nagao, 1997).
W97-0109
Possible cures include extensive use of prior knowledge to guide the choice of relevant parts (Cumby and Roth, 2003; Frasconi et al., 2004), the use of feature selection (Suzuki et al., 2004), and soft matches (Saunders et al., 2002).
