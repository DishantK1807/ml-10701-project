Also, a corpus study of drug lea ets that we conducted (Max, 2003a) showed that documents from the same class of documents could contain a lot of variation, which can hamper the readerâ€™s understanding.

normalization system A MDA grammar can enumerate the wellformed content representations for documents of a given class and associate textual realizations to them (Dymetman et al., 2000).

Our approach to normalize documents has been described in (Max, 2003b).

Figure 1: Architecture of a MDA system creation to systems presenting the user with the evolving text of the document (often called the feedback or control text) in her language, following from the WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Meant) approach (Power and Scott, 1998).2 Anchors (or active zones) in the text of the evolving document allow the user to specify further its semantics by making choices presented to her in her language.

2We have done a review of these systems in (Max, 2003a) in which we have identifled and compared flve families of approaches.

The MDA (Multilingual Document Authoring) system (Dymetman et al., 2000; Brun et al., 2000) follows the WYSIWYM approach, but puts a strong emphasis on the well-formedness of document semantic content.
