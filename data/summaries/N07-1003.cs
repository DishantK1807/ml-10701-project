Following Whittaker and Stenton (1988), we use utterance tags to determine whether an utterance shows initiative: forward functions show initiative while others do not.
P88-1015
Whittaker and Stenton (1988) proposed rules for tracking initiative based on utterance types; for example, statements, proposals, and questions show initiative, while answers and acknowledgements do not.
P88-1015
Walker and Whittaker (1990) found a correlation between initiative switches and discourse segments.
P90-1010
In our future work, we plan to examine initiative conflicts in face-to-face multi-party conversation, such as the ICSI corpus (Shriberg et al., 2004).
