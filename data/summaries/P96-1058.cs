specifies the features to be removed by p, whereas in (Shieber, 1985, 1992) restrictor specifies the features to be retained by restriction which is equivalent to p.
P85-1018
Another approach taken in (Haas, 1989) eliminates the cyclic propagation by replacing the features in the root and leaf terms with new variables.
J89-4001
In order to solve the nontermination problem, Shieber (1985) proposes restrictor, a statically predefined set of features to consider in propagation, and restriction, a filtering function which removes the features not in restrictor from top-down expectation.
P85-1018
A left-corner parsing algorithm with top-down filtering has been reported to show very efficient performance for unification-based systems (Carroll, 1994).
