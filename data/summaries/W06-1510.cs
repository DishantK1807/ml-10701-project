As a sample derivation let us sketch the analysis of quantificational NPs in English from (Kallmeyer, 2005).

This feature passing is technically achieved by articulating the VP spine with the feature MINS (much like the use of the P feature in English for adverbial scope in Kallmeyer and Romero, 2005), and by adding the feature NEXT for passing between NP substitution nodes (since substitution nodes do not have T and B features that allow feature percolations between mothers and daughters).

We take this as further evidence that the distinction between the two kinds of features, advocated in (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2005) is em             VP NP VP∗ NP ǫ              l6 : quant(x, 15, 16 ) l7 : restriction(x) 15 ≥ l7, 17 ≥ 16, 16 ≥ 18  NP  GL bracketleftbig MAXS 17 bracketrightbig B bracketleftbigg MINS 18 NEXT 18 bracketrightbigg     bracketleftbigg VPr bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS l6bracketrightbig bracketrightBigbracketrightbigg Figure 8: Weak quantifiers that have been moved 77 l1 : read( 1, 2 )       VP bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS 5 bracketrightbigbracketrightBig NP1 bracketleftBigg T bracketleftbigg MINS 4 NEXT 5 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBigg NP2 bracketleftBigg T bracketleftbigg MINS l1 NEXT 4 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBigg       vp np1 np2 l4 : every(x, 9, 10 ) l5 : book(x) 9 ≥ l5, 10 ≥ 11 l2 : some(x, 6, 7) l3 : person(x) 6 ≥ l3, 7 ≥ 8 VPr bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS l4bracketrightbig bracketrightBig VPf bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS 11 bracketrightbigbracketrightBig   bracketleftBigg NP bracketleftBigg B bracketleftbigg MINS 8 NEXT l2 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBiggbracketrightBigg bracketleftBigg NP bracketleftBigg B bracketleftbigg MINS 12 NEXT 12 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBiggbracketrightBigg Figure 9: Analysis of dass [jedes Buch]1 irgendeiner t1 liest l1 : read( 1, 2 )       VP bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS 5 bracketrightbigbracketrightBig NP1 bracketleftBigg T bracketleftbigg MINS 4 NEXT 5 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBigg NP2 bracketleftBigg T bracketleftbigg MINS l1 NEXT 4 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBigg       vp np1 np2 l4 : some(x, 9, 10 ) l5 : book(x) 9 ≥ l5, 10 ≥ 11 l2 : every(x, 6, 7 ) l3 : person(x) 6 ≥ l3, 7 ≥ 8bracketleftbigg VPr bracketleftBig B bracketleftbig MINS l4bracketrightbig bracketrightBigbracketrightbigg bracketleftBigg NP bracketleftBigg B bracketleftbigg MINS 8 NEXT l2 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBiggbracketrightBigg bracketleftBigg NP bracketleftBigg B bracketleftbigg MINS 11 NEXT 11 bracketrightbiggbracketrightBiggbracketrightBigg Figure 10: Semantic analysis of dass [irgendein Buch]1 jeder t1 liest pirically justified.

The equations of top and bottom features linked to specific node positions in the elementary trees are parallel to the syntactic unifications in FTAG (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988).

Our analysis can be adopted using V-TAG (Rambow, 1994) or something in the style of SN-MCTAG (Kallmeyer, 2005).

(Kallmeyer and Romero, 2005) model this by defining a scope window delimited by some maximal scope (global feature MAXS and some minimal scope (global feature MINS) for a quantifier.

quantifier scope in LTAG We use the LTAG semantics framework from (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004; Kallmeyer and Romero, 2005).
