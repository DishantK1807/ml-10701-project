The final component assesses the frames encountered by the parser by using the same model as (Brent, 1993), with the error rate set empirically.

Work The automatic extraction of English subcategorization frames has been considered in (Brent, 1991; Brent, 1993), where a procedure is presented that takes untamed text as input and generates a list of verbal subcategorization frames.

Although an error rate of over 15% is not negligible, it is comparable to other PP attachment experiments (Collins and Brooks, 1995).

This statistic is given by -2 log A = 2(log L(p1, kl, hi) Ã·log L(p2, k2, n2)-log L(p, kl, R1)--log L(p, k2, n2)), where log LCo, k, n) = k logp + (n k)log(1 -p), and Pl = ~, P2 = ~, P =,~',~; (For a detailed description of the statistic used, see (Dunning, 1993)).
