The unification algorithm used by the current system is a modification of Tomabechi's (Tomabechi, 1991) "quasi-destructive" unification algorithm.
P91-1041
While an improvement over simple destructive unification, Tomabechi's approach still suffers from what Kogure (Kogure, 1990) calls redundant copying.
C90-2039
A detailed description of the approach can be found in (Kasper et al., 1999).
P99-1052
We have implemented our methods as extensions to a HPSG grammar development environment (Uszkoreit et al., 1994) which employs a sophisticated typed feature formalism (Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1994; Krieger and Sch~ifer, 1995) and an advanced agenda-based bottom-up chart parser (Kiefer and Scherf, 1996).
C94-1072 C94-2144
To be independent from a-certain grammatical theory or implementation, we use restrictors similar to (Shieber, 1985) as a flexible and easyto-use specification to perform this deletion.
