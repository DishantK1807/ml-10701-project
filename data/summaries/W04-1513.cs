However, even after extending this model by allowing cloning operations on subtrees, (Gildea, 2003) found that parallel trees over-constrained the alignment problem, and achieved better results with a tree-to-string model using one input tree than with a tree-to-tree model using two.

with Dependency Grammars 2.1 Dependency Grammars and Statistical MT According to (Fox, 2002), dependency representations have the best phrasal cohesion properties across languages.
W02-1039
The syntax based statistical approaches have been faced with the major problem of pervasive structural divergence between languages, due to both systematic differences between languages (Dorr, 1994) and the vagaries of loose translations in real corpora.

(Alshawi et al., 2000) extended the tree-based approach by representing each production in parallel dependency trees as a finite-state transducer.

(Yamada and Knight, 2001, 2002) model translation as a sequence of operations transforming a syntactic tree in one language into the string of the second language.

For example, Synchronous TAGs, proposed by (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), which were introduced primarily for semantics but were later also proposed for translation.

At the same time, grammar theoreticians have proposed various generative synchronous grammar formalisms for MT, such as Synchronous Context Free Grammars (S-CFG) (Wu, 1997) or Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammars (S-TAG) (Shieber and Schabes, 1990).

In comparison, in (Yamada and Knight, 2002), which was a phrasal structure based statistical MT system for Chinese to English translation, the Bleu score reported for short sentences (less than 14 words) is 0.099 to 0.102.

DIG 5.1 Definition (Wu, 1997) introduced synchronous binary trees and (Shieber, 1990) introduced synchronous tree adjoining grammars, both of which view the translation process as a synchronous derivation process of parallel trees.

Syntax based statistical MT approaches began with (Wu 1997), who introduced a polynomial-time solution for the alignment problem based on synchronous binary trees.

By having the advantage of leveraging large parallel corpora, the statistical MT approach outperforms the traditional transfer based approaches in tasks for which adequate parallel corpora is available (Och, 2003).
