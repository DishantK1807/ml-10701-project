Work for Punctuation Processing Several researchers have provided descriptive treatment of the role of punctuations: Jones (1996b) determined the syntactic function of the punctuation mark.

In addition, many studies also have been done on long sentences segmentation by certain patterns (Kim and Zhang, 2001, Li and Pei, 1990, Palmer and Hearst, 1997).

In English, the average use of comma per sentence is 0.869 (Jones, 1996a) 1 ~1.04(Hill, 1996), and in Chinese it is 1.79 2, which is one and a half to two more times as it is used in English.

Because of these characteristics, Chinese has a rather different set of salient ambiguities from the perspective of statistical parsing (Levy and Manning, 2003).

Jones (1994) successfully shows that grammar with punctuation outperforms one without punctuation.
