Word error rate (WER) (Su et al., 1992) is a measure of the number of edit operations required to transform one sentence into another, defined as: WER(si,ri) = I(si,ri) + D(si,ri) + S(si,ri)|r i| where I(si,ri), D(si,ri) and S(si,ri) are the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions respectively.
