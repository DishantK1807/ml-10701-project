OUR VIEW OF PREFERENCE Preference has been defined in a number of ways, e.g. as a gradual fulfilment of semantic constraints \[Fass andWilks 1983\], as a lexically induced syn~ctic bias \[Ford et al.1982\], as a parsm\[\[ strategy in~pendent of linguistic criteria \[Frazler and Fodor 1978, Pereira 1985\], and as a system based on multiple judgements reflecting the complexity of psychological processes \[Jackendoff 1985\].
