Abstract
In this paper we propose a framework
ofverbsemanticdescription inorderto
organizedifferentgranularityofsimilar-
ity between verbs. Since verb mean-
ings highly depend on their arguments
wepropose averb thesaurus onthe ba-
sis of possible shared meanings with
predicate-argument structure. Motiva-
tionsofthisworkareto(1)construct a
practical lexicon for dealing with alter-
nations, paraphrases and entailment re-
lationsbetweenpredicates, and(2)pro-
videabasicdatabaseforstatisticallearn-
ing system as well as a theoretical lex-
icon study such as Generative Lexicon
and Lexical Conceptual Structure. One
of the characteristics of our description
is that we assume several granularities
ofsemantic classes tocharacterize verb
meanings. Thethesaurusformallowsus
toprovideseveralgranularitiesofshared
meanings;thus,thisgivesusafurtherre-
visionforapplyingmoredetailedanaly-
sesofverbmeanings.
1 Introduction
In natural language processing, to deal with
similarities/differences between verbs is essen-
tialnotonlyforparaphrase butalsotextual en-
tailment and QA system which are expected
to extract more valuable facts from massively
large texts such as the Web. For example, in
the QA system, assuming that the body text
says “Helenther abicycle”, the answer ofthe
question “He gave her a bicycle?” should be
“No”, however the answer of “She rented the
bicycle?” should be “Yes”. Thus construct-
ingdatabaseofverbsimilarities/differences en-
ables us to deal with detailed paraphrase/non-
paraphraserelationsinNLP.
From the view of the current language re-
source, how the shared/different meanings of
“Helent her abicycle” and “Hegave herabi-
cycle” can be described? The shared mean-
ing of lend and give in the above sentences is
that they are categorized to Giving Verbs,as
in Levin’s English Verb Classes and Alterna-
tions(EVCA)(Levin,1993),whilethedifferent
meaning willbethat lend does notimplyown-
ership ofthetheme, i.e., a bicycle. Oneofthe
problematicissueswithdescribingsharedmean-
ingamongverbsisthatsemanticclassessuchas
Giving Verbs should bedependent onthegran-
ularity ofmeanings weassumed. Forexample,
themeaningof lend and give intheabovesen-
tences is not categorized into the same Frame
in FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998). The reason
for this different categorization can be consid-
ered to be that the granularity of the semantic
class of Giving Verbs is larger than that of the
Giving FrameinFrameNet
1
. Fromtheviewof
natural language processing, especially dealing
the with propositional meaning of verbs, all of
the above classes, i.e., the wider class of Giv-
ing Verbs containing lend and give as well as
the narrower class of Giving Frame containing
give and donate, areneeded. Therefore, inthis
work, in order to describe verb meanings with
several granularities of semantic classes, a the-
saurusformisadoptedforourverbdictionary.
Basedonthebackground,thispaperpresents
a thesaurus of predicate-argument structure for
verbs on the basis of a lexical decompo-
sitional framework such as Lexical Concep-
tual Structure (Jackendoff, 1990); thus our

mentsinFrameNetbutwhatweproposeinthispaperisthe

proposed thesaurus can deal with argument
structure level alternations such as causative,
transitive/intransitive, stative. Besides, tak-
ing a thesaurus form enables us to deal with
shared/differenciate meaningofverbswithcon-
sistency, e.g., a verb class node of “lend” and
“rent” can bedescribed inthedetailed layer of
thenode“give”.
We constructed this thesaurus on Japanese
verbsandthecurrentstatusoftheverbthesaurus
isthis: wehaveanalyzed 7,473 verbmeanings
(4,425verbs)andorganizedthesemanticclasses

types. Below, we describe background issues,
basic design issues, what kind of problems re-
main, limitations and perspectives of applica-
tions.
2 ExistingLexicalResources
and
Drawbacks
2.1 Lexical
Resources in English
From the view of previous lexical databases
In English, several well-considered lexical
databases are available, e.g., EVCA, Dorr’s
LCS (Dorr, 1997), FrameNet, WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998), VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005)
and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005). Be-
sides there is the research project (Pustejovsky
andMeyers,2005)tog192ndgeneraldescriptional
framework of predicate argument structure by
mergingseverallexicaldatabasessuchasProp-
Bank,NomBank,TimeBankandPennDiscouse
Treebank.
Our approach corresponds partly to each
lexical database, (i.e., FrameNet’s Frame and
FrameElements correspond to our verb class
and semantic role labels, and the way to orga-
nize verb similarity classes with thesaurus cor-
responds with WordNet’s synset), but is not
exactly the same; namely, there is no lex-
ical database describing several granularities
of semantic classes between verbs with argu-
ments. Ofcourse, sincetheaboveEnglishlex-
ical databases have links with each other, it is
possible toproduce averbdictionary withsev-
eralgranularitiesofsemanticclasseswithargu-
ments.However,thebasiccategoriesofclassify-
ingverbswouldbelittledifferentduetothedif-

2.2 Lexical
Resources inJapanese
In previous studies, several Japanese lexicons
were published: IPAL (IPA, 1986) focuses on
morpho-syntactic classes but IPAL is small
3
.
EDR (Jap, 1995) consists of a large-scale lex-
icon and corpus (See Section 3.4). EDR is
a well-considered and wide coverage dictio-
nary focusing on translation between Japanese
and English, but EDR’s semantic classes were
not designed with linguistically-motivated lex-
ical relations between verbs, e.g., alternations,
causative, transitive, and detransitive relations
betweenverbs. Webelievetheserelationsmust
bekeyfordealingwithparaphraseinNLP.
Recently Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al.,
2006)andJapaneseWordNet(Bondetal.,2008)
are proposed. Japanese FrameNet currently
published only less than 100 verbs
4
. Besides
Japanese WordNet contains 87000 words and
46000 synsets, however, there are three major
difg192culty of dealing with paraphrase relations

As Kipper (Kipper-Schuler, 2005) showed in their
examples mapping between VerbNet and WordNet verb
senses,mostofthemappingsaremany-to-manyrelations;
this indicates that some twoverbs grouped ina same se-
mantic type in VerbNet can be categorized into different
synsets inWordNet. SinceWordNetdoes not have argu-
ment structure nor syntactic information, we cannot pur-
chasewhatisthedifferentfeaturesforbetweenthesynsets.

ofPredicate-Argument
Structure
The proposed thesaurus of predicate-argument
structure can deal with several levels of verb
classesonthebasisofgranularityofdeg192nedverb
meaning. InthethesaurusweincorporateLCS-
based semantic description for each verb class
thatcanprovideseveralargumentstructuresuch
asconstructiongrammar(Goldberg,1995).This
mustbehighadvantagetodescribethedifferent
factorsfromtheviewofnotonlysyntacticfunc-
tionsbutalsointernal semantic relations. Thus
thischaracteristicsoftheproposedthesauruscan
be powerful framework for calculating similar-
ity and difference between verb senses. In the
followingsectionsweexplainthetotaldesignof
thesaurusandthedetails.
3.1 Design
ofThesaurus
Theproposedthesaurusconsistsofhierarchyof
verb classes we assumed. A verb class, which
is a conceptual class, has verbs with a shared
meaning. Aparentverbclassincludesconcepts
of subordinate verb class; thus a subordinate
verbclassisaconcretization oftheparentverb
class. A verb class has a semantic description
thatisakindofsemanticskeletoninspiredfrom
lexical conceptual structure (Jackendoff, 1990;
Kageyama, 1996; Dorr, 1997). Thus a seman-
ticdescriptioninaverbclassdescribescorese-
manticrelationsbetweenargumentsandshadow
argumentsofasharedmeaningoftheverbclass.
Sinceverbcanbepolysemous,eachverbsenseis
designatedwithexamplesentences. Verbsenses
with a shared meaning are assigned to a verb
class. Everyexamplesentence isanalyzed into
their arguments and semantic role types; and
thentheirargumentsarelinkedtovariablesinse-
manticdescription ofverbclass. Thisindicates
thatonesemanticdescriptioninaverbclasscan
provide several argument structure onthebasis
ofsyntacticstructure.Thisarchitectureisrelated
toconstructiongrammar.
Here we explain this structure using verbs
suchas rent, lend, give, hire, borrow, lease.We
assumethateachverbsensewefocusonhereis
designatedbyexamplesentences,e.g.,“Mother
givesabooktoherchild”,“Kazukorentsabicy-
clefromherfriend”,and“Tarolendacartohis
friend”. AsFigure1showsthatalloftheabove

3.2 Construction
of VerbClass Hierarchy
Toorganizehierarchicalsemanticverbclass,we
takeatopdownandabottomupapproaches.As
for a bottom up approach, we use verb senses
deg192nedbyadictionaryasthemostg192ne-grained
meaning; and then we group verbs that can be
consideredtosharesomemeaning.Asforadic-
tionary, we use the Lexeed database (Fujita et
al., 2006), which consists of more than 20,000
verbs with explanations of word sense and ex-
amplesentences.
As a top down approach, we take three se-
manticclasses: State, Change of State,andAc-
tivity as top level semantic classes of the the-
saurus according to Vendler’s aspectual analy-
sis (Vendler, 1967) (See Figure 4). This is be-
cause the above three classes can be useful for
dealingwiththepropositional,especially,resul-
tativeaspectofverbs. Forexample“Hethrewa
ball”canbean Activity andhavenospecialre-
sult;but“Hebrokethedoor”canbeaChange of
Stateandthenwecanimaginearesult,i.e.,bro-
ken door. When other verbsenses can express
thesameresults, e.g., “Hedestroyed thedoor,”
wewouldliketoregardthemashavingthesame
meaning.
Wedeg192neverbclassesinintermediatehierar-
chybygroupingverbsenseonthebasisofaspec-
tualcategory(i.e.,action,state,changeofstate),
argument type (i.e., physical, mental, informa-
tion), and more detailed aspects depending on
aspectualcategory. Forexample,walk the coun-
try, travel all over Europe and get up the stairs
can be considered to be in the Move on Path
class.
Verb class is essential for dealing with verb
meaningsassynsetsinWordNet.Evenifwehad
givenanincorrectclassname,thethesauruswill
workwellifthewholehierarchykeepsis-arela-
tion,namely,thehierarchydoesnotcontainany
multipleinheritance.
The most g192ne-grained verb class before in-
dividual verb sense is a little wider than alter-
nations. Currently, for the g192ne-grained verb
class,weareorganizingwhatkindofdifferenti-
atedclassescanbeassumed(e.g.,manner,back-
ground,presupposition,andetc.).
3.3 SemanticRole
Labels
Theaimofdescribingargumentsofatargetverb
sense is (1) to link the same role arguments in
a related verb sense and (2) to provide disam-
biguated information formappingasurfaceex-
pression to averb sense. TheLexeed database
providesarepresentativesentenceforeachword
sense. Thesentence issimple, without adjunc-
tiveelementssuchasunessential time,location
ormethod.Thus,asentenceisbrokendowninto
subjectandobject, andsemanticrolelabelsare
annotatedtothem(Figure3).

pus show that the coverage of verbs is 84.32%
(1825/2195) in 1000 sentences randomly sam-
pled from Japanese news articles

relations with “or” in logical form. Therefore,
g192nding and describing these verb relations will
beessentialfordealingwithpropositionalmean-
ingsofasentence.
Forfurtherviewofapplication, eventmatch-

is supposed to be a practical and useful appli-
cation. Assumingthatauserisconfrontedwith
thefactthatwirelessLANintheuser’sPCdoes
notwork,andtheuserwantstosearchfordoc-
uments that provide a solution, the problem is
that expressions of situations must be different
fromtheviewsofindividualwriters,e.g.,“wire-
lessLANdidnotwork”or“wirelessLANwas
disconnected”.Howcanweg192ndthesamemean-
ing in these expressions, and how can we ex-
tract the answers by g192nding the same situation
from FAQdocuments? To solve this, a lexical
database describing verb relations between “go
wrong” and “disconnect” must be the base for
estimating how the expressions can be similar.
Therefore,constructingalexiconcanbeworth-
whilefordevelopingNLPapplications.
5Conclusion
Inthispaper,wepresentedaframeworkofaverb

well as to differentiate meaning between verbs
fromtheviewpoint ofrelating eventual expres-
sions of NLP.One of the characteristics is that

Also,weensurefunctionsandlimitationsofse-
