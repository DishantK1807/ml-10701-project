FEATURES As a very simple example we will look at the TUG version of the example grammar in Shieber (1984).

(1988) and Chen (1990), the processing of head movement is based on GPSG like slash features.

trace(rip). The main difference of argument movement to other approaches for the description of discontinuities like extraposition grammars (Pereira 1981) is that argument movement is not restricted to nested rule application.

Further advantages are mentioned in Neumann (1991).
E91-1043
This approach is taken in Shieber (1988).
C88-2128
The grammar describes the relation between a subset of German and a subset of QLF, the intermediate semantic form that is used in the Care Language Engine of SRI Cambridge (Alshawi 1990).
J90-3001
Strzalkowski (1990) and Strzalkowski/Peng (1990) describe a compiler that transforms a grammar originally written for parsing into an efficient generator.
C90-2060 P90-1027
3.2THE GENERATOR GENERATOR For generation with TUG an improved version of the semantic-head-driven generator (SHDG) (see Shieber e.a. 1990) is used.
