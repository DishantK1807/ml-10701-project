Briscoe (2006) provides references and more information about extant use of RASP and fully describes the modifications discussed more briefly here.
P06-2006
A weighted set of GRs from the parse forest is now computed efficiently using a variant of the inside-outside algorithm (Watson et al., 2005).
W05-1517
Briscoe and Carroll (2006) discuss issues raised by this reannotation.
P06-2006
This is done using a first-order (‘bigram’) hidden markov model (HMM) tagger implemented in C (Elworthy, 1994) and trained on the manually-corrected tagged versions of the Susanne, LOB and (subset of) BNC corpora.
A94-1009
Briscoe and Carroll (2006) show that the system has equivalent accuracy to the PARC XLE parser when the morphosyntactic features in the original DepBank gold standard are taken into account.
P06-2006
The criteria are partial parse probability and a preference for longer but non-lexical combinations (Kiefer et al., 1999).
