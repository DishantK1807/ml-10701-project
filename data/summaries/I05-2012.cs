We evaluate results with the alignment error rate (AER) of Och and Ney (Och et al., 2003), which measures agreement at the level of pairs of term constituents.

In order to produce relevant alignment results for n:1 alignment, we need information indicating that more than one 5 While (Och et al., 2003) differentiates sure and possible hand-annotated alignment, our gold-standard comes in only one variety.

Characteristics experimental data (the number of bilingual term pairs) We compare our model with IBM Model 2 (IBM-2), and IBM Model 4 (IBM-4) implemented by GIZA++ (Och et al., 2003).

In this paper, we propose an alignment algorithm between English and Korean conceptual units (or between English and Korean term constituents) in English-Korean technical term pairs based on IBM Model (Brown et al., 1993).

It was initially proposed by (Brown et al., 1993) and, more recently, have been intensively studied by several research groups (Germann et al., 2001; Och et al., 2003).

(Chen et al., 1993; Gale et al., 1993) proposed sentence alignment techniques based on dynamic programming, using sentence length and lexical mapping information.
