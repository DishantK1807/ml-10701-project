We proposed to use low dimensional term vectors for inducing the translation probabilities between terms (Matveeva and Levow, 2006).

On the TOEFL test GLSA achieves the best precision of 0.86, which is much better than our PMI baseline as well as the highest precision of 0.81 reported in (Terra and Clarke, 2003).

We will take advantage of the flexibility provided by our framework and use syntax based measure of similarity in the computation of the verb vectors, following (Lin, 1998).

Our results demonstrate that similarities between GLSA term vectors achieve better results than PMI scores and outperform the related PMI-IR approach (Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003).

GLSA achieves the same maximum precision as in (Terra and Clarke, 2003) for TS1 (0.73) and higher precision on TS2 (0.82 compared to 0.75 in (Terra and Clarke, 2003)).
