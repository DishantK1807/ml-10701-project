Many length-based alignment algorithms have been proposed (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991a).

Recently, many rese~{rchers timber claim that "two languages art more informative than one" (Dagan, 1991).

Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 199l; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and are very complex.
