Subject Areas: feature logic, constraint-based grammars, HPSG 1 Introduction Grammatical formalisms such as HPSG \[Pollard and Sag, 1987\] \[Pollard and Sag, 1992\] and LFG \[Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982\] employ feature descriptions \[Kasper and Rounds, 1986\] \[Smolka, 1992\] as the primary means for stating linguistic theories.

However multi-valued attributes cannot be described within feature logic \[Kasper and Rounds, 1986\] \[Smolka, 1992\].
P86-1038
Furthermore the descriptive machinery employed by both HPSG and LFG is difficult (if not impossible) to state in feature based formalisms such as ALE \[Carpenter, 1993\], TFS \[Zajac, 1992\] and CUF \[D6rre and Dorna, 1993\] which augment feature logic with a type system.

ym6 In this section we show that the attributive logic developed in this paper can be encoded within the SchSnfinkel-Bernays subclass of first-order formulae by extending the approach developed in \[Johnson, 1991\].
