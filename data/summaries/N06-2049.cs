The idea of using the confidence measure has appeared in (Peng and McCallum, 2004), where it was used to recognizetheOOVs.

It was first used in Chinese word segmentation by(XueandShen, 2003), wheremaximumentropymethods were used.

In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.

of the corpora and these scores, refer to (Emerson, 2005).

The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).

Later, this approach was implemented by the CRF-based method (Peng and McCallum, 2004), which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).
