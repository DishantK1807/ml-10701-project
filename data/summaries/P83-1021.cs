These problems do not preclude its use for creating uniquely efficient parsers for suitably constructed grammars (Warren and Pereira, 1983: Pereira, 1982), but the broader questions of the relation between parsing and deduction and of the derivation of online parsing algorithms for unification formalisms require that we look at a more generally applicable class of proof procedures.

It is difficult (especially in the case of pure bottom-up parsing strategies} to augment chart parser~ to handle gaps and dependencies (Thompson, 1981}.
