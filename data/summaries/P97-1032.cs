The method for blending the distributions applies equally well to smoothing the transition probabilities pij, i.e., the tag N-gram probabilities, and both the scheme and its application to these two tasks are described in detail in (Samuelsson 1996), where it was also shown to compare favourably to (deleted) interpolation, see (Jelinek and Mercer 1980), even when the back-off weights of the latter were optimal.

However, Voutilainen and J~rvinen (1995) empirically show that an interjudge agreement virtually of 1()0% is possible, at least with the EngCG tag set if not with the original Brown Corpus tag set.

Recently, new interest in the linguistic approach has been shown e.g. in the work of (Karlsson 1990: Voutilainen et al.1992; Oflazer and Kuru6z 1994: Chanod and Tapanainen 1995: Karlsson et al.(eds). 1995; Voutilainen 1995).

Older versions of EngCG (using about 1,150 constraints) are reported (~butilainen et al.1992; Voutilainen and HeikkiUi 1994; Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1994; Voutilainen 1995) to assign a correct analysis to about 99.7% of all words while each word in the output retains 1.04-1.09 alternative analyses on an average, i.e. some of the ambiguities remait~ unresolved.
