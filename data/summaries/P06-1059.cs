Many of the previous studies of Bio-NER tasks have been based on machine learning techniques including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1997), the dictionary HMM model (Kou et al., 2005) and Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) (Finkel et al., 2004).

In a recent study by Finkel et al., (2005), nonlocal information is encoded using an independence model, and the inference is performed by Gibbs sampling, which enables us to use a stateof-the-art factored model and carry out training efficiently, but inference still incurs a considerable computational cost.

Among these methods, conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) have achieved good results (Kim et al., 2005; Settles, 2004), presumably because they are free from the so-called label bias problem by using a global normalization.

However, other types of nonlocal information have also been shown to be effective (Finkel et al., 2005) and we will examine the effectiveness of other non-local information which can be embedded into label information.

For example, the best F-score in the shared task of Bio-NER in COLING 2004 JNLPBA (Kim et al., 2004) was 72.55% (Zhou and Su, 2004) 1, whereas the best performance at MUC-6, in which systems tried to identify general named entities such as person or organization names, was an accuracy of 95% (Sundheim, 1995).
