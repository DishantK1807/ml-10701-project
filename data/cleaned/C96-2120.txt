Since, additionally, there are tools provided for the maintenance and extension of the test suite database, the TSNLP virtual test suite approach is an essentim innovation leading the way to a new generation of highly-structured reusable test suites.
2 Test
Suite Design and Methodology Based on a survey of existing test suites and an analysis of the diagnostic and evaluation requirements of both NL technology developers and users, TSNLP has developed the methodology for the construction of core test data, that is, test items reflecting central language phenomena and that are applicable to a wide range of applications, including parsers, grammar checkers, and controlled language checkers (Balkan et al.(1996)). The TSNLP methodology is designed to optimize (i) control over' test data, (ii) progressivity, and (iii) systematicity.
These are necessary qualities for an adequate, reusable test suite, which are difficult to find in test corpora.
The methodology also addresses the specific goals of TSNLP to produce multi-purpose, multi-user, and multilingual test suites.
Control over test data What makes test suites valuable in comparison to corpora is that they can focus on specific linguistic phenomena and that each phenomenon can be presented both in isolation and controlled combinations in which as many linguistic parameters as possible are being kept under control.
This is particularly the case when a phenomenon is illustrated by systematic variation over the parameters used to describe this phenomenon, while all other parts of the test items remain constant.
Vocabulary is an aspect of the test data that needs to be controlled.
TSNI,P achieves this by restricting the vocabulary in size as well as in domain.
Categorially and semantically ambiguous words are avoided where possible and only included when ambiguity is explicitly tested for.
Additionally, TSNLP attempts to control the interaction of phenomena by keeping the test items as small as possible.
Therefore, a number of guidelines for this purpose (such as use declarative sentences and avoid modifiers and adjuncts) is provided.
Progressivity Progressivity is the principle of starting h'om simple test items and increasing their complexity.
In TSNLP, this aspect is addressed by requiring that each test item focuses only on a single t)henomenon (or rather subphenomenon or even feature) which distinguishes it from all other test items.
This principle not only ensures systernaticity during the test data (:onstruction but also allows test data users to apply the test data in a progressive order obtained from the special attribute presupposition in the phenomena classification.
Thus, the precise identification of the coverage of a system and of its defteieneies is rendered easier.
Systematicity Systematicity refers to the depth of coverage of a test suite, with respect to both well-formed and ill-formed items.
Systematicity in TSNLP is achieved for well-formed items by the explicit classification of test items according to phenomena and sub-phenomena.
Negative test data permits testing for overgeneration as well as for coverage, ill-formed items are derived from well-formed ones by systematic variation of the parameters through the application of one (or more) of four operations, namely: • REPLACEMENT (e.g.
change of person) (l)h'ench) L' ingdnieur vient.
(lq'ench) *L' ingdnieur viens.
• am)rrION (e.g.
of an object NP) (German) Dcr Managcr arbeitet.
(German) *Dcr Manager arbeitet den Vortrag.
• DELETION (e.g.
of an obligatory complement) (German) Der Mana.qer hiilt den Vortrag.
(German) *Der Manager hiilt.
• PERMUTATION (e.g.
inverting word order ) (English) He saw the boy.
(English) *He the boy saw.
In general, tile systematicity of test data was greatly enhanced through the use of specialpurpose tools in the data construction and validation process (see section 5 below).
Multillnguallty Multilinguality is achieved in the TSNLP test suites by covering the same range of phenomena in English, French and German, and adopting the same classification for these phenomena in the three languages.
Furthermore, the choice of related terminology for the categolial and structural description contributes to I;he comparability and consistency of the test items (see section 4 for details).
Documentation To enhance the usability and extensibility of TSNI,P results, a three-vohnne user guide is under preparation providing clear instructions for the assessment of the methodology, test data, and tools developed.
3 TSNI,P Annotation Schema A detailed annotation schema was designed tbr the test data which does not, presuppose a specific linguistic theory, a particular evaluation situation or application type.
Test data and am~otations in TSNI,P test suites are organized at four distinct representational levels: 712 • (?ore Data The (:()re of the test data c<>nsists of the individual test items together with all ge, neral, categorial and structural inforlnation that is indepenlent of a token phenomenon or application.
Besi<les the actual input string, annota: tions at this level include (i) bookl¢eeI>ing and documentation inR)rmation (sill;her, date, id numl>er), (it) the item format, its length, category and well--formedness eo<le, (iii) the (morpho)syntactic categories and string l)ositions of the lexi<'al and phrasal elements ('onstil;nting the test il;em, and (iv) ~'tIl (mMersl,eeilie(l) representation of its flmctional stru(:tm:e, gn<:oding a dependency or funetor-argument graph rather dmn a t)hrase st;ructure tree allows generalizations over pt>tentially <:ontroversial t>hrase structttre eonfigul'ations ~ilcl, thus, avoids imposing a specifi<: <:onstituent stru<:ture lint still ean be mapi>ed onto one.
• Phenomenon-Related Data Based on a hi= erarchical classification of linguistic (an<l extra= linguistic) phenome+,a (e.g.
verb wdency as a subtype of general complementation), each phenoiuenon ix identitied by a phenomenon id and by its supertype,(s).
\]interaction with other phenomena as well as the l)henom<ma which must be presuplmse<l are also given, in addition, the (syntactic) parameters which are relevant for the phenomenon (e.g.
the munber an<l tyt)e of con> plements in the case of verb valency) are describe<t.
Individual test items can be assigned to one or several phenoluena and annotated ge<:ording to the eorresl)ondii~g parameters.
• Test Sets 'lPest items emt optkmally be groul>ed into test sets.
A tesl, s01, is a group (>f test items containing typically one I)ositive examl)le &lid one or nlore negative examples.
The relation t)etween positive an<l negative Ix;st it;eros has l)een one (>f the most <:hallengiug <luestions in designing test data and, as has l)een men: tioned, is based on the systematic variation of phenomenon=specific paraineters.
• User and Application Parameters Infornm: lion that typically correlates with the use of a I;est suite for difl'erent types of ewtluation and for different apl)li<:ations (e.g.
ratings of fl'e(luency or relewm<'e \['or a particular <\[onlailt) i8 factore<\[ fl'om the remainder of the data into 'user \[:4 application profile.,< As part of the <:ustomization t)ro<:ess users of the TSNI,P \[;est suil;es are eli<:ouraged to extend this part; of the test suite database and a<ld whatever (formal or informal) information is necessary for Ch<',ir Sl>eeific requirements.
In ad<lition to l;he parts of the annotation s(-henta that follow a formal speeifi<;ation, there is room for textual conmmnts at the wn'ious levels to accommodate informatioi~ that (:annot or need not be forlnalized.

I)ata Construction l;<)llowing the TSNI,P test suite guidelines (Estiwfl et al.(1994)) and using the annotation schema sketched above, the eonstru(:tion of test data was based on a classitication of the (synl;ac= tic) phenomena to bc <:overed.
\[,i'om judgements on the linguistic relevance and frequency for dm individual languages, the following list; <)f (:ore pheo,n, omcna for T,qNIA' was compiled: • coinl)lententation; • agreelllenl;; • modification; • <liathesis; • modality, teltse, and asl)ect; • Selltence and clause tyt)es; • word order; ® coordination; • negation; and • extragrammatical (e.g.
parenthetieals and ternporal expressions).
A fin'ther sul)-elassifieation of phenomena is made according to the relevanl ~ynl, actie domains in which a I>henonmnon occurs (e.g.
sentences (S), clauses (C), n<mn 1)hrases (NP) et al.).
Fignre 2 giw;s an overview of the test material awfilable.
For ea<:h of the three languages some 5000 l,esl; items are l)rovided.
Theret.'ore, TSNI,I' has already achieved a substantially broader and deeper <:overage than previous general-purpose test suites (the still very popular Hewlett-Paekard tes~ suite, for instance, has a (;overage of 3000 test items for English only).
In order to enforce consistency of annotations across the three languages, canonical lists of the categories and fimctions used in the <leserit)tion of categorial and de4>endency structure were estal> lished (see Ix'\]mlann et al.(1996)).

5 Test
Suite Technology Because {;he test data construction proper as well as the custornization and application of a generalpurpose test suite to a specific NLP system or domain are laborious, cost-intensive and error-prone tasks, TSNLP put strong emphasis on supplying suitable special-purpose tools to fitcilitate both the development as well as usage of the TSNIA' test data (Oepen et al.(1996a) give an overview).
5.1 Test
Data Construction To ease the tilne-consuming test data construction and to reduce erratic variations in filling in the TSNI,P annotation schema, a graphical test suite construction tool (tsct) was implemented.
The tool instant, iates the annotation schema (see section 3) as a feral-based input mask and provides for (limited) consistency checking of the field values.
Additionally, tsct allows reusing previously constructed and annotated data, as quite often when constructing a series of test; items it can be easier to duplicate and adapt a sintilar item rather than t)roduce annotations froul s(:ratch.
For sorer; of the I;est data a DCG--lmsed test suite generati(m tool (Arnold et al.(1994)) was det)loyed to automatically produce systematically wu'ied (i.e.
both grmnmatical and ungrammatical) test items togeth0r with some part, of the ~mnotations.
5.2 Test
Data Maintenance and Retrieval To implement the TSNI,P virtual test suite ai)preach (see section 1), the test data is mounted (m a relational datal)ase to satisfy the, folh)wing key desiderata: CI,IENT & APPIACATION PROGRAMS VGral}hical "~ I I • " " I Browser E L joe± j DATABASE \[ Library of Interface Functions i KFI~NEL f (SEaVEI~) I Database Inference Engine \[ Figure 3: Sketch of' tile modular tsdbl design: tin; database kernel is separated from client programs through a layer of interface flmctions.
• usability: to facilitate the application of the methodology, technology, and test; data developed in TSNLP to a wide variety of diagnosis and evaluation purposes for ditferent applications by developers or users with varied backgrounds; • suitability: to meet the specific necessities of storing and maintaining natural language t;est data (e.g.
in string 1)recessing) and to provide maximally flexible interfaces; • adaptability and extensibility: to enable and encourage users of the, database to add test data and annotations according to their needs without changes to the underlying data model; and • portability and simplicity: to make the reSUIts of TSNI,P available on several different hardand software plat;forms and easy to use.
To a.ccount for the 1)otentially different requiremeats of NLP developers a.nd users and ill order to provide suitable interfaces to hmnan test suite users as well as to external applicatioi~ programs, a dual database inq)lementation was carried out: (i) while a proprietary implementation (called tsdb 1) allowed the fine-tuning of both the query \]anguage and interfaces, (it) a second version (tsdb2) builds on a commercial database product and, thus, is coml)liant to commol~ industry standards allowing (industrial) users of the TSNLP test; suite to acquire on-site technical SUl)l)ort where necessary.
: The tsdb 1 inll)leanelfl;ation is a small and etlicient relational database engine in ANSI C.
11; was designed with an open and dot:unrented interface layer (see figure 3) that enalfles test suite users to 1)idirectiona.lly link an al)l)lication being tested to t;he database and run automated retrieve, 1)recess, and comi)arc, cycles.

7 15 tile test data as well as tile TSNLP technology were validated.
Building on the C version of the TSNLP database (tsdbl), a bidirectional interface to the application was established allowing the instantiation of a DFKI user & application profile for tile storage of application-specific data (including performance measures and a semantic specification of the expected output).
The seamless coupling between the test suite and the NL system allows running flflly automated retrieve, process, and compare cycles in the continuous progress evaluation of the grammar and software such that after making changes to the system the irnpact on coverage and performance can be determined in an overnight batch,job.
The TSNLP test data and database technology proved to be a highly adequate tool for glass-box diagnostic evaluation; besides, the testing experience provided valuable feedback for both the test suite and the application tested (Dauphin et al.(1995b)). 7 Conclusion and Future Work The TSNLP project has laid tile tbundations for buihting large scale reference data for diagnostic and evaluation imrposes.
The project has produced a substantial set of test items for three different languages, which are based on a systematic and controlled methodology, comprehensively almotated, and embedded in an enviromnent; allowing for easy access and maintenance of the data.
The approach has been successfully tested against commercial and research NLP applications and components.
However, while this work can be seen as an important step in the right direction, we are very well aware of fllture developments which will be essential for a widespread acceptance of the system in a broad user coinmunity.
These developments comprise amongst others further extensions of tile test data (possibly taking into account aspects of morphology and discourse), customization tools, which support the adaptation of the test data to specific domains and applications, as well as tools and methods which relate the isolated test items to corpora in order to determine their frequency and relevance.
While the members of the project will continue this work, outside developers and users of NLP applications are invited to contribute to these resources which can become a reference standard only if they are truly public domain.
Acknowledgements in its initial specification and in the early phase of the project, TSNLP 'was greatly inspired by the conceptional and administrative contributions of Siety Meijer of University of Essex.
Additionally, substantial parts of the implementation work at DFKI and the University of Essex have been carried out by Tom Fettig, Fred Oberhauser, and Martin Rondell.
We especially want to thank Roger Havenith, the TSNLP project otficer at 1)G XIII, for his help throughout the project and tile two external reviewers, Dan Flickinger and John Nerbonne, for their constructive comments and suggestions.
