Previous proposals to cast phonological structure in a typed feature system can be found in Bird and Klein (1994) and Walther (1999).

The merits of applying a type discipline even to untyped feature structures is considered in Wintner and Sarkar (2002) from a general perspective and in Neugebauer (2003b) with special reference to phonological lexica.

In contrast to the approach presented in this section, the work described in (Cahill et al., 2000) is set in an untyped feature system using DATR to define inheritance networks with path-value equations (Evans and Gazdar, 1996).

First, while types may denote sets of segments, we go beyond the idea of sets as arc labels in finite-state automata (Bird and Ellison, 1994; Eisner, 1997; van Noord and Gerdemann, 2001) which says that boolean combinations of finitely-valued features can be stored as a set on just one arc, rather than being multiplied out as a disjunctive collection of arcs.

This choice has no theoretical consequences but is merely a convenience for grammar development (Bird and Ellison, 1994).
J94-1003 J94-3010
Since here the crucial inheritance relationships are induced automatically, we elaborate on work by Walther (1999) where a complex hand-crafted type hierarchy for internal segmental structure is mentioned instead of simple appropriateness declarations (Bird and Klein, 1994).
