Mani et al.(1999) proposed a summarization system based on the “draft and revision.” Jing and McKeown (2000) proposed a system based on “extraction and cut-and-paste generation.” Our abstractors performed the same cut-and-paste operations that Jing and McKeown noted in their work, and we think that our two-step model will be a reasonable starting point for our subsequent research.

We found that the deletion of lead parts did not occur very often in our summary, unlike the case of Jing and McKeown (2000).
