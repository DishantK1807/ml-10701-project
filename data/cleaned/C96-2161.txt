1 Introduction
Thesauruses are among the most useful knowledge resources for natural language processing.
For example, English thesauruses sttch as Roger's Thesaurus and WordNet \[4\] are.
wideJy used for tasks in this area \[,5, 6, a\].
Howew~r, most existing thesauruses are compiled by hand, and eonsequently~ the following three problems occur when they are used For NI,P systems.
First, existing thesauruses have insufficient vocal)ularles~ especially in I~nguages other than English.
In J~pa, n, there are no free thesauruses that can I)e shared by researchers.
Vu rthermore, ge.eral-domain thesauruses do not (:over (lomMn-specifie terms.
Se(:ond~ the human intuition used in constrllcting thesauruses is not explicit.
Most existing thesa.tlrttses are hand-crafted by ol)serving huge amounts of data on the usage of words.
The data a.n(l human judgements used in (;onstructhlg thesauruses would be very useful in NLP systems; unfi)rtunately, howeve h this information is not represente(I in the thesauruses.
'l~hird, the structure of thesauruses is subjec-hive.
The depth and (lensity of nodes it, (tree-llke).
thesauruses directly a:\[l~ct tilt', calculated distances between words.
For example, n(>des fi)r biological words haw=, many levels, while abstract words are classified in relatively shallow lew4s.
However, existing thesauruses only represent unif(lrm relationships between words.
This pa, per describes a way of overcoming the prol)lems, using a, medium-size Japanese thesaurus aim large corpus.
'Yhe main goal of our work is to expand the thesaurus automatically, explicitly including distinguishing features (viewpoints), and to construct a domain-setlsitive thesaurus system.
:Co expand the vocabulary of the thesaurus, it is important to position new words in it automati(:ally.
In this paper, words that are not contained in the thesa.urus but that appeared in the corpus more than once are called unknown words, l '\['he proper positions of the unknown words in the thesaurus are estimated by using woM-to-word relationships extracte(l from a large:sca.le corpus.
This task may be similar to word-sense disambiguation, which deterI|Hlles the correct sellse of a, word from several predefined candidates.
However, in l)ositioning a word whose sense is 1,11knowtl, a suitable position must be selected from thousands of nodes (words) it, the thesaurus, and therefore it is very difficult to position the word with pinpoint accuracy.
Instead~ in this paper~ we give a method for determining the area in which the unknown words belongs.
For example, suppose the word "SENTOUKI" (fighter) 2 is not contained in a thesaurus.
Calculation of the similarity between the word and those in the thesaurus a.sslgns it to tile area \[flying vehicle \[air plane, helicopter\]\].
Viewpoints are features that distinguish a.
node from other nodes in the thesaurus, and are good (:lues for estimating the area to which an unknown wor<l should be assign(d.
The area can be efficiently estimate(/ by extracting viewpoints.
Several systems have used Wor<lNet a.nd statls: tieal infi)rmation from large corpora \[31 5, 6\].
Howeve.r, there are two common problems: noisy cooccurrence of words a,nd data sparseness.
In WordNet, since each node it, the thesaurus is a set of words that haw~ synonym relationships (SynSet)~ wtrious methods for similarity cah'ulatlon using the SynSet classes have been proposed.
In this t)aper~ ISAMAP \[8\], a hand-crafted Japanese thesaurus, is used as a (:ore.
To overcome the problems of noise 1Tha.t is, unknown words do not lne~\[\[ very |ow-frequency words.
~A Jttpa.nese word in ISAMAP is represented by a pair of capital Rom~tn letters and the word's English tr~mslatlon.

'\['hough Stl(:h features are implicitly used in the creation of most existing thesauruses according to hilRiaJi in-tuition, they axe lost wheii the constructe(l t\]~le-sara'uses are used.
An exception is the Wor(1Net~ in which the distinguishing \[ea.tures a.re nlP~nually listed.
In tliis l)aper~ the distinguishing fea.tllres aa'e extracted automaticMly, reflecting the characteristics of the corpus to be used.
For example, Figure,5 shows a f)a.rt of ISAMAP.
The viewpoint of a.
node in the the.sa.urus is estimated by using a certa.in l)rocedure.
Suppose we want to extract the viewpoint o\[' the noun "HF, IIKOPUTAA" (helicopter).
Tile wor(t occurs 131 1.iines in our corpus.
Figure 3.2 shows exa.mples of the rela_ tlonshil)s.
For each rela.tionship~ a sea.tell is nlade h)r nodes that have the sa.me relationship.
In tile c~se of the pattern "TUKAU" (use), 385 nodes with the s~mm relationship ~tre extra.cted Ijrom a.reas, scattered throughout ISAMAP.
On the other ha.nd~ the pattern "TOBU" (fly) shares only two nodes, h.elicopter aaid aiwlaue.
The nodes have direct ISA relationships; in other words, the nodes are c.an be connected in the hierareDy of nodes.
Since the viewpoints of a node are inherited by its children in many cases, the existence of the connected nodes that include ISA relationships is strong evidence for the viewpoints.
In this case., (fly, SUB) is a viewpoint for the node "airpla'n% " which is the topmost of the connected nodes.
Viewpoints are extracted by calculating th.c typicMness of word-to-wo,¥t relationsh@s.
Given a node nd a'nd its candidate viewpoi.n.t (a pair of a relation marker rel and a wo,d w), the typicalness of the viewpoint is calculated as typicalness(nd, tel, w) _ ( E<~ o..( ....
~,'~) EE.,, o<,( .......
~,<:) "°:' t o.(.,..,,-,' ' where N is a set of no&s i'n \]b'AMAP, and C is a set of conuected no&s that contain the: word w.
Examples o i the vie'tvpoi,nts (whose typicalness exceeds 0.5). are as follows: I flying vehicle land vehicle water vehicle / / iic(~ket balloon /% a ear train coach s I air plane helicopter cargo ship patrol boat Fig.

Suppose the word "SEN'I'OUKI" (fighter a) is to be placed in the thesaurus.
First;, for each node in the 1SAMAP, the slmil~rity between the word and the node is cMculated.
The similarity is ca.lculated according to the rollowing formula.: st're(w1, w~ ) = rnax(simi, sire2) (o,.(w,,,., v) o,,(w~,,_',_s,) '~ st.,,,, -_ E,, +,,~p o,,(_, ",v) ) (o,~(v_~, y, 2':) + o,,0,,,,, y~) \] W si71~ 2 ~',.

If the simib~rity va.lue exceeds a pre-delined threshold, the node is marked.

In co-occurrence based similarity calcula.tion, words with strong similarities but whose relatioashit)s seem st;r~nge to huma.n intuitioa reduce the a.ceuracy of the proposed method.
Howew~r, ill trla, lly cases~ these strong similarities are caused by less typica.l co-occurrences.
In Figure 6, the words "buy, .... tmr chase," aim "h~ve" convey less informa.tiw, relation ships than viewpoint relationships.
If ttmre are many role.lion,ships \[br an unkuown word, the possibility of the existence of viewpoints will increase.
However, some relationships ma.y be noisy.
Figure 9 shows the relationships between the mtmber of relationships a.nd the ~ccuraey of positioning.
In this case, the a.cctlra.cy mea.ns the percenta,ge of words tot which the most preh~ra.lde area estimated hy the proposed method contained the node theft the word really belonged to.
As shown in Figure 9, 50-100 relationshil~s are needed to est.im~te the nodes.
On the other }ran(l, too ma, ny relationships prevent the ext.raction of useful view points.
It is very di\[\[ictdt 1.o position a, word with pin point accuracy.
Experiment showed lhat the fol lowing heuristic is usefll\], If all ullkltoWIl word lies conjunctive relationships with a node (word) in a, pa,rtieular area.
it can be positioned a.s a sibling I%)r examph', the following f/l.ctions are needed fi)r a corpus based thesa, tlrtls system: 'positiou(w): ret;,rns the position (or pa.th) of the word w.
supcvordi,~al, e(@: returns the superordinate words of the word w.
subovdinale(w): returns the subordinate words of tim word w.
simihrr(,~): returns the words similar to w.
dista'nc~-(wJ, w~): returns the distance between wl and w2.
It is important that the return vMues of the %nctions should be depend on the corpus and the locM context of words, s q'he proposed method can t)e used to reMize these functions.
Viewpoints make it po.ssible to realize ;t, dynamic interpretation of disLance.
