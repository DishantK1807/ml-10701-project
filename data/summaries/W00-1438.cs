Currently, segmentation is accomplished prior to using our algorithm by executing Hearst's text tiler (Hearst, 1994).

..... WWhile.,usable currenlfly, the-system provides a platform for generation research on automatic text summarization by providing an intermediate representation which has been shown to capture important concepts from the source text (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997).

First introduced by Morris and Hirst (1991), lexical chains represent lexical cohesion among related terms within a corpus.

In their research, Barzilay and Elhadad showed that lexieal chains could be an effective tool for automatic text summarization (Barzilay and EIhadad, 1997).

Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) dealt with some of tile limitations in Hirst and St-Onge's algorithm by examining every possible lexical chain which could be computed, not just those possible at a given point in the text.

with Previous Work As mentioned above, this research is based on the work of Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) on lexical chains.
