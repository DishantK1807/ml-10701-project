Sequence Classification Similar to English text chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995; Wu et al., 2006a), the word sequence classification model aims to classify each word via encoding its context features.

Among them, the machine learning-based techniques showed excellent performance in many research studies (Peng et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2004).

In this paper, we used the similar IOB2 representation style (Wu et al., 2006a) to express the Chinese word structures.

Machine learning-based word segmentation method is quite similar to the word sequence inference techniques, such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, phrase chunking (Wu et al., 2006a) and named entity recognition (Wu et al., 2006b).

Unlike previous researches (Zhou et al., 2005; Shi, 2005), we argue that without using the word segmentation information, Chinese named entity recognition task can also be viewed as a variant word segmentation technique.
