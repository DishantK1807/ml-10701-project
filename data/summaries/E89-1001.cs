They were proved to be -1parsable in polynomial time (worst case) by Vijay Shanker and Joshi 1985 and an Earley-type parser was presented by Schabes and Joshi 1988.

Since TAGs factor recursion from dependencies, discontinuities are captured straightforwardly without special devices (as opposed to Johnson 1985 or Bunt et al.1987). We distinguish two kinds of discontinuities: discontinuities that come from internal structures and discontinuities that come from the insertion of modifiers.

A lexicalized version of the formalism was presented in Schabes, Abeill~ and Joshi 1988 that makes them attractive for writing computational grammars.

Therefore parsing flexible idioms is reduced to the general parsing of TAGs (Schabes and Joshi 1988).
