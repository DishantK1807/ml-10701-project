The use of the web as a corpus for teaching and research on language has been proposed a number of times (Kilgarriff, 2001; Robb, 2003; Rundell, 2000; Fletcher, 2001, 2004b) and received a special issue of the journal Computational Linguistics (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).

Prototypes of Internet search engines for linguists, corpus linguists and lexicographers have been proposed: WebCorp (Kehoe and Renouf, 2002), KWiCFinder (Fletcher, 2004a) and the Linguist’s Search Engine (Kilgarriff, 2003; Resnik and Elkiss, 2003).

In corpus linguistics building such megacorpora is beyond the scope of individual researchers, and they are not easily accessible (Kennedy, 1998: 56) unless the web is used as a corpus (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).

Curran (2003) 9 http://pie.usna.edu/ suggested distributed processing in terms of web services but only to “allow components developed by different researchers in different locations to be composed to build larger systems” and not for parallel processing.

Clark and Curran’s (2004) work is in parallelising an implementation of log-linear parsing on the Wall Street Journal Corpus, whereas we focus on part-of-speech tagging of a far larger and more varied web corpus, a technique more widely considered a prerequisite for corpus linguistics research.

Increasingly, corpus researchers are tapping the Web to overcome the sparse data problem (Keller et al., 2002).
